>An Invasion will most likely begin with Large Scale Naval, Land and Air Strikes across Eastern Ukraine from prospects including Iskander Missiles, Artillery Barrages, Airstrikes, and other Naval and Ground launched Cruise/Ballistic Missiles.

>From there Russian Forces will most likely push into the Eastern Regions and begin a Full Scale Renewed Invasion of Ukraine, after that there is no clue what path the Russian Military will take whether that is taking the Coastal Regions or heading straight to Kyiv.

70% of Republicans BELIEVE THE LIE. Are we not living on the same planet? This is the same planet where the ""west"" LIED to invade Iraq.

Btw MANY common people don't bother to remember *how* wars start. They always remember the wars themselves and usually the ending....Do you know off the top of your head how the Vietnam war started? What about WWI? What about the Syrian war? Or the Tigray war?

edit: Ok maybe point might have been lost. The point is Putin lying(which he is) to start a war is not a uncommon and the obviousness of it doesn't matter in the long run. Btw the War has already started since 2014. Ukraine has lost 14K ppl so it's silly to act like this is some first time aggression.

At least, not to the degree where it is predicted by western state media.  
War will not turn out in his favor, at all, and he knows that. Last time Russia invaded a sovereign, highly patriotic, state in the middle of a social and economic crisis it imploded the Soviet Union. Putin is - or at least, that's what most people are saying - smart enough to remember that happening. His whole idea is to artifically inflate a crisis to a point where either a) other countries flat-out refuse Ukraine's admission to the NATO (which is what we already see happening) or b) at the very least force Zelensky to uphold his part of the Minsk Agreement, which would include a Federalized Donbass with enough power to basically bar Ukraine from ever joining NATO or Europe. Both of those scenario's are a win-win for Putin.   


Biden, on his part, knows that just as well - so he uses his own state apparatus to force Putin to a point of such desperation where he will be forced to reveal his cards (those being, economical and material support for pro-Donbass rebels) or even invade in a panicked flurry. This would cause a huge crisis for Russia, since most people there, still see Ukraine as brothers - meaning that any armed conflict would just be fratricide, which wouldn't fare well in Russia.   


EDIT: Did any of you bother to read beyond Putin doesn't want war, or are you just monkey see monkey downvote?


There a few caveats to be made here though:   
First off - the analysis of Putin's  actions is predicated on what he did in the past. It is well-known, however, that Putin is extremly volatile and often does not see the consequences of his own actions (something that had barred him from fieldwork in the past), meaning that he could have just as easily actually planned a blitzkrieg to capture Kiev from the get-go.   
Second -  a revolution in Russia as a side-effect of the war in Ukraine is likely, but not a certainty, due to how tired and broken most Russians are in general. However, they were just as broken during the First World War and during Afghanistan and they still managed to rise up, so what gives?  
Third - you do have to realize, this is still not very objective. I, as a Russian living in Europe, have my own stakes in the conflict (or the avoidance thereof) - one of my best friends is serving his time in the army, for fuck's sakes.",1645377165.0,1645376883.0,t3_sx55pn,t3_sx55pn,,0,-14,0,-14,1,0,

The fact that our world leaders would let an invasion happen in the first place is gross.  “Sure, we could help you Ukraine, but I would like to get elected again, so we are just going to let your civilian population be needlessly slaughtered so I can hopefully continue to live a lavish politicians life.”

Fun fact: NATO has enough AirPower to stifle a full scale invasion.  No nukes, no ground combat forces, No “boots on the ground,” just boots in the sky.  It might not be “easy,” but there is no doubt that providing air superiority alone to Ukraine could ruin most invasion plans.

Lemme break it down like a fraction…

1) pinpoint and neutralize s400 sites, s300 sites with precision stealth strikes.  You best believe there is a lot of satellite imaging power being tasked with finding these.

2) f22s / f35s establish air dominance over outmatched air aggressors inside Ukrainian airspace

3) load up the b52s / b1s / b2s / f15s and drop a couple thousand metric shit tons of laser guided bombs on invading armor columns and supply lines

4) Mad af Ukrainian ground forces wreak havoc on scattered and battered invading armies.  Take lots of prisoners

The most notable non-DDoS attack in my recent memory is the SolarWinds Cyberattack, which was a software supply chain attack that is contributed back to Russia. Embedded in one of the updates was a trojan horse that went out to companies far and wide. We still don't know the full extent of the security breach or if there are still active footholds within systems both public (government) and private (companies).

As for DDoS attacks, the United States and more specifically the technology companies based in the US are very often the targets of very large attacks. Last year in Q3 and Q4 Microsoft mitigated a 3.47 Tbps attack on Azure and then went on to mitigate two more above 2.5 Tbps. 

Whatever happens, I am sure the United States will respond quickly and proportionately. Also, keep in mind there are professionals whose sole job is to be in a constant state of justified panic/paranoia so you don't have to be. If something does happen, start by taking a deep breath and asking if what you are trying to do is critical to the current moment or if you can come back to it once services are restored and/or mitigation efforts are deployed.

If that doesn’t work, the second best scenario is that the target capitulates very quickly and you remove the sanctions and claim victory very quickly. After that, sanctions become horrible horrible things that are hard to stop. Sanctions, in order to work, target entire populace including all non-combatants. With the advent of nationalism, sanctions actually often don’t work. In addition to not working, sanctions also often entrench hard-line repressive elements in target nation. Propaganda paints a very convincing story that the enemy is trying to starve your children and family. Targets of sanctions become a victim of their own propaganda and they can’t back down. If they back down, they risk being lynched by their own lieutenants, if they sense weakness. 

Then on the flip side, the party imposing sanctions has a hard time lifting sanctions unless it’s abundantly clear they “won.” They have their own propaganda justifying why sanctions, which hurt entire populations, are “necessary.” Meanwhile if they lift some of the sanctions early they are often accused with capitulating to the evil/horrible person/government.

Now with Putin, we have the threat of sanctions operating. We haven’t yet imposed sanctions, and Putin hasn’t yet fully invaded. There is more freedom to negotiate and to not escalate war. Once sanctions are imposed, Putin needs a justification that both allows him to stay in power and also serves to blunt the impact of sanctions. That may push him into war. What sanctions won’t do, is convince Putin to start being Mr Nice guy.",False,1645381604.0,t3_sx55pn,t1_hxq41k2,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In which case to answer your question:

California is the home of a nuclear early-warning system so would likely be hit first by a submarine, using a non-parabolic trajectory to destroy it within minutes. Very shortly after you'd have high-altitude nukes detonate to create EMPs across most of the mainland, knocking out unprotected electronic and comms systems.  This would be followed by an attrition of nukes on areas of government and military with the aim of taking out as much command & control plus second-strike capability. Lastly you'd see strategic attacks on areas of population, such as NYC and each major city.

So TL;DR Cali -> DC -> NYC in that order",False,1645391593.0,t3_sx55pn,t1_hxqzoxd,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Likely the only area to experience limited nuclear blasts would be Africa and South America. But the impending nuclear winter would kill them shortly enough. 

If there is a bright flash explosion, I suggest you enjoy the show and wait for the nuclear sun to kill you quickly rather than suffering radiation poisoning and starvation.

Muscovy eventually grew out from being a Mongol tributary fief to its own state and out competed its other East Slavic and Baltic neighbors. The area of Ukraine has been contested for centuries since its founding as Kievan Rus due to its various ties at different times to Lithuanian dynasties, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russian dynasties, and whomever the Cossacks felt loyal to at the time (whoever promised them more autonomy essentially). 

Territories in that period of time were much more hereditary and nobility based, so they were more fluid.

NOTAMs are issued (and reported) for a number of reasons, such as:  
  
hazards such as air shows, parachute jumps, kite flying, lasers, rocket launches, etc.  
flights by important people such as heads of state (sometimes referred to as temporary flight restrictions, TFRs)  
closed runways  
inoperable radio navigational aids  
military exercises with resulting airspace restrictions  
inoperable lights on tall obstructions  
temporary erection of obstacles near airfields (e.g., cranes)  
passage of flocks of birds through airspace (a NOTAM in this category is known as a BIRDTAM)  
notifications of runway/taxiway/apron status with respect to snow, ice, and standing water (a SNOWTAM)  
notification of an operationally significant change in volcanic ash or other dust contamination (an ASHTAM)  
software code risk announcements with associated patches to reduce specific vulnerabilities

I think that the Russian plan isn't to take cities directly, but to control space, movement, and access so that they can strangle Ukraine into submission. If the government of Ukraine and their remaining military are contained inside cities where they can't move out without risking destruction, can't easily resupply because land routes are cut off, and can't fly out because of the Russian air superiority, they will be in a very bad strategic position.

At that point Russia can offer to negotiate, and if Ukraine says no, then they'll move west to capture Odessa and the Black Sea coast (though they could also do this in the first phase to really turn the screws on the Ukrainian government right from the outset), and further west from the Dnieper, then pause and offer terms again to a Ukrainian government that would be in an even shittier position since they would be a landlocked country if they don't get Odessa back. If they say no again they'll probably push all the way to the western border and demand that they surrender since there's nothing else they can do.

At the end of the day, all my assumptions are based on the idea that Putin doesn't want to destroy Ukraine's economic capacity and doesn't want to have a long and costly occupation.

Indochina was a French-occupied colony, then temporarily Japanese occupied, for which a nationalist coalition for independence, the Viet Minh, was sprung by Ho Chi Minh during WWII, with American support. At the end of the war, Indochina was partitioned so that the Viet Minh controlled the north, and the French remained in control in the south. However, war soon broke out between the two. Ultimately, the insurgency against the French by the Viet Minh culminated with the famous French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, and a formal partition of Vietnam was again declared with the Viet Minh in control of the North.

Soon after, President Diem was in power of South Vietnam, who was an asshole, and another insurgency against the south was created.

Biden comes across as a weak and feeble old man who can barely articulate a point, let alone actually emphasize a point with the gravitas you'd expect from the leader of the strongest military on the planet. He clearly reads a teleprompter the entire time and none of the words that come out of his mouth come across as his own thoughts. It's depressing to watch... remember Obama and how he spoke? When Obama said some shit everyone was like OH BOY OBAMA JUST LAID SOME SHIT DOWN. We haven't had a president with an actual strong presence since Obama. Hell, people made fun of Bush but even Bush makes Trump and Biden look like absolute clowns in comparison.

 [Russian government involvement theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings#Russian_government_involvement_theory) 
 
 >According to David Satter, Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Boris Kagarlitsky, the bombings were a successful coup d'état coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power. Some of them described the bombings as typical ""active measures"" practised by the KGB in the past. The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, and brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma and Putin to the presidency within a few months.

I know Zelensky and other members of your leadership are saying that the invasion isn’t certain, but they’re trying to keep people calm.  It’s not 100% official yet, but Russia has started their invasion (which takes time, but they are moving troops and readying for airstrikes).

Dnipro is going to be a secondary target, by the look of it.  When the ground forces start to move (after the initial airstrikes and infrastructure hacks—you’ll probably be losing electrical power soon), they will likely march inward from the Donbas, up from Crimea (plus men arriving in boats across the coast), and down from the north. 

They will probably use troops in Belarus to form a “curtain” isolating the western part from Kyiv, and march troops (a very large number) from south of Bryansk into Kyiv.  

The biggest issue for you is the fact that they will likely move into Kyiv and areas to the west of it quickly.  This will make areas to the west harder to move through if/when you try to escape.

If you want to leave—rather than to stay—I don’t think hiding will give you time to get out.  If you hide for a day, they will probably already be closing in on your way out (to the west).  Your best chance of getting out is probably to be moving within 12 hours.  The best route out is probably the most direct route to the border near Rădăuți, Romania.

In short, Crimea gives Russia unimpeded warm water access 24/7, 365 days a year. It also has a large agricultural industry that is vital to Russia. Keeping it operational is a huge part of Russia’s economic and military strategy. It is how Russia will be able to deploy its forces and keep imports/exports moving year round, as opposed to when the ice melts at the rest of their bases.

The problem is Ukraine cut off its water supply from the Dnieper river. Lacking a vital resource like water, Crimea risks withering on the vine. That has major implications for their military and economic strategy.

My guess is Putin wants to annex Eastern Ukraine so they’re not held hostage by Ukrainian dams. A secondary goal is the acquisition of Ukraine’s robust agriculture industry. Both of these goals can be achieved with an invasion preceded by a pretext, which were seeing develop now in the east.

If Putin has made the decision that these benefits outweigh the detriment of sanctions, then logically it would make sense for him to invade under the pretext of “protecting ethnic Russians from Ukrainian genocide.”",False,1645396445.0,t3_sx55pn,t1_hxr5b4x,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

They’ve deployed 75% of all forces to the area around Ukraine, they declared a “NOTAM” over the Sea of Azov (basically saying that it will be a no-fly-zone and very dangerous to be in), and they are moving tanks and artillery over the last 20km of land before the border.  It’s very unlikely that they would have their tracked vehicles (tanks, SPGs) moving on their own tracks—this is only done when they are very close to seeing some action (or simulated, in wargames), because they consume a massive amount of fuel compared to a tank or SPG on a truck trailer.

From what I have heard, they also have assigned assault groups, and the numbers/codes are visible on the sides of vehicles—contrary to what Zelensky said.  

There are articles from [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-us-intelligence-orders/), NBC and Washington Post stating that orders have already been given to invade, and that movements that mirror that have begun.

Also, I'm not sure what you think a successful cyber-attack means.

The only guaranteed defense we have is diplomacy and retaliation, both cyber-retaliation and kinetic.

No doubt, the Russians have already identified a lot of vulnerabilities in the US and could quickly exploit them if given the order from the Russian government and there would be little we could do about it in the short term other than try to track them, give assistance to those affected, and use our military to attack Russia in retaliation and our economic power to sanction them.",False,1645387416.0,t3_sx55pn,t1_hxqq1yn,,6,0,0,0,0,0,

 >A numbers station is a shortwave radio station characterized by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which are believed to be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift keying and frequency-shift keying, as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, other stations appear to have no discernible pattern and broadcast at random times. Stations may or may not have set frequencies in the high frequency band.

All he has done is Tajikistan is stationing troops, and in Syria, well supporting Assad and fighting ISIS is just geopolitics, enhancing his global position, nothing aggressive about it. Same goes for Libya, Central Africa, building ties with Turkey and Iran, and sending peacekeeping troops into Bergkarabach.

Now for the big ones: in Georgia, Saakaschwili attacked the separatists in order to bring their territories back to georgisn authority, thinking the NATO would support him no matter what - they didn't. Only then Putin intervened. And Crimea wasn't invaded, it was occupied and annexed. The troops doing the occupation were already on the isle legally, in the leased port of Sewastopol, and the inhabitants, being mostly russian, accepted the takeover without there being any fighting worth mentioning.

Do not get me wrong, both of those two were reprehensible and unlawful, but they are not signs of military aggression. What he is doing with taking these territories and supporting these separatists is ensuring that Ukraine and Georgia will NEVER join the NATO by any means necessary - he's messing them up.

They won't be able to access a lot of those projects when countries turn against China, even in Africa or Latin-America. They own the projects, not the country itself. And that's pretty relevant, especially in a global war.

All the US would have to do is blockade all those countries from China, which is easy when the US has the largest navy in the world and also the two largest airforces in the world.
