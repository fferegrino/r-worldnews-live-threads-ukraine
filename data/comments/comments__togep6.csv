> 
> Russia’s defense ministry said on Saturday Azeri armed forces had entered a zone that is the responsibility of Russian peacekeepers in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and had set up a surveillance post in violation of an agreement.
> 
> It said Azerbaijan had carried out four drone strikes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow had called on Azerbaijan to pull out its troops, and was “applying efforts” to move forces to their initial positions, it added.
> 
> Azerbaijan’s authorities were not immediately available for comment.
> 
> After a military conflict in September-November 2020, Azerbaijan emerged as the victor, recapturing territory it had lost in an earlier war between 1991 and 1994.
> 
> But many questions remain unresolved, including the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenians who live there.
> 
> Moscow deployed almost 2,000 peacekeepers to the region after the ceasefire, reaffirming its role as policeman and chief power broker in a volatile part of the former Soviet Union where Turkey also wields increasing influence thanks to its close alliance with Azerbaijan.

Ukrainian forces have staged a counter-offensive in areas around Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, local officials said Saturday. 

In a statement on Telegram, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said, ""We are not only defending our positions, but also liberating our temporarily occupied land. Several settlements were liberated, and fighting for our territories is underway in the direction Rohan. Fighting also continues in the Izium direction and Chuhuiv direction.""

CNN could not immediately verify that claim. Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, has come under intense shellfire since Russian forces invaded in late February. 

Syniehubov said the city ""was shelled only 24 times overnight. Which now can be considered a relatively small amount.""

Kostiantyn Nemichev, a far-right Kharkiv politician and member of the nationalist Azov battalion, said ""Yesterday was very productive day, and a few settlements were liberated,"" and posted pictures of what purported to be Russian prisoners of war.

> Just hours after visiting Ukrainian refugees, Biden cites the story of Madeleine K. Albright, a child of Czech refugees who fled from Nazi invaders and Communist oppressors and became secretary of state. She died earlier this week.
> 
> Biden condemns Putin’s claim that he is denazifying Ukraine, noting that Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family were killed in the Holocaust. Biden returns to what has has become the consistent message of his foreign policy: that opposing Russia’s military assault is part of a broader, global battle between democracy and autocracy.
> 
> “Swift and punishing costs is the only thing that will get Russia to change course,” Biden says, referring to economic sanctions. He has been pressed in recent days for saying sanctions were never meant to deter the invasion, but rather to hurt the Russian economy over a longer period to force Putin to stop his military aggression. Last month, Biden’s national security advisor said the sanctions were meant to deter Mr. Putin.
> 
> “Don’t even think about going on one single inch of NATO territory,” Biden says to Russia, raising his voice in his most animated moment of the speech. But he draws a familiar line in the sand, saying that American troops will not go into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member.
> 
> “This war has already been a strategic failure for Russia,” Biden says. “Having lost children myself, I know that’s no solace to people who’ve lost family.”
> 
> “You the Russian people are not our enemy,” Biden says. This certainly is not just a speech to assure NATO allies. Biden has spoken directly to the people of Poland, Ukrainian refugees and now the people of Russia.
> 
> “The days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over -- they must end,” Biden says, calling on European allies to stop relying on Russian energy. The administration has said it will help the allies secure an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas.
> 
> “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden says of Putin — a quote that may be referenced for years to come.

Been awhile since I posted in one of these.

Re: Gen Rezantsev’s death and Kherson.

The Ukrainian gov released audio 3-4 days ago allegedly from a Russian soldier talking to his superior. It made some pretty astounding claims that are difficult to verify through OSINT, but they include:

1. Approximately 50% of the unit suffers from frostbite 

2. The unit was hit by a BM-21 Grad, but they weren’t sure if it was Ukrainian or Russian 

3. They’ve been riding with deceased soldiers for at least 5 days

4. They were bombed by their own Air Force 

There’s other complaints too, but when asked who the commanding officer is, the soldier answers: Gen Rezantsev

You can hear this [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mlqC-c6Cw), at the 1:09 mark. 

The soldier goes on to say he hasn’t seen Rezantsev since the beginning of the conflict and that Rezantsev said the entire conflict would be over ‘within mere hours.’

With [reports emerging](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60807538) yesterday that Rezantsev was indeed in the AOR, I think this may substantiate some of the other claims in the audio clip about the state of Russian mil forces in the Kherson axis more broadly.

(Bloomberg) --President Joe Biden met with Ukraine’s defense and foreign ministers in Warsaw. He’ll later give what’s been billed as a major speech on U.S. and allied efforts to aid Ukraine. 

Russia is relying on “indiscriminate” bombardment after heavy troop casualties in the month after its invasion, the U.K. said. Russia’s military said it’s focusing on taking full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, a signal that the Kremlin may be backing away from more ambitious military gains after a month of fighting. 

The U.S. and European Union unveiled an agreement to help Europe wean itself off Russian fuel imports. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the U.S. and EU of aiming to “destroy” Russia through “hybrid war, a total war.”",False,1648298096.0,t3_togep6,t3_togep6,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

> Putin Doesn’t Realize How Much Warfare Has Changed

> In April 1945, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, under intense pressure from Stalin, sent his tank armies into Berlin without infantry support. Vladimir Putin’s forces not only made the same error; they even copied the way their forebears had attached odd bits of iron—including bed frames—to their tanks’ turrets in the hopes that the added metal would detonate anti-tank weapons prematurely.

> Tanks were a great symbol of strength during the Second World War. That Putin can still see them that way defies belief. The vehicles have proved to be profoundly vulnerable to drones and anti-tank weapons in recent conflicts in Libya and elsewhere; Azerbaijan’s ability to destroy Armenian tanks easily was essential to its 2020 victory in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

> The army even brought a mobile crematorium to Ukraine to dispose of Russian casualties in order to reduce the body-bag count going home. Putin’s Soviet predecessors had a similar disregard for their troops’ feelings. In 1945, the Red Army faced a number of mutinies. Frequently treated with contempt by officers and political departments, soldiers were ordered out at night into no-man’s-land not to retrieve the bodies of fallen comrades, but to strip them of their uniforms for reuse by replacement troops.",False,1648268693.0,t3_togep6,t3_togep6,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

Following Cialdini’s principles, people are much more likely to identify with, and therefore be influenced by Ukraine, whose people are suffering greatly and valiantly resisting attack than with those giving the cold-hearted, cruel orders to invade and destroy.

Putin has incentive to do something so heinous it cuts Russia off from the west to force Oligarchs to depend on Putin since there is no going back. Putin might have floated tactical nukes that Soviet Russia had but there is a catch.

In 2004, Yesin said the Russian small nukes only gets checked by the factory that makes them. This gives the factory a way to scam Russia by saying their expired or broken junk still works.

With how clownish the war effort from Russia has been, if Russia does use a small tactical ""suitcase"" nuke like they've been threatening there is a very good chance its a dud. Putin might opt for these old suitcase nukes because its a tiny explosion enough to take out hard targets like Kyiv's command structure, implies willingness to use larger nukes, and might be small enough for NATO to let slide and force Ukraine to surrender.

Starukh said the convoy included two ambulances carrying three children requiring urgent medical care.

EDIT: let me rephrase - can anyone provide concrete proof, not just opinions, that Russia was recognized as the official successor, like a UN charter statement?

If Putin uses a nuke on Ukraine, the US and NATO would probably be cleared to sanction Russia in every way possible. The US would also likely clear the use of much more sophisticated weapons in Ukraine and carry out conventional strikes against Russian targets there.

If Putin then decided to launch a zillion nukes and kill is all… well there’s not much that can be done about that really. We certainly won’t let him nuke democratic countries and bully the world around because he has this capability. We would be handing him anything he wants from that point forward.

I’m reminded of a quote by Frank Herbert: “The power to destroy a thing imparts absolute control over it”. Which is worrisome because in some ways Putin has this absolute power over the whole planet because of his nuclear capability.

He argues that what keeps Putin particularly worried is that this area of land is part of what’s called the North European Plain, which stretches from France across Belgium, the Netherlands, Northern Germany, Poland and ends at the Russian Urals. As the name suggests, this area is flat and makes the European gateway to Russia vulnerable and difficult to defend.

Any country within the North European Plain could conceivably send an army across the flatlands and directly into Moscow. As Putin knows all too well, this is exactly what has happened to Russia throughout its history.

During both world wars, this is the path the Germans took in their military campaigns. But that’s not all – since 1812, invaders from the Northern European Plain have attacked Russia an average of once every 33 years!

For generations now, Russia’s strategy for neutralizing the threat from the North European Plain has been to control Poland and all the Baltic states that lie between it and Russia, which include Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Belarus.

What the hell is Ukraine’s foreign minister’s problem where a Holocaust memorial is destroyed and the first thing he says is “I expect Israel this and that”. These were Ukranian Jews. All you need to ‘expect’ of others is to condemn it yourself and stop politicising this.

0a6d9c0e7b17d1e211f3aacff7d1b1ce,togep6,i262ezh,"Thought on the possible reasons countries may have remained neutral in some UN votes and other actions—imagine that Russia and Ukraine were to agree to a referendum with a supervised election. Would Russia let NATO countries or Ukraine be the sole supervisor? Likely not. But if a country remained neutral, they could be credible, non-aligned negotiators or mediators, which for some of them may be a more strategically and politically valuable position to be in. 

If, for instance, a nation with a self-narrative that takes pride in their “democratic traditions” since independence like India, China, Israel, or Senegal is able to interject itself into the process of supervising an election, hosting negotiations, or acting as a trusted intermediary. As a settlement is reached, remaining neutral also allows them to align economically with whatever seems like the most likely outcome, minimizing the disruption to to their societies. 

The fact that there is a sudden “retreat” has me thinking that, diplomatically, it might work best to work by letting unaligned nations act as mediators that are allowed to remain impartial. The alternative to mediation would be escalation into increasingly destructive forms of war—possibly nuclear war, which would lead to starvation and death in both directly invested countries (US, Russia, Ukraine, NATO countries) and places that are geographically, historically, and economically disconnected from the actual fighting in the conflict, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, or Nicaragua. 

I feel like there’s just... billions of people that could starve to death because of what will happen without mediated negotiations, and so I hope that somehow neutral mediators can step forward, even if that means allowing actors the IR discourse usually frames as “developing countries” take on a more equal standing on the world stage. 

I think it requires a conscious rejection by parties on all sides of “superpower” status and a willingness to recognize the injustice of allowing wealthy nations to hoard nuclear weapons. Placing all nuclear arsenals under diplomatic supervision, with any public, repeated mention of nuclear war triggers immediate mediation by parties that agree to remain neutral—and there are plenty of countries that are willing to remain neutral.",False,1648279565.0,t3_togep6,t3_togep6,,0,-16,0,-16,0,0,

the very idea of this kind of military operation to secure just the Donbas is just **batshit bonkers insane**. He would have achieved the same victory by *doing nothing at all*. 

he couldn't steal what he already had. he *had* the militias. he had the physical control already. If anything he's now stepping on his own goon's territory with Putin's bigger army, pissing them off too.

In other words, he has probably (as these things inevitably go) created (the seeds of) a counter insurgency in the area where he controlled the insurgency!


> Zelenskyy has already stated any major decisions over territory will go to a national vote (like giving up Donbas to the invaders) After Russia's atrocities and war crimes i think theres zero chance they will willingly give up their lands. It will spark an insurgency more potent and deadly than the world has ever seen before. An angry nation armed to the teeth with western weapons, money, tech, and intelligence will be unleashed on whats left of Russia's occupying forces in Donbas.

Agree. Agree. Agree. Agree. I also don't understand how they are expected to conduct a national vote with maybe 10m externally and another 10m internally displaced.

At times even ahead (see developments of the attack helicopter MI-24 before the US made the Apache) but overall yeah, they lack so many things proper military's need, and their economy doesn't support it either

They lack a proper NCO corp, often called the backbone of an army, NCOs lead soldiers in battle directly, provide them needed support and are massive boost to morale. ""I will never make my soldiers do something that I would not do myself"" is the ethos of the NCO. Russia basically just uses officers

Russian military doctrine heavily focuses around the use of armored warfare to travel quickly over open flat ground that is found in its sphere of influence. Lessons they learned from watching the success of the blitzkrieg in ww2, as well as the understanding that Russian territory is so vast that having a highly mobile force is just necessary. Despite this their tanks are increasingly revealed to be poorly designed death traps that can't meet their operational requirements. Worse so are the IFVs and APCs (BMP, BMDS, and BTRS particularly) that under perform in battle. Especially when the force is so heavily dependent on these vehicles, they lack the robust infantry support needed to defend them, especially in urban environments. Furthermore these vehicles are decades old in designed, even the modern ones lacking in advanced systems to defeat modern missiles. They are gigantic targets for guided and lock on smart weapons, with next to no way to defeat that technology.

Economically they lack the materials and capital needed to maintain, upgrade, train and repair this force. On paper there are thousands and thousands of vehicles Prussia hasn't devoted to this fight, why? are they just choosing to hold back strength for the fun of it? It's unlikely, whats more likely is that nearly 3/4ths of their equipment is deadlined in a motorpool or warehouse somewhere. As I understand it they have no way of domestically producing the microprocessors that new vehicles use, and producing a lot of the spare parts and equipment is also a struggle.

Yes UA desperately needs to relieve pressure around the capital, Chernihiv, Kherson, and they might get to do that.  But Russia consolidating its supply lines is the best thing it can do right now (not that there's any real evidence for that being the plan).  By the time UA can get any additional forces to the Donbas, the area will be fully conscripted and emptied of subversives, and possibly reinforced with extra btgs.  

It also completely shifts the war from one of guerillas fighting occupiers to two armies fighting over what is at this point nobody's territory.  There will be one long front and few surprises, with Russian missile attacks from ships in the Black Sea supplementing.  It'll be Russia's war to lose, even with poorly trained troops, because UA hasn't fought open pitched battles yet.  Not that they'll be bad at it, but they'll start taking far heavier casualties and it is unknown how well they can replace such losses.  Russians can; they just keep kidnapping people.  

I don't know; I think there would have to be significant attrition of their forces before it gets to that point for UA to have any chance to regain those areas.  Hopefully Russia continues trying to hold the other 2-3 fronts and is bled a bit in the process.  And hopefully UA's Donbas line isn't surrounded by these extra movements.

Some people always develop this consciousness of taking up all the guilt of it's nation or even of all of humanity, it is simply not intended for one person to feel that way. Some person see an accident where 1 human died and start to cry, but ignore the thousands who died elsewhere on the same day, we are all a bit hypocritic. It's just how humanity is. Especially if you are smarter you will be exposed to it more as you think about it more and have better access to information. In the great scheme we are all little gears in a big system, but you should take pride in it that you see the world with open eyes, and that you maybe are able to steer that little gear in the right direction at some point in your life if the opportunity reveals itself. So there is hope. 

Revolutions in Russia aren't that unlikely in history, they happened sometimes because of failed wars like this one, don't underestimate the effect it will have on the population if they see how many have died in it. If I were you I would try to finish your study (ye I checked your post history if you are bullshitting sry :P) and then look again how things developed. With that it would be much easier to find a job and longterm visa I guess. You can still bypass EU travel sanctions quite easily, it is not like you are getting stuck right now. Ticket to Istanbul and the world is open again. And no offense to USA, but I think EU is a much better place to immigrate to, especially central/western/north EU, just because of the social systems and healthcare already. (And US becoming kinda crazy too) And even if you fail study, countries like Germany need so many fcking normal skilled worker in the next years, because so many people go into pension, there will be a lot of opportunities for migrants and it is not bad work.

I know another Russian girl and she is kinda the same, I think it happens to many Russians tbh, that they get a bit depressive over the last years even. She distracts herself with video games a lot, to not think about all the fcked up shit in the world.

> **Russia's richest businessman tells Putin: Don't take us back to 1917**

> London (CNN Business)Russia's richest businessman has warned the Kremlin against confiscating assets of companies that have fled in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, saying such a step would set the country back more than 100 years.
> 
> Vladimir Potanin, president of metals giant Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) and its biggest shareholder, said that Russia risked returning to the tumultuous days of the 1917 revolution if it slammed the door on Western companies and investors. He urged the Russian government to proceed with extreme caution regarding the seizure of assets.
> 
> ""Firstly, it would take us back a hundred years, to 1917, and the consequences of such a step — global distrust of Russia on the part of investors — we would experience for many decades,"" he said in a message posted on Norilsk Nickel's Telegram account on Thursday.
> 
> ""Secondly, the decision of many companies to suspend operations in Russia is, I would say, somewhat emotional in nature and may have been taken as a result of unprecedented pressure on them from public opinion abroad. So most likely they will come back. And personally, I would keep such an opportunity for them,"" he added.

ee9bbb12ca21dc489536660d1ffe44a6,togep6,i28dbio,"**ON FINLAND AND NATO (reposted from yesterday)**

This [interview with a Russian-specializing Finnish ex-intelligence agent](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?) has specific information on this subject (re Finland, NATO, the process of joining thereof).

The entire video is worth watching, but [this link (20:57)(closed captioning available)](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?t=1257s) discusses the status of Finland vis-a-vis NATO.

Paraphrasing:

* In [public discourse (the 'tactical truth')](http://world-information.org/trd/68) Russia considers Finland as officially neutral^[a]
* In private discourse (operational plans), Russia **already** considers Finland as part of NATO.

* In public discourse, Finland considers Finland as independent of NATO and Finland as opposed in principle to Russia since joining the EU in 1995.
* In private discourse, Finland considers itself part of NATO and probably (*wink*) has a **'special relationship' with NATO**^[b] with some security guarantees already in place.

Right after the linked time, he goes on to tell a story about he was indoctrinated in school to reinforce the idea that Finland always stay neutral and he could not publicly state his preference to join NATO but since his retirement he professes this fact.

He also says that in its current state because Russia **already views Finland as a NATO member operationally**, Finland has already assumed nearly **all** the disadvantages of being a NATO member without any of the benefits. So he argues that they should finish (no pun intended) joining the alliance.

[This video (a 1 hour lecture with slides, but worth every bit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw) was my first introduction to this guy Martii Kari which delves into the core cultural differences which are important in understanding the Russian perspective and their system of operating. (closed captioning available)

I also just noticed [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBopkxqR3p8) published today from the same guy.

**tl;dr** Finland is already some percentage of the way to joining NATO through a secret process to avoid exactly the situation Ukraine and Georgia find themselves in: wanting to join but being attacked, in part, to prevent it. The government and intelligence agencies are probably committed to this process, and now that public support is tipping to favor it, it will probably be completed rapidly.

ee9bbb12ca21dc489536660d1ffe44a6,togep6,i27pjdc,"**ON FINLAND AND NATO (reposted from yesterday)**

This [interview with a Russian-specializing Finnish ex-intelligence agent](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?) has specific information on this subject (re Finland, NATO, the process of joining thereof).

The entire video is worth watching, but [this link (20:57)(closed captioning available)](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?t=1257s) discusses the status of Finland vis-a-vis NATO.

Paraphrasing:

* In [public discourse (the 'tactical truth')](http://world-information.org/trd/68) Russia considers Finland as officially neutral^[a]
* In private discourse (operational plans), Russia **already** considers Finland as part of NATO.

* In public discourse, Finland considers Finland as independent of NATO and Finland as opposed in principle to Russia since joining the EU in 1995.
* In private discourse, Finland considers itself part of NATO and probably (*wink*) has a **'special relationship' with NATO**^[b] with some security guarantees already in place.

Right after the linked time, he goes on to tell a story about he was indoctrinated in school to reinforce the idea that Finland always stay neutral and he could not publicly state his preference to join NATO but since his retirement he professes this fact.

He also says that in its current state because Russia **already views Finland as a NATO member operationally**, Finland has already assumed nearly **all** the disadvantages of being a NATO member without any of the benefits. So he argues that they should finish (no pun intended) joining the alliance.

[This video (a 1 hour lecture with slides, but worth every bit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw) was my first introduction to this guy Martii Kari which delves into the core cultural differences which are important in understanding the Russian perspective and their system of operating. (closed captioning available)

I also just noticed [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBopkxqR3p8) published today from the same guy.

**tl;dr** Finland is already some percentage of the way to joining NATO through a secret process to avoid exactly the situation Ukraine and Georgia find themselves in: wanting to join but being attacked, in part, to prevent it. The government and intelligence agencies are probably committed to this process, and now that public support is tipping to favor it, it will probably be completed rapidly.

Russia is certainly using lots of missiles and amunition and loosing equipment. But that stuff was paid for before the war. At some point Russia will run out of amunition and usable equipment, but it's not like they can buy that stuff somewhere and need foreign money to do so. They produce it inside Russia. Again, they can print money for that if needed or even pay their people in gold, which Russia has considerable amounts of.

So the actual daily cost of that war is negligible. Russia doesn't need foreign money to keep the war going for quite some time. Even if all payments to Russia were stopped, the war would continue.

""Conservative"" isn't a philosophy, it's a stance. The way we run our country/religion/club/etc now is the way it should stay. We stay where/as we are. It's the default or neutral position. Even very 'liberal' people can be extremely conservative when someone someone starts trying to bring My Little Pony into their anime club. *It's not anime. It may be fine, I don't have a problem with bronies, but not in this club. We can let them use our projectors, but they have to do it on a different night.*

""Progressive"" is another stance. It's the position of, 'what we have isn't working or could be better, let's change away from where we are.' *We may have started as an anime club, but we should expand beyond that to include all animation. Why artificially limit ourselves to animation from one country? Besides, we watched Avatar and no one had a problem with that.*

""Reactionary"" is the forgotten stance. This is the position of, 'Where we are is not where we are supposed to be. We need to get back to our original purpose/mission/beliefs.' *I did! I had a problem with us watching Avatar. It may be 'anime inspired' but it's not anime. I told you it was mistake and look at where we are now, fighting off the sparkly unicorn hordes. We need to go back to the way this club was when it started. 480 fansubs animes only!*

Many people who think they are conservative, or are called conservative, are in fact in a reactionary stance. 

These stances can be adopted towards anything, nationalism, taxes, religion, market structure, etc. 

So, what does this have to do with your question. Cultural reactionaries are getting confused with free-market conservatives because they currently tend to be in the republican party. They may, or may not, have anything in common with each other. They may find themselves in different parties in the future.

Go look at pro-Russian fascist mobs in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and at the Proud Boys doing a lame imitation a few years later. Go look at the GOP congressional junket to Russia on the 4th of July. And also working from the other side funding random people who can be bought in racial justice and pacifist movements as long as they can be counted on to speak out against stopping Russian aggression.

Think about that, and then go look at how many mainstream conservative think tank, media and elected figures are publishing and appearing regularly on things published by a religious cult that wants more political influence (Falun Gong via Epoch Times, NTD, etc). Exactly the same corrupting influence of money and a message people are primed to hear, replacing anti-internationalism messages with the laziest anti-communism arguments. And again it's Steve Bannon getting the richest of anyone by seeing the easy money first and being smart enough to move onto the next thing before it gets ugly. The difference this time around is that Falun Gong unlike Russia can't pivot to threatening WWIII on its own and is just pretending to want increased conflict with China because it's a good recruiting tool and increases influence in the USA.

I don't know how many folks involved are blind to corruption in where the money comes from... the charitable explanation is that money buys a large blind spot. And, yes, Falun Gong is a cult and Epoch Times has spent the entire pandemic trying to cause as much chaos with medical disinformation as possible, contributing to countless preventable deaths, etc. All because it provides a convenient message for some politicians and money for the people making political content. If you care about China becoming more rather than less democratic and about human rights of people in China now, it's a terrible organization to support. The ""conserving culture"" message is strong there, too.

> Here’s a list of five Ukrainian vodkas available in the West.
> 
> NEMIROFF
> 
> Nemiroff vodkas won six medals at the 2020 Bartender Spirits Awards, including its Rested in Barrel, which won gold. As its name suggests, this vodka matures in oak barrels in Nemyriv, southwest of Kyiv. It has tasting notes of “spiciness, light sweetness, [the] astringency of the oak core, and [a] rich wooden aroma,” according to Nemiroff’s description. Other Nemiroff vodka flavors include honey pepper, burning pear, and bold orange. 
> 
> ZIRKOVA
> 
> Zirkova produces two main spirits, Zirkova One and Zirkova Together. Food for Net rates Zirkova as its third-place favorite Ukrainian vodka, distilled since 1997 in Zolotonosha, downstream from Kyiv on the Dnieper River by about 100 miles. Zirkova One is distilled with the intention of sipping while Zirkova Together is specifically for cocktails and mixology. 
> 
> DIMA’S
> 
> Outside of Ukraine, Dima’s vodka is only available in the UK. The brand won silver at the 2020 International Wine & Spirit Competition and the International Spirits Challenge, stealing the gold at the World Vodka Awards in 2021, where it also won silver simply for its design. World Vodka Awards described the flavor during the competition, “A little peachiness on the nose and hints of nuts, chocolate and caramel on the palate give way to a luxurious mouthfeel. Vivacious and layered.” Dima’s also credits the soil in Ukraine for its “velvety smoothness.”
> 
> KHORTYTSA
> 
> Using oatmeal for a smooth finish, Khortytsa brews its vodka in Zaporizhia, also on the Dnieper River. Go To Liquor Store describes Khortytsa as aromatic with notes of cherry and cinnamon. The Rum Howler rated the vodka a 9 out of 10 for a first impression, with high scores also in sipping, shots, dinner, and cocktails.
> 
> SHEVKOFF
> 
> Though Shevkoff originally began distilling at one of the oldest facilities in Ukraine, the company ultimately moved to Khortytsa island on the Dnieper River just north of the Black Sea, in 2003. In 2014, the New York International Spirits Competition awarded the Shevkoff’s facility Distillery of the Year. Drizly, a national liquor delivery service, described Shevkoff’s tasting profile as “vivid, off-dry tastes of wheat and resin; by midpalate, the taste expands to include bittersweet cocoa and prickly (a plus) cereal spirit. Concludes offering moderately hot tastes on the tongue.”

Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan x2.  We wouldn't have the Chechnya situation, the Bosnian war, the shit in Georgia, or Ukraine.

“Number one is the situation, when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies.

“And the fourth case is when an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.”

Keep in mind that there is an escalation ladder here, and Putin will resort to utilizing more deadly types of non-nuclear weaponry (like FOAB or biological weapons) before resorting to tactical nukes.  

IF Putin decides to double down and stay in this war, I would fully expect this to happen based on the premise that a lot of Russia's issues are self-inflicted, and therefore solvable:

1)  Troop level increases and/or partial mobilization efforts.  Russia's low troop count is mostly responsible for their high casualty rate and low morale as they have insufficient forces to achieve objectives, defend supply lines, and maintain offensives.  Seriously, this is huge.

2)  The logistical supply lines and command/control nightmares will be cleaned up, aided by #1.  We're not talking the distance of Berlin to Stalingrad here, and morale can be improved a lot simply with the aid of a good meal and a clear objective.

3)  Adjustment in tactics.  The Russians are making the very same mistake the Syrian Army made in the early stages of the Syrian Civil War.  That is, the Syrians charged head first into high density areas with their armor, only to be picked off by hidden infantry and anti-tank weaponry.  Sound familiar?  Casualties were very high, but the Syrians learned, and the Russians will, too.  

And don't worry, I'm no pro-Russian stooge.  I'm just a realist.  Russian has a history of laughable initial military performances, only to regroup and come back looking somewhat like a professional military.

In case of a NATO attack on Russia, every Russian will support defending it, even with nukes. In fact, it's the most consistent defense philosophy of Russia for the past 70+ years (most of it as part of the Soviet Union): not allowing the enemy to attack mainland Russia by any cost. It's their greatest fear, and it's the one thing that can guarantee for 100% that they will start shooting nukes.

And there's exactly 0% chance that you destroy enough of their missiles fast enough to avoid a retaliatory strike. They store some in silos, some in nuclear submarines that can stay hidden for months, and some on mobile trucks the location of which you know nothing about. You are guaranteed to miss *at least* several dozens of these (most probably way more), which is translated into several hundreds or thousands of warheads. Even if only 20% of them work and hit their targets, we're talking about no more Europe and US east cost. In addition, there's a high chance of a nuclear winter following, which would kill in the hundreds of millions if not a billion+ in the years to follow.

If you don't do that, you keep a low chance of nuclear blackmail because there's a limit to what you can achieve with that strategy: in the case of Russia the maximum is having Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and maybe Georgia under the Russian sphere of influence. Which the current situation is already half of. Are you willing to risk the literal collapse of the human civilization (the western part for sure) for some theoretical chance to change the regime in Russia and prevent something that is already unlikely?..",False,1648319117.0,t3_togep6,t1_i27vgt2,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

If hostilities were to cease right at this very moment in time, ignoring all economic factors and loss of lives and materiel, I’d say Russia walks away in a better outcome. They get the south coast and land route to crimea, all the coastal resources, keep Crimea. 

This can all change very quickly. A Ukrainian breakthrough in the south through Kherson for example could signal a full pull out of Russian forces on the south coast all the way back to Mariupol to secure the Donbass line.

A successful meetup between two Russian groups pushing down from the north from Kharkiv and up from the south from Mariupol would isolate a huge chunk of forces holding Ukraine controlled Donbass. If they can hold the line with artillery, those units will be destroyed.

so… too early to say right now. But that’s what I think their primary strategic objectives are right now.

The atomic nuclei of radioactive materials were split to create different elements, which releases a large amount of energy, splitting more atoms as a result and producing a destructive explosion.
> 
> In a thermonuclear weapon, often called a hydrogen bomb, the fission process is only the beginning. Modern nuclear weapons, such as the United States’ B83 bombs, use a similar fission process to what is used in atomic bombs. But that initial energy then ignites a fusion reaction in a secondary core of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium. The nuclei of the hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and again a chain reaction results in an explosion—this time a much more powerful one.

This isn't possible with many explosives because they burn faster than they can source oxygen from the air, but thermobarics basically have a double explosion, the first small explosion spreads the main explosive into a fine mist and then it ignites and the mist state means it can burn with enough oxygen to go boom. The reason they're controversial is that the side effect of an explosion that consumes oxygen is that it takes away air, so is both asphyxiating and pressure dropping. The deal is that if you're nearby, the air is sucked from your lungs and if they don't collapse, you suffocate because there's no oxygen. So it is a slower and more painful death than explosive trauma. Realistically though, you'd suffer similarly in an intense petrol fire.

It took them until a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo in 2001 before German troops were deployed outside of their country. That peacekeeping mission came at the same time as the Afghanistan occupation where they sent a detachment of Paras. 

They made a mistake in signing up to buy Russian oil and gas and there was a lot of criticism from inside Germany at the time at what the consequences of Nordstrom One and then Nordstrom Two would be, but Germany has little domestic production of oil and gas and their economy needs insane levels of energy. The mistake was compounded by running down their nuclear power stations - the last three were supposed to shut later this year after NS2 comes on stream, but that project is stalled, possibly permanently. Cheapish energy from Russia it was hoped would breakdown historic barriers of mistrust and give everyone too much to lose from the sort of war we are seeing in Ukraine. 

But Germany has been on the right side of the argument here - they cancelled NS2 and have supported Ukraine diplomatically and militarily. They have upped their defence budget to 2% of GDP and German people have taken in far more refugees than the UK has - they have taken in around 250,000 already plus they've sent arms to Ukraine. The modern German way of doing diplomacy is to quietly build consensus rather than grandstand or try and dominate the public conversation. Just because you aren't hearing much from Germany doesn't mean they aren't getting involved.  

Asking Germany to cease all imports of Russian oil though risks severely damaging their economy, if they did they would be competing for oil from other sources which means our oil and gas would be in sharp demand and that would see our petrol prices shoot even higher.

Note that ""tactical"" and ""strategic"" nukes don't have a very well defined classification, if you nuked a city it would almost certainly be considered ""strategic"" bombing regardless of nuke size. This has more to do with the purpose of the bomb rather than its size.

My armchair general opinions would suggest...

If the attack on NATO is a nuclear missile, Russia practically ceases to exist.  NATO would launch a major strike almost immediately annihilating every military target including all ICBMs Russia didn't get off in time.  Russian boomers with known locations would be destroyed.

If the attack is a conventional sort of thing, the destruction is progressive and starts with whatever is attacking.  Troops?  Tanks?  Annihilated with cruise missiles and air power.  If needed, NATO takes out all relevant Russian air defense in the affected region.

In every way NATO can easily and utterly dominate Russia.  But, of course, as you ratchet up to nuclear, the pain NATO will endure is great.

But overthrow Putin?  Take over Russian government?  Invade surrounding countries and build bases?  Help all these other countries restart their wars with Russia?

None of that... at all.

The big fear for this war is as you say, Russia consolidates around Donbas and mobilises locals who support them and suppress or kidnap those that don't, en masse. I think this is a race against time really. If UA can get in and put the pressure on before the Russian regroup is complete, they have a very definite opening to break through. This is especially true if Russian withdrawal or even sustained effort on other fronts continues. The bad outcome for UA is a regrouped, resupplied, and reinforced invasion force that's had time to dig in in Donbas. That will be harder to shift.

Granted I’m a mix of Finnish, Finnish-Karjalan, and Russian-Karjalan myself, and my dad grew up in Finland, so I might be biased, but on the Karelian social accounts I follow, it’s very very common for Karelians to identify as Karelian first, then as Finnic/Finno-Ugric, but not as Russian. Honestly, I’m one of the few Karelians I know who will even admit to being Russian. Several of my older family members refused to speak Russian after certain events, even though they grew up speaking it. Only fully-ethnic Russians in Karelia will call themselves a Russian without any other qualifier, from what I’ve seen. 

I truly don’t mean this to come across like I hate all Russians. Three of my best friends are from Russia and fully ethnic Russian, and they’re wonderful. It’s just that Russia, as a country, is so in denial of its own history. I grew up in California, and I know America gets flack for our education about history, but I have to say that at least here I have history teachers who ardently tried to teach us about the horrible things Americans have done in the past, so that we learn from these and acknowledge them. In Russia, it really isn’t like that. Maybe a very tepid, canned phrase about Stalin, but no specifics. I’ve had Russians tell me my Finnish and Karelian relatives must have been Nazis to be put in prison camps, which is utterly laughable, because half of my Karelian family is Jewish. History-deniers in Russia love to call people Nazis, and yet somehow also love to persecute my Jewish friends’ families and initiate pogroms. Make it make sense.

Sadly, about Karelia going back to Finland…I would be in support of it, as would a lot of Karelians. Unfortunately, a lot of Finns don’t like the idea. Rural Karelians don’t have the same values in certain ways as finns, even rural Finns. Karelians in the Karelian Republic are often poor and quite traditional. They often don’t have a great education. It would also cost Finland a lot of money to get the infrastructure in Karjala up to speed, and Karelia has been pretty much drained of a lot of its resources. Again, I’d be in support, I think it’s a great deal for Karelians, but most Finns wouldn’t support it, and I can’t really blame them when looking at it from their point of view. It would be an enormous money sink. Unified Karelia is very much a sentimental idea to me, but I agree there are loads of logistical hurdles in the way of making this a reality, even if Putin somehow agreed to it (he never will).",1648290971.0,1648289847.0,t3_togep6,t1_i26dawu,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

From East Prussia and Germany in the north, and Silesia and Slovakia in the south, German units quickly broke through Polish defenses along the border and advanced on Warsaw in a massive encirclement attack.

The name ""Red Forest"" comes from the ginger-brown color of the pine trees after they died following the absorption of high levels of radiation from the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986. In the post-disaster cleanup operations, the Red Forest was bulldozed and buried in ""waste graveyards"". The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world today.

In this situation, also calling Ukraine a ""belligerent"" wouldn't be wholly incorrect but it's not really the appropriate use of the word in common understanding. Even though it's a legally recognized term for a combatant nation, most modern sources would avoid using it in this context as it has the capacity to mislead.

It depends whether you are talking about a mutual war or an invasion.

E.g. coastal countries A and B have a set of islands, C, between them. Both A and B claim them as their own, and both send forces to land on the islands. As an adjective, both are belligerent because they both are aggressors and seeking war. As a noun, both are belligerents because they are engaged in war. There is no issue with using the word belligerent in reference to either country.

In contrast, having won the war against B, A now turns its attention to peaceful, resource rich neighbour D. Unprovoked, A invades D to control its land and resources. As an *adjective*, A is belligerent and D is not. As a noun, both are still belligerents because they are engaged in conflict. However, most people would avoid referring to D as a belligerent because of the implication that it is an aggressor. A word like ""combatant"" or ""participants"" that negates the potential for loaded language would usually be employed instead.

Which meaning was implied by the president of SA calling Russia a ""belligerent"" is hard to ascertain. It's arguably a very clever way of subtly insulting Russia whilst technically staying entirely neutral, and relying on language barriers to downplay the nuance of what may well have been a shadowed criticism of Russia.",False,1648296919.0,t3_togep6,t1_i26ile2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

- elites vs poor who won't be slaves - trying to keep control.
- nationalistic blaming others for your own misfortune and xenophobia
- resource scarcity( this is the big one, first oil, then probably rare minerals, and water-water will be the biggest..
- global warming: see resource scarecity, but also xenophobia as there will be millions of immigrants in every country, climate refugees.
- supply chain break down: see scarcity, and climate change (COVID and pandemics are related), and resource scarcity, and now Russian sanctions.
- poverty and famine: ties back into the rich vs poor, but also resource scarcity, supply chain, sanctions, 60 percent of wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine, but there's a lot of other food products we take for granted. We'll probably figure it out in western countries but poorer nations are gonna really suffer.
- suffering nations will blame the west for their poverty and shitty time leading to more escalations
- autocracies and democracies look to be gearing up to unite against each other, even though there's a shit ton of politicians in democracies that take a shot ton of money from rich autocrats...
- globalization is imploding and we may need to eventually move our entire supply chain out of Asia except Taiwan, s. Korea, Japan, Australia, personally neoliberalism dying is a silver lining IMHO.
- Many natural disasters are coming, climate related.
- Inflation, housing crisis, hospital collapse( lots of dead and retired hospital staff who just burned out from COVID), same thing for teachers and schools, lack of trust in authority, rising crime from poverty, and everything is interconnected and feeds each other...

And on top of that, everyone is jockeying for power grabs in a world that is very uncertain, Putin failed this round, but with an autocrat equivalent of NATO, we could see them being even more emboldened.

The US actually has the logistics to conduct a mobile war and literally decades of experience keeping supply lines open in areas with insurgent activity.

Second, the US trains and uses combined arms all the time. ATGMs are substantially less effective when you can see an ATGM team set up with thermal optics on a drone and have a 500 lb JDAM landing less than 2 minutes later. Funnily enough, JDAMs are actually cheaper than Javelins, and they are produced at 100x the rate of Javelins, and can be dropped by any US combat aircraft.

Ground forces need to shoot, move, and communicate. Basically, the Russians can only shoot, but not move or communicate effectively. Logistics and advanced command and control systems like FBCB2 would give the US the ability to see complete intel in enemy positions instantaneously.

People do not understand what modern hyperwar looks like. If it was the US attacking Ukraine, on the first night the power grid around the country would be cut by Tomahawks that deploy strands of conductive wire and short out transmission lines. This would take weeks/months to repair the damage.  The entire AA network would be gone the first night from Wild Weasal/HARM attacks. Every command and control location that could be identified would be wiped out with JDAMs from B2s. The Ukrainian military would have been left without eyes, ears, or leaders on the first night. 

Strictly on the ground forces side, every invading unit would have tanks, artillery, helicopters, and infantry that are able to communicate enemy positions instantly and firepower would be directed on that location within seconds. Drones would fly ahead of advancing units to locate enemy strongpoints. The US has decades of experience fighting in cities too, and are certainly the best Army in the world at city fighting.

 >On 4 March 2018, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer and double agent for the British intelligence agencies, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, were poisoned in the city of Salisbury, England. According to UK sources and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), they were poisoned by means of a Novichok nerve agent. Both Sergei and Yulia Skripal spent several weeks in hospital in critical condition, before being discharged. A police officer, Nick Bailey, was also taken into intensive care after attending the incident, and was later discharged.

We've been assimilating and absorbing different cultural influences forever. The process is basically:

1. Super wealthy import rare goods from a distant culture as a sign of wealth, in volume, e.g. an Victorian English country estate with a ""Chinese Room"" or a Roman Villa with art brought from the other side of the empire.

2. Marginally less wealthy but still rich pay disproportionately and import one or two ""statement pieces"" in the same vein and manufacture an imitation setting for them domestically.

3. The middle class then want this new trend but can't afford the exclusive imports so turn to copies that would fool the layman in an attempt to boost their own status.

4. The overall design language or feel becomes part of local everyman culture over the next few years.

It is an updated version of the German-Singaporean Armbrust design, and operates on the same principles. The development of this weapon began in 2000 and the MATADOR will eventually replace the German-Singaporean Armbrust Light Anti-tank Weapon, which has been in service since the 1980s.

People in the West assume Russians, or anyone else for that matter, thinks exactly the same as they do but they don't. I see a lot of people who think it's so easy to start a revolution to topple Putin. They don't realise that not all revolutions end well. In fact a lot of Russians will remember the fall of the Soviet Union and how their lives became worse since then. At that point peoples money became worthless and many people where forced to go without food. It's hardly surprising that the older generation would rather that doesn't happen again.  

To make matters worse, removing Putin won't really make much of a difference. The whole system which shaped Putin, and in turn was further shaped by him, will still exist. When Putin dies, likely of old age at this rate, Russia will fall again. Then Putin v.2.0 will take control.  

I think a lot of people in democracies look at Russia and other dictatorships and get fooled by the fake veneer of respectability and openness laid over top of the dictatorship. It doesn't help when Putin and other dictators are treated as equals and business partners by other countries. It gives them an air of legitimacy. This, combined with Putin actively undermining democracies, is so very dangerous! People and politicians have become too complacent and caught up in their own countries problems that they ignored Putin and others like him. Ignoring him has allowed him to work towards accelerating the weakening of our own countries. Putin does this so he can say [Russian Sovereign Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_democracy) is just the same as other countries democracy and if both are equal and equally corrupt then why bother changing? It helps to stop Russians from wanting true democracy and freedom.  

I found these two PBS Frontline interviews with Julia Ioffe really helped me to understand Russia, Putin and this conflict better. The first one is from [The Putin Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1HWNcLDK88) series and the second one is from [Putin's Road to War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNo2FPQDQw).

 >Nuclear Gandhi is an Internet meme and urban legend relating to the 1991 video game Civilization, in which there was reportedly a bug that would eventually force the renowned pacifist leader Mahatma Gandhi to become extremely aggressive and make heavy use of nuclear weapons. The bug was first noted in 2012, two years after the release of Civilization V. In 2020, the series' creator, Sid Meier, contradicted the urban legend, saying there was never a bug like that in the original game.

Gandhi was given the maximum negative number the game could store as his counter of aggression. The problem is that binary can't store a minus sign, so the way computers store numbers, called *twos complement*, means negative numbers are actually stored as very large *positive* numbers and the most significant digit means they're negative.

What that means, practically, is that the maximum negative number is actually one larger than the maximum positive number. So, if an event occurred which made leaders less aggressive, for Gandhi that -1 flipped him from what the computer understood as maximum negative to what it understood as maximum positive.

Obviously, many things could trigger this so the inevitability was that at some point, Gandhi went from impossibly non-aggressive to maximally aggressive, which in civ terms meant instant war against everyone.

But asking them to cease Russian imports with immediate effect would cause Germany to literally shut down.

You cannot just turn off the taps and expect nothing to happen or for the supply to be magically taken up from other sources. Also some of what was imported to Germany was sold on to other European nations - Italy takes Russian oil and gas for example. 

It's easy to say that Germany (and Europe) should immediately cut off all Russian imports but it is harder to do and it would lead to the sort of ripple effects that would hit us in the UK. Just because we only took a small percentage of hydrocarbons from Russia does not mean we are immune from global energy prices.

As for the large city question, that's relevant, but if you're deaf from before you acquire spoken language, the options are:

1. You wind up in a situation where you acquire a full sign language (which isn't as uncommon as you may think - schools for the deaf exist even in poor countries. In developed countries the vast majority of deaf  people are taught a sign language)

2. You stumble through life with an ad hoc sign language you use with those close with you, and use incredibly basic signs with people from outside your circle. 

3. You learn to read to some degree. But that's a big struggle. It's a foreign language that you don't speak. And writing is made to represent spoken language. If you don't have a spoken language, the letters are arbitrary as hell. And if you're in category 2, you don't truly know *any* language, even a sign language, so learning to read would be pretty mind bogglingly difficult.

Why would Putin NOT want Trump in charge? The man tried to remove sanctions on Russian oligarchs and was immediately shot down by the entire House. Trump was blatanly playing on misinformation and denial campaigns, just like how Putin does with his people. Trump said he would back out of NATO. He repeatedly said he wished to be on ""good terms"" with Putin. 

If Trump really DID back out of NATO just like he announced he was going to back out of WHO, then guess who the fuck just lost the world's largest military power on the planet with one of the best Intelligence Agencies out there? Oh, I don't know, maybe most of Europe. Poland. Estonia. Whichever NATO member borders Russia at the moment. 

Putin WANTED Trump in power, because Trump would have said some insane bullshit like allowing Russia to take Finland instead while proclaiming they should disguise their planes as Chinese ones and then attack Russia. His insanity is *on purpose*. It's revolting. It's outrageous. The world is going to waste time babying Trump of ""no sir, you cannot do that"" and then have to argue with him & the rest of the Republicans on Putin's payroll that yes, actually, we SHOULD stop Russia from taking control of a sovereign country, because this isn't the fucking 1940s. 

But of course, Trump was thrown out of office and Putin got sicker and weaker, and COVID-19 spelled a real risk to his health. Ukraine WILL get help, because the American leader isn't a fucking idiot who says stupid bullshit to piss off the political opposition. Putin is attacking Ukraine instead of ""just Donbas"" because he's a dying man who's realizing that if he dies without seizing control of Ukraine, anyone who will be his successor will want to pander to the west to get their riches and yachts back, meaning they will absolutely give Crimea and Donbas back to Ukraine. No - Putin needed Ukraine as a government toppled NOW and that meant he couldn't wait until 2024 to MAYBE get another insane idiot in charge of the USA.

>\[Y\]esterday, Colin Kahl said he believes the **Russians are running out of precision-guided munitions**. Is there sense or a percentage of how many –- they might have left in their stockpile right now?  
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yes, I think we have an assessment, Idrees, but I'm not going to get into the whole numbers here. It's an assessment based on our best information. But I -- I'm not going to get into specifics on the numbers. I would say as I said before, the thing -- **the thing they're running the lowest on are cruise missiles, particularly air-launched cruise missiles. But they still have the majority of their inventory available to them. They still have more than 50 percent. But that air--launched cruise missiles in particular are the thing that they're the lowest on.** So Mr. Kahl -- Dr. Kahl is correct that we do see signs that they are that their precision-guided munitions are -- are beginning to be -- the dwindling stocks are beginning to be a factor. And then we think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing them use more and more dumb bombs, if you will.

The longer he keeps this war going, the more he pushes his country into trouble. More economic sanctions, more isolation, more opportunities for Russia's future development being cut off. Yet he continues on this path.

At the base of his entire mythology about NATO is the idea that the western alliance poses an existential threat to Russia's strategic defense or even sovereignty. This idea is used to justify most of his autocratic excesses: building a huge military, maintaining an enormous propaganda machine abroad, fabricating separatist republics throughout countries on Russia's western borders, cracking down on the free press and any political dissent (everyone who opposes him is a foreign agent or paid by ""the West""). The decision for NATO to not enter in this war is a huge blow to this pillar of legitimacy he has built for his entire domestic or foreign policy.

He does not hope to win militarily in a conflict with NATO. He even said it explicitly. But NATO joining Ukraine against Russia in this war would give him both an honorable out (he loses to a worthy opponent) and a confirmation back home that he has been betting right this whole time. Although Putin retains almost absolute power in Russia, as with all dictators, he relies an a pyramid of power. It's not easy to predict what could shift inside that pyramid when the country is dragged into a more and more dangerous outcome on a justification that proves to be false.

 >The Kazakh Khanate (Kazakh: Қазақ Хандығы, Qazaq Handyğy, قازاق حاندىعى) was a successor of the Golden Horde existing from the 15th to 19th century, centered on the eastern parts of the Desht-i Qipchaq. The khanate was established by Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan around 1465. Both khans came from Turco-Mongol clan of Tore which traces its lineage to Genghis Khan through dynasty of Jochids. The Tore clan continued to rule the khanate until its fall to the Russian Empire.

The saying was, ""You can lie to me, but you can't lie to the engines.""

The real threat isn't coming from the Trump.  Yes, he's a huge bombastic and sometimes caustic ego, but he's no authoritarian.  He had enormous opportunity to acquire a lot of power during the pandemic, but he didn't.  The fact that he worked through market forces to create the vaccine instead of government do-this-do-that reflects a non-authoritarian nature.  He might look like it on the surface, but the fruit of his leadership tells a different story.  

Additionally, people naturally flee from authoritarianism.  It's not in human nature to want to be ruled by someone/something.  Yet, Americans prospered quite handsomely under Trump's leadership.  And yes I'll give credit where credit is due, some of what was started by Obama.

Using another example of examining fruit vs what we're being told by the media:  More liberal leaning media outlets consider Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, to be something akin to an authoritarian mobster.  Yet, half the population of the United States wants to live there.  Let's be real here,  it's not red states that are experiencing population declines.  That should be a red flag, yet most miss that.  This is where, as more of a middle grounder, I point out that it's easy to be told by someone else that you're being told the ""truth"", but it doesn't mean that you are.

You can lie to me, but you can't lie to the engines.

>Zero Hedge publishes a combination of financial news—often presented with a dire, fatalistic bent—and right-leaning political content. It has been ensnared in controversy in the past, facing allegations of publishing conspiratorial and pro-Russia claims.

In Tactical Nuclear Weapons:
>A tactical nuclear weapon (TNW) or non-strategic nuclear weapon[1] is a nuclear weapon which is designed to be used on a battlefield in military situations mostly with friendly forces in proximity and perhaps even on contested friendly territory. Generally smaller in explosive power, they are defined in contrast to strategic nuclear weapons, which are designed mostly to be targeted at the enemy interior away from the war front against military bases, cities, towns, arms industries, and other hardened or larger-area targets to damage the enemy's ability to wage war.  
[...]  
>There is no exact definition of the ""tactical"" category on range or yield of the nuclear weapon.[2][3] The yield of tactical nuclear weapons is generally lower than that of strategic nuclear weapons, but larger ones are still very powerful, and some variable-yield warheads serve in both roles.   
  
In Strategic Nuclear Weapons:
>A strategic nuclear weapon refers to a nuclear weapon that is designed to be used on targets often in settled territory far from the battlefield as part of a strategic plan, such as military bases, military command centers, arms industries, transportation, economic, and energy infrastructure, and heavily populated areas such as cities and towns, which often contain such targets.[1] It is in contrast to a tactical nuclear weapon, which is designed for use in battle as part of an attack with and often near friendly conventional forces, possibly on contested friendly territory.    
  
In Tactical Bombing:  
>Tactical bombing is aerial bombing aimed at targets of immediate military value, such as combatants, military installations, or military equipment. This is in contrast to strategic bombing, or attacking enemy cities and factories to cripple future military production and enemy civilians' will to support the war effort, to debilitate the enemy's long-term capacity to wage war.[1]

Which is a big fucking thing, the core elements of command really dictate how the functioning machine works.  Russias core command has a very specific instruction within their military on conflict, one we've seen time and time again and that's escalate to deescalate.

Some. Some does not mean all. I would assume that the ""some"" means things like birth control and abortion, and I would also assume that it has safeguards in place, like the child is asked questions to make sure they are not being trafficked or abused.
