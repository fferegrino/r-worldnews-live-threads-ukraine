Interesting bit in the ISW report about tensions arising from the volunteer recruitment drive.

>The Kremlin likely directed a media outlet closely affiliated with Moscow to criticize the Governor of St. Petersburg Alexander Beglov for failing to incentivize recruitment to volunteer battalions within the city. A pro-Kremlin and Russian nationalist outlet Pravda.Ru published an article blaming Beglov and his administration for failing to allocate appropriate funds, issue necessary recruitment directions, or organize a media campaign promoting recruitment into the St. Petersburg-based volunteer battalions “Neva,” “Kronshtadt,” and “Pavlovsk.”[53] Pravda.Ru has long expressed pro-Kremlin views, even publishing a list of all “anti-Russian” publications that criticized the Kremlin, so this attack on Beglov may have originated with the Kremlin.[54] The outlet claimed to have spoken to military recruitment centers in St. Petersburg that stated that Beglov refused to sign a decree for a media campaign plan that would invite artists, musicians, civil society leaders, and social media managers to promote contract service in the city, resulting in only 100 volunteers enlisting since early July. The outlet claimed that Beglov complained about the financial strain of the cost of the volunteer battalion one-time bonuses and the media campaign, while “killing” all free recruitment events in the city to avoid stoking tensions in the city. Beglov reportedly sought to have a “quiet” recruitment and “sabotaged” the process by tasking individual districts in the city with hosting and financing their own recruitment drives with no instructions or assistance from the St. Petersburg City Administration.

>A source close to the Putin administration told Russian opposition outlet Meduza that war was Beglov’s opportunity to repair his public support in St. Petersburg, but it is likely that a recruitment campaign for the volunteer battalions would only alienate inhabitants of the city.[57] ISW has previously reported that some St. Petersburg military recruitment centers distributed summonses to all local men in an effort to advertise contract service, which drew criticism online and prompted the St. Petersburg officials to deny the legitimacy of the letters.[58]

>Pravda.Ru’s article is an indicator that individual federal subjects (regions) are using the volunteer battalion recruitment to remain on Putin’s “good side.” Beglov’s concern over tensions within St. Petersburg over recruitment advertisements, if true, may also help explain why Russian officials appear to be shielding Moscow City residents from military recruitment campaigns.",False,1661757307.0,t3_x0i1bf,t3_x0i1bf,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

Day 187 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling at all, so it was very quiet the entire time, but somehow that doesn’t make it any easier to relax. Actually it’s the opposite, when there is no shelling you always expect that it *will* happen, so when it doesn’t happen you never leave that cycle of waiting for when it *does* happen, you always stay on guard.

What is even weirder, is that today there was no missile strike at all. It’s already 6am, but no missiles were fired yet, and probably won’t be, because they never fired them that late. With no shelling, and no missile strike you could say that today is the quietest day in a very long time, which is really nice, but you still never stop waiting for those missiles, so being quiet doesn’t really help all that much. 

Also at around 11pm there were some explosions somewhere in Belgorod, we even got a video where missiles can be seen flying and hitting something. People from Belgorod were saying that there were 2 loud explosions. I wonder if no missile strike today has something to do with those explosions, maybe a launcher or a missile stockpile was hit? But if so I think there would be more info about it, though some people from Belgorod were saying that they saw glow from something burning on the horizon right after those explosions, so something was hit.

With this logic, should I also remove the monument to Pushkin or Gagarin? It doesn't make sense,” said Gennady Trukhanov.

>Gennady Trukhanov also noted that the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin has among his plans the capture of Odessa:

>“Yes, he will try again: he is obsessed with our city. He does not want to bomb him, like Kharkov, he wants him whole. I am not a pessimist, I believe that we will win in the end. But the war remains long and hard. Our offensive on Kherson is slow, and Putin continues to hope for the encirclement of Odessa from the north to connect with ""Transnistria"".

>According to the mayor, in this war it is necessary to go through negotiations, not direct confrontation.

>“I think it is important to act politically, because the lives of millions of people are at stake. I don't want to be misunderstood. Obviously, I dream of returning to our borders in 1991, but we need to come to an agreement step by step, gradually look for compromises, and avoid confrontation. ”, - added Gennady Trukhanov.

And if there's a whole set of second-order and third-order effects... If Russia pulled more forces out of the East to prevent the move, are Ukrainian forces in those theatres able to be supplied to capitalise on the opportunity? (Which would be one of the potential advantages of such a move).

A Melitopol offensive means there has to be a Ukrainian ability to fix most other forces in place to ensure it's success, and that is highly contingent on having enough force for both Kherson and Melitopol and fixing the enemy in the East.

It's no contest. Russia will never be able to occupy Ukraine (outside of Crimea) at this point. I would argue when Russia lost the covert war before the invasion, and their carefully arranged propaganda messaging destroyed by the CIA and NSA, that Russia had little chance of a successful invasion after the 3rd day of the war, it was over for them.

Russia's greatest strategic fail was being far too confident in their propaganda. In modern times, post Internet, the Soviet style propaganda tech is no longer effective. Russians will eventually learn the actual reality of things over years, it is impossible to keep your people in a thought bubble like this -- only China is really capable of it, due to their being billons of Chinese people, its a much different social control calculus. Russia doesnt have the resources or economy size to resist the influx of the global hegemonic standard messaging program.

And the stupid part is that this strategy is the only thing they can do because of how broken their army is due to corruption and Putin's refusal to mobilize.

The high-speed armored assaults that were the foundation of Soviet and Russian tank doctrine fell apart due to Private Conscriptovich being paid $30 a month so he steals all the copper wiring from the tanks, sells off all the diesel fuel and ERA explosive panels, and just signs maintenance papers without doing any actual work on any of his vehicles. The officers in charge of the units are morons because they are friends of friends or family members of people higher up rather than competent officers. The armored units and infantry battalions are undermanned because the conscript troops who are supposed to fill up the dismount roles aren't there because Putin won't order a mobilization, and thus the only infantry available are conscripts from proxy states (usually outfitted with WWII kit) or Wagner mercenaries.

The only competent infantry able to do mobile operations were the naval infantry, VDV, and Wagner mercs, and they've been mauled to the point of ineffectiveness.

So they're stuck using the only ground arm that can be used to any effectiveness: their artillery. And that dried up the moment HIMARS (a late Cold War weapons system) gave the Ukrainians the capacity to blast their ammo dumps and supply facilities with impunity.",False,1661819940.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imboran,,1,27,0,27,0,0,

A good method of revenge for our warehouses and airfields these last days. Either they surrender and become Russia or we erase them and their cities from the face of the Earth."".

Very rarely used, but when needed, they had to bust out ~10 of them because of the low carrying capacity. 

This leads to stupid amount of maintenance for very little gain. So we donated all of them and IIRC got 2 new large ones. UA will use even the smaller ones and we will actually save money on this all.

8f14029aac0a3acdacd9ad868a18c850,x0i1bf,imc6a4l,"*I always had the impression that the famous words „Never again!“ were directed not only against the return of war in Europe but also against locking people out in an aggressive, unpredictable dictatorship that could abruptly change the rules of the game at any moment and start looking for new victims. This is exactly the kind of regime that Russia has degenerated into after February 24th, and in some respects, even earlier, and it is this kind of regime that some EU politicians are proposing not only to lock people up in, but even to deport people to. This goes against all the experience Europe gained from the two world wars of the 20th century; the Spanish Civil War; the Cold War; the wars in Yugoslavia and the Middle East, which in many ways formed the basis of modern European values. When homosexuals were brutally persecuted in Chechnya, no one said „ they should not complain and rather go and overthrow Kadyrov and Putin“. The same maxim should apply when issuing visas as in court. It is better to acquit ten guilty people than to convict one innocent person. Even if nine out of ten people travel to Europe for purely tourist purposes, but in return, one threatened person is saved from danger, it was already worth it. This is all the more true as Russia today is a country without rules and threats can occur unexpectedly and unpredictably. The Russian State Duma is already working on a new anti-LGBTIQ law that would not only criminalize „propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors“, but essentially criminalize this way of life itself. Furthermore, amendments to the law on mobilization are being drafted. As the influx of volunteers threatens to dry up, governors have been instructed to set up regional battalions, but they are struggling to find enough volunteers for them. Any event, such as the murder of Darya Dugina, could mark the beginning of reprisals against those who could have felt relatively safe yesterday. After all, a tourist visa was never meant only for tourism. It is a visa issued on the basis of a ticket and a hotel reservation, and quite often allows multiple entries into the Schengen area. In this way, people always have an exit option ready without having to take the long route of consular bureaucracy. Because every official, even an official of the most people-friendly country, will act according to the instructions. For example, before the war, the European consulates in Russia, including the German consulate, refused to consider same-sex couples as couples in the process of issuing visas, regardless of the officially declared values by their states. After all, these couples did not have an official document, which in principle could not exist in Russia. So each partner was checked individually, and it could happen that the wealthier of the two got a visa, while the less wealthy one was left without a visa, even though they travelled together. Therefore, one can well imagine what would happen if consular sections started issuing visas only to those who are threatened. How would the proof required for this be provided? Would the people threatened have to present the consulate with a criminal complaint from the public prosecutor's office? It seems strange when democracies sometimes question the freedom to travel more than dictatorships—to the delight of the latter. That is why the EU as a whole is not very enthusiastic about this proposal.*

*And what should the West do so that it neither repeats the old mistakes nor makes new ones?*

*Whenever the Russians are blamed for their inaction, according to which they failed to topple Putin and are therefore to blame for the war, a relatively short period of time is usually used as a reference. Sometimes one year, sometimes two years, more often the years after 2014. This is admittedly too short-sighted. But even in this period, numerous protest rallies took place all over Russia. It does not take much effort to find photo and video recordings of the demonstrations, their violent dispersals, and random arrests. But let us think back to 2011-2013. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Moscow and other Russian cities over many months to protest against the rigged State Duma elections and against the so-called „castling move“ and the return of Vladimir Putin to the presidency—throughout the winter, in freezing temperatures. Then came a very violent dispersal of the protest rally on the day of Putin's inauguration, the Bolotnaya trials, and Vladimir Putin's symbolic procession through an empty Moscow. And what did we see in response? Western leaders recognized the election and congratulated Putin on his re-election—the US president, the German chancellor, and all the others. The people who took to the streets by the hundreds of thousands saw that Putin's return was broadly fine for the world out there. Very soon, a series of extremely strange amendments to the law followed, for example on insulting the feelings of believers, on banning so-called homosexual propaganda, restrictions on the activities of NGOs and the media, and the Pussy Riot case. Although we heard individual statements by Western politicians and saw the reactions of journalists, there were no sanctions, no concrete measures. The West did not take the events in Russia for granted, but nevertheless accepted them—after all, Russia is a strange place, they said. This was very disappointing for all those who saw Putin's return and the way it was conducted as dangerous for Russia and the whole world. Not even two years after these events, Crimea and the Donbas followed. And today, those who took to the streets that winter are told: it's your fault that Putin wasn't overthrown then. Judging by the reactions at the time, Vladimir Putin's return in 2011 seemed more threatening to Russians than to very many Western politicians. This makes blaming the Russians for the consequences of Putin's return to the presidency all the stranger, because it was the Russians who actively protested against Putin. During the protests of 2011–2013, no red lines were drawn by the West against the Russian leadership; rather, the scope of what was permissible was gradually expanded even further until we finally arrived where we are today—in the midst of war. Instead of punishing all Russians across the board—including those who protested—the West should support those who are speaking out against the war today in one way or another.*",False,1661826593.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imc64nc,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

They took massive losses in the early war by storming defended positions, falling out of aeroplanes, and getting blapped by defences. It is also believed that a transport full of them went into the Black Sea after an attempt on Odessa.

And that dried up the moment HIMARS (a late Cold War weapons system) gave the Ukrainians the capacity to blast their ammo dumps and supply facilities with impunity.

Well said but to add on, HIMARS is so effective at disrupting the logistics because the Russian military simply has antiquated logistics. We shouldn't forget that they don't palatalize or have many aids in transporting the kit outside of trucks. 

Imagine having to move 10 tons of cargo out of the back of a truck by hand with your coworkers at work? No pallets, no forklifts. Just you and maybe three other dudes. 

That's like a three hour job, minimum. So, Russia drives a demand-push logistics system that is dependent upon large depots of ammo and gear. It's a recipe for disaster when literally everyone with a cell phone is an OPSEC threat.

Whether these are as effective as dedicated ATGM's against a tank I do not know, given the small size of the warhead I would think not, but it would probably be very effective against more lightly armored targets. I bet pretty much any of the warheads would give thinly skinned armored personal carriers like the Russian BMP and BMD a very bad day. Anti armor is probably not really its intended use as you say though even if the option is there.

Edit: Looking into it the HEAT warhead for the 70 mm rocket contains 2 pounds of explosive and [the Javelin's warhead only contains 1.3 pounds of explosive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_\(surface-to-air_missile\)) The overall warhead weight is also higher at 8.8 pounds for the 70 mm HEAT warhead and 6 pounds for the Javelin warhead. Looks like it might be pretty effective in an anti armor role if they had the correct warheads. Not sure what they will be supplied with of course and it still seems it would be much easier to sneak around with a Javelin and take out a tank then roll up in a pickup truck that would be much easier to spot of course.

Two that come to mind...

There's a situation where an APC was moving with infantry following it. The Ukrainian forces hit the APC and it just started spinning in place.  The infantry following just walked away...  Didn't take cover, didn't run, didn't look to see where the shot came from... They just *walked* away.

Another account that I heard was about Russian soldiers advancing on Ukrainian positions without magazines in their rifles.

And heck, why not, a third is of a Russian soldier that was riding a bike down the middle of a road.  When he saw the Ukrainian troops he got off of his bike pulled a small submachine gun (referred to as a peashooter because of its notable inaccuracy and weak ammunition) and just started shooting from the hip.

And since I'm thinking about it, there what's another account of ukrainians that had their position on a rooftop. A ladder went up to the side and a Russian soldier went up the ladder. When he got to the top he threw his rifle over without even looking and continued up. A Ukrainian soldier shot him right in the head and the Russian fell off, dead. Then, right after that happened, the guy coming up behind him on the ladder did the *exact* same thing and died the exact same way.

Throughout the entirety of the Gettysburg campaign the confederacy lost ~ 27000 men. At Vicksburg they lost ~32,000, and the union only lost ~4000 at Vicksburg.

Gettysburg was more of a crushing defeat to the south than a motivating victory to the north.

The place that they haven’t shown the same speed or low cost is the net new delivery of cutting edge vehicle performance NASA hasn’t already tested 20-30 years ago . There is a reason active cooling (which SpaceX abandoned only recently) and actuated strakes were avoided on DYNASOAR, MiG-105, Shuttle, Buran, X-27, X-33. Perhaps hundreds of the high performance Raptor V1 engines all needed to be scrapped for the V2 block, but V2 seems to need frequent replacing after test fires and the TPS tiles keep popping off. This means they could magically have solved using strake actuators/load bearing hinges so close to the plasma front, and the reliability issues of the similar closed cycle N1 RD-270s, but SLS I think is going to push up the heavy modules for the Lunar gateway and then be sunset for US built METHLOX closed combustion cycle based heavy lift in 5-6 years once BE-4/Raptor version 2 mature and hit their human rated reliability metrics. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105",1661819601.0,1661818577.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imbmes3,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

However I would note that it was reported weeks ago that Ukraine had distributed notices around Kherson, telling people what to do when the counteroffensive begins: my recollection is that they were told to take shelter and remain in place until liberated, only sending one person out for necessities no more than once per day and during daylight hours.

Of course it's possible that civilians may not have received that message, may be unwilling/unable to comply or may not have understood that the counteroffensive had now begun to the point that the instructions should be followed.  But it also *should* significantly reduce (though probably not completely eliminate) the number of civilians in any such a queue of people scrambling to evacuate eastwards over the river.

That's why there is very little direct airs support if any and why every clip you see of jets from either side they're flying on the deck.. And while missiles have a range for any missile you'd be launching you rather be on a platform that can get away fast after you've launched and the A-10 can't even go supersonic, meanwhile the F-16 can go up to mach 2. There are also tons of F-16's in storage, with 4,500 made, lots of countries that have used them with a lot of spare part and experienced mechanics around to train Ukrainian's. There have also been many weapon systems integrated with them making it easier to find munitions for Ukraine to use. 

They did lose 5 A-10's in Desert Storm and 7 A-10's in the reinvasion of Iraq after 9/11 all in the opening stages of both wars. After that the Iraqi air force and ground based air defenses were neutralized and it allowed the A-10's to operate freely, Russia's are defenses are still very much active to this day and A-10's are not the plane to take them out. If you flew the A-10 today in Ukraine anywhere near the front at altitude as survivable as they are they'd still be getting shot down just like in the opening stages of both Iraq wars.

The issue is that if the Ukrainian's are going to go to spend the time and effort to adopt a foreign jet fighter, which is possible but is a massive investment in highly skilled manpower, it's better to pick a multirole jet that can do most of what the A-10 can do and do other vital missions like air superiority and missions against enemy air defenses. Those are missions the A-10 can not do. Unlike some others I think Ukraine can overcome the huge challenge in learning to maintain and fly a western fighter and the sooner we start the better but it is still a massive change for their maintainers and pilots. Adopting one new jet is already a huge challenge, adopting two is twice as bad as that.

If this was an actual plan they would have been training in the US and you would never have heard about it.

I'm not saying Ukraine has unconditional support, but there's a lot of things that need to change before they lose all support.

I'm not suggesting your concerns are invalid or incorrect, just that it's likely we'll see Kherson liberated (which will be a *huge* development for war support), and it's highly likely Ukraine can outlast winter even if the season slows things down.

We're a long way from either Ukraine or Russia collapsing.

Alternatively, if Russia keeps pushing there's a chance of breaking through, which is bad for Ukraine (but likely something that would increase immediate support rather than a collapse of support).

If you have one option to get humans to space that cost X amount, and on the other hand you have no option, then indeed the first option is more economical? So, in this case, SpaceX is more economical than NASA?

Also, it’s my understanding that SLS will depend on SpaceX to land people on the moon. So don’t you need to factor those 5 refueling trips and the whole flight of Starship to the moon, into the SLS costs? So then really the question is, why not just use another Starship to get the humans into space and then transfer to the one going to the moon? 

I could be wrong on this. But my understanding is that Artemis has contracted the lunar landing portion to SpaceX. So the cost of getting people to the moon via SLS is the cost of SLS, + the cost of Starship and refueling and moon insertion orbit and landing and ascent. The cost for just sending people via SpaceX is the same, minus all the costs for SLS (99% of which is thrown away), plus the cost one one additional Starship launch (which is almost 100% reusable).",1661820389.0,1661820070.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imbr7us,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

So, I don't think it is very beneficial to go around the world telling people not to get their hopes up. I think, in general, when it comes to not getting our hopes up - we are all fine on that by ourselves.

It's like, going around telling people, ""You know, you aren't a 10"". It's just not as helpful as going around telling people, ""Hey, you look good today."" Everyone already knows they aren't a 10. They don't need the reminder. All of us have some flaw. And, likewise, most of us struggle with confidence, hope, and expectations. So, just having killjoys running around like, ""Warning, here's something you might be happy about for a second, BUT DONT BE"" seems unnecessary and counter productive. Like... where are you where everyone is falling over themselves with boundless joy, optimism, confidence and too much hope? Because, most people I know identify with the human condition and feel somewhat lost, alone, scared, and in need of hope.

Like, life itself tells us not to get our hopes up or set our expectations too high. Do we need additional reminders? Or do we need to give each other the encouragement TO hope, because life throws a lot at us already?",False,1661805875.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imavwwu,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

People don't need reminders for what is realistic, because that is reality. Reality does that. It's like if you get punched in the face by Mike Tyson, then someone running up and telling you, ""Getting punched in the face by Mike Tyson hurts."" No shit! My experience has already taught me that. 

&#x200B;

Now, if you come up and say, ""Hey, did you know Hollyfield also got punched in the face by Mike Tyson? And, he's like one of the best fighters of all time - so, you're in good company!"" Then I might laugh, and you cheered me up, and you added something of value to the experience. Right? 

&#x200B;

But, just running around telling people, ""Hey, the world is bad, don't get your expectations up, and don't have hope"", isn't very helpful. Everyone is already there. We've all been punched in the face by the gloved Mike Tyson cannon of an arm that is life itself.",False,1661806753.0,t3_x0i1bf,t1_imaxmdr,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Some Bobby-Sue in a desk somewhere in middle America is going to see reports of the counter offensive in Ukraine today, and maybe they get a little hopeful. Maybe they think, ""Hey, maybe this is the beginning of a turnaround. Maybe this thing will go Ukraine's way eventually."" Now, what's the major risk there? We find out tomorrow or a week from now the counter-offensive failed, right? Do you really think Bobby-Sue is now going to be so depressed they don't show up for work? That they lose their job due to insurmountable depressions? Nope. They just move on to their next subreddit and hope Ukraine has better days ahead.

&#x200B;

So, in that context,  I see little value in people who enjoy running around telling people ""don't get your expectations up!"" - it just comes across as an ego trip mixed with a bit of a Debbie Downer. There's no benefit in it. People already know, from the world itself, not to have high expectations. A far better approach, imho, is, ""Here's a bit of good news. Let's hope it holds up."" Do you see how that works? Because, it sort of implies that the world suggests it won't hold up, which is the ""don't get your expectations up"" part. It's built in. By default.

Second, complaining about fuel usage while ignoring other factors is stupid. Fuel is literally the easiest logistics problem to solve. It’s stable in liquid form, easily storable and transportable, and available in bulky nearly anywhere on the planet. Solving for an engine that needs overhaul every 100 hours instead of 500 hours means more mechanics and spares, which also need to be transported.

Here’s a fact: The US Army has used turbine engines in the Abrams for 43 years now. They’ve had plenty of chance to change the engine and it’s been proposed several times. It never happened. Why, because the Army knows more about logistics than you.

I'll end with one last example. I remember when the first Star Wars prequel was coming out. The months before were amazing. There were leaks, and build up, and all the fans were hopeful and excited about it. At some point, I was questioning... should I avoid any more spoilers? Should I tamper my expectations? What if it is bad? And, you know what, even thought people look back a little more fondly at the prequels now - the consensus at the time was that they were terrible. One thing I remember thinking then was, ""You know what, the hope and joy I had leading up to the movie release was more fulfilling to me than the movie itself"". Like, either way, I was probably, at the time, going to be disappointed in the movie. But, by participating in the moment, in the discussions, in the movement, in the spoilers, in the speculation - I got a lot more out of the movie than if I had just remained agnostic and avoided expectations and just purely went to see the movie itself. Because I participated, I have fond memories of those times with my friends and the culture at large. 

&#x200B;

Now, you could have said at the time, ""Hey, dont' get your expectations up, because if this movie sucks, then people will see how the fans were disappointed and wrong, and think we are stupid, and never go see it and they will never make any more Star Wars films ever again!""

Because those ""disinterested passer-bys"" are the ones who really determine whether support for Ukraine continues and how long it lasts. Not us, because they outnumber us by an order of magnitude or more. Majority wins in democracy, for better or worse - it cuts both ways, and in a world of social media and memes, anyone can be the one under the microscope at any time.

This is not some kind of ""human principles"" thing, it's a very practical and in-the-mud concern of what makes for a stable (vs. unstable) political effort.

And, to put it more bluntly - this war is not about us or our own emotional development. I give a shit about what happens to Ukrainian citizens, their lives, their freedom, and what positions them for the best chance for success - not about some abstract burden on me or on members of this sub. Frankly, I don't give the slightest shit about the latter.

Or, like, the citizens in Ukraine right now, ""I mean, let's not get our hopes up. We are a small country. Russia has done this multiple times. Realistically, best case scenario, we hold out for a few months and then have to capitulate. They are just way too big. So, y'know, go out there and launch a rocket or two, but keep it safe and don't get your hopes up.""

I'd argue it is people that find uncommon ways to maintain and sustain hope who accomplish better things.
