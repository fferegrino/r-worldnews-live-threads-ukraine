- there's lots of Russian troops moving around Ukraines borders. New satellite images show field hospital (weird to setup for a drill) 7m from border w Kharkiv. Lots of movement from Belgorod (Kharkiv). Russian navy is in the med outside Odessa including repair and infantry ships (weird to setup for a drill). Huge tank and artillery divisions in Crimea. 
- obviously also Russians in occupied parts of ukraine
- they have some markings nobody understands
- more generally Putin was authorized to use Russian military ""abroad"" with unilateral individual authority. He is the commander in chief
- inside Ukraine there is lots of shelling from Russia controlled Donbass (name for the TOTAL contested area) into Ukraine controlled, power stations have been targeted
- Ukraine also returning fire but trying not to (some journalists otg say)
- Russia says new republic borders include whole Donbass incl Ukraine controlled areas, giving casus belli to at least push past the ""contact line"" which includes the large city of Mariupol
- pro ru gatherings happened in Donetsk (ru-donbass) and pro-ukr in Mariupol (ukr-donbass) but you can legally pay for protests in Ukraine lol (look it up!) so who tf knows
- on top of real agitation, lots of people claiming lots of fake agitation. Ukraine secret service intercepts 2 Russian sponsored false flags, publishes one. Terrorist attack in donestk leaves 2 broken windows.
- Russian diplomats are all fleeing. Russian consulates are seen burning documents 
- Ukraine mobilizing infantry and reserves (aka everyone who is already ready to fight) but not full conscription yet. Minister of defense has told country they have no other option than to fight
- us/NATO responding 2 ways - a - limited sanctions (nord stream2, mil banks, some aristocrats, and most importantly sovereign debt sales) - and - b - deploying nominal amounts of troops to surrounding NATO allies (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). E.g. Canada says 500 boots. Buildup might be much much bigger.

Or vice versa, if the Mexican President said the reverse (which is probably closer to the reality lol)

>Western officials say they are holding back the bulk of a long-threatened “crippling” sanctions package for what they believe to be an inevitable attack on the rest of Ukraine in the coming days.  
>  
>“Putin lost in terms of what he wanted to achieve, what he was betting on,” Ingrida Simonyte, prime minister of Lithuania, told the Financial Times. “Today we see incredible unity not only within western democracies . . . but also coordination with Ukraine.”  
>  
>Simonyte added that not all the options should be unleashed at this point, but said “a clear message that this is just the beginning has been sent to Putin”.  
>  
>Western intelligence officials told the FT that there was near certainty that Russia would in the coming days begin an attack on areas of Ukraine not held by the Kremlin-backed separatists, and likely strike Kyiv and crucial military sites.  
>  
>A senior state department official acknowledged there were some limitations, saying any sanctions imposed on Russia should not disrupt global oil and natural gas flows “There are more sanctions we can impose . . . but even when we do \[impose\] those, the base characteristic of trying to impose them on the Russian economy and not on energy markets will be a top priority for us,” the official said.  
>  
>Tougher measures that the EU and US have drawn up but not yet deployed include targeting bigger and more systemic Russian lenders, restricting Russian banks from converting roubles into dollars and blocking high-technology exports in certain industrial sectors that are critical for the country’s economy.  
>  
>Ahead of Putin’s decision, some EU members had disagreed over whether it was preferable to adopt a single powerful sanctions package or a more gradual approach.  
>  
>But once it became clear that the Russian president was preparing to recognise the breakaway territories, officials opted for a graduated approach, preparing an initial, relatively targeted response that was presented by the commission and the EU diplomatic service on Tuesday morning.  
>  
>“Some would like to act with everything we have now, but they understand that we have to be able to increase if need be,” said one EU official. “We still have quite a big package in reserve.”A G7 meeting on Thursday would provide an additional opportunity to gauge the right response, the official said, saying “it will be discussed if we need to scale up the intensity”.",False,1645579626.0,t3_syzhbn,t3_syzhbn,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

George Bush this morning said he ""strongly supported"" Ukraine's attempt to join Nato, and warned he would not allow Russia to veto its membership bid.

Speaking in Kiev after a meeting with Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, the US president said both post-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia should be allowed to join the alliance – despite vehement objections from Russia.

In remarks likely to infuriate the Kremlin, Bush said Ukraine should be invited during this week's Nato summit in Bucharest to join Nato's membership action programme, a prelude to full membership.

He also said that there could be no deal with Moscow over the US administration's contentious plans to locate elements of its controversial missile defence system in eastern Europe.

""This is a misperception,"" Bush said after talks with in Kiev. ""I strongly believe that Ukraine and Georgia should be given MAP [Membership Action Plans], and there are no tradeoffs - period.""

Bush's comments came ahead of this week's Nato summit in Bucharest and talks between the US president and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, on Sunday in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

The encounter is likely to be the last between the two leaders before Putin leaves office on May 7.

Putin is also attending tomorrow's Nato summit, and will address a closed meeting on Friday. The event is likely to be stormy.",False,1645589923.0,t3_syzhbn,t3_syzhbn,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

NATO simply happens to be the alliance that is currently preventing Putin from realizing his vision for Russia. And thats Russia being the political, economic, cultural and military center of a likeminded bloc of Eurasian countries. Not European, not Asian, but Eurasian. This is his real obsession.

Various scenarios possible

1) Putin wont continue. He got his frozen conflict, massive troops in Donetsk and Luhansk, and in the current state Ukraine cant join NATO. So far it didnt cost him much. Putin has always been a leader seeking maximum gains at minimum cost. Also explains a bit all the theatre and staged events. 

Didnt this conflict cost him money? Militarily speaking not so much and economically speaking sanctions so far have been mixed in severity but could also have been far worse. They are mostly affecting the elite and not so much the Russian population. NS2 might have been cancelled but he still can sell a lot of oil/gas to Europe in the coming years against high prices. The more he escalates the more he jeopardizes that. In short, it offers an escape for Putin to not continue any further escalation, to save at least a bit of face and to have strategic superiority ovet Ukraine.

Correct, strategic superiority, with Ukraine not able to join NATO, he can keep poking in Kiev which would face hard times as well. Remember Lavrov saying today Ukraine has no sovereignty? Well this thought is what he might be really after, not so much to completely conquer Ukraine right now, but to simply undermine and question Kiev's power base. To enforce movements and politicians that might seek better ties with Russia again. In Ukraine not unlikely.

And if this doesnt work, well, he has his military bases in Luhansk and Donetsk to quickly escalate and conquer more land if necessary.

2) Putin escalates the fight into eastern Ukraine. He feels Ukraine has slipped away for good and its now or never to take as much as possible. Militarily speaking very much possible. With the occupation of Crimea the South is completely open while eastern Ukraine all the way to the Dniepr is pretty flat. So with sea and air superiority, which Russia has, an invasion would be relatively easy/doable. 

Would he go as far as Kiev? The Ukraine government most likely would leave for Lviv as would most people (fleeing West). But the main obstacle for Putin would be the cities. Where air and sea support would matter far less and costly bloody conflicts are more likely. Eastern Ukraine (whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions plus a possible corridor to Crimea) might be enough.

Clear downside would be economically. A clear rift between Russia and the West would happen with heavy sanctions. Russia would become completely dependent on its own Eurasia region as well as China.

Military speaking, the frozen conflict under scenario 1 gives him the guarantee that he might get the time to grow stronger. It also leaves some space for diplomatic talks, possibly even with Kiev over time (which he could use to grow his influence there again). Furthermore, his Donbass republics claim more land than they currently control. He could use those claims when the time is right. 

Under scenario 2 however, he doesnt have that guarantee which is a risk. However, with keeping in mind that he already believes that Ukraine has slipped away, and that its now or never he might go for it anyways. Furthermore, Kiev wouldnt give up its claims on occupied land and the frozen conflict would remain. What is even more sinister is that Russia could create more puppet regimes in the east with new claims. But no guarantees he would succeed in that.

Why is the latter not unlikely, Putin's rant and laughable ultimatum didnt make the impression he is satisfied. It made the impression that he is going for as far as he can get against a reasonable cost (this doesnt mean the whole of Ukraine otherwise he would have invaded much earlier when his chances were far better to do so). The east of Ukraine therefore, is still looking like a relatively easy target. And that might be now or never in Putin's ideas.

Would the east of Ukraine be worth such high costs to Putin? It might.

3) He escalates the fight into the whole of Ukraine. Would be a bloody fight facing heavy opposition and far more resistance and obstacles. Russia would still be superior but maintaining an occupation for years to come would be hard to manage.

Regardless Putin would realize his dream of recreating a big part of the Russian Empire. He is a longterm thinker and knows as long as he doesnt get into a war with NATO in the short term Russia might recover in the long term and even get stronger.

Economic sanctions would be heavy, diplomatic relationships extremely tense, and he even might have overplayed his hand. There is no guarantee he would win this fight let alone be able to maintain an occupation. It might also weaken Russia's strategic position in other countries from the Middle East to Georgia, Moldova, and even Central Asian countries. Maximum gains or maximum loss?

-----‐----------

In short, scenario's 1 and 2 are the most likely. Scenario 1 is looking far more in line with how Putin has been operating traditionally. The staged events, the maximum bluff, and the creation of a a frozen conflict in a by Russia contested area remind us about past conflicts.

But this isnt an ordinary conflict. Also not for Russia. Putin feels he has lost his grip on Ukraine completely, and he cant keep the country from moving west. In that case it might be now or never for him to get as much of Ukraine as possible and to keep the conflict as alive as possible as described under scenario 2. If that includes Kiev that can be debated but the whole of Ukraine, as under scenario 3, seems far less likely otherwise he would have done so before.

If having to choose, and seeing this as not a typical conflict and Russia believing its now or never (also because under scenario 1 he would give plenty of opportunity to Ukraine to improve its stance in East Ukraine), I fear scenario 2 is the most likely at the moment. But with heavy doubts and still with the first scenario in the back of my mind. My view.",1645583518.0,1645583099.0,t3_syzhbn,t3_syzhbn,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

What should happen:

Biden: I've had positive discussions with President Putin wherein he has promised to respect Ukrainian territorial boundaries against assurances from NATO to stay out of bilateral discussions between the neighbouring countries.

What will probably happen:

Biden: We've frozen the financial interests of Russian oligarchs across US and Europe, and have diverted the full might of the US military to fight Russia.

Yet look what happened:

> In conjunction with the sanctions that the US imposed on Russia (namely, sanctioning a number of Russian banks, Russian sovereign debt, and a number of Russian elites), President Biden announced that the US would be deploying troops to the Baltic states and other Eastern European NATO countries to reassure those countries of NATO's commitments.",False,1645588685.0,t3_syzhbn,t3_syzhbn,,0,-36,0,-36,0,0,

I support Ukraine and hope there's no war, but Chechnya isn't applicable here for the most part.

After the First Chechen War, the de facto independent Chechnya immediately descended into chaos. There was no central government or even pension system and could be described as the Somalia of the Caucasus. The economy was illicit, and kidnappings formed a part of the ill gotten gains. The de facto country devolved into a civil war between nationalists and Islamists. It was a mess. It got so bad, even Georgia wanted Russia to launch an offensive into Chechnya because so many of its problems were spilling into the Caucasus.

The second Russian intervention in Chechnya was generally supported as a necessary action, especially since Chechnya was within Russian borders. Those Chechen warlords were beyond fucked up.

The crux of the issue of course comes with the apartment bombings; it's certainly plausible that Putin ""test-runned"" his now infamous false flag strategy with that incident, solidifying support for what would have been an already justified intervention. The evidence is inconclusive (the FSB destroyed documents), so we really don't know, but it definitely boosted Putin's career.

Chechnya is nothing like Russia's immoral ""intervention"" in Ukraine, let's not get things twisted. It would be like hating the USA for the Iraq War, and retrospectively looking at every American military action with similar malaise.

In early August 2008, after Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops into the rebellious province of South Ossetia, Russia came to its defense, beginning a five-day-long conflict that ended with Russian troops within striking distance of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.

Moscow’s aggressive reaction to its long-simmering tensions with Georgia announced Russia’s reemergence as a military power, and paved the way for its controversial dealings with another former Soviet republic, Ukraine, beginning in 2014.


Separatist Issues in Georgia

The roots of the Russia-Georgia conflict go back to the early 1990s, when both Russia and Georgia were newly independent nations after the dissolution of the USSR. Civil war erupted within Georgia, located to the south of Russia on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, when two provinces—South Ossetia in eastern Georgia, and Abkhazia, on the northwestern coast—sought to declare their own independence.

“One can track [the 2008 conflict] back, really from the very beginning of the independence of Georgia, when Abkhazia in particular split away, and the Russians backed Abkhazia,” says Mark Galeotti, senior non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague and an expert on modern Russian history and security affairs.

A ceasefire in 1994 ended the worst fighting, but tensions continued to simmer in the two breakaway provinces, which remained technically part of Georgia. Home to different ethnic groups, the Ossetians and the Abkhazians, they had been autonomous earlier in the 20th century, after the Russian Revolution, and they wanted their autonomy back.

Georgia and the West
Beginning in the late 1990s, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expanded their influence in Eastern and Central Europe, formerly a Soviet stronghold. Russia and its new president, Vladimir Putin (first elected in 2000), bitterly resented the loss of this buffer zone between Moscow and the West.
For its part, Georgia was moving further West, even joining the U.S.-led coalition fighting in the Iraq War in 2003. This process intensified after the election of pro-Western President Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004.

Georgia was clearly embarked on a process of trying to break out of Russia’s sphere of influence,” Galeotti says. “And as far as Russia was concerned, this was an absolute priority. It had to maintain its sphere of influence, and if it let Georgia go, then who could be next?”

Long-Simmering Tensions Erupt Into War

Sakaashvili also attempted to crack down on separatism within Georgia, which brought the long-running conflict in South Ossetia into the forefront again. Georgia’s always-tense relationship with its northern neighbor worsened in late 2006, when Sakaashvili’s government accused Putin, who was Russia’s prime minister at the time, of supporting the separatist cause. After Georgia arrested four Russian military officers for suspected espionage, Russia responded by closing Georgian businesses and deporting Georgian citizens.

With Georgia on the verge of joining NATO, but not yet subject to the organization’s collective defense agreement, Russia saw an opportunity to rein in its neighbor and demonstrate its military strength in the region. As Galeotti puts it: “The Russians built up their plans, built up their forces, and they ensured that their local proxies in South Ossetia needled Georgians enough, knowing that Sakaashvili….would rise to the bait.”  

On August 8, 2008, after months of back-and-forth accusations and provocations between the two sides, and a series of clashes between South Ossetian militia and Georgian military troops, Sakaashvili ordered his troops to capture the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. Russia swiftly responded by moving its troops to the border and conducting air strikes on Georgian positions in South Ossetia as well as Abkhazia.

With the United States, Great Britain and NATO calling for a ceasefire, the conflict continued for five days, as Russia quickly took control of Tskhinvali and rolled its tanks and troops through Ossetia into Georgia, stopping only about 30 miles from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.

Beyond diplomatic efforts and humanitarian aid, the international community did little to stop the conflict. “No one was willing to go to war for Georgia,” Galeotti points out. “This was a time in which no one really wanted to provoke Russia. [Dmitry] Medvedev was president, and particularly American policy was to essentially hope that this could be leveraged into something more positive. So…to a large extent, Georgia was left on its own.”

After Russia called a halt to its advance into Georgia, a cease-fire on August 12 ended the Russia-Georgia War. According to an official EU fact-finding report in 2009, nearly 850 people were killed during the five-day conflict, while some 35,000 Georgians were left homeless. That same fact-finding report concluded that though Georgia had initiated the war, Russia had provoked its neighbor over a long period and overreacted to that initial artillery attack.",False,1645590313.0,t3_syzhbn,t1_hy26fm9,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

*So, Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.*

*By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad. Very sad.*

* Everyone claiming Hillary was terminally-ill and suffering secret seizures during the 2016 election.
* Tons of people claiming that Trump was ""clearly"" suffering debilitating effects of long-covid and secretly couldn't breathe for months after he had Coronavirus. 
* Kim Jong-Un for most of his reign so far.
* Fidel Castro's entire life

I mean, yeah, if you keep insisting a politician is terminally-ill, eventually you will be right, assuming you are still alive to see it.

I think you are just confused about what you see. And I think for the sake of simplicity, everyone just refers to tank as anything with treads and a gun on top, so it's not your fault.  
Russia has the BMP. It's tracked and has a turret top with a small cannon, but it's main duty is to haul a unit of infantry men and their equipment. They get loaded up with 6-7 guys and protect them, move them into place and then provide fire support. The tracked vehicles with large turrets and long gun barrels are main battle tanks. The tracked vehicles with small turrets and smaller guns are mechanized infantry BMPs. I'm not an expert on what the Russians currently use or have, but basically every military in the world uses some combination of Main battle tank, mobile artillery (rockets or howitzers), and a mechanized infantry vehicle like the BMP or the US/Canadian stryker, and maybe a recon jeep like vehicle.  
Again, not a military expert, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but in terms of doctrine, main battle tanks would probably be the first to roll across the border and try to find targets and seize the more open areas. The mechanized infantry and artillery would be brought up later to hold ground and take hard points like bunkers and cities. Basically, places that are harder for tanks to handle. So if you are seeing tanks moving to the border over mechanized infantry, or dudes in trucks, that would make sense. There probably will be a bunch of reserves in trucks, but they don't need to be up on the front line. Keep them back and safely out of range of Ukrainian artillery and then when the line gets pushed you move them forward.

Syria was subject to extensive attention for a while, but mainstream media again lost attention shortly after it turned into a long and low-grade conflict.

North Korea... Depends upon what portion you are referring to. The Korean War had extensive press coverage until the armistice was signed. Same for Vietnam

The World Wars were extensively covered, but also heavily censored.

Basically if the Draft was involved there was heavy press coverage and after the draft was suspended in the US press coverage of conflicts limited themselves to the first few months of American involvement then dropped. Once the possibility of young men from (supposedly) random families getting drafted and sent overseas went away, so did the public interest in wars that did not have a truly existential threat to the US.

The EU/US can't really back down off of sanctions without just completely giving up and openly telling Russia that it can do what it wants. Which they won't feel comfortable doing because they've very publicly taken a firm stand and to back down on sanctions is to risk an existential threat to themselves. Which means that Putin would then have to follow up and declare all out war on NATO something which he'd either lose on conventional terms or which we'd all lose on nuclear terms.

China won't fight Russia. The US could fight Russia, however that would trigger all the alliance nations to the US to fight. Australia, UK, etc, essentially everyone else and their allies as well.

0b720e212c85cc0967e7dbd3798863c0,syzhbn,hy2gvmo,"First of all, China and Russian are both communist in name only. Communism is all about equality - no one being rich while another is poor, and these countries are not communist. China actually practiced communism in the 70s, but over time they've probably grown more capitalist than the US. I am less familiar with Russia's politics but to my understanding it's the same.

China and Russia aren't that chummy. Chinese people don't think the way Americans do. Americans are more idealist - they feel something is morally right so they HAVE to act on it, even if it hurts themselves (ex: sanctions). China has more of a ""face"" culture - it's about keeping your head down, working hard, and you really really care what other people think about you.

China doesn't want the West to see itself as the bad guy. They try very hard not to be seen by the West as a bad guy, but they're like the kid in school who tries too hard to be accepted by the popular kids and it blows up in their face. Like the 2008 Olympics. Wanted to win so bad to have face, but instead everyone thinks they're cheaters who lie about the age of their gymnasts. Wanted to put on a great show, got mocked for having one pretty girl lipsync while an uglier girl sang live in the back. Want to dress like Westerners and wear luxury brands, gets called shallow. Wants to be rich like a Western country, gets called greedy. Wants to be technologically advanced, gets called uncreative copycats. Wants to hide embarrassing stuff like COVID, makes it worse and makes themselves look bad. Builds fancy buildings really fast and tries to impress the world with it, gets mocked for the quality of their work.

China's alliance with Russia is only half-assed. It's like they didn't get to sit with the cool kids so they sit with a fellow unpopular kid but they don't actually have much in common. Ultimately the Chinese would look out for themselves first, they don't actually care about Russia. For China they want to keep improving the lives of their citizens which would involve keeping their economy strong and staying neutral, but simultaneously they want Russia to win because they have the whole thing with Taiwan.

Ukraine has about similar numbers of troops, is fighting a defensive war, and the front is enormous. Russia in general also hasn't performed that well in most of their wars, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is nowhere the number of men Russia would need to actually crack Ukraine to the point that they would be able to take substantial land. Though at the same time Ukraine also hasn't performed all that well, and Russia has invested a lot in improving their military lately.

Basically, 190k Russian troops is not a slam dunk ""we will roll over you no matter what"" sort of numbers for the size of the operation and the size of the Ukranian army on paper. If Russia has improved so much it might be a cake walk, but if it hasn't much, or Ukraine has improved a lot as well, it might end up with a slogging fest that will end up with a few extra breakaway republics or expansion of Transnistria, Donbas, maybe a land bridge to Crimea once Russians start complaining about the thousands of body bags being flown back home.

At the same time it's a lot of pressure still because it is playing poker. Russia attempts to expand Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine trying to resist faces attacks on basically every front, without knowing exactly where the main thrust might come from - and probably deploying most of their forces at more important areas around Kharkhiv, Kiyev, Odessa etc. instead of the realistically provincial backwaters of the East. So the end goal might just be to expand Donetsk and Luhansk, with the wide deployment aimed more at spreading Ukraine too thin to effectively defend the main thrust and prevent all of Doentsk and Luhansk being taken from them.",1645569380.0,1645569142.0,t3_syzhbn,t1_hy0u5j1,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

I don’t understand any conservative that supports Putin and is okay with this whatsoever as defending our Allies is basically what America is all about. I think Trump’s recent interview about it was absolutely ridiculous while also being taken a little too literally.  Do I think Putin is genius in the way he’s going about this? Yes, he’s playing this very smart.  But he’s still insane thinking he’s gonna get away with it and the NATO countries must do what they can to  squash this before a major war breaks out.

To preface, I am admittedly not an expert in the Russian nuclear chain of command. However, it is not just Putin and Russian oligarchs who would be deciding to use nuclear weapons. 

Also, for clarity, let’s not call it deciding to use nuclear weapons, we can call it what it is— committing suicide. The Russians are not dumb, they understand completely that a decision to use nuclear weapons on any nation would result in the complete annihilation of Russia. (The world would be annihilated too, but we are only concerned with Russian interests here.)

Virtually, at every step along the line in the nuclear chain of command (and there are many steps and failsafes), each person would be, essentially, willingly making the decision to commit suicide. This means that even if an aging and scared Putin with a crumbling economy and political party decides to throw his life away, every military official at each nuclear site or submarine would have to also be choosing to throw their life away (as well as the lives of everyone they know and love) away. 

Moreover, even in 1983 when Soviet nuclear early warning systems incorrectly reported that the United States had fired 5 missiles, Stanislov Petrov, one Lt. Col in the Soviet Air Defense Force, was able to stop the Soviets from retaliating based on the bad information and averted nuclear war. One man disobeyed orders and stopped the entire chain. 

Putting it this way, I think it’s easy to see why threat of nuclear war breaking out is virtually nonexistent, even if I have gotten some of the details wrong and oversimplified and extremely complex issue.",False,1645592911.0,t3_syzhbn,t1_hy28tbj,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

>how smart is that?


Trump is saying that Putin knows what he’s doing. He didn’t just rush in and take the land. He “let” the people decide and is now pretending to be the defender in the situation. He know the deal, if you just tell the world, ”fuck it, we took the land, what are you going to do?” Not even China could defend them publicly. But instead Putin is creating defenses as he goes that are hard to verify.

>that’s the strongest peace keeping force

Trump likes to speak sarcastically. Sometimes you need to read between the lines. He’s saying what everyone else thinks too but in a different way. We know it’s not a peacekeeping force and they are there to either find a reason to justify invasion or simply the first wave. Either way trump is not advocating for a strong peacekeeping force, he is mocking it.

True conservatives need to take the stand up if the politicians, former President, and popular talking heads don’t actually represent them. But I haven’t seen that

Most conservatives are outnumbered on the right by trumpist. They essentially hijacked the Republican party and decided to have really weird values under the republican brand, moderates don't speak out against it because in order to win we need them. They divided the party. True conservatives are stuck between winning elections and political suicide going against trumpists It's again the loudest voices getting the recognition because this way we can win elections as a party. Conservatives don't like trumpists and if they do they aren't conservatives. 
Personally I wish they'd start their own party.

Boris Johnson said that he was committing troops to NATO allies as well, not to Ukraine. I can't find any information on that quote about defending Ukraine aside for his introduction of sanctions against Russia.

Also, if any of the NATO member states wanted to go to war with Russia, they'd be sendin a lot more than 800 troops, probably several orders of magnitude more. They'd also be doing it together, because any military action taken proactively by a state would exclude them from the treaty and leave them on their own.

These prohibitions will cut off the Russian government from a key avenue by which it raises capital to fund its priorities and will increase future financing costs. It denies Russia access to key U.S. markets and investors.

I could be wrong but this blocks US (West/EU?) from buying Russian bonds. Bonds are a major mechanism for raising government funds they don't have. Meaning they will have less capacity investments or spending. Again I could be wrong but governments use bonds for things like new bridges or funding the cost of a war and occupation. Without them governments are limited to spending what they earn through taxes. Which in turn can collapse their economy if they aren't able to pay existing debts.

This isn't stupid.  Russia has much less to lose economically than the West.  Putin's whole playbook has been to try and destabilize and distract the West to buy Russia more time.  Making Russia pay costs and denying impact to the West is basically handing Putin a guaranteed loss.

I agree. I heard them talking about this on Fox and was curious what they were referencing. Viewing it here, I see nothing wrong with either clips.

The first one with the spy, I interpreted that as a boss encouraging his subordinate whom he trusts and has faith in to speak forward and with confidence about his position and what he is saying. There was an awkward nervousness the spy had, perhaps because the scale if what they are discussing is pretty intense and historical, nerves can get to anybody and it us up to the leader, the boss, and if a good one also has the role of a mother.

I remember specifically how he saw the armistice of 1918 as a backstab for the German people and how he was nostalgic of the former German empire.

When France, Great-Britain and the US signed the treaty of Versailles, they thought that putting enough sanctions on Germany would prevent it from starting again. It had quite the opposite effect. German people wanted revenge.
