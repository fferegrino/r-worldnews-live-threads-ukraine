Day 110 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Most of the day was pretty quiet, with some occasional shelling in oblast, but as usual closer to midnight shelling gets worse and they start firing missiles. Today people counted 7 big explosions, most likely from missiles, as at the same time there were reports of missiles being launched from Belgorod again.

While this constant shelling that isn’t aimed to destroy military targets seems useless at a glance, it actually does serve a purpose, it’s psychological warfare. Recently we met 3 people on the streets that are so fed up with shelling that they won’t mind if Russia captures Kharkiv if it means that the shelling will stop.

It’s pretty scary knowing that the shelling actually works the way they intended it to work. I really don’t understand why people think that if Russia captures our city the shelling will stop, did they not see what a city occupied by Russia looks like? Of course these people are a minority, but the fact that some people think this way is horrible by itself, they would rather become a slave to Russia (or worse) than endure shelling.",False,1655173150.0,t3_vb3elh,t3_vb3elh,,0,90,0,90,3,0,{'gid_3': 1}

Russia has killed hundreds of civilians in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv using indiscriminate shelling and widely banned cluster munitions, according to new research by Amnesty International.  
  
Amnesty says it has found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using 9N210/9N235 cluster bombs, as well as ""scatterable"" munitions - rockets that eject smaller mines that explode later at timed intervals.  
  
The BBC visited five separate impact sites in residential neighbourhoods in Kharkiv and saw evidence of a distinctive, symmetrical spalling effect associated with cluster munitions.  
  
We showed images from the sites to three weapons experts, who all said the impacts were consistent with the controversial weapons.

This is a pretty wild story. Surely you know that Turkey has its Bayraktars - military drones that have earned their own song in Ukraine. Well ... it turned out that someone in the Czech Republic years ago thought that the Czech Republic should also have its own combat drones.

And the forum is that when the war came, they had them almost done, but without armycertification (they cannot be bought by the Czech Army). But we can buy them. Which Dalibor has already done, UA operators have already learned from them and now we want to deliver them against the Russians. And we want to deliver a lot of them.

So, ladies and gentlemen. This is the A25 Bivoj - a completely Czech drone - it will reach 200 km, it will last 4 hours in the air and it can deliver various gifts to Mr. Putin's horde.

River crossings will be among the most important determining factors in the course of the war in coming months, the UK’s defence ministry says.

The ministry said the Russia’s 90km key frontline in the Donbas lay to the west of the Siverskyi Donets River, which Russian forces have previously been unable to cross. Ukrainian officials said on Sunday that Russian troops had damaged the bridge over the river which linked Severodonetsk with its twin city of Lysychansk.

“To achieve success in the current operational phase of its Donbas offensive, Russia is either going to have to complete ambitious flanking actions, or conduct assault river crossings,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing.

“Ukrainian forces have often managed to demolish bridges before they withdraw, while Russia has struggled to put in place the complex coordination necessary to conduct successful, large scale river crossings under fire,” it added.

He said Russia is trying to ""create conditions under which they can freely enter the city with minimal effort"".

""This is achieved through massive shelling and aerial bombardment,"" Mr Striuk said.

""But so far they are not succeeding. Our armed forces manage to resist and maintain the line of defence.""

Asked how much of Severodonetsk remains in Ukrainian hands, Mr Striuk said the situation has ""not changed in the last three days"".

""In fact, just over a third of the city is under Ukrainian control, and just under two-thirds is under Russian control.""

BBC News  
  
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged the West to send his country modern missile defence systems.  
  
As Russia continues its assault with tanks and artillery in the east, it is also carrying out air strikes in support of its troops on the ground and against other targets.  
  
Missiles continue to hit Ukraine too. Yesterday video was released of four Kalibr cruise missiles launching from a Russian ship in the Black Sea.

&#x200B;

Last night President Zelensky said Moscow had launched 2,606 missiles since the strart of the war.  
  
Modern missiles would be more effective against aircraft and cruise missiles.  
  
Ukraine does have a potent air defence system in the shape of S-300 long-range surface-to-air units and shorter-range Buk-M1 SAMs, amongst others. But these are ageing Soviet-era systems and Russia has been successful in destroying some of these in strikes.  
  
The US has supplied Stinger, shoulder-launched Manpads (Man-portable air defence systems) and the UK Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles.  
  
Denmark has sent advanced Harpoon anti-ship missiles to complement Ukraine’s domestic Neptune systems, to defend the Black Sea coast.

&#x200B;

But Ukraine really wants to beef up its land-based air defences.  
  
One option might be Nasams fitted with AIM-120 AMRAAM (advanced medium range air-to-air missiles). Developer Raytheon says it gives air defenders ""a tailorable, state-of-the-art defence system"".  
  
But whether these will be sent is far from clear. Germany has pledged to supply the advanced IRIS-T SL missile system, but this could take many months to arrive in Ukraine.",False,1655127998.0,t3_vb3elh,t3_vb3elh,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

 https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/roundup-of-us-weapons-for-ukraine.html
 here's the earliest reference i could find of m777s being announced. It also states training was already in progress. Less than 3 days later they announced over half of them were already in ukraine. 

Unless you have an earlier announcement, this fits what I remember. Pictures are not a good measure of when they are there. They keep western weapons secret because they are big targets. We've seen like 1 switchblade and they've been there for months.

https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/25/ukraine-weaponry-russia-war-00027406

Ceasars were announced april 22nd, along with the statement ua forces were already in training. They were announced as delivered the same week. 

Obviously there aren't going to be photos of them for your convenience, but france, USA, Norway and others have announced deliveries of equipment already in action that were never announced publicly. And idk why the fuck they would just straight up give Russia 4 weeks heads up like you think they have, because that seems dumb. I think they basically are announcing things as they are ready to go. 

Basically I imagine it like this. Biden/USA says look we've got a bunch of xyz for you. Send us 40-80 guys. We will get them trained and have them delivered in 2 weeks. Until then, keep publicly asking us for these things. That way when we announce it, we have support at home and it comes as a surprise when they are already there.

Which is why I think if you see an announcement for reapers or other uaps or f-16s in the next few months, it's because there's already people in training they just wait until they are ready and basically there to announce. Obviously timelines might not ever be concretely known, or at least until after the war... but that looks like what's happening to me. 

Unless you can prove that that my dates are wrong here, but seems like at least some m777s were in ukraine by the time they were announced. Or they hauled a shitload of them in 3 days.

EDIT someone found april 13 as first announcement, with the second large batch announced april 22nd. Which is three weeks from first announcement of a handful until [this stating on May 5th they are already in service, with first footage on telegram on the 9th](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/m777_howitzers_with_rocket_assisted_projectiles_in_ukraine_taking_revenge_on_bucha_massacre_along_with_irpin_and_boyarka_photo-2811.html)

Which confirms what I stated that HIMARS could be in operation already without us knowing. And that whatever is announced to the public means it's already done or at least in progress. So again, if the states planned on giving things like advanced drones or aircraft, by the time we hear about it the wheels would have been long in motion. Heck wouldn't surprise me if there are some UA pilots practicing on f16s since april. But since that training takes longer we wouldn't hear about for a while.",1655098408.0,1655092993.0,t3_vb3elh,t3_vb3elh,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

> Sumy, Cherninhiv  – Shelling, but no risk of a direct attack. 2 Russians BTGs that only endanger themselves, and location around within 500m.

> Kharkiv: Russians brought reserves, and started advances in North and East. Regular artillery started reaching Kharkiv, attacks already 5-6 days. Captured village 15km from Stariy Saltiv, and some other, that were not well defended. This attack is still done in order to keep Ukraine from relocating forces to Izium and lower.

> Izium: Russia restarted attempts to create large pocket, put significant effort in direction to Sloviansk/Barvinkove/Sviatohirsk. Russian forces consist of 20 BTG, many with experience near Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, however they have similar probability to capture Sloviansk, as Sievierodonetsk, that can’t be captured for 60 days already.

> Lyman: Russians trying to cross river Siversky Donets, movements in direction to Siversk, Zakitne, Kryva Luka. All possible crossing points known, Ukrainian M777’s are ready.

> Sievierodonetsk – announced Russian control of 70%, however those control numbers last for couple of hours, as there are active manoeuvre battles. Russians retracted main forces, only keeping mobilised units, and using artillery. Ukraine did repel attacks on Metolkine (E) and Borivske (SE), Toshkivka (SE) today, situation being controlled. Russians trying to create small pocket near Komyshuvakha-Hirske-Toshkivka. Near Berestove, Russians again trying to cut off road Bakhmut-Lysychansk
Bakhmut – shelling.

> All those changes look scary on map, but will be long, boring and unsuccessful. Most units are consisting of reserves and conscripts, less than 50% of total capacity. Their battle-skills are lower than baseboard, and can be seen near Sievierodonetsk. If Ukraine had enough artillery, this would be solved in a week.

> Huliaipole – Russians were preparing for attack, but Ukraine did counter-attack.

> Vasylivka – unconfirmed information, that Russian forces were split, Kadyrovites sent to Sievierodonetsk area, Buryats to Kherson (as Kadyrovites did couple of artillery attacks on Buryats).

> Kherson: tactical movements, counter-attack actions. Ukraine pushed back from 15km to 18km from Kherson city. No significant changes.

> Partisans: Creative posters in Kherson, couple of Russian military lost in Zaporozhye district, ammo depot in Velykyi Burluk blown up.

Ukraine doesn’t have enough weapons yet, to recapture Kherson. After Bucha massacres, Russians were scared of reaction, almost become ready for dialogue. Now they see, that there was no significant reaction, few sanctions, and not much weapons deliveries. Annexing Kherson is not out of the question. In Kherson 23 out of 250k current inhabitants went to receive Russian passports, which shows perspective of referendum. However, Russia has achieved dialogue with the West, and that means compromises
The West thinks, that speed up of 🇪🇺-integration of Ukarine, sanctions and peace would keep off Putin’s aggression. Only direct defeat, will stop Putin, if he physically is unable to attack. If Putin is still in dialogue after all possible crimes, and announcing, that he is doing war against the West, he thinks West is weak, and he should keep doing the same.

A ship carrying 18,000 tons of Ukrainian corn arrived early Monday at a port in northwestern Spain, using what a regional animal feed producers group described as a “new maritime route” that aims to avoid Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea.

The cargo ship Alppila, carrying the corn, arrived at Spain’s port of A Coruña before dawn on Monday and is due to be unloaded by Tuesday, the port’s press office told CNN.

It’s the first shipment of Ukrainian grain to reach northwestern Spain by sea, using “a new maritime route opened in the Baltic Sea to avoid the Russian navy’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea since the start of the war” last February, the animal feed producers group, called Agafac, said in a statement.

Some background: Russia's war in Ukraine could push up to 49 million people into famine or famine-like conditions because of its devastating impact on global food supply and prices, and countries are scrambling to find a way around the blockade. On Sunday, a Ukrainian government official told Reuters Ukraine has identified alternate routes to export grain stores. 

Deputy Foreign Minister and Chief Digital Transformation Officer Dmytro Senik said Ukraine was attempting to establish new routes with Romania, Poland and the Baltic States to allow 22 million tons of grain stuck in Ukraine’s seaports to “reach their destination.” It’s just a small amount of corn but it recovers the possibility to import whatever’s possible from Ukraine,” Agafac director Bruno Beade told CNN by phone.
He said Agafac, the Galicia regional animal feed producers group, typically imports 40% of its corn from Ukraine between January and June each year, which is part of the total 1 million tons of corn it imports for livestock feed annually.

The Agafac statement said that “small quantities of corn have left western Ukraine in trucks for Poland and Romania” and that the corn which arrived in Spain was loaded onto a ship at Poland’s Baltic Sea port of Swinoujscie.

The Alppila is a Finnish-flagged cargo ship that was in Swinoujscie in late May before making stops at two German ports and then arriving at A Coruña port on Monday, according to vesselfinder.com.

Beade said he didn’t know if Ukrainian corn had arrived at any other Spanish ports since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in late February.",False,1655117961.0,t3_vb3elh,t3_vb3elh,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

Sweden has taken important steps to meet Turkey’s demands for approving Stockholm’s NATO membership application, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

“I welcome that Sweden has already started to change its counter-terrorism legislation and that Sweden will ensure that the legal framework for arms export will reflect the future status as a NATO member with new commitments to allies,” Stoltenberg said during a press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson during a visit to the Nordic country.

“These are two important steps to address concerns that Turkey has raised.”

300 MLRS would effectively end the war in the week it arrives.

Say 150 M270 thats 12 missiles per salvo, 150 HIMARS thats 6 missiles per salvo. One combined volley would mean: 2700 dead targets moments later.

M30/M31 have <5m precision at 70km and are have active homing and seeking. 

I mean US MLRS is vastly superior to Russian ones. Its the reason US thinks 1500 are enough for world stage. UK has >45 to cover pretty much their territorial defence and their expeditionary forces.

3-4 salvos and there would be no more Russian utilisable assets in Ukraine. 4 HIMARS would turn the tide of eastern theatre. 100 would be more than enough.

To add 1000 howitzers on top of that is insane,  500 tanks is my guessing after war arsenal. UA has under-utilised their tanks and have pretty much most of their stock. They had more than they need from their own stock and on top of that they got 250+ T72s and 80+ T72s from Poland and Czech Republic I think they are fine tank wise only reason I think Ukraine might need 500 western tanks is if Russia mobilises.

They announce this stuff well in advance for transparency, for political points and so that Russia can't use it for propaganda that the US or anyone else is deploying secret weapons. It's as simple as that.

There's been no deliveries of weapons, especially not any complex high tech systems that were just sent and announced only when they were at the frontline.

Plenty of people were spreading bullshit about HIMARS and M270s already being in Ukraine over a month ago, claiming exactly what you're saying that they'd keep it a secret. Well that turned out to be total bullshit, even though it was pretty obvious before the official confirmation of HIMARS being sent even came.

Remember that while Russia's forces are degraded and below par on a lot of levels, most of NATO is weakly armed, and the alliance is a lot more shaky than it used to be.

NATO has four serious military pillars: America, Turkey, France and the UK. Each face significant domestic problems that undermine the certainty that other NATO members can have that they will stick around. It is also not at all clear that sanctions will continue or grown in the future, which is critical to blunting Russia's military capacity.

While Ukraine has mounted a heroic and impressive defence, the country remains devastated by Russia's attacks and the truth is that Ukraine at the start of the war had a much more impressive army than most NATO members.

Aside from that, Russia has a lot more on its frontiers than Europe. It's hunger to re-subjugate former colonies might well redirect its energies to central Asia or the caucuses.

Keep in mind, too, that Putin looks like he's following the Bismark model (albeit with much less competence), of using foreign wars to force support for domestic authoritarian reforms. The pattern normally starts with small wars and builds to larger ones over time. The Ukraine invasion does not reflect what Russia is fully capable of, and is not a full mobilization of the army and economy.

4. USDD (Tron / DAO) is kinda-sorta losing its peg.

Each one causes a loss in confidence, causing people to panic and sell off more bitcoin. Of course, they **cant** sell bitcoin, which then scares them even more.

russia is unlikely to be able to mount any further offensives after this battle.  On the other hand, Ukraine fully mobilized back in February and the first batch of men are entering the battlefield.  We're seeing limited counteroffensives in the south near Kherson (southern front), and the russians have been driven back nearly to the border around Kharkiv (northern front).  Consider the Kherson counterattack a shaping operation which should turn into a proper counter attack sometime in late June to mid July.

As more of Ukraine's draftees come on-line this month and next and more heavy weapons from the west arrive (HIMARS rocket systems in early July), things do not look promising for the war-weary russians who are unable to mobilize further beyond conscripting men in the occupied areas of Ukraine and that resource is pretty exhausted.

It's going to be a long slow war, but russia has expended enough men and resources that there exists a very real possibility of a sudden collapse as we saw in Kyiv.

a3a98640366ef3668b99210337b694e1,vb3elh,ic8kb66,"> So good news

There is actually some good news here in terms of european rearmament and what you can get for your money. 

The US Army, and it's equipment, is cheap compared to the rest of the American military. Most of the money goes to the Navy, Airforce, nukes, etc. Stuff that's important if you're going to project power across the world and fight another superpower on their home turf. 

But a conventional land army comparable to what Ukraine is asking for, ie what you'd need to fight the Russian army, is much more affordable. 

1000 Abrams tanks is somewhere in the neighborhood of 9 billion dollars. Leopard 2s are a bit cheaper but still in the same neighborhood. That's less than one of the US's 11 aircraft carriers and would provide a solid counter to Russia's tank fleet. Yes Russia has a lot more than a 1000 tanks, but there's a reason the modern T-72 variants are about a 1/3 the price of Abrams and 2/3 the weight.

For artillery, 1000 M777s, which are honestly over engineered and overpriced for towed artillery unless you need it to be liftable by helicopter, would be ~$700 millionusd. 

500 of the French CAESAR SPGs, $3.75 billion.  

Europe could spend a lot less than the US and still have a land force of equal or greater capability. And honestly that's what I'd like to see Germany do; become the armored heart of europe.",False,1655147494.0,t3_vb3elh,t1_ic6r6dg,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

A conventional war between the United States and Russia wouldn't be fought this way; the Russian artillery wouldn't be destroyed by American artillery in the kind of long range duels we're seeing in Ukraine. The Russian artillery would be destroyed by air strikes, which is why America doesn't feel the need for a larger artillery capability. If NATO air power were to enter the war then this would not be anything like a close run thing.

The problem is that since this is a proxy war, the West has one hand tied behind its back.

Ukraine got more tanks by capturing abandoned Russian ones. Abandoned tanks don't make a new tank unit. In order to be useful for the war effort Ukraine needs a homogenous tank force with trained people, mechanics and supplies. So both ""Ukraine has more tanks now than they had before the invasion"" and ""Ukraine needs more tanks"" can be true. Ukraine can't press into service a motley collection of 300 mixed T-72s, T-80s and T-90s when their main battle tank is based on the T-64 because that's what they had local production lines for.

Same with the losses. Russia can have between 15 and 30k dead and they can still put up offensive action in a very limited area of Eastern Ukraine. Such losses are crippling because Russia has a very limited pool of professional soldiers, but with enough press ganged recruits from local Donbas militias they can make some gains.

We have also heard that ""counter offensives may start in June, July"".

You talk as if Ukraine is fighting a WW1 style war.

Go here: [https://www.calcmaps.com/map-radius/](https://www.calcmaps.com/map-radius/) put single MLRS battery in UA held Slavyansk and put in 70km radius and see how much territory this covers. HIMARS is extremely mobile, takes < 20min to reload and has sub 5m precision at 70km with active seeking and homing on M30/M31 rockets.

1 battery that is 4 HIMARS trucks in Slavyansk without moving covers 140km range with extreme precision they only need to advance 50km to cover the edges but with 50km advance you cover additional 150km of tertitory. That 1 battery coverage, 4 HIMARS each dispatching 6 rockets with absurdly high precision. Thats 24 targets destroyed with extreme comfort. Pull it back 30km to be extremely outside Russian artillery range and you are still covering 110km of the frontline.

2 - 3 batteries would pretty much suppress the frontline and more and you would be able to negate any artillery or armour use by the enemy.

300 US style MLRS systems for this kind of teatere is insanity.  250km is nothing especially when you are not fighting along the entire 250km frontline.

There is a range of higher tech weapon systems that use at least some foreign parts like infrared sensing equipment and precision weapons like cruise missiles that will be almost impossible for them to replace with domestic alternatives. Even for very basic things like tooling for industry they imported a lot from western countries. I am sure some of it can be replaced with their own production but how much?

Sure there will be a lot of things they can still manufacture and they've probably got good stores of a lot of stuff for now but at some point there will be a wide range of equipment their defense industry simply won't be able to make or repair.

Thinking about it maybe that's why Putin hasn't bothered to fully mobilize and draft enough Russians to simply overwhelm Ukraine with numbers, maybe he knows that a full war effort really can't extend beyond a certain point by which having a bunch of new soldiers will be irrelevant because the Russian army will start to suffer critical shortages. That might be why Putin has this current focus on taking as much of the Donbass as possible at no matter the cost for how little ground gained. So he'll grab as much territory as he can in the next few months then turn around and try and get a ceasefire, I wonder what will happen if by that point Ukraine has more men trained and equipped and they simply refuse and start counter attacking.

I don't want to engage in wishful thinking, there is no guarantee Putin doesn't start full mobilization tomorrow, but I just don't get how Russia is going to continue this war losing as many men and using as much war material as they are when it doesn't look like they are making plans to replace the men and will at some point run out of maybe entire classes of certain weapons and capabilities.

US built 1000 M270 and around 400 HIMARS for the entire world theatre. UK has around 50 for both domestic and their expeditionary forces. You wont be using US style MLRS to fight infantry but mechanised, armoured assets, logistics and supply/service stations. 

4 HIMARS in Slavyansk puts out of commission a wide array of Russian conventional and rocket artillery its pretty much just the matter of how fast you can reload.

Thats pretty much 24 guaranteed targets destroyed per 20min if you are out of their range and don't need to reposition. Russia has nothing to answer to this their artillery both conventional and rocket is not precise they use it for suppression not precision effect fire.

4 HIMARS with a counter battery radar 30km out of Slavyansk deploy them in 20km dispersion and you cover 200km easily. Thats comfortably outside Russian range unless they attempt suicide airstrikes. I think you overestimate Russian imprecise artillery, conflate frontline with actual field deployment and line of contact and vastly underestimate the M30/M31 missile and the M999 launcher platform.

We have seen HIMARS in Iraq and Afganistan against small mobile targets. 4 HIMARS them selves wont change the battlefield much since infantry is the frontline mover. But in combination with M777, AT and mechanised infantry its more than enough to hold and push back.

On top of that thats well within Russian strike range even with the imprecise MLRS and the bad part is you need to deploy, reload it on the spot. Even if you are extremely precise you have at best 2-3 shots before you need to bail out.

CESAR can reach 48 and 52km range with extended range shells with lower payload or rocket assisted one.

MLRS on the other hand has seconds of deploy time, can fire entire salvo at the same time thats 6 rockets for HIMARS and 12 for M270 at the same time and each is almost guaranteed to hit its target with a larger payload.

Again, we're a collection of the richest countries in the world. Why are our collective economies so fragile that we can't afford to stop funding a low-strength (economically) tyrant?

What's the point of all our economic ""prosperous, stable"" economy if it's built on a house of cards? I'm of the opinion that its fragility means it's neither.

Europe fucked up by tying itself to Russia. Now it's funding their war machine. A ""cushioned fall"" or a ""soft landing"" is paid for in Ukrainian blood.

And Ukraine will benefit most from military force projection. So maybe while Europe is fucking around with higher energy prices (like the rest of us saps who've had to deal with rising energy costs for years), they could make up for it by actually sending through modern equipment in significant numbers.

But I'm sure that'll be justified away, too. It's just awfully convenient that Europe has so many reasons for funding Russia and not supporting Ukraine in full, that at some point you have to start asking how genuine the support for Ukraine really is.

Poland and the US (and other countries) seem to understand what's going on and what's needed. Even Finland and Sweden are getting it (and Switzerland's history of neutrality is wavering). But a lot of Europe seems to be content simply wringing their hands and creating excuses.
