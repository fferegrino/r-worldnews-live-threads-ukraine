I will say that I think the speech was two speeches - one for domestic and one for foreign audiences. For foreign audiences, he recalled every grievance Russia has had against the West since the Austro-Hungarian Empire - I'm not kidding. This will anti-liberal people in the West something to think they're clever for repeating, and is an effort to further polarise and weaken unity in the West.

For domestic audiences, he announced a raft of social programmes (from additional cash for veterans to economic stimulus) and large state interventions that may be positive in times of crisis (think of COVID stimulus in the US and Europe) but which are only necessary because of the economic downsides of Putin's war. The benefits of a lot of what he mentioned won't materialise, if they ever do, for 10+ years.

I work in policy and a lot of the policies Putin set out are only half-baked aspirations. ""Infrastructure for towns and villages, we will look into this."" ""We are looking very hard into tax incentives for businesses."" These aren't policies, these are statements that beg the question: why haven't you already thought about these? You've had 12 months to process the effects of this war.

These are not a prescription for Russia's future.

Poland only came off the map as a prize to be fought for in 1999, when it joined NATO, and, five years later, the European Union. Those decisions stabilized Central Europe.  
>  
>Now, here we are with Ukraine. The similarities are bracing. Both the national anthems of Poland and Ukraine begin with the same line, that their nation “has not perished yet.” The Ukrainian question is shaping the Europe of the 21st century for the same reason the Polish one did: Its position in Europe, its future as a nation that desires freedom against the violent wishes of a tyrant next door, is at its heart what this conflict is about. The outcome, as the Polish experience shows, isn’t by any means certain.

>What’s Putin’s problem with Ukraine? It’s not NATO as such. The Kremlin shrugged when Finland — of Cold War-era Finlandization! — decided last year to join the alliance. It has little to do with Ukraine’s efforts to sign trading arrangements with the European Union that Putin forced a corrupt Ukrainian president in 2013 to tear up, sparking the protests on the Maidan. In reality, Ukraine’s outreach to NATO and the EU is just a manifestation of something far more unacceptable to an authoritarian Russia: That a democratic Ukraine would naturally seek alliances with other European democracies. Or really, since views on NATO were sharply split in Ukraine until last year’s invasion, that a democratic Ukraine could never be an ally or a vassal of an authoritarian Russia. The problem, at its heart, is Ukrainian democracy — and genuine independence.  
>  
>Free Ukraine is a rebuff to Putin’s repeated denial of its existence, as a country or people separate from Russia. But its existence presents an existential threat to a Russia ruled by a single man that sees itself as an empire. Regime survival is the top priority for any autocrat. If people who are such close cousins of Russians build a vibrant democracy that regularly chucks out leaders, someone like Putin rightly fears contagion. An independent Ukraine sets back Russia’s ambitions for control over this region.

Not really all that interesting. Feel like 2 hours of my life was wasted, but still. Here it is.

**Background**

* The west has a history of colonialism, dictatorship, imperialism.
* Russia tried dialogue but the west continued to surround Russia with missile systems
* Putin's fantastical justifications for the military operations going all the way back to 2014, to protect people against Ukrainians and the West.
* Making it clear that *they* the west started the war, and Putin is trying to stop it.

**Complaining about Ukraine**

* The West has paid 150b dollars to support Ukraine, but neglect the poor countries (only paying 60b, and forcing them to submit to western will)
* 900,000 dead and millions of refugees from wars started by the west
* Just as the west rebuilt nazi Germany, they are trying to do the same in Ukraine, separating the country from ties to Russia
* The Ukrainians aren't even hiding that they get their imagery and insignias from Nazi Germany, use even image of Satan himself as a weapon against Russia
* Ukrainians have become hostages of their western masters, who rob and destroy their country, which is why moved in Donbas
* the West uses Ukrainians as cannon fodder

**Reaction**

* the existence of Russia is threatened by all this, targeting our young generation, lying, twisting history, information war against Russia
* west is destroying family values, abusing children, pedophilia announced as a normal thing in the west (lolwtf), while Russia doesn't enter private lives of people
* Anglican church considering gender neutral God
* western elites leading those nations to spiritual destruction, we must protest russian children from degradation
* Russia will continue social program, bring back factories and economics, create a new highway to Crimea; all regions of Russia providing direct support to these new regions, do everything to bring land back to peace and order
* Minute of silence for everyone who died in the action (lasted 6 seconds)

**Putin's Proposals**

* Russia has a duty to support everyone who has been negatively impacted by the war, need to respond to their needs quickly
* Putin proposes to create a special fund for families and people who died or were affected: medical, psychological support, education, entrepreneurship, veteran support, etc., and to bypass bureacracy to make this happen
* Putin admits there are certain issues getting this help to those who need it and that these must and will be resolved

**Military Force for 2023-2025**

* There is an approved plan, this is of extreme importance
* The readiness of the nuclear force is 91%, but must make this level of readiness for all areas of the military
* Officers need to be trained and taught, and Russia needs to value their contribution
* Continue implementing the latest technologies to improve the quality - the tech is already there, but Russia must take this to mass production by mobilising more elements of the economy; everything needs to be done for the victory
* Putin proposes more protections for employees, and more securities for affordable housing, especially in cities which are important for weapons and engineering production

**Back to bitching about the West**

* The West has not acheived success in any of these areas. They are punishing themselves by sanctions: increased prices, collapsed energy sector, businesses failing.
* The West's objective is to force Russian citizens to suffer, destabilise society from within, but they are not successful.
* But Russia made it through despite it all this, thanks to the hard work of everyone in Russia. No printing money - everything done by simple market tactics.
* The West was forecasting total collapse, 20% GDP increase - all those predictions have failed; Russian economy stays strong, while the West continues to lose its status

**Russia's Internal Plan & How to Do It**

* Russia has everything it needs to continue to develop its economy; talking about how much housing and agricultural increase has happened
* The situation has changed for the better regarding the sustained development of Russia, despite any external threat: this isn't just a time of challenges, but also of opportunities

**""A little philosophical aside"" from the grandfather**

* Everyone remembers the chaos from the 90s. Russia made an economy based on Western market values. It's not enough to just copy the models though.
* Europeans/Americans arguing about how Russia should develop. As a result, Russian economy became Western-oriented. Russian business was aimed at extracting quick profit. Money not invested into long-term projects.
* Russia needed years and massive state investment to break this. In all of this, cheap money supply, and technology came from the west, and so capital flowed there. Instead of stimulating economy in Russia, the capital was spent on luxury estates and yachts in the West.
* The rich elite of Russia had their children and luxury in the west. Now they see that they got robbed, assets siezed. No Russians were sorry about those rich elites who lost money, palaces, yachts in the west.
* Putin appeals to these rich elite to come back and invest in Russia.

**Sounds like Concluding Thoughts? (Nope, just rambling)**

* Russia must rely on and protect its own civilization, to be compassionate and support anyone who is in trouble. We helped Europe during Covid, now with the earthquakes in Turkey.
* Regional elections and the presidential election in 2024 will be according to the law.
* More fluff about investment into art, culture, and education in the new regions and in Russia.
* Belarus and Donbas needs to be at the forefront of Modern Russia.
* Higher Education needs to be improved and updated. Important to raise the prestige of teachers as they are very important to education.
* Support for families must be increased and improved. Minimum wage, disposable income must increase. Tax reduction for children's education.
* Need visible improvements for increase in healthcare, especially in remote areas.

**Back to NATO**

* NATO is really bad, broke trust, blah blah blah
* The US is reviewing the history and trying to change the way world security works, only to destroy the system of security; since collapse of USSR, the US is trying to be the centre of power in the world; the US does this only according to their own needs
* NATO offering an ultimatum to Russia: ""you have to comply"". They want to inflict a  strategic defeat on Russia. Thus, a halt on the agreement of control of strategic weapons until Russia knows what the US, France, UK plans to do.
* West's nuclear weapons are expiring, they have new weapons and will test them.
* Russia will not strike first, but there should be no illusions that this parity will be destroyed.
* Unity has helped Russia survive so far, many volunteered at conscription centres. All are fighting for truth and the Motherland.",False,1676976941.0,t3_11803x6,t3_11803x6,,0,217,0,217,0,0,

Biden says one year ago Russia's President Putin ""unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine"". “One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv. Well I’ve just come from Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong,"" he says. Biden goes on to highlight how it is almost one year since the Russianinvasion of Ukraine, but makes it clear ""we stood up for democracy. I**f Russia stopped invading Ukraine it would stop the war, but if Ukraine stopped defending itself it would mean the end of Ukraine, he says.**

Biden now lists how the EU has stepped up with unprecedented commitmentto Ukraine - not just in security assistance but economic andhumanitarian assistance. He says: ""I'm serious, take a look around and look at one another, look at what you've done so far, Poland is hosting 1.5 million refugees sofar, God bless you."" Biden paints a picture of his own land - where people ""stand forfreedom"". **He says Democrats and Republicans alike have got behind the Ukrainian cause**.""

Putin justified his attack on Ukraine by accusing America of taking over. In addition, a woman in the crowd was wearing a blazer with the Z symbol on the right arm, which is no different from the Nazi symbol and is aimed to unite the people around a single ideology.

Putin reiterated that the longer the west continues to act in Ukraine, the longer they will be forced to avert danger approaching their borders. He added that Russia will logically respond to this. Putin emphasized that Russia is speaking about the existence of their country, which he claims is under threat.

During the speech, Putin also made an alarming comment suggesting that it's normal for people to be pedophiles in their countries, stating that ""It's their way of life."" Putin brought in religious quotes to unite his people with religion.

The explosions occurred after curfew, so the citizens’ ability to go physically confirm what they heard—see where landed and what if anything was destroyed—is not possible.

On the day that Russian President Vladimir Putin blames the West for the war in Ukraine and suspends a nuclear treaty with the United States, the Chinese Foreign Ministry launches a brutal attack on the United States.

In a document prepared by the ministry, the US is frankly called unreliable and reckless. There is criticism, among other things, of the abuse of military power by the United States and the destabilization of the financial order. ""The fact that this is now being published at a time of high tension is really telling,"" says political scientist and China expert Jonathan Holslag of the Free University in Brussels. 'blame list'

""This document is unprecedented. The Chinese accuse the US of hegemony, interference and military abuse of power."" With that high voltage, Holslag refers to the war in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that there are indications that China would supply arms to Russia and thus clearly take sides.

What strikes Holslag especially about the Chinese attack is that there is not one point that stands out. ""It's just a whole list of accusations. They accuse the US of absolute recklessness."" He speaks of a ""foot-forward diplomatic attack"" in a way he hasn't seen in a long time.

Cold War

China also published a document on security and, like Russian President Putin earlier today in his State of the Union address, presents itself as an attractive partner and alternative to the US. According to Holslag, the Chinese want to show that they are a much more reliable partner than the US.

A message that the Russian leader also sounded. ""Putin tried to say in his speech that Russia is a good partner, a reasonable and benevolent country. He mentioned that Russia immediately came to the rescue in the event of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,"" says Niels Drost, Russia expert at the Clingendael Institute.

Holslag thinks that China is really looking for a new world order. It will be difficult for the European countries to set a course now, thinks Holslag. ""If this means that the Chinese assume that the Cold War has started, then that is very worrying. It will then be difficult for Europe to trade and hold talks, for example."" Russia and China

According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon visit Moscow. It could indicate that the two countries will continue to strengthen ties. Russia and China desperately need each other, says Holslag. ""Despite occasional resentment, Beijing sees Russia as an indispensable partner.""

Supplying weapons to Russia will be a step too far, thinks Holslag. “That means they will forfeit what little credit they have left in Europe and then Europe will side with the US.”

So Russia pretty much had to make a move this winter. They have precious little to show for it despite almost 50,000 troops KIA since Christmas. I believe Ukraine also wanted to make more of a move to liberate Kremmina and Svatove, but most of the effort had been bleeding the Russian advance.

A tiny drone can move extremely fast. Some tiny drones can do 80mph for short distances so you lose a bit of speed and attach an explosive to it. Drop them out of a plane and they go as a group to an area (this is what the US has released footage of). Once they get to an area they look for any movement and fly to it and explode.

The west quickly and rather vocally reasserted their group support for Ukraine and called out China basically saying don't even think of it without treating Ukraine properly in any peace process. I believe someone mentioned all Russian troops being withdrawn must be part of it.  

It's nice to see other countries being so blunt about what is required for there to be any true peace.  

Even reporters were sceptical of China's peace plan.  

China may cause some problems with southern nations though if the west needs more votes in the UN. Western leaders and a diplomat from a southern nation have said recently that China has a lot of influence in those nations through their Belt and Road scheme.  

Money is very tight. Climate change is causing them problems. Grain and fertiliser prices are high. A diplomat mentioned one southern country is having to subsidise very expensive fertiliser for their farming sector which is putting a great strain on their already strained finances in a difficult global economy.  

Western leaders said that they didn't initially do a great job in diplomacy bringing the southern nations up to speed on why the grain and fertiliser situation is the way it is, namely Russia destroying crops in Ukraine and the shortage of fossil fuels which effects the manufacturing of fertiliser.  

This puts the southern nations in a very difficult position. A diplomat said they don't want to basically sell themselves to China but if China is the only one currently willing to invest in their countries then they have no choice as they just don't have the money to cope without foreign investments. They really do want to work with the west, but the investments and money from the west has dried up in the current climate and interest rates have gone up. That leaves them having to work with China by default most of the time as China is the only one willing to invest at that scale. The diplomat was really blunt about this.  

The American government has also said that China may provide munitions to Russia. Needless to say the American government has been rather vocal about this.  

That's basically all I know.  

I can only recommend you check out your preferred reputable news media to see what the western leaders have said just recently on the subject of China and the southern nations.  

The western leaders were very candid about their diplomatic failings regarding the southern nations. They basically said they took the south for granted.

I've seen a lot of people speculating that the offensive is already underway, but if you follow more official/journalistic sources, they suggest these are most likely probing attacks/attempts to draw out Ukrainian reserves so they have less to plug the holes in the line when the major offensive does come. Given the general state of the Russian military, I wouldn't be surprised if they fail to make any significant gains, but thinking conservatively and without getting my hopes up, I think the Russians have more to come.

There's also been talk of Russia moving like 80% of its air-force within striking distance of Ukraine. This would heavily suggest they are planning a major aerial attack which is something that have avoided thus-far as they have been very careful with their use of aviation. This would probably be a massive attack conducted in the span of a single day. 

At any rate, they only have a few days left to conduct an effective offense, so we should know the true state of this ""major offensive"" by the time the weekend hits.

What you're watching is the logistics of the NATO forces unfold.  The first hurdle was that no one anticipated the utter stupidity of the Russian forces early in the conflict.  NATO had bet on a long drawn out insurgency and sent the weapons for that (guns, ammo, small arms, ATGM's...).  But it turned out the Russian military was a paper tiger with no real training or equipment.  It then took time to stop sending small arms and to ramp up the sending of artillery support and anti-air systems.  That was phase II for months 3-9.  That turned the tide further.  What you're now witnessing in months 12-18 will be the creation of and training for a modern military with modern equipment.  Ukrainian forces needed to be trained on tanks, planes, and missile systems.  So they've started making the transition between smaller vehicles to heavy vehicles as they know their logistics can support the former and current simultaneously.

There are only two mindsets that Putin could reasonably have in my mind.  The first is that he believes he can win, he just needs to outlast the West.  A gradual trickle of weapons helps this mindset.  It means in his mind that if he just commits a few more tanks, men, planes, bombs, and months that he might win out agains the Ukranians.  This is almost a tit for tat situation, where he slowly mobilizes more of the russian population and economy to fight the increasingly well armed ukranians.

The second mindset he could have is the one that I think is more likely.  Hes an old narcicist who drank his own coolaide.  Russia is being denied the global power it should rightfully have, and he will take it by force if need be.  He will ractchet up the fascism as high as it will go, and he will fight the glorias war to make Russia the Soviet Union Again.

Over time, major differences in development appeared, and the “second world” helmed by Russia gradually drifted apart- most of the countries under their umbrella fell into the low-development category and gradually started to look more like the non-aligned and underdeveloped states.  The term “third world” then took on its current meaning that represents what we’d call Less Developed Countries (LDCs).

You don’t hear the term “second world” very much any more because Russia never really managed to gain hegemonic power outside the USSR’s direct region of influence, but that’s what he’s saying- surely Putin must sound like a tinpot *second-world* dictator, since he’s the president of Russia and all…but really there is no second world with Russia at its head.",False,1676986347.0,t3_11803x6,t1_j9extq0,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

Both nations started from a similar basis-a post-Soviet army and stockpile inherited from the Soviet Union. Both nations engaged in programs of military reform, recognizing weaknesses revealed by confrontation with military challenges. Obviously, the Ukrainians were, rightly, terrified at the lame performance (or non-performance) of their armed forces - but the Russians had worries as well. 

The essential difference was this: Ukraine, with considerable help from the West, engaged in a root and branch reform, which heavily emphasized certain military fundamentals (sweeping supply chains of corruption to the extent possible, creating a professional NCO corps, training in combined arms tactics, small unit leadership, etc.). Russia, in contrast, focused on flashy weapons systems prototypes. Russian reform was highly visible and impressed foreign observers; it was designed to. Ukrainian reform wasn’t remarked on as much. 

What I think happened, is that Russia began to believe their own propaganda about their military reforms. After all, they had handily invaded Crimea in 2014, so why could they not completely defeat Ukraine in 2022, given how much better Russian forces were after reform? 

They failed to accurately take into account the impact of Ukrainian reforms. 

As a military plan against a formidable foe, the initial Russian plan made no sense - it wasted Russian strength by indulging in a multiplicity of thrusts that were not mutually supporting, handing over to Ukraine all the benefits of the “central position”, thus allowing Ukraine to defeat each Russian attack in detail. The Russian plan only makes sense if the Russians believed their armed forces were so much superior to Ukraine’s that normal military considerations don’t apply, that the Ukrainian forces would crumble, leading to a political collapse (and presumably swift replacement at the top with a Russian puppet).

Humans create the Avatar project so that they can form a diplomatic contact with the blue-aliens. Cool. They spend billions-upon-billions of dollars creating forms that can communicate with the natives, learning their language, learning their culture and trying to figure out how that world works.

Then halfway through the movie humans decide to just start shooting the aliens because it'd be faster to mine that rare metal.

If humans were selfish, they'd have ""started shooting"" way earlier. If they were diplomatic, they would have waited a bit longer to see if there was a diplomatic solution to ""Hey, under your big ass tree, there's this metal we want. Is there a way we can have the metal without ruining your beautiful tree?"".

------------

Its like watching Spiderman: Far from Home, and watching Dr. Strange cast a spell without thinking of what the spell even is just so that the drama can occur. Its stupid behavior purely for drama.

I dunno. I think if a few more scenes were added that maybe explained the sudden turn in humans (ex: Investors are pulling their funds. You have 1 year left to extract metal and prove that this entire space mission is worthwhile), then it would have been a reasonable explanation.

I know Ukraine's taken some big armor losses in the counter-offensives earlier but no idea what did most of the killing or if western armor will be more survivable against those weapons. 

The refrain from commentators here is that we should not take Russian losses as an example of what armor is capable of in this day and age because they're employing it very, very poorly. Like trying to evaluate the efficacy of a firearm judging by how it works for Don Knotts. 

Funny thing about the Bradleys, Clancy in his book on armor was going on about how they're not tanks, they're not meant to fight tanks, that isn't even their job and using them that way would be stupid.
