To answer your question most ships frigate size and up won't be using its weapons from the bridge, but a separate compartment deeper in the ship. In there they would have air radar advanced sea radar, sonar maybe, (not a combat systems guy just a wrenchturner lol)  so that the information is there for the captian to order what the ship is doing (this video about the shootdown of Iranian air flight 655 shows what the dynamic is kinda like https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DPHGUQrixWc)

Either way while you might disrupt the steering and maritime radar in the bridge, in my opinion you would be better served hitting the radar antennas to blind them or hitting their missile stores hopefully detonating the onboard missiles in their launchers",False,1647657659.0,t3_thle84,t3_thle84,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Johnson said that Putin did not really believe Ukraine was going to join the Nato military alliance, or the ""semi-mystical guff"" about ""the origins of the Russian people"" spouted by the Russian president.

The old guy who wants and tries to get out of bed because his President is there. It's the look in the eyes of all the patients. The look of someone who would die for that man. I've never seen that look before, in any news video of any leader meeting their people.... it's really something. It's not just 'wow it's the President come to visit me'. It's far more than that.

""James Acton said the Kinzhal was thought to be an Iskander missile that had been modified for fighter jets, and Iskander-M missiles have already been fired by Russian ground launchers since the start of the war.  


  
Although the Iskander-M has a far shorter range than the air-launched missile, Ukraine's defence ministry claimed this week that Russia had fired almost all its Iskander missiles during the first 20 days of the war.  


  
A US defence official was quoted as saying on Friday that Russian forces had fired more than 1,080 missiles since 24 February.  


&#x200B;

""\[That\] is an astonishing number and a very significant fraction of Russia's pre-war inventory,"" Mr Acton told the BBC, pointing to the increasing use of unguided bombs in Russian aerial attacks. ""They may very well be running short of accurate munitions.""""",False,1647703179.0,t3_thle84,t3_thle84,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

> The group that represents 1,900 operators in gas, power and water supply said that according to its sources, Russia's share of Germany's gas supply in Jan-March, which is not officially published, stood at 40%.

> Estimates from analysts and utilities last December had pegged the share at over 50%.

> by Christopher Miller
> BuzzFeed News Reporter
> 
> Andriy Khlyvnyuk is one of Ukraine’s biggest rock stars. As the frontman for BoomBox, one of Ukraine’s biggest bands, he had a hectic March lined up, playing 10 concerts in four countries over 25 days.
> 
> “I have a weekend in Miami. The day before I was in LA, and some days before in San Francisco. I’m on tour in the US and Canada right now,” Khlyvnyuk said one morning in Kyiv last week, rattling off the places where he should have been.
> 
> But that was before the Russian bombs started falling on his country.
> 
> Instead, Khlyvnyuk has swapped his microphone for a high-powered assault rifle and his leather jacket for an armored vest, and is now fighting side-by-side with his Ukrainian compatriots against invading Russian forces that are pounding the country with airstrikes and heavy artillery.
> 
> “This is my duty. Ukraine is my home,” the 42-year-old Khlyvnyuk said. “And it’s not that easy to push me out of my home.”
> 
> Many other Ukrainian celebrities, including pop icons, tennis stars, ballet dancers, playwrights, and top chefs, have also pushed pause on their old lives and joined their country’s fight for freedom. Some have taken up arms, while others are helping with humanitarian and fundraising efforts. But in one way or another, they are all now playing major roles on the frontline of the biggest war in Europe since World War II.

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. 

Day twenty-two: three guys from the Tennessee national guard were found in Ukraine, dead or maybe actually alive and still fighting, we're not sure. Is NATO going to be pulled in and start WWIII because of foreign volunteers? Better stop allowing them! 

Day twenty-three: Russia is sending their generals to the frontlines. Putin just spoke to a loud group. Russia is revitalized and starting *right now* will take the war seriously. 

Day twenty-four: Russia says it used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for first time.

> Russian forces pushed deeper into Ukraine’s besieged and battered port city of Mariupol on Saturday, where heavy fighting shut down a major steel plant and local authorities pleaded for more Western help.

> The fall of Mariupol, the scene of some of the war’s worst suffering, would mark a major battlefield advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II.

> “Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth,” Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders that was authenticated by The Associated Press.

> Russian forces have already cut the city off from the Sea of Azov, and its fall would link Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to territories controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in the east. It would mark a rare advance in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance that has dashed Russia’s hopes for a quick victory and galvanized the West.

How can Russian soldiers live with themselves and justify their actions? I genuinely don't understand it.

Many are clearly and knowingly firing on civilians. I'm not talking about people in the homeland who watch censored media. These soldiers see their actions directly up front. These women and children non-combatants that die clearly aren't militarized Neo-Nazis (and that's putting aside how much neo-nazi propaganda Russia bots have encouraged in the west), there shouldn't be any ethnic conflict behind this. Many Ukrainians are parts of the former soviet union and could be seen as family.

Are these soldiers truly so loyal to Putin's ideals that they think firing on civilians is just? Do they want to murder just that badly? If so, why? Even right wing militant assholes at least have years of propaganda being shoved down their throats that I can see radicalizing them, but only a small fraction are 'this' prone to violence. (so far)

What drives this? Why fire indiscriminately at civilian centers? Who gives those orders (below Putin) and what makes them honestly and truly obey? I know this has happened in wars throughout history, but you would think in the 21st century even Russians would not be so keen to merely kill civilian targets so indiscriminately without rhyme or reason. What convinces them to so indiscriminately dehumanize all Ukrainian civilians like this?

I recall my Dust Bowl Survivor grandmother keeping ten plates of cat food in her fridge because ""they might eat them later. It won't hurt them one bit.""

Largely, governments must move people to shift towards rationing, repair, and reuse if it is to happen.

Fukuyama seems to think post Cold War liberal societies have a pent-up idealism, causing many of our divisions.

https://mobile.twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1503370665327529991

Perhaps that pent-up idealism can be spurred on to power lasting change (e.g. decarbonize power generation at scale)?

The question is, could liberal governments spur their societies to en masse change consumption patterns to gain a geopolitical edge? Perhaps we are witnessing this groundswell in autocracies such as China's in the case of Marvel/Disney films?

Much of the postwar expansion of the 20th Century relied on marketing to spur adoption of new technologies and new products at scale, which has helped to make them cheaper, but increased waste esp. for postconsumer import countries (like India, Bangladesh) which receive waste to recycle.

There’s no new info here, just an conglomerate of it. I don’t think each scenario is equally likely (in fact, I think a good number of them, like a Putin coup or nuclear annihilation, aren’t likely at all) but I guess it’s good to keep some things in mind. 


I tried to do a possible allies/axis list, but much of it depends on how China would side in the event of WWIII. And it made my brain hurt. And there’s so many countries I know literally nothing about. So I instead included some notable relationships, positive and negative. 

As of rn, I think the most likely event is very simply, russia and Ukraine come to an agreement that’s somewhere in the middle.

Yesterday Odessa friend said they heard constant air raid sirens for the first time. He send me pics of them sandbagging landmarks to save heritage statues. Overall he seems okay.

Guy from Kyiv told me he was on his way with his wife to Lviv. That was on the 8th. I haven't heard from him since. Really worried.

So many people we met in Kyiv that I've only been able to reach out to once. Our group of people on WhatsApp hasn't had a peep since I checked if they were okay the first week of the invasion.

And I keep thinking about the hospital we stayed at that was right on the edge of the very first area that was invaded. All the nurses we met there. Which makes me remember the Doctor who visited our apartment to do a check up on our son and taught us so much.

In particular, some people in the United States send wrong signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, which is very dangerous. If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries. Hope the US side will pay enough attention. The current situation in China-US relations is directly due to the fact that some people in the US did not implement the important consensus reached by the two of us, nor did they implement Mr. President's positive remarks. The US has misread and misjudged China's strategic intentions.

\#5 is the most optimistic note I've heard about Mariupol today.  The defenders will have a lot of places to hide and hit the Russia assaulting force which is supposed to be around 15,000 soldiers.

Separatist forces are pushing into the city w/ them, and it makes me wonder if they can be knocked out entirely as a fighting force if they take enough casualties.  My understanding is the separatist forces account for about 25,000 of the invading army.  As an aside there was a video where a foreign legion of Belarussian soldiers advised that they intended to head South to try and break the siege around the city.

> **Why Vladimir Putin Invokes Nazis to Justify His Invasion of Ukraine**
> 
> March 17, 2022, 6:53 p.m. ET
> 
> Anton Troianovski
> 
> Ukraine’s government is “openly neo-Nazi” and “pro-Nazi,” controlled by “little Nazis,” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says.
> 
> American officials led by President Biden are responsible for the “Nazification” of Ukraine, one of Russia’s top lawmakers says, and should be tried before a court. In fact, another lawmaker says, it is time to create a “modern analogy to the Nuremberg Tribunal” as Russia prepares to “denazify” Ukraine.
> 
> The language of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been dominated by the word “Nazi” — a puzzling assertion about a country whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish and who last fall signed a law combating anti-Semitism. Mr. Putin only began to apply the word regularly to the country’s present-day government in recent months, though he has long referred to Ukraine’s pro-Western revolution of 2014 as a fascist coup.
> 
> The “Nazi” slur’s sudden emergence shows how Mr. Putin is trying to use stereotypes, distorted reality and his country’s lingering World War II trauma to justify his invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin is casting the war as a continuation of Russia’s fight against evil in what is known in the country as the Great Patriotic War, apparently counting on lingering Russian pride in the victory over Nazi Germany to carry over into support for Mr. Putin’s attack.
> 
> “This rhetoric is factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive,” scholars of genocide and Nazism from around the world said in an open letter after Mr. Putin invaded. While Ukraine has far-right groups, they said, “none of this justifies the Russian aggression and the gross mischaracterization of Ukraine.”

If we did give artillery over to Ukrainians, their supply chain would be complicated, and their training messed up. The crews would have to retrain to NATO-weapons and then those crews would need to use completely different shells than the rest of their stockpile.

> 
> Lieutenant-General Sir Jim Hockenhull said the Kremlin has been forced to switch tactics, turning to the “reckless and indiscriminate” use of firepower which will inevitably lead to more civilian casualties.
> 
> He said the Russians have “enormous” stocks of artillery ammunition and could maintain their bombardment for weeks of the country in an attempt to force Ukraine into submission.
>

It's a flaccid attempt to demonstrate (to someone) that the increased SAM capacity doesn't matter (when it totally does).

It was a very expensive sacrifice of a weapon that Russia doesn't have very much of at all (like all of their fancy unicorn weapon systems) to make a statement that nobody really believes.

It also may be some saber-rattling in an equally flaccid attempt to intimidate the West. 

The problem with that is that Putin had it wrong from the beginning. The West wasn't cowed, it was greedy and lazy. It was simply too much of an inconvenience to deal with him. 

Now, Putin has fucked up and succeeded in actually appearing as if he is a somewhat credible threat and the West is acting accordingly. Further confirming that is only going to bring more of the same upon him and his nation.

Fortunately for the Russian people (and probably the rest of us as well), Putin has only succeeded in being a potential threat and an annoyance. If he ever does manage to frighten the West...

Putin was putting us on notice that if push came to shove in some confrontational environment that the nuclear option would be on the table.

3) Better morale on the USSR side after the initial breakdowns at the start of the campaign, being the defender against a genocidal enemy.

As a starting point, and by far the most important point is this- they are totalitarian government which is hostile to the West and to democracy.

That doesn't necessarily mean they want war with the west but as an emerging global power it is fundamentally in their interests for America to lose power, have less international influence, have weaker ties with its allies, and for democracies to be weakened and discredited. The reason they've initially supported russia and green lit the invasion when Putin visited Beijing for the olympics was there are obvious positives for them from a quick russian victory in ukraine and another russian satellite state on the border of NATO- it would force america to commit more money, attention and troops to NATO and to Europe and therefore have less capacity to exert influence in Asia, and it would leave people in Taiwan far less confident that American can or will defend it.

The only reason there's been vague rumblings within their government now is th war is having huge unexpected consequences- far from requiring a greater long term american presence in Europe, the way things are heading, european countries are dramatically increasing defence spending and russia's military has been shown to be a total joke. And the dramatic sanctions combined with the financial drain of the war on Russia risk what would be a nightmare outcome for China- the collapse of a totalitarian ally on their northern border and the end of any serious stratelgic competitor for the US in Europe.

So where does that leave China? - walking a fine line really- they don't want to be the target of sanctions themselves and they want to keep making money off the West, but they also don't want to see russia collapse, and on balance they'd prefer russian control of Ukraine. I think they are going to continue to try to sit on the fence publically whilst delivering russia what aid they can behind the scenes, particularly economic aid to keep their society stable.",False,1647661932.0,t3_thle84,t1_i18m6lg,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

He recounted his story of why he left Russia in 2013, after the federal policing agency, the FSB, demanded he provide “private data of the Ukrainian users of VK who were protesting against a pro-Russian President.” That story had previously been reported.

According to previous reporting, in 2014 Durov, valued by Forbes at just over $14 billion, sold his stake in VK, which he’d cofounded in 2006, leaving Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia’s sanctioned billionaires, effectively in charge. It came three years after Durov refused to censor VK accounts being used by activists to promote anti-Putin messages in support of protests against what they believed was a rigged 2011 election.

> 
> BEIJING (Reuters) - A senior Chinese government official said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine are increasingly ""outrageous"".
> 
> Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng also acknowledged Moscow's point of view on NATO, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards, forcing a nuclear power like Russia ""into a corner"".
> 
> China has yet to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, though it has expressed deep concern about the war. Beijing has also opposed economic sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, which it says are unilateral and are not authorised by the U.N. Security Council.
> 
> ""The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,"" Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets ""for no reason"".
> 
> ""History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system... and worsen the global economy.""

I imagine they would want to send 1 or 2 in the densest AA area in Ukraine and see if its intercepted, if we were to see ""Tactical nuclear strike de-escalation"" somewhere in Western parts of Ukraine, u need to have an idea how feasible it is. 


Alternatively could be somewhere, where Russian troops suddenly decide to pull back in a big manner. 


If peace talks get nowhere, while Ukraine continues to get armed to the teeth (see switchblades, S300s, ""phantom Migs"" etc, etc), at some point in Putin head there would be a question of cost-effectiveness/price to pay, to get whatever is that he wants. Sort a like United States during WW2 when it decided its too costly to invade mainland Japan and forced capitulation through Atomic bombings. 


Its a pretty grim scenario and there should be some more dancing to be done (i.e. Ukrainians should be portrayed as insane inhuman lunatics, perhaps a big false flag op here or there, smtn along those lines), but it gets increasingly more likely to happen. Imagine Hitler, but with Wunderwaffe and he thinks he can force the other side to at least accept his terms (whatever Moscow listed in those demands).

Even from their staging early on I think it’s obvious they expected a blitz and for Ukraine to quickly capitulate. 

When multiple sources agree on the basics you can feel confident in that information.  Things are not going as Russia planned.  Regardless of the source they have undeniably lost a lot of expensive equipment they have lost assets that they have previously gained. They are threatening other countries supplying the Ukraine because it is prolonging the conflict and is very costly for them.

Who will win?  That’s not very easy to determine, what does winning even mean if you have a large population willing to fight a guerrilla war.  

It’s very clear Russia was expecting a first gulf war scenario and instead have a Vietnam but with very modern weaponry. 

That they have the resources to push forward is undeniable but does that mean a “win”?  In the modern age can you really successfully occupy a country that doesn’t want you there even to install your own government?

Unfortunately, most of it is true “from a certain point if view.”

You have to make assumptions because honestly even the Ukrainians don’t know if they are winning. They don’t know what happens if Sumy finally collapses.

So you end up with vague statements like Russia can’t keep this rate of losses up but… if they would pull their heads out of their asses Russia would win.

so it's not so much ""ukraine is not a real nation"" as ""ukraine would still be russian if not for the bolsheviks being idiots and giving it away for no reason."" per him, russia lost its great power status entirely due to the bolshevik short-sightedness, including the loss of what he feels are rightfully russian lands (the russian-speaking eastern ukraine and crimea) that went with ukraine into independence due to arbitrary administrative boundaries.",False,1647658027.0,t3_thle84,t1_i18il02,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

While most cozied up back when Russia wasn't really in the position to prevent such actions, Ukraine slowed roll their way to this point thanks in part to previous corrupted officials.   


This all changes in 2014, when Putin's puppet candidate is elected which was accused of being rigged, and then ousted by the public via a revolt soon after. At this point the new government in place starts clearing house and removing a lot of corruption from the government to join the EU and NATO.   


Obviously Ukraine being the birth place of modern day Russian Empire and culture,  it has a special place in people's heart. The problem is that Putin and so other hardline officials see Ukraine joining NATO and EU as some unholy thing as that means Moscow has lost influence over most former USSR states and are left with the attention-whore states of  Belarus and North Korea, although the latter seems to be closer with China now. This is why you see Putin call Ukraine officials, drug induced Nazis because Moscow leadership doesn't understand why Ukraine would side with the group of countries they consider the enemy, which they still don't because I guess they don't own that western invention called a mirror.

1. Russian training.  We now now that many soldiers thought they were going to be welcomed or that it was an exercise.  So when they get shot at, must have been a real shock that they were actually at war.  I attribute the labored early advance to this.  When you’re getting shot at without expecting that, you’re probably going to be a bit more deliberate in how you do things.

2. Ukrainian resistance.  Cannot be understated.  They’re outnumbered in their own country (although who knows how many volunteers they have? I’ve seen no estimates on that). And yet are making the Russians pay for every inch with blood.  The reason we’re sending $800M in weapons 3-weeks in and not on Day 1 is because we now think there’s a reasonable chance the Ukrainian Army will be there to receive them.

The incredible pressure created by their movement through the air makes them especially vulnerable to damage.  So shrapnel striking one from a missile or even a flack shell, marring its surface can cause the super heated air around the missile to tear it apart.

Additionally these missiles require constant flight adjustment handled by computer controls.  So an EMP in their vicinity (like with just a lightning storm) can disrupt their flight controls for just a moment, which is long enough for the missile to tumble out of control.

Right now these assets are frozen. They cannot be spent by the Kremlin on domestic programs to protect the local economy from sanctions and fallout. It cannot be used as collateral on new debt, due to both it being frozen and separate sanctions. No lender wants to touch Russia right now.

By allowing them to service the debt, it protects the integrity of the international debt market and removes any criticism that would have been directed to the west for purposely pushing another country into default. Instead, the country is allowed to service its debt like usual and use the assets for this purpose, not dooming their future at all, but still prevents them from financing the war.

Now imagine if they didn't allow this. The Kremlim would have a talking point domestically and internationally. If it happened to Russia, with their 6000 nukes, it could happen to you. It could happen to any country. It could galvanize public support for general mobilization and further efforts. Overall, the risk is not worth the reward. 

This might be the dawn of a new international system of order. Instead of direct military intervention, regional peace etc could be better influenced through access to capital, markets and other programs. 

\------

Right now, Russia is fighting a losing war on multiple fronts. Militarily, they're unable to make significant progress. Assets are being re-deployed, but unlikely to make a difference. 

Economically, they're experiencing shortages in some areas already, but the real pain is yet to come. Product shortages, loss and closure of entire industries/production chains and a weak export sector is going to make the domestic politics of Russia an extremely unstable and dangerous game for people at the top.

Internationally, Russia is losing support because they have nothing to give. As the situation continues to unfold, their position weakens. Why would countries risk market access to the West to support a country that is bombing hospitals, civilian bread lines and more? Who knows what they will do domestically to their own people when they start to protest. 

Overall, Russia has lost this war. It's now just watching as the aggressor crumbles further and further. This is a warning to other countries that would look to upset the rule based international system.",False,1647689915.0,t3_thle84,t1_i19nsfx,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

The answer to your question is it depends on the timeline and many factors... Having said that...

Most likely a drawn out conflict that bleeds Russian soldiers and equipment and Ukrainian civilians and soldiers.

Ukraine will de facto have an endless supply of infantry equipment but more complicated systems (Tanks, Planes) will be in short supply.

Biggest area where I would expect Russian gains is in the South.

Initial area of Ukrainian gains is likely heading south from Kyiv.

A basic strategy would be use Kyiv to hold a portion of Russian forces in place and attempt some sort of move elsewhere.

A PR win would be getting to Mariupol, but this is unlikely at best without a push South.

Peace at some point, maybe... That comes down to Putin because while Zelenskiy may want to compromise, Ukraine has tasted blood and is fighting for it's survival, Ukrainians are unlikely to want to cede any territory.

Ceasefire at some point, maybe and more likely than Peace but Putin has demonstrated multiple times that such small-level ceasefires are meaningless to him, why would a larger one be any different.

Long term - once Russia pulls out, Russia will be a shell of its former self, in what circumstance depends on China, India and other 'neutral' nations trading. Ukraine will rebuild with Western money and become an EU nation, but that's talking 10-ish years.

Crimea, other territories, unknown, NATO membership for Ukraine - permanently on hold but aspirational.

Putin pushes his army until they're unable to function, they get killed, captured or they walk home. Ukraine insists on either getting a concession of Crimea, Donbass and Luhansk diplomatically or militarily. They're open to diplomacy only if those are the outcomes. Lots more Ukrainians will die until they reach this point.

Russia claims ultimate victory over the Neo-Nazis and the combined might of the West at some point.

Russia becomes North-North-Korea and China maintains relatively antagonistic but above-board deals with the West while providing for a new black market in Russia.

Zelenskyy, dead or alive, will inspire some sort of new coalition in his name, theoretically called U24, that tries to redefine pacts that allow nations to resist getting gutted while others watch helplessly.

Putin is going to stay in power or the next person will be Putin-Lite for 10 years or so. The Russian people will resist all cultural reforms and be themselves. Good guys in charge are weak and easy to kill, bad guys in charge are 'strong leaders.'

>Biden warned that Putin had dreams of rebuilding an authoritarian empire going all the way back to his days as a senator from Delaware. On the campaign trail, he said repeatedly that he knew Putin didn't want him to win.

>Since the beginning of his time as President, Biden has relied on his sense of the Russian leader to guide his own response. It's even guided the way Biden deals with Putin in their conversations, repeatedly interrupting what he and aides see as the Russian President's strategy of going off on tangents meant to muddle and undermine.

>According to a dozen interviews with White House officials, members of Congress and others involved in the effort, Biden has deliberately worked with allies abroad to deny the Russian leader the one-on-one, Washington vs. Moscow dynamic that the President and his aides think Putin wants. Publicly and privately talking about the war as a fight for freedom and democracy, Biden has left other leaders to speak with Putin.

>He has moved just as deliberately at home to depoliticize opposition to the invasion of Ukraine so that, even among Republicans, support for Putin has been forced to the fringes so that vilifying the Russian leader has become the one major area of bipartisan agreement since Biden took office. This week Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric by calling the Russian President a ""war criminal,"" a ""murderous dictator"" and a ""pure thug.""

7e82d65cbd1d01e0b5467689be5e74a1,thle84,i18iz3y,"Nukes are a bit complicated, because they aren't all or nothing. Sure, Russia has 1000kt nukes (Hiroshima was 10kt for comparison) but if he dropped one of those in Ukraine, the fallout could either blow back into Russia or into a NATO country, which would not take kindly to it.

The problem is that Russia also has thousands of nukes that range from 1kt to 50kt which can hit up to 500km. We're assuming that he won't nuke Ukrainian cities, because he'll want them to be liveable after the war, but he could certainly nuke large military formations. If the West tried to invade Russia, they would have a lot of large military groupings which would make for easy targets, and Russian soldiers would probably hide in cities just like the Ukrainians are doing now. So we'd have to choose between nuking cities to move forward or getting all our large units taken out if they formed any kind of coordinated assault.

The most effective way to fight Russia is doing exactly what we're doing now. Hide in defensible, high value targets that aren't worth nuking, and whittle away at their army while sanctioning them until they can't put up an army anymore. If the people overthrow him as a result of this, that's fantastic.

The only wild card is that he may decide to simply destroy Ukraine if he can't win it, but hopefully either him or his men with see that such an act could cut off all European trade via nuclear wasteland and kill Russia in the end. It all depends on how much he's willing to burn.

NATO and Ukraine were both willing to be cooperative with a cooperative Russia. NATO has *zero* interest in attacking Russia. In fact at one point Russia had the opportunity to join NATO. It's not true that Russia will do *anything* for a warm water port, because they didn't join NATO.

Apart from point 1 (which a NATO-member Russia would have been able to access), points 2, 3, and 4 could have been solved by non-hostile, diplomatic actions where Russian experience paired with Ukrainian resources in s mutual oil and gas partnership (e.g. just like Canada's involvement in Cuban oil).

Point 5 could have been solved by Russian alignment with NATO or just talking it through.

Russia is a victim in all of this of Putin's paranoia. He can't comprehend that other nations might actually want to cooperate with Russia and not backstab it, and that mutually beneficial solutions can be reached through diplomacy rather than disastrous and destabilising military action. This has backfired on him, and hard, and a much better option has always been on the table.

 >As Allied troops entered and occupied German territory during the later stages of World War II, mass rapes of women took place both in connection with combat operations and during the subsequent occupation of Germany. Scholars agree that the majority of the rapes were committed by Soviet occupation troops. The wartime rapes were followed by decades of silence. According to historian Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it.

Yes, Putin is a dangerous and immoral authoritarian who had a lot of support, but there was nothing to indicate the average Russian citizen (or rather, the ones whom became a soldier eventually) was so quickly capable of indiscriminate murder like this.

I'm not so much saying it's not possible to act this way. It's just that I've studied the psychology of terrorists, fascists, murderers, and radicalized people for a few years now, but this is one of the few times none of the usual reasons I see that lead others to kill so indiscriminately and so immorally seems to apply. There is no true national pride in this that matches the history of the average citizen's ethics. No sense of honor or misguided beliefs of protecting the innocent. No hiding behind a computer screen just pushing buttons in many cases. No true signs of ""liberation"".

 >HyperNormalisation is a 2016 BBC documentary by British filmmaker Adam Curtis. It argues that governments, financiers, and technological utopians have, since the 1970s, given up on the complex ""real world"" and built a simpler ""fake world"" run by corporations and kept stable by politicians. The film was released on 16 October 2016 on the BBC iPlayer.

Creating competitive syndicates of private worker and Union owned companies that pool resources, create mutual aid based on shares which can be earned by being a loyal customer or worker, etc.. Revenue would be used for healthcare for all shareholders, payroll, and building new revenue streams. Eventually we could buy up hospitals and set prices for services.

Exec pay at co-ops would be capped at 5x average salary.

You might gain shares for purchases, hours worked, or even volunteered at events or charities.. Shares would be used when paying dividends.

Shares for purchases would be capped at 5k per year, so billionaires can't milk it.

Workers also get votes on how company is managed, based on role, time with company and other factors. 

I'm working on creating a worker co-op building software for co-ops, basically the ERP and SAP systems that could tie unions of co-ops together but also be used for normal businesses as a SaaS...

I think it's a step towards a post scarcity society, if business is more geared towards doing good and providing to workers and customers while also taking via sales etc... It's like a charity that runs fundraisers, but more like a business with charities and when leadership that isn't profit motivated, other than to ensure everyone can afford a home, healthcare and other essentials...

Georgianism is another interesting philosophy you might be interested in, and I think could be a good idea.... Basically universal basic income based on a land value tax and the idea the land and resources under it belong to everyone, but as you can't take back what has been purchased, or is owned you'd just tax land at the value it carries...

I find many different ideas from multiple ideologies make sense, and that somewhere there's maybe a unifying solution that joins them...

Like a unified theory of physics but for political science....

I'm sure I'm not the only to think this, but the way everything seems to always favor corruption and the whole world always being controlled by a handful of people, that needs to change or at least needs to figure a way to raise up the bottom rung to a place of comfort and not be used as slaves, real or wage slaves.",False,1647686309.0,t3_thle84,t1_i19ev4y,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Point 1 absolutely, Russian planning just got this hopelessly wrong. The cities they're bogged down in are ones they expected to roll over - if this is what the majority Russian cities do in response, pushing further is an inevitable world of hurt for Russian forces. Scholars will study for years how Russia managed to miscalculate so drastically.

On point 2, Ukraine has been quietly preparing and learning since 2014, and the Russians seemingly have not. They've been, I think, deliberately downplaying their own abilities until they needed to show their hand once Russia rolled in. They're also no longer outnumbered, with reserves called up, the Territorial Defense Force spooling up, and tens of thousands of Western veterans forming volunteer batallions, Russia no longer has a numbers advantage. Ukraine has been slowly rotating lots of troops through Donbas over the last 8 years so the number of combat tested reserves they have is impressive. Russia has a bigger population but it's ageing, they have other interests their military also needs to continue supporting, and any recruits they do pull will be greener than even the TDF in Ukraine. That's the thing, because Ukraine is surrounded by NATO and Russia and has no foreign campaigns, they can dedicate 100% of their military to this fight. Russia cannot. They're propping up Syria, multiple African nations, Transinistria, South Ossetia, plus all sorts of internal disputes and holding off several neighbours who'd like to chip into Russian borders. If they remove troops from these to stop their position in Ukraine fully collapsing, they're absolutely screwed. In fact, if ISIS suddenly pushed in Syria and aligned groups in central Africa did the same, Georgia pushed back in Ossetia, plus some of the internal disputes got busy, they'd find themselves stretched very thin. I think there's a chance this will happen too, as people with an axe to grind start seizing the opportunity.",1647694771.0,1647692900.0,t3_thle84,t1_i19rtht,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

It's not like they're fielding WW2 and Korean War era stuff (like North Korea), their equipment is often similar to Ukraine's (e.g. the same BTRs, BMPs, BRDMs, modernised T-72s and T-80s) if not outright newer (GAZ Tigr, later MiG and Sukhoi models than Ukraine), and yet they're absolutely failing to use any of it effectively.

It's almost baffling how they are this bad. It's a people problem. Russia just doesn't have the competent leadership or the level of frontline troop training to pull off an operation on this scale. In contrast, Ukraine has good training, fabulous morale, and something to unify them and fight for.

The benefits of this war geopolitically cannot be underestimated. Russia has demonstrated it's a mere shadow of the USSR and is barely a regional power. The West gets to demonstrate and refine all their late cold war weapons platforms, lots of nations questioning the point of their military and of NATO have been given a much needed prod back up to speed - Europe has been *very* complacent militarily since 1991. Significantly reshifts and rebalances the power dynamics globally. Keeps the US riding high but tightens strained bonds in the EU. Makes Turkey and Iran much more like kingmakers. Boosts the other members of BRICS, particularly Brazil, India, and China, into the space Russia just vacated. 

More interestingly, it lifts countries like Vietnam, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan... we could see, I think, an equivalent of NATO forming in SEA and the Pacific, a NATO allied pact that extends Aukus to drop the UK but add in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and maybe even the Philippines.

Putin is an Almighty Daddy to his people. The Christian God is an Almighty Daddy.

Trump wanted to be an almighty Daddy. Xi wants to be the Chinese version of Almighty Daddy - Wise Ancestor Guardian.

Conflating the power dynamics of religion with the potential for greed in a hyper-capitalistic society with cult of personality, and we have a lot of Not-Russian-But-Close.

We have Karl Rove and Rupert Murdoch as the masterminds of this particular American tragedy. They are evil, rational geniuses that fractured the psyches of many ""Almighty Daddy"" seekers and weaponized them politically. We did it to ourselves. Putin capitalized on it, but by degrading intellectual rigor and defining 'free speech' in America to ""If I don't agree with science it won't affect me"" we set the stage by weakening our intellectual immune systems.

It's so incredibly natural Plato considered it the *inevitable* path that Democracy *always* takes towards Authoritarianism and Totalitarianism.

Desire leads (per Plato) to decay as everyone starts voting benefits for themselves.  In this morass of corruption and inefficiency seeps factions and insecurity.  The people very willingly hand over the reins of power to a strongman who will promise to clean things up and provide security.

The counter-argument to your supposition is simply that you're wrong in the perceptions of the masses.  The masses very often **strongly desire** a monarchy or something similar.  Just look at how *eager* people are to support political dynasties within democracies.  These people consider is much safer to stick with the offspring than to risk some unknown person.

I find the entire saga of the monarchy in the Old Testament to be profoundly demonstrative here.  They wanted a King.  The prophet told them over and over that monarchy would result in them being abused and mistreated.  But the people insisted.  Then the succeeding centuries validate your view.

Germany systematically opposed Ukrainian ascension to the EU and NATO since 2008.  
Germany has been blocking any weapons supply up until the invasion.  
Germany barely accepted a single Ukrainian refugee in 2014-2015. And media downplayed it for years.  
Germany systematically has been increasing their reliability on gas, instead of nuclear/renewable power.

I don't want to come to an unwarranted conclusion, but it appears as though aligning with Russia was a conscious decision, made in the same way it was made in the US under Trump. 

Unfortunately I see a lot of exhaustion among Germans saying ""We get it, we were Nazis, let it go"" but that in itself seems to be an awful mindset that reflects apathy and the inability to realize ""We're not calling you Nazis, we're saying Nazis acted this way and Russia is acting this way, and letting it go is the opposite of what we're trying to do.""

The two main places I saw immediately start pushing ""But gas prices..."" were American Republicans and people saying that Germany simply couldn't do it without freezing to death and anybody saying 'stop Russian imports' want Germans to die of starvation and destitution.

I'm also seeing that stopping Russian gas would result in a 1-3% decrease in GDP and COVID resulted in 4+%.

>plus nuclear isnt carbon free because building the plant and mining and enriching uranium isnt

Just keep in mind that Wind and solar require a lot more material as in steel especially apparent in wind turbines compared to nuclear. It is about 30x-100x times more steel per khw of energy produced. the huge span is due to wind and solars unpredictable nature and dependence on where exactly they are placed.
Anyway the point is rather a point in favor of nuclear as solar and wind require a shit ton of materials (resources) per power produced which all must be mined and transported. In fact jsut to replace current power generation with wind and solar we would need to significantly increase steel production globally. wind and solar are a logistically nightmare.

With nuclear much less is needed and at one point all the machinery used for mining will run on power from nuclear so no CO2 output from mining. This also ignores my initial point that we wouldn't even need to mine for at least 2 centuries just burning the current waste.",False,1647696550.0,t3_thle84,t1_i19u6tr,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

right? You are aware of that?

Because the general belief was that the prosecutor was corrupt and too lenient on oligarchs and Burisma.

So by that logic, Biden wouldve pushed for the prosecutor to be released for being _too lenient_ on Burisma. Wouldnt that be a good thing?

The origian of that narrative stems from a conspiracy theory which was pushed by Trump and Bannon in the lead up to the election in 2020 (remember the weird story about Hunter Biden's laptop being found in a random trash bin or something like that?)

 >Right Sector (Ukrainian: Пра́вий се́ктор, Pravyi sektor) is a far-right, Ukrainian nationalist organization. It originated in November 2013 as a right-wing, paramilitary confederation of several radical nationalist organizations at the Euromaidan revolt in Kyiv, where its street fighters participated in clashes with riot police. The coalition became a political party on 22 March 2014, at which time it claimed to have roughly 10,000 members. Founding groups included Trident (Tryzub), led by Dmytro Yarosh and Andriy Tarasenko, and the Ukrainian National Assembly–Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNA–UNSO), a political and paramilitary organization.

Edit:

I do personally believe that there may have been a time where democracy wasn't always the best way. I think in our early days it made sense to have some leaders that would just spearhead progress. We didn't want to be oppressed by other nations/groups/tribes/empires, and we generally wanted to just live our lives. Having someone spearhead that can really vastly improve the lives of the people in the future. I do admire those who've sacrificed themselves for a better future.

I do believe we've come to the point where we've figured out a lot of shit and quite honestly have enough tech and collective knowledge that we can really just slow the fuck down a bit, stop trying to kill each other and start understanding each other. Our medical advances have us reaching 100+ years old more and more regularly, we've become wiser, healthier, and yet it still seems so chaotic.

And things like the internet are a massive game changer because for once in our history the victor can only write history so much, you can't erase the direct thoughts of every person who's pumping their brain out into the cloud.

 >The philosopher king is a hypothetical ruler in whom political skill is combined with philosophical knowledge. The concept of a city-state ruled by philosophers is first explored in Plato's Republic, written around 375 BC. Plato argued that the ideal state – one which ensured the maximum possible happiness for all its citizens – could only be brought into being by a ruler possessed of absolute knowledge, obtained through philosophical study. From the Middle Ages onwards, Islamic and Jewish authors expanded on the theory, adapting it to suit their own conceptions of the perfect ruler.

The Serbs continued similar mass killings **even after** they lost their war in Croatia and Bosnia, which prompted the NATO bombings in 1999 to finally put a stop to their madness, and it effectively did.

Not if they're good comedians, like Jon Stewart is. To be a good comedian you have to have a huge degree of self-deprecation and a sense of empathy which actors generally lack. It's just that our market is over-saturated with loud shitheads who think shouting insults qualifies as comedy when it doesn't. 

Actually quality comedians will be excellent as leaders because of what I said about empathy and self-deprecation. Conan O'Brien and his foreign visits are an excellent example of this. No matter where Conan goes, he always manages to connect with people like a State Department veteran. It doesn't matter who the person is or what their politics are, Conan always manages to connect with people because empathy and reading the room are what makes for a good comedian.

We opposed Ukraine's ascension to the EU because they were an economically and politically unstable country that could add further tensions. Other nations opposed it on similar grounds.

Germany had a policy of *never* supplying weapons to *any* nation in an active conflict. I'm still surprised it got broken even for this conflict. It was nothing Ukraine-specific.

We've also not been systematically increasing our reliance on gas, gas power plants have just been the non-renewable plants that were considered of the lowest priority to shot down because they cause the least environmental issues.

And again, the GDP loss isn't what people have a problem with. It's the heating issues. Including for things like hospitals, for people with young children and so on, where ""put a sweater on"" isn't really an option. I would be willing to turn down (or off) the heat in my apartment but since I live in a new complex with geothermal heating that's not even an issue. Experts are discussing various ways to handle this and if there's one that's at all doable, I'm totally on board.

As to why people go ""we get it, we're nazis, save it"", well, whenever Germany does something that's the least critique-worthy, there will be people online with ""Germany on the bad side again, just like WWII...""

Most people are reasonable and either don't do this, or raise the topic to have a reasonable conversation about it - like you did. Absolutely no problem with that. But you encounter enough people that just want someone to bash that during times like this Ukraine crisis, I find myself staying off reddit and other social media just because constantly dealing with this gets tiring and I feel like whatever I say is shouted into the void anyways because no one listens.

Between the two, who do you think has billions in military hardware lying around that they can spare, the EU or the US? Obviously the US is the partner here that is best suited for military aid. The EU simply doesn't have the hardware lying around to send to Ukraine in the amounts the US has. When it comes to sanctions however, it's the other way around, there the EU is taking the lead in terms of impact. That's the great thing about a partnership, you can bring different parts to the equation.

It provides an alternative to GPS and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision. Manufacturers of satellite navigation devices say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where buildings may obscure the view to some GPS satellites.

 >A samovar (Russian: самовар, IPA: [səmɐˈvar] (listen), literally ""self-brewer"") is a metal container traditionally used to heat and boil water. Although originating in Russia, the samovar is well known outside of Russia and has spread through Russian culture to Eastern Europe, South-Eastern Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, Kashmir Valley, India, the Middle East, Azerbaijan and is also known in some parts of Central Europe. Since the heated water is typically used to make tea, many samovars have a ring-shaped attachment (Russian: конфорка, konforka) around the chimney to hold and heat a teapot filled with tea concentrate.

 >A barrage balloon is a large uncrewed tethered balloon used to defend ground targets against aircraft attack, by raising aloft steel cables which pose a severe collision risk to aircraft, making the attacker's approach more difficult. Early barrage balloons were often spherical. The design of the kite balloon, having a shape and cable bridling which stabilise the balloon and reduce drag, meant that it could be operated with more wind than a spherical balloon. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction.

 >Fiscal conservatism is a political and economic philosophy regarding fiscal policy and fiscal responsibility with an ideological basis in capitalism, individualism, limited government, and laissez-faire economics. Fiscal conservatives advocate tax cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, deregulation, privatization, free trade, and minimal government debt. Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical outlook of classical liberalism. This concept is derived from economic liberalism and can also be referred to as fiscal liberalism outside the United States.
 
**[Social conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism)** 
 
 >Social conservatism is a political philosophy and variety of conservatism which places emphasis on traditional power structures over social pluralism. It also engaged with the economic insecurity of lower-class Protestant Americans, McCarthyism and other challenges to social institutions. Social conservatives often promoted the organisation and politicisation of social issues.

Can Ukraine use their mobilized reserves (of which the have a significant number) to secure small villages and crossroads? That would possibly cut off forward Russian units completely. Morale is also beginning to waver on the Russian side, hence generals moving to the front line to try and arrest the decline. As Ukrainian reserves begin to flood the field in small units en masse will the Russians be able to effectively counter with isolated combat units and disjointed operations? Mariupol is probably lost, but the stand cost Russia significant amounts of time that has allowed Ukraine to equip and deploy.

Of course you are, you're cherry picking irrelevant information and presenting that as if it matters.

> German ex-chancellor is besties with Putin

Great example of what I just said. This guy hasn't been chancellor since 2005, this fact is so old it's irrelevant, but you are leaving out this important information to strengthen your argument.

> To this day Germany is contributing to Russia's coffers

And here you are cherry picking. Yes Germany is still paying Russia for fossil fuels. But so are many other countries, because quite simply right now there is not a feasible path to completely stop the use of Russian gas. You're ignoring the ""no feasible path"" part in the situation and placing emphasis on the ""they are still paying"" part. That's cherry picking.

Additionally, you are also ignoring that Germany and other EU nations have committed to a drastic plan to reduce their use of Russian gas at the end of this year by 70%. That is a huge amount. In Germany they are planning the hastened construction of LNG terminals for long term further reduction as well. These are large steps that you are omitting purposefully because they don't suit your narrative.

> Zelenskiy addressed the German parliament and urged them set aside their economic self-interest

This is another reasoning error. Just because Zelenskyy has said something, doesn't mean that this automatically is correct. Zelenskyy has also asked the US to close the skies, which very simply means NATO war with Russia. Obviously he is a motivated player that has the responsibility to get the maximum result for his country. So clearly what he is saying in such matters is not the most neutral or even most reasonable or logical position. I'm not faulting him, but using his words to support your position is simply an ""appeal to authority"" fallacy and a bad one at that.

Additonally, Germany has already taken a huge economical hit, so they have already set aside their economic self-interest, for a good part, but not fully, for sure. But economy also isn't just some abstract thing, people losing their jobs, people struggling to pay their heating bills are real problems also. Not on the level of dying to bombs for sure, but also not just numbers on a page. 

Also, it's also not the case that further sanctions will stop the war. Russia is committed and there is no sanction that will make them stop now. Sanctions are by definition long term whereas the problem for Ukraine is distinctly short term. There isn't a situation where if we add enough sanctions, that the war will stop, at least not in the coming 3-6 months.

Which is again, an element you are omitting from your reasoning. You are simplistically saying: ""More sanctions = more better"" and anyone who isn't adhering to that simple logic you treat as morally and ethically defunct.


Lastly, in your argument you are also ignoring the huge shift that Germany has taken when it comes to re-arming and also sending lethal aid. For the US this is normal, but in German culture this signals a huge shift and is a departure from the post-WWII order they have established there. It's not a small decision and it's to their credit that they have taken it. They didn't want to do this, but they did it anyway. That is the definition of ""stepping up"", which you accuse them of not doing.

So all in all, you are demonstrably reasoning in a malicious manner. You're omitting critical details, ignoring relevant context, highlighting uninmportant elements to make them seem more prominent and using incoherent and even outright fallacious reasoning to strengthen your argument.

>Unlike a traditional missile, fired at a target visible at launch, the Switchblade cruises over the battlefield for up to 15 minutes, sending back video for the operator to detect, locate and identify targets up to six miles away. Once confirmed, the operator locks on and Switchblade dives in to destroy the target with a small but powerful fragmentation charge that can take out a group or roomful of individuals or a pickup truck. It can circle around defenses or can dive vertically to defeat targets in trenches or foxholes, making most forms of cover useless.  
While it only flies at about 65 mph and is driven by an electric propeller, the makers still refer to Switchblade as a missile — in a sense it could be viewed as a miniature cruise missile. And it should be emphasized that it is tiny: The whole system in its launch tube weighs less than six pounds.

I can assure you that most germans are not afraid to freeze to death. They are afraid of losing their jobs, because high energy prices are extermely bad for german industrial sector. Some aluminum factories already annonuced that they will decrease their output, because of high energy prices,

And one thing is also clear. Germany will be dependent on energy imports as long as it cannot supply itself with renewable energy.Germany has only few natural resources. A little bit of coal is left, that's all. Almost no natural gas and no oil.If the world does not change for the better, Germany will not be able to import enough energy from democratic and friendly states.

Many countries that export oil and gas are not democratic!

In my opinion Germany should reduce and replace energy imports from Russia as soon as possible! Better today than tomorrow!!!

1. i am not the one publishing it.

2. the map attempts to show operational level movement without trying to assess actual disposition in an area, which is impossible to do accurately. yes, ukrainian forces are everywhere and they're causing all sorts of problems, but that is not possible to map. there are even partisan attacks reported in kherson - should we not mark that as russian-controlled, even though the russians very clearly occupy it? what is possible to map is where the most recent fighting has occurred and deduce from there where the most recent front lines are. that is what makes the map useful. 

3. i am sure it does miss some reports. but also, not all reports are credible. the other day, the vdv reported securing a foothold on the east bank of the irpin at the same time the ukrainians reported a successful counter-attack in the same area. i am not sure either was accurate. so i think the author does their best given the fog of war.

And no grouping ppl via location is not ignorant. 
Americans do indeed complain about regugees from these regions. I'm honestly not sure you understood what I meant at all. 
They complain about all South and Central American refugees and all the rest I listed. That is a fact.

Not so far at least. 

And if ppl from those places are included in the Americans complaining about the refugees that's even worse. Usually they aren't though. You're just nitpicking at this point because my points land.

 >A barrage balloon is a large uncrewed tethered balloon used to defend ground targets against aircraft attack, by raising aloft steel cables which pose a severe collision risk to aircraft, making the attacker's approach more difficult. Early barrage balloons were often spherical. The design of the kite balloon, having a shape and cable bridling which stabilise the balloon and reduce drag, meant that it could be operated with more wind than a spherical balloon. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction.

Part of my family is Jewish. One of my partners is Jewish. Does that give me any moral superiority in this discussion over someone who isn't Jewish or doesn't have Jewish relatives?

No.

We are all human beings. Anything who tries to diminish the essential one-ness of humanity is attacking what it means to be human.

I grew up 'Russian' living in America during the Cold War. My father had gone to Europe to kill Nazis and the USSR was 'our' great alley But of course it was never that simple. The USSR became 'our' great enemy.

I grew up in a society believing that the USSR could at any moment rain nuclear hellfire down on 'us'.

Half of my family remembered the USSR 'liberating' Hungary and hated them for it. Just as Edward Teller did. You remember him, the great Hungarian physicist, the founder of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, the 'Father of the H-bomb', the 'Father of Star Wars', 'Great Cold Warrior' who wanted to nuke the USSR -- the guy I worked for at LLNL.  OK, five levels down but still, I was in the Process Physics group and he was the Director of the Lab.

I played my little role in MAD. Did it help prevent WW3? Did it hasten the fall of the USSR?

Maybe.

But if 'we' had launched, I would have had a role in the deaths of how many of 'them'?

And when I say 'them', that would of course include how many of my extended family.

How many people guilty of nothing more than living in a place that 'we' know makes them evil?

How many Ukranian Jews?

That's the way it works when you hate an entire nation.
