🪖 On Wednesday, Ukraine liberated a few [small villages](https://twitter.com/SoizaDavid/status/1552219453483409408) in the Kherson area and russia began an assault on [Avdiivka](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1552348049162354690) in the Donbas.  [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1552460132252106752), and [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552240634580402177.html), cover all the details of the day.

🚧 All [bridges into Kherson](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549993412161593345.html) are reported to [have been damaged](https://twitter.com/WhereisRussia/status/1552245110234120192) and [are unusable](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552211470024310784.html) for all but [pedestrian traffic](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552204334951276544.html), including the important [railway bridge](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1552228012384460800).   

🚧 russia appears to have started up a [ferry under the Antonovsky bridge](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1552341868083613699), but it may have been targeted and [destroyed](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552385428971462659.html).  Right now Ukraine appears to be content to weaken russia’s [logistical position](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552358513963405314.html) and to give russia a chance to escape from an indefensible position which will push back the day when Ukraine must engage them, but will save thousands of civilian lives in Kherson.  At least on Wednesday, russia’s response has been to move even [more men and equipment](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1552368730067312641) into the area.

🌾 As expected, the [Grain Export Coordination Center](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1552317638352592896) opened [in Istanbul](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1552250544802119681) on Wednesday.  The center allows for the inspection of cargo to and from Ukraine ports to ensure no weapons are being transported.  Really, really important for the grain deal: Lloyds of London is [issuing insurance contracts](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552362360513388544) for the transport of Ukrainian grain.

👉  We don’t get too many reports of Ukrainian casualties in the war which makes [this report by Simon Ostrovsky](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552141699606106112.html) so unusual and important as he reports on a strike on a Ukrainian military warehouse in Mykolaiv.

👉 Only 10% of Ukrainians are willing to cede territory to russia in order to end the war, for [84% any territorial concessions are unacceptable](https://twitter.com/mattia_n/status/1552296702350073857).  This is an important point to remember as russia starts pushing its “peace initiatives” so it can regroup and recoup its spent forces.

👉 russia’s war objective of the day is… ~~“[overthrow Volodymyr Zelensky](https://twitter.com/SamuelSokol/status/1551540678030770179)”~~ oh wait, that was monday…  Wednesday’s war objective is… re-establish the [“Soviet Union”](https://twitter.com/LlopisMarta95/status/1552334904280715264).  In a reminder of objectives past, former russian president Medvedev published a map on Wednesday of how russia planned to [divvy up Ukraine’s corpse](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1552371965318537218) amongst russia, Poland and Romania.

👉 With western weapons savaging putin’s troops in Ukraine, russia threatened a [“harsh response”](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552334619437154308) if the west increases weapon supplies to Ukraine.  Meanwhile, the US’s NATO mission said if russia goes ahead with its plans to annex occupied areas that NATO will [respond swiftly](https://twitter.com/USNATO/status/1551872732094255104).

⛴ russia opened [a ferry](https://twitter.com/WithyGrove/status/1552361388957384704) between the russian port of Yeysk and occupied Mariupol.  It’s expected to expedite the transfer of military equipment into Ukraine, and pillaged materials out.

🇩🇪 The lack of russian gas is really lighting a fire under Germany this week as Berlin approves the sale of [100 PzH-2000 self propelled artillery units](https://twitter.com/marceldirsus/status/1552291106678784001) to Ukraine.  This is a billion dollar, multi-year deal that won’t immediately impact the war.

🇵🇱🎁 Poles launched a fundraiser to buy [3 evacuation helicopters](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552339987420614659) for Ukraine.   

🔥🇩🇪 Now that russia has cut off the gas and Gemans have no other recourse, German industry is preparing to cut gas usage by [up to 50%](https://twitter.com/marceldirsus/status/1552257764935745537).  The rising price of gas in europe is also triggering the [laws of supply and demand](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1548004135294754817.html).

💰 putin’s war not only caused a mass migration out of Ukraine, but there was also a [mass migration](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552021634063679488.html) of young, highly educated, wealthier people out of russia and only 3% plan to return.

>There won’t be a single day, when you will be able to tell, that it had started. In a way – it already has started. It will be accurate destruction of Russian forces top-down, starting from operational, then operational-tactical, then tactical levels. Decisive forces – artillery (guided 155mm shells) , rocket artillery (HIMARS), aviation.
Ukraine will not throw solders in one large assault, they will first make sure Russia has no fuel, no ammo, no command, only then approach with infantry. Of course, there will be manoeuvres, forcing Russia to respond and deploy defence. This is not yet NATO level, when most damage can be done remotely, but close to that. Most emphasis is on remote fire, isolation of battlefields, and incremental destruction.
Ukraine's objective is for its infantry to encounter weakened Russian forces without supplies, fuel, ammo, command.

- Ukraine's counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering momentum. Their forces have highly likely established a bridgehead south of the Ingulets River, which forms the northern boundary of Russian-occupied Kherson.

- Ukraine has used its new long range artillery to damage at least three of the bridges across the Dnipro River which Russia relies upon to supply the areas under its control. One of these, the 1,000 metre long Antonivsky bridge near Kherson city, was damaged last week. Ukraine struck it again on 27 July 2022 and it is highly likely that the crossing is now unusable.

- Russia's 49th Army is stationed on the west bank of the Dnipro River and now looks highly vulnerable. Similarly, Kherson city, the most politically significant population centre occupied by Russia, is now virtually cut off from the other occupied territories. Its loss would severely undermine Russia's attempts to paint the occupation as a success.

Day 155 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Again there was no shelling yesterday, but they still fired some missiles at us at midnight. There were at least 4 missiles, most likely S-300 again, for some reason air raid alert was late by around a minute, we got alert from Russians about missiles being launched at 12:01am, at 12:02am missiles already landed in Kharkiv, but alert only started at 12:03am, it being so late is far from ideal.

Their targets as always had absolutely relation to military. One was a factory that made construction materials. The other one was Gorky Park yet again, no military equipment was damaged in the process. Though they did demilitarize some lawn mowers, a truly scary piece of equipment, if they didn’t destroy them they would have certainly been moved down, but now they are safe, right?

Just in the past hour a video has surfaced, where a Russian soldier cuts Ukrainian POW’s balls off, posted by the Russians, [here’s the thread about it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/wagzlh/a_video_surfaced_where_a_russian_orc_cuts_off_the/) Those pieces of shit think that they will scare anyone by doing that, delusional fucks, the POS that did it is already identified, so he won’t be able to run.

I've been seeing a ton of pro-RU trolls trying to push the old ""West vs everyone else"" narrative around Ukraine to make it seem like Russia is part of a larger ideological struggle with support from around the world - this is just patently false. 

The whole ""West vs Everyone"" narrative around Ukraine is, in and of itself, Russian propaganda.  
  
Ukraine is supported widely both in and outside of the West.  
  
1) A vast majority of the world voted to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine. So at the very least, many many more countries than just the ""West"" are against Russian aggression in Ukraine. [https://www.axios.com/2022/03/02/united-nations-ukraine-russia-141](https://www.axios.com/2022/03/02/united-nations-ukraine-russia-141)  
  
2) Even countries in Russia's very very anti-western sphere of influence are supportive of Ukraine. Kazakhstan has long been one of Russia's closest allies and is now turning away from Russia due to their actions in Ukraine. [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/kazakhstan-cancels-victory-day-in-protest-over-putins-ukraine-war/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/kazakhstan-cancels-victory-day-in-protest-over-putins-ukraine-war/)  
  
3) At a CSTO (Russia's version of NATO) meeting in recent months, Russia was trying to gain wider support for the war in Ukraine but failed. CSTO won't even get involved...

4) Even China is cooling on supporting Russia's economy during this war...

The only way Russia has been able to advance from Popasna to then Severdonetsk and then Lysichansk has been to use massive amounts of artillery spam and then basically have Wagner attack using their best troops and literally go block by block, village by village with air support and artillery on call. It is an incredibly slow strategy but it seems to have worked somewhat.

I know most of Wagner is pretty mediocre but the teams that were used for the most recent Donbass operations seem to be really legit. Probably like the top 5% of Wagner and have the ability to basically call in whatever they need. (Most RU ground forces don't have this ability.)

Also given the photos out there they obviously have top notch gear that's not available to most RU forces (NV goggles, Expensive weapons, High quality helmets, etc.)

Is there a way UA can counter act these Wagner Drop in Drop Out teams? They seem to be the only way Russia can advance and are moved from place to place in order to make marginal gains. Should UA drop in their special forces whenever the intel suggests they might be coming? Honestly curious to know what UA could do to counter this.

That shit actually happened. There are plenty of devastating drone strikes and ambushes where Ukraine is on the losing side. It's important to know the truth of that and not to turn away. It makes it clear that they need more and better weapons, especially AA.

Also on the list is some shithead named Eliot Magnier. Now this guy is a *complete* fuckhead. Rob Lee posts objective stuff but Magnier constantly tweets and retweets stuff where the truth is subtly (and often not so subtly) twisted to fit the Russian perspective. Example: trying to say that Western sources were inconsistent because the CIA claimed 15,000 KIA while the next day 75,000 KIA+WIA. Magnier tried to twist that like it was an inconsistent statement.

1) Numbers - Yes, it's been established that Ukraine has a solid corps of pilots that have acquit themselves well, given the odds.

You would have to train a sufficient number of pilots and provide enough planes to at least match up with the level of air-to-air fighters Russia can field, as well as the pervasive SAM threat, and have those aircraft fully serviceable and operational.  

2) Basing issues - Another thing that needs to be accounted for when adding additional planes into the mix is being able to put them in available airfields, and then protecting those airfields from the cruise missile threat.   The UA air force has survived fairly well, as they've been able to actively keep aircraft from being stuck at one base, shuffling them enough that they couldn't be targeted.   

If you throw a number of additional into the mix, you have more units to shift about, which makes the risk of damage from air-to-ground strikes higher, and increasing the number of facilities that need adequate SAM protection.  In addition, there might be operational requirements a more modern military jet is going to need, which may limit the number of bases that those aircraft can operate from, and thus make it more easy for the Russians to target and attack that capacity.",False,1659039557.0,t3_w9zemk,t1_ii11qfa,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Not that realistic at the moment. Taiwan's coastline is heavily defended and China wants the island for its outsourced goods.

That is because it isn't realistic. Firstly, China will need to do an amphibious assault. These are costly, easy to defend and have large casualty rates (this will be politically unacceptable with a population that is old)

China barely has enough aircraft carriers with decent kit to do this. They also don't have the amount of landing craft necessary to achieve this plus resupply.

China relies on the West to feed it's people. Each year China has to import enough food to feed between 400 and 500 million people because they can't produce enough food on their own.

Where does this extra food come from? The US, Australia, and a number of other western countries.

As long as  you can't feed your people, to that degree, you don't go to war and piss the west off.

That's it.

Second of all, look how fast the west dismantled Ruzzia's economy. It took them a weekend to pass the first package of sanctions, in the same week that Ruzzia invaded. The sanctions that came after did help, but the bulk of the damage was done over a weekend at the beginning.

Now, China's economy depends on the west. No west, no Chinese economy. That's it.

If the west starts moving factories, China is fucked, hard. All it will take is for the EU, for example, to subsidize companies that move their production facilities back home. And this is not really that big of a deal for the EU, if they really wanted. The EU, and the US, however, prefer to offload all these industrial processes - that pollute the fuck out the environment - to China. Let China poison its people, it's lands, it's air.

The damage that can be done to the Chinese economy in a weekend will shadow anything done to Ruzzia.

The Chinese government is well aware of this, and they took note of what happened to Ruzzia. That's why most of the help China provided to Ruzzia since the beginning of the invasion was moral support. And that was it. China is scared of sanctions.

Third, China doesn't have the military power to invade another country, especially one that is across water. It would be difficult to invade a country they share a border with, one that is practically an island they have no chance.

The idea that China is a competent military force is on the same level as Ruzzia is a competent military force. They use the same equipment, more or less, with China generally making copies of soviet crap, and China has no real military experience. At least Ruzzia was always invading someone left or right, but China has little experience with this, and none of it is recent.

China also lacks a navy. What they have wouldn't survive an encounter with the US navy, for example, and we are talking about two or three carrier groups here, not the full force of the US navy. You can't invade Taiwan when the US is there to defend it.

In conclusion, no, China is not going to invade Taiwan, and all they are doing is posturing. Talk is cheap, and talk gets others to the negotiating table, and China is doing more with talk than with actions.",False,1659054033.0,t3_w9zemk,t1_ii1gf1x,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Personally I think the following happened: 

- Sabotage by Russian Agents
- Strong Russian Troops Concentration & Ukrainian Troops Concentration being lesser. 

Regarding the second point, it’s just a theory but. Kyiv was always going to be the main show. However, I personally (based on what I’ve read), interpret the reactions of Russia & Ukraine as very different to this. 

Russia wanted to make a quick surgical strike to take Kyiv, while Ukraine concentrated troops around Kyiv to defend. Meaning Ukraine would have had less to dedicate to the south. With this being particularly true in the first week/s, as Kyiv was under threat. 

But Russia, I think took this as putting a lot of troops in the south, to break Ukrainian resistance. I think they figured they could take Kyiv, then break the southern strongholds. With a goal of eventually breaking to Dnipro. 

Meaning overall, Russia concentrated troops for Kherson, while Ukraine had less concentration on Kherson. Which definitely didn’t help, since sabotage then further impacted its defence. 

The south of Ukraine in particular is also quite flat & open. Which definitely would have helped Russia move quickly out of Crimea. This also meant that Ukraine had much less natural terrain to rely on for defences. Unlike the north, with lots of forested areas, that Ukraine used ruthlessly. 

TLDR; Definitely was a big part, but it was also a complex equation that resulted in Kherson being less well defended than is ideal.",False,1659021717.0,t3_w9zemk,t1_ihzw00r,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

This is over the shoulder footage filmed on a non-potato phone.

A man is bound and gagged face down on the ground, he is struggling but a kick to the head stops all that.

His trousers are pulled down / missing exposing his underpants. (I'm not watching it again to check.)

A man with a box cutter slashes his undergarments away, revealing his bare behind.

He is wearing latex gloves.

He reaches under then bound and gagged man and after some fumbling pulls the man's (sizeable) testicle into view and starts slashing at the base of the scrotum with the cutter.

Lots of cuts, not too much blood. More nicks than anything else. Like someone slashing at a particularly well wrapped parcel with a slightly blunts knife.

The man stops and goes off screen before returning with a plastic bag to more effectively cover his arm.

He takes a firmer hold of the scrotum, stretching it out, before more confidently slicing and sawing through the skin. Look up a video of a chef preparing cuts of meat from a chicken.

There is now a lot of blood.

Russia may be able to extract the bulk of these soldiers but due to the damaged bridges; a substantial portion of their heavy equipment may be as good as lost. These BTGs are as good as destroyed even if they can escape without their heavy equipment. It will take months for Russia to reconstitute these units.
2. Kherson is a strategic position from where to hit the tenuous supply lines in and out of Crimea. It's a position for the further degrading of Russian positions in Southern Ukraine and legitimately poises a threat to roll up much of Russian gains in the rest of Kherson oblast.
3. Ukraine already controls and possesses far more crossings on the Dneipro than Russia. Ukraine can certainly shift forces freed up from reducing the Russian presence on the West bank of the Dneipro (from Mykolaev and Odesa) to the Southern front. Ukraine may be able to finally gain a superiority of fires and other equipment on a single front after Russia is ejected from the West of the Dneipro. This position might prove untenable for Russia.
4. Retaking Kherson will be a massive propaganda win for Ukraine. Both in telling her Western supporters, her own citizens and allies that Ukraine can indeed retake territory and convince more Russians that this war is unwinnable. Russian morale has typically been poor and it is impossible for Russia to paint a false narrative of why they didn't suffer a major defeat in Kherson. This is akin to the 'gesture of goodwill' in Kyiv and much of the country early in the war. It's an undeniable defeat.
5. Strategically, Ukraine needs to reclaim her southern coast as much of her GDP is tied to the export of materials and food out of her Southern ports.

In normal times, the President has a certain dollar amount ($100M/year?) of US military equipment they can give away. Congress has been upping this limit for Ukraine pretty regularly throughout the war.

Congress can approve all sorts of other packages, but the execution is left up to the President. The package Trump was accused of holding up for blackmail was basically a gift card to Ukraine valid for the US defense industry (Ukraine wanted ATGMs even then, if I recall correctly).

I figured I'd write this to help you understand his initial response:

>Damnit, I wanted to downvote you in the first half but upvote you in the second. And I’m guilty of laughing at the entirety of your comment. So take my angry upvote

What he's conveying is that you, 'got him.' in other words, he started to think one thing based on your opening

>I don't really see how that matters, wearing knee pads on a bike is something you should do especially when you're 10,000 years old like him.

So that statement, as he mentioned, is an insult to the current president.  It sets the stage, so to speak - kind of like mine where *I* mentioned the kneepads.

But then you follow up with:

>And no Trump didn't wear knee pads because the floor was always nicely coated from all the piss

Which is a 'slam dunk' because it pulls multiple things together, such as the rumored piss-sex-tapes and his obvious fondness for Putin - and it does so very visually... You're like a poet; you painted a picture with words.

Regardless, his response was admirational in nature... Basically, ""well done, sir.""

Protocol on Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use
of Incendiary Weapons
(Protocol III)


Article 1
Definitions
For the purpose of this Protocol:

* 1. “Incendiary weapon” means any weapon or munition which is
primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to
persons through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on
the target.
(a) Incendiary weapons can take the form of, for example, flame
throwers, fougasses, shells, rockets, grenades, mines,
bombs and other containers of incendiary substances.
(b) Incendiary weapons do not include:
(i) munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects,
such as illuminants, tracers, smoke or signalling systems;
(ii) munitions designed to combine penetration, blast or fragmentation effects with an additional incendiary effect,
such as armour-piercing projectiles, fragmentation shells,
explosive bombs and similar combined-effects munitions
in which the incendiary effect is not specifically designed
to cause burn injury to persons, but to be used against
military objectives, such as armoured vehicles, aircraft
and installations or facilities.
* 2. “Concentration of civilians” means any concentration of civilians,
be it permanent or temporary, such as in inhabited parts of cities,
or inhabited towns or villages, or as in camps or columns of
refugees or evacuees, or groups of nomads.
* 3. “Military objective” means, so far as objects are concerned, any
object which by its nature, location, purpose or use makes an
effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial
destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling
at the time, offers a definite military advantage.
* 4. “Civilian objects” are all objects which are not military objectives
as defined in paragraph 3.
* 5. “Feasible precautions” are those precautions which are practicable or practically possible taking into account all circumstances
ruling at the time, including humanitarian and military considerations.

Article 2
Protection of civilians and civilian objects

* 1. It is prohibited in all circumstances to make the civilian population as such, individual civilians or civilian objects the object of
attack by incendiary weapons.
* 2. It is prohibited in all circumstances to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of
attack by air-delivered incendiary weapons.
* 3. It is further prohibited to make any military objective located
within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by means
of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered incendiary
weapons, except when such military objective is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians and all feasible precautions
are taken with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing,
incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to
civilian objects.
* 4. It is prohibited to make forests or other kinds of plant cover the
object of attack by incendiary weapons except when such natural
elements are used to cover, conceal or camouflage combatants or
other military objectives, or are themselves military objectives.",1659040340.0,1659039560.0,t3_w9zemk,t1_ii127q6,,6,3,0,3,0,0,
