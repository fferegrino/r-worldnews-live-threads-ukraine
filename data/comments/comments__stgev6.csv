It seems to me like Putin became somewhat sloppy and began to believe that the US and NATO were nothing but weak pushovers and he was genuinely surprised by the strong response to Russian aggression. That said Putin is a shrewd tactician and his goals remain unchanged so now we wait for the next move. It seems like the move from Russia now is to bide their time and wait for Ukraine to make a mistake of some sort, which would give an opening and a pretext for invasion. However, time is not entirely on Russia's side. Keeping and maintaining an army like this is expensive, and at some point domestic pressure turning against what seems on the surface like a pointless exercise will become too much for even Putin to handle. And at the put up or shut up moment, Russia will move in as planned as opposed to retreat. So in my opinion as an outsider, it seems like Russia's play at the moment is to bide their time and wait for a Ukrainian slip up, but at some point invasion is still inevitable atm unfortunately.",1645034570.0,1645034041.0,t3_stgev6,t3_stgev6,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

Russia has steps they need to do that simply weren't meet today.

If the west somehow appeases him he won't sign it or will keep the status quo of funding rebels and declaring the whole thing a military exercise. But i don't think this happens, putin has realized whether intended or not he is locked in now, and there's no cost too high to get it what he wants done. 

Putin will sign, they will find fabricated evidence of genocide, and Russia will be at war. I'd say friday-sunday but who knows, I thought it was weird they'd attack during the Olympics at all, even though they have before they have a much greater need to appease China right now. So aftet the 20th maybe.

Absolutely not, read any number of articles from today that are talking about how diplomatic channels are still up and functioning. That is very important for de-escalation efforts, and if countries start reporting that Russia isn't communicating? That's a worrying sign, but to say war is imminent is turning a blind eye to lots of reports that suggest the exact opposite.

However, Russia still has a ton of troops built up along the borders of Ukraine and there is still lots of intel and reports suggesting that invasion is not off the table yet. To say that nothing will happen however, much like the previous paragraph, is ignoring lots of reports that are suggesting the exact opposite.

The Russians were due to hold military exercises just like they do almost annually; the Biden admin saw numbers tanking; the US media saw Covid fading; the military-industrial complex saw a client in demand. 

It actually started at Fox, who hyped it up to make Biden look bad. The Biden admin ignored it for a while but then made the same move as they did on the border issue (which backfired btw) — embrace it, embellish it, exit it — Biden comes out with a ratings boost. Easy. In theory. 

Putin sees them doing this in response to his military exercises, realizes he has them at an advantage because Biden can’t just yell fire and then say oh nevermind. So Putin alters the plans to make the exercises more extreme and provocative — it’s expensive, sure, but he knows for certain he has a bite, so it’s worth spending a little to reel it into his advantage. 

Putin will drag this out as long as possible, because every day of hype pushes Biden admin further back on the ropes. By now, Putin’s goal is simply to embarrass the Biden administration, and the “West”/NATO in general. 

In the meantime, Ukraine has no choice but to sign a shipping receipt for billions of dollars worth of prepaid munitions from US military manufacturers. How gracious of the US, even if they wouldn’t foot the comparatively small bill of $590m for a few days worth of “airspace insurance” (?). This looks like a shakedown of Ukraine, IMO. They are the biggest loser here, even and especially if no blood is shed. Of course, the Biden admin will also likely embarrass itself (and us), just based on history.

He made his demands clear and everyone knows them now. He discredited western media and exposed their propaganda, if he doesn‘t invade, which I am pretty sure of. And to top it all of: he might get the pro russian city/states from east Unraine if they manage to declare independence, without firing one shot. Basically, he trolled the west and gained a lot.

EDIT: Love the downvotes, finally got that crossed off on my Reddit to do list. Let‘s see how far we can get. 

Anyways, for all ya‘ll crying me a river, cba to reply to so many the same answer: Even if western intelligence was right about the day of invasion, Putin would be dumb to actually go for it now, if it was indeed exposed. Now he can just chill his balls and actually can prove his narrative of the Anti-Russian narrative of the West. Played right into his hands. Btw. People of Russia are against a potential war or invasion. He doesn‘t have the people‘s support. I believe even someone like him needs to have some sort of support to pull that off. Source: German Media after the press conference between Putin and Scholz. 

Oh and he made his demands heard. After all, ya‘ll know them by now, even people who weren‘t even aware of those differences so far. Word spread. He got the attention he wanted. 

And what do I mean by propaganda. Basically, everyone got their own kind of it. The western media, especially USA, is more leaning towards Anti-Russia, while Russia is saying that it needs to liberate cities of Ukraine or the whole Ukraine. It was one of the two from what I read. Everyone got their own schtick.

To be unbiased I will acknowledge that after the collapse of the soviet union the US and nato still worked endlessly to help russia become the failed state it is today. The only way for them to ""play ball"" so to speak would be to purposely put themselves under the west's thumb. So they became increasingly backed into a corner quite litterally.

Its part of the global chess game that's been waged since long before we were born.

Long term the US and Europe are generally open to allowing russia to come back to the table and open trade after events like this. Probably someone is wagering that taking ukraine will result in heavy sanctions and a rough decade, but long term benefit.

American politics are fickle(as you've probably seen well enough in the past few elections).

I agree with you based on what I have seen that it appears the Ukrainians will fight.  While they are mired in a war of attrition we will hopefully strangle their economy.  Russians know how to suffer but hopefully their elites don't.  Watching the flights I saw two DHL flights headed to Moscow.  I say we start some painful sanctions now for their aggressions to show them we're serious and that they'll just get worse if they invade.  Imagine a cessation of sharing airspace with them.  Yes it might hurt the West more than Russia but I would guess minimally.  Isolate them, cut them off, let them have their sphere of influence and not one inch more.

Russia will start a physical assault on Ukraine as soon as Feb. 16, multiple U.S. officials confirmed to POLITICO, and Washington communicated to allies that it could be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyberattacks. One person said the leaders’ call indicated that cyberattacks are “imminent” and another said the intelligence is “specific and alarming.” Sullivan mentioned that any attack on Ukraine could begin with “aerial bombing and missile attacks.”

More NATO weapons, more killing within insurgent territory, and NATO troops attacking unbadged Russian troops within said insurgent territory. Remember all those nameless troops entering Crimea? 

Pretty sure this is going to end with a shrunk Ukraine, or a Western Ukraine. With a new Donetsk Federation on the East or a sudden vote to become part of Russia. Probably split along a natural barrier, the Dnieper river.

Keep in mind, Russia can cross over their defined border without resistance, aside from air attack. The front line isn't the border of Ukraine, it's varying around 50 to 150 miles further inland.

There are reports that Russia is pulling back some troops and plans to end these military ""excercises"" by the end of the week and that there is hope for a diplomatic outcome. There are also reports that troops and vehicles are imminently waiting on the border to attack. Then there are other spanners in the works like the cyber attack and the thwarted terrorist attack in the Donbass and Putin claiming genocide.

Russian Intelligence agencies have intentionally confused western media leaving everyone on the edge of their seats.

>The Kremlin sent a third covert flight to Minsk on August 30 potentially carrying personnel. An An-148 passenger plane belonging to Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations flew from Moscow to Minsk on August 30 at 1:33am Minsk time.[8] The plane spent approximately one hour in Minsk before leaving at 2:37 am, landing in Moscow at 3:45 am.[9] ISW cannot confirm who or what arrived in Belarus on the flight, but has observed a pattern of Kremlin aircraft arrivals in Minsk punctuating new preparations for a Kremlin intervention in Belarus. Russian media personnel first appeared in Belarus on August 19 after a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) plane landed in Minsk on August 18.[10] Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the existence of a reserve police force ready to intervene in Belarus on August 27 after the same FSB plane visited Minsk again on August 26.[11] The Kremlin is likely maintaining flights to Minsk to send in key personnel and potentially equipment.

Forte11 is a [Global Hawk drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk). Since there is no pilot, there aren't really many high altitude restrictions (manned high alt planes are pressurized and pilots can wear pressure suits). It uses many different sensors with different ranges. Best bet is to read through the wiki.

acbc2cd6abf2f73be0165383c396a1ed,stgev6,hx427a0,"It is quite complex.

Since inception, Russia has been victim to outside invasions due to its lack of ""hard"" geographical borders such as major rivers and mountains.  Russia is a massive plain, the Mongols invaded through the Steppe, the Huns did the same, Napoleon did the same, Hitler tried it too. So Russia historically and culturally is fairly paranoid.

The USSR finally achieved what Russia was attempting to do for centuries: defensible borders.  Catherine the Great famously said that Russia either expands or Russia dies.  The USSR obviously collapsed and the Russians are back to square one, they actually have a longer border now than they did as the USSR despite controlling significantly less land.

So anyways, Kiev and Moscow have a common history stemming from Kievan Rus, the Viking state established in the 8th/9th century that eventually morphed into the modern Russian state via Muscovy as Ukraine was taken over by Muslim hordes (Golden Horde etc), then the Poles, and finally the Russians.  Ukraine is one of the most fertile regions in Europe and is the breadbasket of Europe - the USSR invested a lot into making the Dnieper a major economic corridor as well.  

If Ukraine drifts away from the Russian sphere of influence, which it already has really, then Russia is completely exposed as they enter a period of profound weakness due to:

1. Rapid, incredible demographic decline due to Perestroika and alcoholism.
2. Sanctions decimating the Russian economy and reducing it to what is essentially a gas station.
3. The almost complete withering of the generation, and all the knowledge they carried with them, that was able to compete with the US during the Cold War.  That was no small feat, but those scientists and thinkers are now dead or dying.

So yeah Russia is basically facing an existential crisis during the 2020s - their window of opportunity is closing due to demographic decline and they straight up won't have spare young men by 2025.",1644974070.0,1644973332.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx40wir,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Ukraine is literally his front yard, so having nato so close would be like if Cuba had missiles facing the USA. 

That doesn't work with him. Add to that the fact that russia in its history has been sacked and attacked several times. Last time being attacked by Hitler. 

Putin also says that the USA promised not to move nato further east. There wasn't a document but there was a verbal agreement. So this to him is treason. 

Add to that, putin wants to show that russia is still a super power, they basically are a mid table team pretending to be a championship team. This makes him think that he looks tougher for his people. Who are starting to show more and more unhappiness with putin.

Desperate gamble but if he wins, Russia is back to being a big dog on the block even more so than before since he knows what he can get away with.

Putin is just being aggressive for two reasons. The “long term” reason is that Russia has gotten its ‘edge level’ tech like hypersonics, genetics, counter intelligence, and cyber to a point of relative superiority compared to adversaries (especially when paired with China). The short term reason, or the answer to “why now”, is that he saw the failure in Afghanistan and realized that American leadership has piss poor communication, weak decision making skills in times of urgency, and an intelligence community that is increasingly running into challenges with better and better counterintelligence from their adversaries. 

What Putin may have failed to calculate was the united response, and harsh economic consequences that appeared as a result world wide. In response to that, we are seeing China and Russia finding common interest in re-acquiring land that they believe is “rightfully theirs” (but in reality is just land they lay claim to because it is economically valuable to them), hence why we are seeing quasi-alliance like statements about ‘unbreakable friendship’ and all of that.

Combine the Cream, butter and sugar; mash bananas, beat 2 eggs and add to the bananas with vanilla and buttermilk; mix well and add to the cream, butter and sugar mixture; sift together flour, baking soda and salt; add to banana mixture, beat well; pour into 2 greased and floured 9x5x3-inch loaf pans; bake 45 to 50 minutes (I find this bread needs over an hour) or until bread pulls away from sides of pan; add topping. 

To prepare Topping: Melt butter in saucepan; add sugar and milk; cook until syrupy (like honey); remove from heat and add chopped pecans; pour over bread spreading to all the corners and place under broiler until bubbly and brown. Watch closely (this takes around 1 minute I'll usually do it in a single bundt pan, and bake it for 65 minutes. Cook the syrup til it's like honey and it'll be slightly tacky after you broil, cook it a bit more and it will set up more like a praline (a bit crunchy).",False,1644972272.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx3z72e,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

For decades former Nazis and German war criminals served at the highest echelons of NATO.

Most of them were highly decorated Nazis, who later served in top positions in the Western German army, and were later promoted to serve as Commander and Chief of all NATO forces in Europe.


This was not a unique event, but a very common phenomenon in post WW2 western Europe and especially in Western Germany.


Nazi war criminals and people who supported and helped Hitler to carry out the holocaust and other war crimes, genocides and crimes against Humanity were almost never put on trial for their crimes against the Jews, the Poles, the Greeks, the Russians and the people of Europe, but instead were installed in top positions in NATO, in the western German government, army, industry and western German society at large.

The most famous of them was Adolf Heusinger, chief of the Operationsabteilung from 1940-1944.


He was actually Hitler's chief of staff and helped plan the Nazi’s invasions of Poland, Norway, Denmark, and France. He was promoted to colonel on August 1, 1940 and became chief of the Operationsabteilung in October 1940, making him number three in the Army planning hierarchy.


After the war, this German war criminal, the man who helped Hitler plan and execute his invasion of neighboring countries which directly led to the deaths of millions of people, was not even put on trial, quite contrary he was allowed to take over the newly established West German army, the ""Bundeswehr"".


In 1961, Heusinger was made the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee (essentially he was NATO's chief of staff). He served in that capacity until 1964. 

 Heusinger was far from being the only Nazi war criminal who would later serve at a top position in NATO, here's a summary of a few more.


General Hans Speidel, a Nazi general who was Erwin Rommel’s chief of staff during WWII.


After the war he served in the Western German army and became the Supreme Commander of NATO’s ground forces in Central Europe from 1957-1963.
 
Johannes Steinhoff, Luftwaffe fighter pilot during WWII and recipient of the Knights Cross of the Iron across (the Nazi military’s highest award), was Chairman of the NATO Military Committee 1971–1974 (among other NATO positions beforehand).

Johann von Kielmansegg (pictured left in first image), General Staff officer to the High Command of the Wehrmacht 1942-1944, was NATO's Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central Europe 1967-1968.

Ernst Ferber, a Major in the Wehrmacht and group leader of the organizational department of the Supreme Command of the Army (Wehrmacht) from 1943-1945 and recipient of the Iron Cross 1st Class, was NATO's Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central Europe from 1973-1975.


Karl Schnell, battery chief in the Western campaign in 1940/later First General Staff Officer of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in 1944 and recipient of the Iron Cross 2nd Class, was NATO's Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central Europe from 1975-1977.


Franz Joseph Schulze, a Lieutenant in the reserve and Chief of the 3rd Battery of the Flak Storm Regiment 241 and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1944, was NATO's Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central Europe from 1977-1979.


Ferdinand von Senger und Etterlin; Lieutenant of 24th Panzer Division in the German 6th Army, participant in the Battle of Stalingrad, adjutant to Army High Command, and recipient of the German Cross in gold, was NATO's Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central Europe 1979-1983.
Some people would say that some of these people were just army officers in a professional army and not war criminals.


However the Nazi Wehrmacht was not just a normal ""professional army"", it was an integral part of the German Nazi killing machine that was responsible for the deaths of 14 million civilians and the destruction of Europe and Western Russia.


Instead of facing trial for their particiaption in war crimes during WW2,  they became top generals in NATO.

Moreover, Biden said that they WOULD stop a full scale invasion, but not minor conflict - and my take on this is that he may know that Russia is planning to invade Donbas, just like Crimea 2014.   And maybe that is why the US is so insistent on the invasion narrative.

Ukraine was given assurances by the United States, Russia, China, and more in exchange for giving up their nukes.

Ukraine has seen the result of paper promises in times of relative peace.

No one would have touched Ukraine had we not convinced them to give up their best deterrent.

Meanwhile, Biden has assured Ukraine that not a single soldier will be sent in their defense.

Since this is a war Ukraine can not win without support, meeting the demands seems like the only viable option to save lives.

If Ukraine loses enough people in war, it will become much easier to claim that Ukraine is not even ethnically Ukrainian anymore, and more likely to end up conquered permanently.

It really does not seem like a risk they can take.

I think Putin can't pressure Ukraine at this point to do anything more than side with the west, they've demonstrated they will at least fight for sovereignty, so expecting them to get pressured into giving it up would hard.

 >The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely-piloted, surveillance aircraft. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

aacebbdf5b1700a7591a14d3ec3acee5,stgev6,hx3xd4x,"tl;dr: Russia can create a domestic crisis at short notice through the denial of critical resources and exacerbate the political reverberations by amplifying domestic dissent. Agent provocateurs can turn protests violent, creating the conditions for the assassination of Ukrainian officials and the decapitation of the state. With the government in crisis, Russia is poised to escalate fighting in the Donbas, offering the West the prospect for de-escalation if it can force Ukraine into a compromise of its sovereignty through accepting the Russian interpretation of the Minsk Agreement. If these paths fail, then Russia has amassed the capacity to invade and is able to defeat the Ukrainian armed forces. The question is whether Russia believes it can absorb the economic blowback and suppress the risk of protracted insurgency. If society has been divided domestically then the backbone of a protracted resistance could be broken and the FSB will be able to leverage its networks in the country to establish a system of Ukrainian-fronted repression. But it is a major gamble. Russia has consequently laid the groundwork to achieve victory along several paths and is pursuing all of them simultaneously.  
Indeed, the combined threat has fixed Ukraine because the measures best suited to countering one Russian path to victory are precisely those that would precipitate defeat on a different axis. If Ukraine mobilises to deter an invasion, Russia can destroy its economy and break the cohesion of the Ukrainian state. If the Ukrainians move to break up the networks eating their country from the inside, their government will be weakened and vulnerable to pressure from the West to accept the sacrifice of Ukrainian sovereignty. If the Ukrainian government remains steady, and the West holds firm in supporting Ukrainian sovereignty, then Russia may resort to invading the country and using its covert networks to enact systematic repression. Countering these threats will not be achieved through a breakthrough diplomatic summit. Nor will the delivery of small quantities of military aid change the conventional balance of forces.  
It is entirely plausible that, in their erratic lack of focus, Western governments have lurched into crisis mode too late to have many meaningful options. If Ukraine survives the next month, however, then Western policy must be multi-layered and coherent. The first requirement is to bolster the Ukrainian armed forces, and in particular the equipping, training, and command and control for territorial defence, which is the best route to deny Moscow a viable path to a swift military victory. The key is asymmetric deterrence. There are also key systems that must be bolstered, most significantly air defence.",False,1644971168.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx3wv7d,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia needs China. China does not need Russia.

China also will maintain whatever shaky relationship it has with the U.S. for economic/trade relations. Obviously, I’m not an expert on foreign policy. But money always talks.

Two big things with a situation like this:

Russia likely has multiple invasion plans and schedules. It’s also pretty likely that the only ones who know all of them are Putin and cabinet level officials. This way, if one of the plans leak, they can more easily identify where the leak came from, and they still have multiple other plans to work with. Worth noting that “not invading” is likely one of those plans still.

The US and other western intelligence agencies aren’t going to make all their information public.

It was very stressful in 2014, especially in Odessa [clashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Odessa_clashes?wprov=sfla1) (I was there personally near Trade Unions House and my classmates were in the middle of clash in Deribasovskaya street). It was stressful when the news about war was new to us. After 8 years of living with this I just feel exhausted. 

This evening I was having a walk for about two hours (I play Ingress and also need to breath the cold fresh air after covid-related oxygen therapy), the local Telegram news channels were posting shit about people being panicking, withdrawing all their savings from ATM and sweeping emergency first needed stuff off the shops.

Putin knows Russia is in a fragile position. They are having growing discontent within the country and the economy is not doing great. NATO is moving in closer and closer to its borders and Putin likely feels like he needs to pull this move in order to prevent NATO arriving at his doorstep if Ukraine joins.

I would wager Putin has zero desire for war or to take over Ukraine. I think he’s just terrified of the idea of the power of the west’s nuclear arsenal sitting right beside them. The US are the ones who have been pushing this closer and closer to war constantly with the war-like rhetoric from the mainstream media, bought and paid for by the defence contractors. 

They bring on war hawks to try and manufacture consent for a new war since the 20 year grifting gravy train that was the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are now over and the endless money machine stopped printing.

Right. Not to mention taking action to secure a possible source of income as we prepare for the unknown. Our president told the American people today, if Russia invades, shit's gonna hit the fan for American citizens and their wallets. Particularly around fuel.

When I googled it just now to be sure that’s correct, (and of course using  Wikipedia so…not ultimate source) to verify, it reiterates that fact, stating “but it does not impose a legal obligation of military assistance on its parties.” And even military assistance is a broad term. That could just means some training. Or drowns and weapons, AKA what NATO is doing now. And it says they don’t even have to provide that. 

So this was a nice thing they all agreed to do that does absolutely nothing and does not require US troops on the ground in any way, shape or form.

So my statement above, that Ukraine doesn’t have a single alliance, is still proven true. 

In case anyone reading is confused, an alliance is NATO, or the CSTO for Russia, or the TMCSBUSJ between Japan and USA. What this commentor is talking about was essentially a broadly defined agreement which is most definitely not an alliance. There’s a major difference and it can be confusing. Ukraine has no allies. If you Google Ukrainian military alliances, you will see there are none. The top hits are Ukraine-NATO relations.

I mean a quick google could've led you to any number of lists but feel free to start at wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_war\_crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes)

>What is your definition of a war crime

Are you serious? You can't go around with a personal definition of what a war crime is. War crimes are violations of international treaties, they are not just how you personally feel about actions. I mentioned the geneva conventions as an example of one set of treaties that define what is and isn't a war crime, are you being intentionally obtuse or are you just not familiar with the term?

>And am I to understand that because the U.S. military doesn't say it committed a war crime, they must have committed war crimes

No, there are plenty of known war crimes committed by the US, see my link above and maybe take a second to look into it. I think it stands to reason that there are many many more that we don't know about but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the ones we know about.

>As I said ""war crimes"" committed by U.S. military personnel are the exception not the rule.

I don't disagree with this sentiment, any military that commits war crimes or other atrocities are spending most of their time and money on logistics and not on committing crimes. I also recognize that many war crimes are committed by rogue units, but many are not. Either way that doesn't mean that you can wash your hands of the ones you DO commit.

All I'm saying is that the US has committed many verifiable war crimes, if we want to say our country is moral and against the idea of war crimes we have to take serious action to prevent ourselves from committing them. And a HUGE part of that is owning up to it when it gets found out rather than trying to sweep it under the rug until someone leaks information about it.

Pretending like committing war crimes is no big deal as long as you do other stuff too is just putting your head in the sand. We have a duty to hold our government accountable and you can't really contribute to that effort if you're explaining away crimes as if they don't matter when we commit them.

>Individual Soldiers, Sailors, Airman and Marines are made familiar with the main tenants of the Geneva Convention

Oh so you know what the geneva convention is? Why are you asking me what my definition of war crime is?

> Individual Soldiers, Sailors, Airman and Marines are made familiar with the main tenants of the Geneva Convention. Which I might add only applies to uniformed soldiers in combat. They also are taught the difference between a lawful and unlawful order, and what to do if given an unlawful order is given. As well as a strict code of conduct. So please expound.

I don't understand the thrust of what you're arguing at all, from my perspective it seems like you're saying:

* We do commit war crimes, just not that often
* It's not that bad because we are generally good and not bad

While I'm saying

* We do commit war crimes
* We don't hold ourselves adequately responsible for those crimes
* We don't openly admit when we've committed those crimes and deal with it properly, instead we wait until someone leaks it and force them into exile

So to me it seems like we just disagree on whether war crimes are okay or not and what sort of accountability is expected for a country.",1645050933.0,1645045394.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx7r0wy,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Angela Merkel agreed with Donald Trump to spend $1 billion building a new LNG port to become more dependent on highly priced U.S. LNG. (The plan was cancelled after the U.S. and German elections changed both leaders.) But Germany has no other way of heating many of its houses and office buildings (or supplying its fertilizer companies) than with Russian gas.
The only way left for U.S. diplomats to block European purchases is to goad Russia into a military response and then claim that avenging this response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As hawkish Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained in a State Department press briefing on January 27: “If Russia invades Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”[1] The problem is to create a suitably offensive incident and depict Russia as the aggressor.
Nuland expressed who was dictating the policies of NATO members succinctly in 2014: “Fuck the EU.” That was said as she told the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine that the State Department was backing the puppet Arseniy Yatsenyuk as Ukrainian prime minister (removed after two years in a corruption scandal), and U.S. political agencies backed the bloody Maidan massacre that ushered in what are now eight years of civil war. The result devastated Ukraine much as U.S. violence had done in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. This is not a policy of world peace or democracy that European voters endorse.

160abf51b635f5f32e2fea19605501e4,stgev6,hx6b1w7,"Operation Gladio is the codename for clandestine ""stay-behind"" operations of armed resistance that were organized by the Western Union (WU), and subsequently by NATO and the CIA,[1][2] in collaboration with several European intelligence agencies.[3] The operation was designed for a potential Warsaw Pact invasion and conquest of Europe. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, ""Operation Gladio"" is used as an informal name for all of them. Stay-behind operations were prepared in many NATO member countries, and some neutral countries.[4]

During the Cold War, some anti-communist armed groups engaged in the harassment of left-wing parties, torture, terrorist attacks, and massacres in countries such as Italy.[5][6][7][8] The role of the CIA and other intelligence organisations in Gladio—the extent of its activities during the Cold War era and any responsibility for terrorist attacks perpetrated in Italy during the ""Years of Lead"" (late 1960s–early 1980s)—are the subject of debate. Researcher Francesco Cacciatore, in an article based on recently de-classified documents, writes that a ""note from March 1972 specified that the possibility of using 'Gladio' in the event of internal subversions, not provided for by the organization's statute and not supported by NATO directives or plans, was outside the scope of the original stay-behind and, therefore, 'never to be considered among the purposes of the operation'. The pressure put forward by the Americans during the 1960s to use 'Gladio' for purposes other than those of a stay-behind network would appear to have failed in the long term.""[9]

In 1990, the European Parliament adopted a resolution alleging that military secret services in certain member states were involved in serious terrorism and crime, whether or not their superiors were aware.[10] The resolution also urged investigations by the judiciaries of the countries in which those armies operated, so that their modus operandi and actual extension would be revealed.[11] To date, only Italy, Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter.[12][13]

The three inquiries reached differing conclusions as regarded different countries. Guido Salvini, a judge who worked in the Italian Massacres Commission, concluded that some right-wing terrorist organizations of the Years of Lead: La Fenice, National Vanguard and Ordine Nuovo were the trench troops of a secret army, remotely controlled by exponents of the Italian state apparatus and linked to the CIA.[14] Salvini said that the CIA encouraged them to commit atrocities.[15] The Swiss inquiry found that British intelligence secretly cooperated with their army in an operation named P-26 and provided training in combat, communications, and sabotage.[16] It also discovered that P-26 not only would organize resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, but would also become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority.[17] The Belgian inquiry could find no conclusive information on their army. No links between them and terrorist attacks were found, and the inquiry noted that the Belgian secret services refused to provide the identity of agents, which could have eliminated all doubts.[18] A 2000 Italian parliamentary report from the left wing coalition Gruppo Democratici di Sinistra l'Ulivo reported that terrorist massacres and bombings had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions who were linked to American intelligence. The report also said the United States was guilty of promoting the strategy of tension.[19] Operation Gladio is also suspected to have been activated to counter existing left-wing parliamentary majorities in Europe.[20]

Maybe you know more about the tank armor outfitting types that can be answered below?

I have no way to verify this assessment, but it has been written in US media that military strategists think 150k Russians is enough to defeat Ukraine.
I think that's mostly estimated due to Ukraine's inability to quickly resupply their forces at the borders, or allocate advanced weapons properly, regardless of how many soldiers they have.

Also commonly discussed is how exactly Russia would attack. I'm not sure the best tanks are needed if Russia has more of them?
I think Russia had something like >1200 tanks near the border since December, which is hundreds more than Ukraine has in their total ground forces.
I was also under the impression that Russian ground force maneuvers  primarily have the goal to position for artillery strikes in the typical doctrine? Therefore I really don't know how important it is to send the best tanks, or if just operating more of them is sufficient for such maneuvers. 
Also I have to assume Russian superior aerial strikes would play a part before any direct tank fighting.

We also don't know Russia's long term strategy if they do enter Ukraine.
I assume that would affect the specific ground force composition they choose to assemble, for example if they expected long term warfare in major cities, vs if they just plan to take Donbas etc.

I am not an expert on the Russian tank armor types, or in what cases the Russians would absolutely need Relikt armor.
I thought the Russians were still primarily using T-72B3, T-80U, & T-90 in their units with the older Kontakt ERA?

Maybe you can inform if you know how many Russian units now have Relikt ERA, or where they are even stationed?
In what scenario do they need the Relikt armor compared to other ERA? 
Is it only for facing Javelins or also if they expect to engage Ukrainian tanks?
Again I don't think we know for sure how often Russia's strategies/tactics will even bring them in direct contact with other tanks.",1645039780.0,1645039307.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx65jqf,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I can understand why you'd respond the way you did if you felt that's what I was trying to get across, I don't really see how you could've understood that from my comments though as I didn't draw any comparisons at all, I haven't even mentioned any other countries at all and I don't intend to.

> I am afraid war is a messy business and bad things happen

Totally. That's exactly why countries have come together to make treaties to prevent things from getting too heinous.

> How you enemy obeys the civilized rules of war often dictate how you yourself proceed

Agreed. To be clear wikipedia lists crimes against individuals and civilians, not just crimes against other factions who forced our hand when we just wanted to be good so this point kinda misses what we're talking about

> It is quite easy for someone who has never been never been in a situation to make moral judgments on others

Absolutely agree here, I'm not calling any individuals out or any specific actions, I'm talking about the concept of committing war crimes and whether I feel my government holds itself to the same standards it expects others to follow. 

In the US you definitely have to be mindful about how you vote and what you advocate for because being informed is hard and often requires perspective that you can't get from wherever you are. However that should never discourage someone from being critical of the government, especially when we are talking about such broad concepts as the idea of committing a war crime and whether you are held to account.

> I personally have never fought the Moro's in the jungles of the Philippines. But I will go out on a limb and say they never heard of the Geneva convention or the civilized rules of war

Yeah I'd just point back to the fact that there are plenty of war crimes committed against civilians and not just against enemies. I do concede that in war it's hard to argue that you should follow rules that other people don't follow.

> I don't know you, so I could be wrong. But you sound like a self loathing American. You want to show that you don't like America by nitpicking the 235 year history of the United States military for anything you can point at to show what bad people we are. That is obtuse

What I am doing here is responding to your comment refuting your assertion that war crimes in the middle east are somehow a consequence of modern culture. If you don't mind I'd prefer if you stuck to the topic and responded to the points rather than ascribe malice or personality traits. I'm just going to continue responding to your points and enjoy the discussion rather than try to dress you down as a person.

As far as the notion of ""show what bad people we are"", if you think that every American who disagrees with the government is as you describe, you must not talk to many Americans. It feels like you're getting defensive rather than addressing my points, I don't mean to attack you personally here and I don't think anyone is bad just by virtue of being a citizen of a country.

> If you could possibly score out something like proper prosection of a war, exactly how many mass Graves around the world will you find caused by American troops? What you will find is military cemeteries full of Americans who died defending others.

I don't really follow what this has to do with what we're talking about.  
Imagine if a kid breaks something of yours and the parents come and say ""My kid is good way more often then he's bad!"" or ""If you could possibly score out something like proper prosection of a war, exactly how many mass Graves around the world will you find caused by my child"" you would probably say something like ""Why does that have anything to do with what we're talking about"" and they say back ""I think you just hate kids and want to make a point of showing how bad kids are"".. Not exactly an intellectual conversation and probably not going to lead anywhere, would you agree?

I think I've made some solid points on why I think you're incorrect about your assertion but I'm struggling to see any response to those points, all I see is non-sequitors and ad-hominems.

If I was forced to bet, I would also guess not a full invasion.

Like you said, it also may just be lucky and the weather prevents him from doing something.

The nuance with his military buildup is that it could either mean true action for the purpose of territory gain, or true appearance of action for other important geopolitical gain. This is complicated by the fact that he has actual reasons that overlap for both, and has already taken territory a few years ago.

So what does he gain with:

1) Invasion ----> Means he gets to add more territory that is meaningful for  the Russian identity.
Probably at this point it would be limited to Donbas, if anything.
In that scenario, he gets to continue normalizing the idea of territory gain to improve the Russian position, while preventing an all out bloody conflict with Ukrainians.
But... maybe he is really that desperate to invade Ukraine to keep it from joining NATO for the same reason here in #2.


2) The appearance of invasion----> Supposedly the idea was that NATO might finally allow concessions toward Putin's other main goal to prevent more Aegis missile deployments, or removal of existing ones in the Baltics, Poland, Romania etc. as long as it seems the threat of invasion was credible.
The claim is, this is so important to Putin because it is destroying a source of Russia's world power by weakening their ability to launch nuclear ballistic missiles.
The fact that he invaded Crimea before works in his favor to provide this pressure.

If his motivation is actually #2, The reason US and NATO still have an ""exaggerated"" response is because they also have to present a credible reactionary effort in order to achieve geopolitical deterrence. Otherwise, if Putin thinks the price of sanctions/ military losses / negative-opinions will be low enough, he might actually take #1 if he does not get #2. 

In that case, it comes at a low price of  ""2 for 1 Donbas/Crimea deal please"".",1645055681.0,1645053542.0,t3_stgev6,t1_hx7qt3j,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

I can recall several incident's in the Iraqi and Afghan conflict that the press tried to turn into war crimes. There was the Marine who shot a dead or faking insurgent while breaching a building. Abu Ghrab(sp) being made uncomfortable, embarrassed and or sleep deprived, are valuable and pretty standard interrogation techniques. Now the elephant in the room, waterboarding. By the modern definition this considered torture. Torture is prohibited by treaty and convention. But by what appears to be the modern definition giving a prisoner of war anything but three hots and cot is torture. May I also remind you, combatants captured out of uniform are subject to execution. A standard that has been accepted for a long time. Spying out of uniform subject to execution, attempting to disguise ones self as a combatant by hiding in the civilian population, subject to execution. Once again a long accepted practice and a universal acceptance that fighters in these situations are not entitled to protection under convention. I recall an incident of American soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants. Not a war crime. I also recall all of the people in these incidents be held accountable. I would also point out to my knowledge Iraq and Afghanistan are not signatory on the Geneva convention. So what war crimes were committed by coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan?

Germany started both world wars by illegally invading other countries.  


In both cases Russia fought against them. 

They entered ww1 to defend their ally against German invasion. They entered ww2 when Germany invaded them.

**10 years later Germany is part of NATO  alliance targeted against the soviet Union with the USA as a key member.**  


I know modern day germany is not nazi germany and im sure USA had plenty of ""good excuses"" for all the invasions and bombings they have committed over the last 40 years....**but**...  


....From a Russian standpoint, NATO is an alliance of all the most warmongering countries of the 20th century formed with the explicit goal of shutting down soviet communism.  


They are not going to pop champagne when they see an ex soviet ally joining NATO. They know how this ends.  


USA is not a live and let live country.  They are regime changers.   


They are the biggest threat facing putins rule.

True, and I'm not knowing either. But as much I distrust Russia, I distrust NATO generals. Their sole reason of existence is that Russia is a threat, and is seen as a threat. So if NATO generals speculate that Russia is going to invade, my first instinct is to doubt them.

Compare Russian and Ukrainian forces for yourself, Ukraine has 4 times the manpower. Then try to identify the Russian gear used, the tanks are old and not close to their newest iteration.
