The last couple of days continued to be mostly quiet, there were a couple of times where many people reported hearing explosions (which we also heard), but there were no confirmed hits on any target afterwards, so we don’t actually know what those explosions were, if they were explosions at all. The most notable thing that happened recently was an emergency three days ago, when lighting struck a gas pipe, which caused a giant fire that was visible from almost anywhere in the city. 

There were reports of missiles and drones potentially being launched around the same time, so at first people thought that they might be the cause of this fire. During a thunderstorm it’s basically impossible to tell explosions and thunder apart, so it’s not surprising that people thought that we were hit with missiles. And in the first couple of months of this war Russians almost always used to shell Kharkiv during thunderstorm to mask the sound, which really sucked because we didn’t know which sounds meant danger.

It also looks like the next missile strike is happening right now. Apparently, some missiles have already entered our airspace, and they will be nearing their targets within the next hour. Most of them will get intercepted, but they are also launching S-300 missiles at Zaporizhzhia at the same time, which are much harder to intercept, and sadly at least some of those will get through, because we don’t yet have enough Patriots to protect all of our cities from ballistic missiles.",False,1687474859.0,t3_14fssdq,t3_14fssdq,,0,145,0,145,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-22-23/index.html

""Ukraine's advance on Russia will ""take time,"" the Ukrainian prime minister said, while expressing optimism for the counteroffensive.  

Denys Shmyhal called on Ukrainians to be patient while speaking in London at the Ukraine Recovery Conference.

Shmyhal said there will be ""results of the counteroffensive"" but added that ""Ukraine values the lives of its soldiers, so it does not plan to lead them mindlessly under fire,"" according to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform.

""We must all understand that every life is important to us. We will not lead our people under fire, as the Russian army does, which has not counted and does not count people's lives. We are working according to NATO standards; we are taking care of each of our soldiers, and we are taking steps forward. It will take time, but we intend to advance, and we are advancing with a counteroffensive. We all have to be patient and we will see the results,"" he said.

More context: CNN reported earlier Thursday that the early phases of Ukraine’s counteroffensive is having less success and Russian forces are showing more competence than Western assessments expected, according to two Western officials and a senior US military official.

The officials cautioned that the counteroffensive is still in its beginning stages – and the US and its allies “remain optimistic” Ukrainian forces will be able to make territorial gains over time. In addition, these officials note that Ukrainian forces have themselves been adapting to Russian tactics and defenses, including carrying out more dismounted operations. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have also had more success targeting and shooting down Russian aircraft.

And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted Wednesday in a BBC interview that progress had been ""slower than desired,"" he added that ""nevertheless, those who fight shall win and to those that knock, the door shall be opened.""",False,1687464293.0,t3_14fssdq,t3_14fssdq,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-22-23/index.html

""Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that Ukraine has not depleted its ""offensive potential,"" adding that it has a ""number of strategic reserves that have not yet been activated,"" while addressing members of his Security Council in Moscow Thursday.   

Despite having claimed that Ukrainian forces are losing ground, Putin cautioned that Russian armed forces need to ""proceed for the realities"" when ""building combat work.""

Ukraine's Western allies have made it clear they have ""really decided to fight with Russia to the last Ukrainian,"" he added.

On Wednesday, Putin told reporters that there is a ""certain lull"" in fighting, with no active offensive operations being carried out by Ukraine yet. He claimed Ukraine is suffering heavy losses on the battlefield.

CNN is not able to independently verify Putin's claims about Ukrainian loses or the course of the operations on the ground.

""But today we see that this (Ukraine's) offensive potential has not yet been exhausted, there are also reserves that the enemy is thinking about where and how to introduce,"" he said. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine claimed Wednesday that Russian forces are on the defensive in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region directions, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing.""",False,1687464116.0,t3_14fssdq,t3_14fssdq,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

>
>The United States, Europe and other countries have imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow. In an effort to hurt Russia but keep global supplies steady, the West also imposed a cap on the price Russia could charge for its oil.

>
>In addition to stoking India’s economy, cheap Russian oil has given India a lucrative business refining that crude and exporting the products to other regions that suddenly need fresh energy supplies. That includes the European Union, which has banned direct oil purchases from Russia.
>
>China and India are buying so much Russian oil now that Moscow is selling more crude than it was before it invaded Ukraine. At the same time, lower prices have meant that the Russian government is earning less revenue on its oil trade.
>
>The reasons for falling oil prices are complex, and experts debate how much they are because of the West’s price cap, or merely the result of a slowing global demand. Either way, India has found a way to take advantage of the situation.
>
>The bulk of the crude that goes to India from Russia arrives at ports near Jamnagar in Gujarat State and is piped to nearby refineries.
>
>So as the trade in this region grows, Russian companies — and, by extension, Moscow — are reaping some of the benefits.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-22-23/index.html

""Russia launched attacks on populated areas of Ukraine on Thursday destroying infrastructure and causing civilians to suffer, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine said Russia launched 44 air strikes and fired about 30 multiple rocket launcher systems over the last day.  

In the south, Russia continues to be on the defensive, focusing its ""main efforts"" on preventing the advance of Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, the military said.

Ukraine has also claimed ""partial success"" in the south against Russia where the Ukrainian offensive continues, though the ""situation has not changed significantly over the past day,"" Hanna Maliar, deputy defense Minister of Ukraine, said in her latest update.

""We are gradually advancing, having partial success, pushing the enemy back and leveling the front,"" she said. ""The Ukrainian defense forces continue their offensive on the Melitopol and Berdiansk directions. In some areas, we have advanced and are consolidating our positions.""

Ukraine's air force carried out seven strikes on Russian military personnel and four on anti-aircraft missile systems, striking a command post and ammunition depots, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. 

Heavy fighting continues in the east, especially in the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka directions — where Russia continues its main assault, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said.

Ukrainian forces conducted both offensive and defensive operations over the day but continue to ""effectively restrain the offensive of Russian troops"" in those eastern sectors, Maliar said.

""The enemy has not advanced a single meter,"" she claimed.

Russia conducted ""unsuccessful"" attacks and an air strike in the Kharkiv region as well as air strikes in the Luhansk and Donetsk region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, adding that Russia was also unsuccessful in its offensives in the area of Sieverne and Avdiivka and in the Donetsk region.""",False,1687464457.0,t3_14fssdq,t3_14fssdq,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-22-23/index.html

""In its early phases, Ukraine’s counteroffensive is having less success and Russian forces are showing more competence than western assessments expected, two western officials and a senior US military official tell CNN.

The counteroffensive is “not meeting expectations on any front,” one of the officials said.

According to Western assessments, Russian lines of defense have been proving well-fortified, making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to breach them. In addition, Russian forces have had success bogging down Ukrainian armor with missile attacks and mines and have been deploying air power more effectively. Several officials also told CNN that adverse weather was proving an issue for Ukrainian forces.

Despite the assessment, officials cautioned that the counteroffensive is still in its early stages – and that the US and its allies “remain optimistic” that Ukrainian forces will be able to make territorial gains over time. The US and its allies are likely to wait until at least July for a fuller assessment of the progress of the counteroffensive which was gradually launched over the last few weeks.

In addition, these officials note that Ukrainian forces have themselves been adapting to Russian tactics and defenses, including carrying out more dismounted operations. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have also had more success targeting and shooting down Russian aircraft.

Ultimately, the counteroffensive is proving a “tough drive” for Ukraine and Russia, one of the Western officials said, with both sides incurring heavy losses.

The last time it occurred it was on may 30th. By increasing its value by about 6 rubles for about 7-8 hours and then returning back to its normal value.

Just before anyone claim that the Russian value is manually manipulated. What's important here is more the reason why they would want to increase the value for a brief amount of time. 

Keep in mind that 7 days after doing that, the Khakovka dam got destroyed. It could be unrelated or it could be just a scheme for people moving a lot of money suddenly and being able to do the transaction at a good rate for the Russian side. Like moving money out of Russia before a catastrophic event is about to occur.

9ca1260e4f95516165acd5c5cd0330b1,14fssdq,jp2nej9,"It takes a certain amount of fear to paralyse seasoned military-intelligence officers. But a Russian attack on the officers’ Rybalsky island headquarters in Kyiv in March 2022 crossed that threshold. The officers recall “terror” as missiles landed, windows popped and ramshackle buildings crumbled at the edges. The men, waiting in a reception area for a meeting with their boss, fell to the floor. Moments later a door beside them opened, and Major-General Kyrylo Budanov stepped out. “Everything is fine,” one recalls him grunting, before he ordered them to get back to work. “He dusted himself off, put his cap on and went outside to inspect the damage.”

The 37-year-old General Budanov, a former commando, is the architect of increasingly brazen operations within Russia, making him a big irritant for the Kremlin. Aides to the spymaster say there have been “at least ten” attempts on his life. In the latest, on May 29th, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones targeted his Rybalsky office. They narrowly missed that and an adjacent road bridge, although drones scraped another building. A day later Vladimir Putin bragged about a “precision” attack destroying the complex. Pro-Kremlin media reported that General Budanov had been evacuated to Germany and put into a coma. The Economist can confirm that neither claim is true.

The spymaster’s office, his undisguised address for 16 months, exudes chaotic, crepuscular energy. Sandbags block windows. Machine-guns and armour litter the floor. A turntable sits in the corner, though the audible Vivaldi comes from a YouTube playlist. The sense of absurdity is heightened by an elderly frog, swimming about a tank, and a canary. Memorabilia from General Budanov’s war line the wall. On an adjacent corridor hangs a photo of a March cross-border raid into Bryansk in Russia, supposedly the work of independent Russian partisans. A large screen, the room’s only source of light, displays a map of Moscow—the target of a drone strike in May.


Ukraine has not claimed either operation. But General Budanov barely respects the official ambiguity. “We are at war,” he says. “Drones over the Kremlin showed the world that Russian defences are just a Potemkin village.”

Aides huddle close when the general speaks. Under his leadership Ukraine’s main directorate of intelligence—hur—has become a plucky, autonomous authority that punches above its weight. It resembles a gang. “Before we had managers, now we have a leader,” says one veteran officer. Oleg, an operative who has known General Budanov for decades, speaks approvingly of his ability to infect others with his fervour, comparing him to a snake “hypnotising you before he comes in for the kill. Restrained, measured, never panicked. You do anything he asks.”

General Budanov has his adversaries at home as well as abroad. Competing security agencies fret about his power and resources. “It’s logical that military intelligence becomes powerful during war,” says one rival officer. “But you can’t get much done without his sign-off now.” Even friends describe the military-intelligence chief as “difficult”. Some find it hard to get on with him, says Brigadier General Dmytro Timkov, a partner on “dozens” of operations. “He doesn’t adapt to others’ opinions.” The younger Budanov would answer back to commanders if he thought them wrong. Yet supporters say he has a “generous” side, too. A master of mind games in the outside world, says Oleg, General Budanov never extended that to colleagues. “He understands you can’t trick tricksters.”

Volodymyr Zelensky’s decision in 2020 to promote a little-known commander came as a surprise to many. But inside the services Kyrylo Budanov’s name was already legendary. The Kremlin knew something about him, too. “It was the equivalent of holding a red flag to them,” says Andrii Yusov, an hur officer. “It’s what convinced many of us of [President] Zelensky’s national-security credentials.”

The incoming spymaster was revered as the commander of a daring raid, in 2016, to destroy helicopters at Dzhankoi air base in Russian-occupied Crimea. The geography of the operation—in the backyard of Russia’s security services—was brazen enough. On the way out General Budanov’s team also engaged Russian special forces, killing several, including a high-ranking commander. The Russians later avenged that raid with attacks of their own, missing General Budanov but killing his direct superior.

General Timkov, reputed to be the second-in-command on that raid, chortles through an unconvincing denial of the operation. But he offers another story that only adds to the spymaster’s legend. In early 2015, he says, the two were deep inside enemy lines in Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, when then-Lieutenant Colonel Budanov was hit by an anti-infantry mine. Shrapnel sunk into his neck and shoulder-blade, and just below his heart. “Kyrylo asked us to leave him.” But the group refused, and through force of willpower the wounded officer stumbled to safety more than 3km away. “He didn’t say anything the whole way. That’s how much it hurt.”

As the new spymaster at hur, General Budanov pushed an “anything-possible” attitude. A rescue mission to evacuate Afghans and other foreign nationals from Kabul in 2021 earned him praise. But he really made his mark after the full-scale invasion. In the early days, as saboteurs operated in Kyiv, the general was seen running about Rybalsky with a machine-gun. He masterminded critical operations at Hostomel airport, Irpin and Moschun, on the edge of Kyiv, which stopped the Russian advance—if only just. He sent supply-and-rescue helicopters into the cauldron of besieged Mariupol. He took part in many frontline operations himself. The risk-taking worried some colleagues, who felt their leader should be better protected—“but you try stopping him.” The general says he does it only because other people are in danger. “Lives are at stake. There is no room for mistakes.”

Western partners describe the Ukrainian spymaster as a straightforward and incorruptible player. He is now privy to more American and British intelligence than the Germans or French, says Philip Ingram, a former British military-intelligence colonel. Yet his bravado is not universally welcomed. Leaked documents show that the cia had to intervene to stop General Budanov from ordering an attack on Moscow on the anniversary of the invasion in February. Sabotage and the raids inside Russia since have heightened worries among Ukraine’s allies about provoking a nuclear power. General Budanov’s statements about engineering a collapse of Russia do the same.

Yet he says that nine years of studying Russian aggression leave him uniquely positioned to assess the risks of nuclear escalation. “As the head of intelligence, I’m telling you straight out, it’s not going to happen,” he says. “For all my dislike of the Russian Federation, there are not many idiots running the country.” He insists that peace is impossible without the strategic defeat of Russia—and the “reformatting of power” there. “Either everyone will get out of the war at the same time, or one side will lose and the other side will win. There are no other options.”

As a confidant of the president—those in government call them kindred spirits—General Budanov is understood to be playing an ever-bigger role in behind-the-scenes peace negotiations. Sources say he is a conduit to secret talks with the Chinese, and he has also been in contact with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia’s mercenary Wagner outfit.

In conversation it is clear that General Budanov has been thinking hard about postwar Ukraine. Last winter there was talk of him becoming defence minister. He insists his only political ambition is victory over Russia. Yet secret polls conducted by Mr Zelensky’s office show they are thinking about using the cult of their hero spymaster to counterbalance the (perceived) threat posed by Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s likeable and independent commander-in-chief. General Budanov’s colleagues say they are convinced he is destined for a big political role once peace comes—if he lives that long. ■",False,1687427370.0,t3_14fssdq,t1_jp2ncz5,,1,69,0,69,0,0,

I’m optimistic about the offensive and I’m not talking out of my ass either. Operational pauses happen in big offensives and sometimes things go better than expected and sometimes things don’t go as well as expected. I’ve been impressed with Ukraine so far and I don’t see that changing soon but at the same time we don’t need to pretend thar every part of the operation is a stunning success either. Ukraine is taking calculated risks and is being slow but deliberate in how they fight and that is ultimately how big wars are won. Russia is also using a lot of their combat power to slow down the Ukrainian advances and it’s unclear how sustainable that is for Russia. Nothing that I’ve read is THAT alarming but I also don’t believe in pretending that everything has been a great success either.

Such bias, as understandable as it is, clouds analysis. We remember the hits and forget the misses more often than a truly objective person would.

That's not to say CNN is great. But we're in danger of engaging in the same rhetoric that Trump people did when attempting to discredit stories about him (""who are these anonymous sources, they could be anybody""). In reality, all semi credible news sources tend to do a decent job of both vetting sources *and* keeping them anonymous. Anonymity does not indicate lack of reliability. It doesn't automatically indicate reliability either, but we have to judge based on the source. CNN seems to be moving to the right, which makes them suspect, but I don't think it's fair to say that they've reached the point that we can discredit their *reporting* from sources (ignoring their opinion pieces, sure).

The reality is that Ukraine will have successes and failures. Russia has poorly trained troops with low morale, incompetent leadership, and bad logistics. But they're still large and well armed. They will have successes too along with their failures.

In WW2 the allies had numerous failings: the Maginot line and the overall defence of France, Dieppe, Market Garden, various setbacks in North Africa against Rommel, etc. And the allies still won.

We should avoid rose coloured glasses, and look at this realistically with expectations tampered. It looks like the counteroffensive has been initially a bit underwhelming, but has lots of time and resources to still be successful, and in any event there will be losses.

In light of this, my argument is that the strategic ambiguity we currently have (make it clear via back channels what the response will be, but not make it public so there’s no incentive for an attempt to publicly call a bluff) is most likely by far the best strategy, and hence trying to kill this via an explicit law that removes all strategic ambiguity is a very bad idea.",False,1687475606.0,t3_14fssdq,t1_jp5k9fz,,6,0,0,0,0,0,

Hmm, check your source again. It wasn't Webster that said that, but the AP. The Associated Press. And they said nothing about norms. In fact, Webster said chomping is a variation. My point was that chomping had become the norm. No part of the rest of the article contradicted that, so I'm not sure why you accused me of cherry picking.

You seem to be taking the prescriptive approach to grammar, but a lot of people, myself included, are okay with the descriptive approach. Instead of grammar being a source of authority on how to use language, we look to it as a snapshot of how the language is currently being used. In other words, we don't care what the word is as long as we know what it means. 

You also throw in some UK elitism in there, but even your own country is not a monolith on grammar. As a famous British playwright once wrote: ""What's in a name?

You're right. Good news gets amplified but bad news gets shouted down. Such is the way of information warfare. 

However, it's not wrong to question a source's legitimacy, especially when a source is anonymous. This is the equivalent of CNN saying, 'Trust me, bro.' Sometimes that's fine. CNN is a legitimate news organization with an extended track record of honest journalism. If CNN believes the claims of these anonymous sources, then their credibility becomes their source's credibility. 

That said, I don't question that some western officials said they expected the offensive to move faster, but I do question their metric of success. If it's only land then how do they factor in the detonation of the Nova Kakhovka dam? It essentially allowed the Russians to abandon an entire front, redeploying those forces to halt the Ukrainian advance. What if the Ukrainians noticed the drastic change in the battlefield conditions, noted a time period in the very near future where the dropping water levels would open another vector of attack, and chose to take a more measured approach to their offensive? 

If the Ukrainians are deliberately slow-walking the offensive, if the Russians are able to bring more soldiers to bear than previously anticipated due to the abandonment of the Kherson front, if Russia is actively counterattacking and experiencing an unfavorable casualty ratio, and if we've still got three months of summer left, then what the fuck is the hurry? 

That's why I question this story. It's vapid. The journalist makes no mention of possible reasons besides, 'There are mines than we thought there'd be.' They lack the know-how to ask important follow up questions.

The Russian artillery and helicopter strikes have forced Ukraine to break into smaller groups which are useful for probing and aren’t large targets but they also make big advances and breakthroughs challenging. Minefields also make movement harder because even if you create an opening against enemy forces you cannot rush through minefields. None of these are insurmountable challenges by any means but they have seemed to work to slow down the offensive. Ukrainian forces and their high command have repeatedly played their hand exceptionally well and I think they’re continuing to do so.

If us directly fighting with them at the height the Cold War didn’t set it off, why is this different? Russia knows launching a nuke is a losing battle.
