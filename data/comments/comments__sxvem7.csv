The historic borders of Luhansk and Donetsk regions are much larger than the exiting pro-Moscow-run areas. Key Ukrainian cities include the port city of Mariupol, Kramatorsk- where Ukraine’s army has its eastern HQ - and numerous villages.  
  
“Those regions are regular towns where people live regular lives. Any attempt to occupy those areas would be direct violent aggression by Russia onto Ukraine. There would be war,” Zagorodnyuk said. He added: “There would some attacks, resistance, deaths, casualties, losses. And there would be trials against Putin as a war criminal.  
  
He continued: “Ukraine has lots of weapons there and Ukraine is not going to give it up just like that. Why the hell should we? It’s like someone comes to UK and says ‘Now I think this town should belong to France’. Obviously it’s going to be a very nasty process, dramatic and tragic.  
  
“The legal consequences of that are exactly as if the Russian go to Kyiv. it’s the same territory of the same sovereign state.”

USSR screwed up by allowing Ukraine to break away. The current government in Ukraine is made up of nationalists, extremists and Nazis who side with the West using Russophobia to hold power.

Corruption has permeated the entirety of Ukraine, and protesters in Ukraine received $1m a day from the United States. Extremists then came to power and began a reign of terror throughout Ukraine.

6m Ukrainians (15%) had to move out to find work because of the social collapse of Ukraine. 

Ukraine is growing poorer. The economy is in ruins and is being looted under the sway of foreign elements. NGO's and internal Branches are looting. Nothing is independent in Ukraine. The embassy of the US controls the Courts and state attorney office in Ukraine.

Ukraine is not a state, it is a colony with a puppet regime that's destroying Ukrainian sovereignty.

Russians in Ukraine are treated as foreigners. The Russian language is being excluded from all society. There is no freedom of speech. Ukrainian officials are persecuting their own citizens. The Orthodox Church is being oppressed via religious schism.

Crimea made their own choice. Ukraine is using extremists, Islamic radicals as a diversion. Ukraine is kidnapping Russian people, with support from foreign nations.

In 2021, a new military strategy in Ukraine was opposition to Russia. Ukraine is trying to rope the international community into a direct conflict with Russia leading to nuclear conflict. Ukraine is trying to attain nuclear weapons, Ukraine can acquire tactical nukes with foreign assistance. We cannot let this happen.

Ukraine can never have nuclear weapons. Russia must prevent this from happening. The US has spent billions in providing Ukraine with weapons and training. There are NATO troops in Ukraine and the command of Ukrainian units is under the Chief of Staff of NATO.

There are foreign missiles in Kyiv, confirmed that Ukraine will join NATO. You cannot establish your own security if you are threatening someone else's security. 2018 Bucharest Summit, Georgia and Ukraine would in time become members of NATO. The risk of this decision. For us tomorrow or down the road, the American Leaders have said that if there is a military conflict in Ukraine this would not prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

In 1990, the US promised the USSR that there would not be an enlargement of NATO to the East after the unification of Germany. Eastern European nations used Russophobia to gain NATO membership.

In 2000, Clinton visited Russia. Putin asked Clinton how the Americans would react to Russia joining NATO. Clinton's reaction was moderate. The US then supported the terrorists, didn't listen to Russia in regard to the missile treaty. The US does not want Russia to exist. Goes on to list all the Eastern European NATO members. This is the source of the security crisis and mutual trust is gone.

NATO is preparing to deploy missiles in Romania and Poland. This is something that is happening in Ukraine. This is a danger to Russia especially with unexpected strikes. The Military Doctrine of the US that the US can and will carry out preventable strikes, and Russia is the main enemy to the US.

Ukrainian airports are close to Russia and NATO could set up missiles near these airports and strike major cities in Russia. The US can strike Russia with Tomahawk missiles, hypersonic missiles, that can strike Russia within 30 mins. The US will undeniably attack Russia with these weapons if given the chance.

2008 Russia suggested a new security system. No country can increase its security if it came at the expense of another's security. This was rejected.

In December, Russia proposed to a security treaty. US was vague and not interested in negotiating. Russia demanded that NATO stop enlarging, np defensive systems, the return of NATO borders back to their original position. These were the main points Russia made but were ignored by NATO.

Russia is black mailed with sanctions but these will happen anyway when Russia tries to reinforce its sovereignty. The objective in Ukraine is to limit Russia, to prevent Russia from existing.

Russia's proposals are being ignored. Russia will take all necessary measures to ensure its security. The power in Kyiv does not want to implement Minsk Agreements. The Kyiv government wants another civil conflict in Eastern Ukraine.

There is no end to the bloodbath happening in the East but the West is turning a blind eye to the genocide against the 4M people in the East.

We are seeing a rise in Nationalism, preventing the use of Russian language and identity.

The regime is not legitimate in Ukraine and has chosen violence in Donbass. We have no choice but to recognize the sovereignty of the DNR/LHN regions.

[https://www.ft.com/content/51fb7e97-db8d-4d77-a10a-23b807c5a7a1](https://www.ft.com/content/51fb7e97-db8d-4d77-a10a-23b807c5a7a1)

>US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, have already warned their Russian counterparts that an invasion would be followed by an insurgency like the one that drove the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan, the New York Times reported last week. Biden administration officials have also told allies the CIA and Pentagon would help any Ukrainian insurgency with covert and overt aid.  
>  
>“Nobody thinks Ukraine is something you can just grab,” said one senior former Kremlin official. “It’d be very unpopular domestically because many people have relatives there, and you can’t hold the territory because of partisan warfare.”  
>  
>Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based defence think-tank, said Russia would likely stick to “managed escalation” in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, ravaged by a conflict with Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.  
>  
>“In Aleppo and Grozny, Russian forces could reduce the towns to rubble, plant a flag on top and declare victory,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia military expert. “But Ukraine is a brother country.”  
>  
>Ukraine has a long history of resistance movements, and the government passed a law last year for “total national defence” that gave special operations command responsibility for organising resistance forces.  
>  
>Nationalist insurgents fought Soviet forces in the west of the country until 1949. Much of the fighting against Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas was also undertaken by volunteer battalions, who notched up some battleground victories and have since been incorporated into the national guard.  
>  
>“The resistance in Kyiv would be huge,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister and director of the Centre for Defence Strategies think-tank.  
>  
>Another complication is eastern Ukraine’s open terrain, which makes it ill-suited to guerrilla warfare. The cost to life may also render resistance futile.  
>  
>“There has been a lot of talk about Ukrainian resistance — a gun in every window,” Samuel Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, told UK MPs this month.   
>  
>“But given that we have seen what Russian counter-insurgency looks like in Syria and Chechnya . . . that eventuality should be treated with some level of concern because it would be potentially a humanitarian disaster.”",1645462005.0,1645461931.0,t3_sxvem7,t3_sxvem7,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

It's almost like they feel somehow threatened by somebody, or that they've seen their neighbor's borders actually violated recently.

None of these countries have any interest in attacking Russia.

And now he's fussing over ground-based Tomahawk missiles, which is a legitimate concern to talk about/negotiate ... except that [Russia was ""allegedly"" violating the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty for years with their own missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty\#Initial_skepticism_and_allegations_of_treaty_violations).  It's why the US eventually pulled out of the treaty.  Maybe this is the occasion for a revived INF treaty rather than invading neighboring countries?

Edit: Damn this guy feels insecure for someone who has placed almost 200k troops along their border.

Edit 2: He keeps calling Ukraine's government a ""coup"".  I wish he'd make up his mind.  If someone seizes power in a territory, and then subsequently holds a democratic election, does that somehow validate the outcome (e.g., Crimea post-foreign-invasion, supposedly) or does it not (e.g., what he claims about Ukraine 8 years and multiple elections later)?

The US did not make Russia put over 200,000 Russian soldiers at Ukraines border. The US did not make Putin himself highly imply a nuclear war might occur if Ukraine joins NATO. The US did not make the Russian parliament ask Putin to recognize these regions within Ukraine to become independent which the only way that will occur, is if they invade Ukraine.

What the US has done as well as the West is say loudly every bit of Intel they are getting on this to put all the spotlight on what Russia is doing. At the same time, the US and the West are begging Russia to prove them wrong. Make it true that this is all apparently propaganda by not invading Ukraine. At the UN, the US Council said they want to be proven wrong. Biden has said he hopes to be proven wrong. These are not the words or actions of people who want a war.

Edit 2 
A lot of history lessons most importantly 

He’s talking about communists pandering to nationalists and how they created a mess wrong ethnicities. And about how this all lead to Nazi sympathizers.

Edit 3

Putin is saying how Ukrainian politicians have been destroying their own country, with it dropping to one of the poorest in Europe, by politicians/oligarchs pretending to be pro-democracy whilst looting their own nation. 

He then mentions how in 2014 the people of ukraine were frustrated by all this and revolted. But the radicals took front stage and managed to seize power. He ‘smirked’ at how no one talks about the violence and killings after this happened. How 6 million Ukrainians have since left for work outside of the country.

&#x200B;

Putin to decide on recognising breakaway regions on Monday  
Andrew Roth Andrew Roth  
Vladimir Putin has said he is considering recognising the Russian-controlled territories in southeast Ukraine as independent states in what would be a pivotal decision, scuttling an existing peace agreement and possibly triggering tough new sanctions from the west.  
  
In an extraordinary meeting of his security council broadcast on national television, the Russian president said he would make a decision later on Monday following a choreographed back-and-forth with his top advisers designed to prepare public support for the decision.  
  
“We’ve been negotiating for eight years,” Putin told his aides at one point. “We’re at a dead end.”  
  
In turn, each of Putin’s top advisers stood at a lectern and delivered a speech that ended in favour of recognition of the separatist states in Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which have been at war with Kyiv since 2014.  
  
It ended in a made-for-TV cliffhanger. “I have heard your opinion – a decision will be made today,” Putin said.  
  
Russia has controlled and armed the two states since the outbreak of fighting in southeast Ukraine following a revolution in Kyiv in 2014, but wanted to keep them in Ukraine with the right to veto crucial decisions like membership in Nato.  
  
Ukraine has said it will contest any decision by Russia to recognise the territories’ independence and would recognise the move as a Russian decision to exit the Minsk agreements, the peace deal signed in 2015 that appears close to collapse.  
  
Putin may still choose not to recognise the two states’ independence, using the staged debate with his advisors to show the western leaders that they are running out of time to negotiate. But it appears more likely he will follow the unanimous advice of his aides and close allies to recognise the two territories in a dangerous shift of the status quo.  
  
The decision could either freeze the conflict in southeast Ukraine or reignite it, depending on the Ukrainian response and whether Putin seeks to take further territory.

eb5bdc82bd1c9f94d2f4dab1ad290173,sxvem7,hxumj8u,"A lot of people are asking about summaries of todays event. This is from The Guardian:

Here is a summary of events so far, on a day when fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine reached boiling point.  
  
Ukraine has rejected as “fake news” a claim from the Russian army that it killed five “saboteurs” attempting to cross the border in the Russian region of Rostov. Ukrainian officials said not a single soldier had been killed and their forces were not present in the Rostov region.  
Vladimir Putin promised to take a decision on whether to recognise two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine later on Monday, after leaders of the self-declared republics appealed to the Kremlin to recognise their independence in co-ordinated statements on Russian state TV.  
The Russian president was speaking at an impromptu meeting of Russia’s national security council, where top officials lined up to echo nationalist talking points, such as the baseless claims of genocide in eastern Ukraine and drawing parallels with Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia. The meeting was broadcast on Russian state television: Putin said it was “happening spontaneously, because I wanted to hear your opinions without any preliminary preparation” - a line at an eye-rolling distance from the staged nature of the event.  
Earlier in the day Putin’s spokesman said talk of a summit between the Russian president and Joe Biden was premature. The two leaders could arrange a call or meeting at any time but there were no concrete plans for a high-level encounter, he said.  
Western officials believe Putin is now poised to invade, as they said the Russian military build up continues.  
Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the EU to impose sanctions on Russia now, a call backed by Lithuania, whose foreign minister said Ukraine was under attack. But foreign ministers meeting in Brussels declined to follow this path. Instead the EU high representative on foreign policy, Josep Borrell, repeated his promise the EU would act “at the right moment”.

This likely sets the stage for a meeting of the Security Council where Ukraine can put its case to the world. Any of the current members can request an urgent meeting, which has to be held within 24 hours of the formal demand going in.

Russia is currently president and so may be able to control whether the meeting is closed or open. However Western member countries that have been pushing hard for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis are likely to group together in a show of strength, to try and ensure the cameras of the world’s media can record the gathering, one envoy said.

Kuleba warned that any move to give the territories official status would represent a dangerous escalation.

“Not only Ukraine, the entire world now closely follows Russia’s actions regarding the recognition of the so-called ‘L/DPR’. Everyone realizes consequences. A lot of emotions out there, but it’s exactly now that we all should calmly focus on de-escalation efforts. No other way.”

Ukraine claims that under an agreement signed as part of efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the country in the post-Soviet era, the west undertook to protect the country from external attack. The Budapest memorandum was signed by three nuclear powers – Russia, the US and the UK – in December 1994,

- I am embarrassed that Macron's made us look like idiots because he used the gravity of the situation for street cred during an election year (April)
Edit : I support acting in favor or world peace. But the fact that French officials tried to orchestrate fake media leaks minutes after the end of this meeting that they had to backpedal after Kremlin denied their allegation shows that the current French governement's move was opportunistic and motivated by self interest. Also if you know Macron like French people know him you would never let him speak to Putin in a time this. The guy can't keep his mouth shut and he has a tendancy to say things that irate people VERY easily. Not your best negotiator I'm affraid
- Ukrainian and russian people, I like you both, as a European it's sad to see we are the theater of this old West/East schtick dividing us
- I like the idea of not having to go to war
- I would like my country to stay out this but I know we won't. Even though there's no conscription model RN, anything's possible at that point

Are we seriously at the turning point? Is it my duty as a citizen to rally and take part into a proxy war that's so absurd everybody can see the writing in the wall?
I never thought I would have to ask myself those kinds of questions. Edit : for the ones actually living in Ukraine and telling me to grow a spine. Well no, I'm not a career soldier. Call me the names you want, but I'm not willing to fight for another country than mine (and even that I have problems with). And I don't think that rallying everybody to the poker table that is the ukraine is a good thing either. I have seen enough material to know what full scale war does to a land and their people.

I hope you'll all be able to cope with this. Because this shit is fucked.

Germany’s Scholz to hold telephone talks with Putin

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will speak with Putin by telephone later today in a further effort to ease tensions, a spokesman for Germany’s government says.

Steffen Hebestreit said the planned call “this afternoon” had been “closely coordinated” with Macron, who spoke to Putin on Sunday.

He said the talks were part of “joint diplomatic efforts” by the West to “prevent a catastrophe” in Ukraine.

I still don't see a full on invasion happening. It just doesn't seem practical to me, and Putin, despite being a criminal enterprise, is not irrational.

I don't see how a full on Russian attack and invasion/occupation of Ukraine accomplishes Putin's alleged goal of having a pro-Russia Ukraine that moves away from the west. Inevitably there would be massive civilian casualties and built up resentment from invading Ukrainian sovereignty, trying to bully and pound Ukraine into submission. I'd expect such an effort would only push Ukraine more away from Russia and to the West.

Moreso I'd expect some effort to try to annex or free the breakaway regions of Donbass, limited military action, then other actions (cyber attacks, keeping the Ukrainian economy on edge) to try to destabilize and mess with Ukraine.",False,1645457315.0,t3_sxvem7,t3_sxvem7,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

Another sector they could hit hard is Russian banking, making it difficult or impossible for them to conduct foreign business. Sanctions that prevent exports to Russia could increase the inflation rate, at the same time that the Ruble is devaluing, which could put a lot of pressure on the average Russian citizen.

One area that they'll likely hit is to freeze/seize foreign held assets of pretty much every Russian government official, oligarch, and friend of Putin.

 >In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia, and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances. The book declares that ""the battle for the world rule of Russians"" has not ended and Russia remains ""the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution"". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed ""on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us"". Military operations play relatively little role.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if,
like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m
one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s
true!—but when you’re a conservative Republican they
try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start
off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there,
went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to
give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little
disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the
thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy,
and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is
powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many
years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he
would explain the power of what’s going to happen and
he was right—who would have thought?), but when you
look at what’s going on with the four prisoners—now it
used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and
even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger;
fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they
haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now
than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about

Here's the thing. Russia might be shitty with their sentiment towards LGBTQ, but it doesn't appear to be far off from where many western countries were only 10-15 years ago. Like, there's LGBTQ protests and rallies, and it's even legally recognized if you change your gender post op. Same sex intercourse isn't illegal either, while it's still technically illegal in some US states. So making the leap to insinuate ""Russia is invading to kill the gays"" seems pretty fucking absurd to me. They're definitely not pro LGBTQ and I'm sure there's hate crimes, they're not rallying them up and throwing them in prison.

Furthermore, if they plan to target ethnic/religious minorities, and that's a goal at all, the sentiment should be reflected by the Russian people. The government would be pushing propaganda to cultivate that sentiment if necessary (like the nazis did, even though there was already a lot of anti Jewish sentiment in multiple countries). However I read a study recently about hiring practices in Russia, where employers' rates of response were gauged to very obviously ethnic resumes. In Moscow it was slightly skewed towards ethnic Russians, but nowhere near so much as to indicate a huge issue. Outside of Moscow, some minorities actually had higher response rates than Russians.

Not living there I obviously can't say for sure, studies are often skewed by bias, and statistics can be manipulated. But with the studies and information I've seen, and using some logic...I think that intel is at the very least highly exaggerated/twisted. More likely fake to liken Russia to Nazi Germany. But this is entirely opinion.

I believe, at worst, the report is ""Russia plans to send some journalists and anyone who causes too much trouble to camps. Dissidents who may attack them. Some of them might happen to be LGBTQ/minority"". Because I mean, every single country in the world has done that when in conflict.

eb5bdc82bd1c9f94d2f4dab1ad290173,sxvem7,hxulxgd,"Here is a summary of events so far, on a day when fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine reached boiling point.  
  
Ukraine has rejected as “fake news” a claim from the Russian army that it killed five “saboteurs” attempting to cross the border in the Russian region of Rostov. Ukrainian officials said not a single soldier had been killed and their forces were not present in the Rostov region.  
Vladimir Putin promised to take a decision on whether to recognise two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine later on Monday, after leaders of the self-declared republics appealed to the Kremlin to recognise their independence in co-ordinated statements on Russian state TV.  
The Russian president was speaking at an impromptu meeting of Russia’s national security council, where top officials lined up to echo nationalist talking points, such as the baseless claims of genocide in eastern Ukraine and drawing parallels with Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia. The meeting was broadcast on Russian state television: Putin said it was “happening spontaneously, because I wanted to hear your opinions without any preliminary preparation” - a line at an eye-rolling distance from the staged nature of the event.  
Earlier in the day Putin’s spokesman said talk of a summit between the Russian president and Joe Biden was premature. The two leaders could arrange a call or meeting at any time but there were no concrete plans for a high-level encounter, he said.  
Western officials believe Putin is now poised to invade, as they said the Russian military build up continues.  
Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the EU to impose sanctions on Russia now, a call backed by Lithuania, whose foreign minister said Ukraine was under attack. But foreign ministers meeting in Brussels declined to follow this path. Instead the EU high representative on foreign policy, Josep Borrell, repeated his promise the EU would act “at the right moment”.  
That’s all from me, Jennifer Rankin, as I hand over the blog to Lauren Aratani.

If he invaded the Ukraine a second iron curtain could be set into motion. With the alliance between Belarus and Russia comes another country to offer a buffer zone between Russia and the west.

Most of the killings were arranged in a form of forced disappearances from multiple cities and towns upon the German arrival. In the spring and summer of 1940, more than 30,000 Polish citizens were arrested by the Nazi authorities in German-occupied central Poland, the so-called General Government.

Since 2014, when it was successfully used by Russia during its annexation of Crimea, this model has been adopted by other governments and political movements around the world, including by former U.S. president Donald Trump.

2.	Russia announces recognition of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk (sp?) and doesn’t invade, trying to get a concession out of the US at a summit (19%)
3.	Recognition, and the tanks roll in, triggering sanctions, cancelling the summit (70%) and a bunch of emergency meetings and eventually a sit down at the table for ceasefire talks
4.	Recognition, tanks roll in, brutal war, further incursion into Ukraine by Russia and largest NATO buildup in history around Ukraine, then talks (8%)

People thought WW1 wouldn't be fought due to developments in weaponry (such as the machine gun) or the damage such a war would do to the interconnected economies of countries like Britain.  Yet one event led to another, and turned into a massive war that killed millions of people.

Are nuclear weapons a deterrent against such violence occurring again?  Yes.  But at some point in time, sometime in the future, they're going to get used.  An analogy - let's say there's a 1% chance of them being used in a given year.  You can keep rolling the dice each year, and for 70+ years, you're doing fine.

However, if they remain active and useful weapons, enough time will pass that you eventually roll a natural 1, and something triggers their use.  Hopefully we get to a point where they'll be made obsolete in the future before this happens.",False,1645466576.0,t3_sxvem7,t1_hxuvwgg,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The ""temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine"" (Ukrainian: Тимчасово окупована територія України, romanized: Tymchasovo okupovana terytoriia Ukrainy) were defined as such in Ukrainian law following the Russian military occupation that resulted in the loss of Ukrainian control over the Crimean peninsula and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The situation regarding the Crimean peninsula is more complex since Russia annexed the territory in March 2014 and now administers it as two federal subjects - the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.

 >Novorossiya (Russian: Новороссия, tr. Novorossiya, IPA: [nəvɐˈrosʲɪjə] (listen); Ukrainian: Новоросія, romanized: Novorosiia; Romanian: Noua Rusie, Polish: Noworosja), literally New Russia, is a historical term of the Russian Empire denoting a region north of the Black Sea (now part of Ukraine).

According to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the strikes resulted in the deaths of 34 Turkish soldiers, while other sources close to the Turkish government gave death tolls of up to 50–100 Turkish soldiers killed, making it the single deadliest attack on Turkish forces since the start of their involvement in the Syrian Civil War. Between 36 and 60 soldiers were also wounded, of which 16 were reported to be in critical condition.

My country is well known for its warmongering habits, and I trust our major media outlets only slightly more than Russia and/or China. Our leadership has intentionally fabricated motivations for war more than once in recent history.

My country refuses to tax the upper class because they control all of our lawmakers, and anyone that isn't a part of that upper class is being slowly bled dry. Biden is a part of this upper class and one of the most popular points proving this is his support of a bill that ensures student debt is impossible to have forgiven.

Our public education system is deeply flawed and ultimately just a glorified daycare service after a certain point, graded harshly and exclusively on how students perform in four categories: English, Math, History and Science. History curriculums are hyperfocused only on matters relating to the US and skim over everything else leading to the mass ignorance of world culture Americans are known for. Math on the other hand goes on for about six years longer than is necessary for any practical reason - Basic geometry is about as far as 99% of the population needs to be taught.

Our culture thinks a nipple is more harmful to children and generally offensive than brutal and graphic murder.

When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992, he brought the archive with him, in six full trunks. His defection was not officially announced until 1999. The official historian of MI5, Christopher Andrew, wrote two books, The Sword and the Shield (1999) and The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World (2005), based on material in the archives.
