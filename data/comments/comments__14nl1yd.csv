>  
>*During meetings in Kyiv, William Burns was told of Ukraine’s ambitious goal to retake territory and push Moscow into talks by the end of the year*  
>  
>During a secret visit to Ukraine by CIA Director William J. Burns earlier this month, Ukrainian officials revealed an ambitious strategy to retake Russian-occupied territory and open cease-fire negotiations with Moscow by the end of the year, according to officials familiar with the visit.  
>  
>The trip by Burns, which has not been previously reported, included meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine’s top intelligence officials. It came at a critical moment in the conflict as Ukrainian forces struggle to gain an early advantage in their long-awaited counteroffensive but have yet to deploy most of their Western-trained and -equipped assault brigades.  
>  
>“Director Burns recently traveled to Ukraine, as he has done regularly since the beginning of Russia’s recent aggression more than a year ago,” said a U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unannounced visit.  
>  
>Its purpose was to reaffirm the Biden administration’s commitment to sharing intelligence meant to help Ukraine defend itself, the official added.  
>  
>Publicly, Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration with critics of the pace at which the counteroffensive has played out thus far. But in private, military planners in Kyiv have relayed to Burns and others bullish confidence in their aim to retake substantial territory by the fall; move artillery and missile systems near the boundary line of Russian-controlled Crimea; push further into eastern Ukraine; and then open negotiations with Moscow for the first time since peace talks broke down in March of last year, according to three people familiar with the planning.  
>  
>“Russia will only negotiate if it feels threatened,” said a senior Ukrainian official.  
>  
>Whether Ukraine can deliver on those plans, on such a truncated timeline, remains to be seen. The CIA declined to comment when asked for Burns’s assessment of the offensive’s prospects.  
>  
>Burns’s trip occurred just before the aborted rebellion by Russian mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin against Russia’s defense establishment. Although the U.S. intelligence community had detected in mid-June that Prigozhin was plotting an armed assault of some kind, those findings were not discussed during the meetings with Zelensky and others, the U.S. official said.  
>  
>Biden administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that Washington and Kyiv had nothing to do with the failed march on Moscow, a rare challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States has characterized as an internal matter.  
>  
>In an effort to reinforce that line, Burns made a phone call to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, after the event and underscored that the United States was not involved in any way, the Wall Street Journal reported.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Ukraine’s cautious approach in the opening days of the offensive is a sign of the challenge that lies ahead, analysts say.  
>  
>“The problem is that Russia has emplaced a large number of mines, both in front of and behind the main defensive line,” said Lee. “Even if Ukraine can achieve a breakthrough, it will still take time to exploit. It may take weeks, it may take months.”

Satellite imagery shows hundreds of large tents set up over the past week at a previously abandoned base in Asipovichy, about 150 miles north of the Ukrainian border, ISW said, adding that the militia forces will reportedly operate out of three field camps in Belarus. Ukraine’s president on Friday instructed his armed forces to bolster defenses in the nation’s north. An official with Kyiv’s border force told Ukrainian media that as many as 8,000 fighters from Wagner may be deployed in Belarus.

Russia is reducing its presence at the plant, and Ukrainian employees have also been advised to leave, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate said in a report on Friday.

1775a6d585cbe77ad3dd85626a9404eb,14nl1yd,jq8ffpn,"There has been a lot of talk specially these days about Ukraine's counteroffensive being too slow, that this has become a frozen conflict, that the counteroffensive has failed, the theory that the US is not giving Ukraine what it needs to win and wants to just bleed out Russia slowly at the expense of Ukraine in prolonged war has been repeated more, etc. Aside from the pro-Putin people and troll accounts, I get it, we almost had a victory for Ukraine event this weekend and it is very frustrating to go back to the grind business as usual. I myself have recently fallen into such defeatist mindset and for sure the West is absolutely not doing everything they could be doing to support Ukraine (like delaying stuff like ATACMs or drip drop numbers). But after taking some time to cool off and observing the situation, I want to explain why this is not the case and there is proof of it.

To do this, we have to first understand the Ukranian Strategy (likely developed by the West) and compare it vs Ukraine's exploitation of opportunities. Kharkiv was such an exploitation of opportunities, the Russian Army was in a very bad shape, fell for a feit and Ukraine exploited it to the fullest retaking lots of territory in a blitzkrieg-like fashion in a rout. But now we have to look at Ukraine's consistent strategy for the war that has been in place since the invasion in Kyiv. Ukraine's strategy has been to destroy Russian logistics, force Russia to engage in high intensity combat to burn supplies and then force Russia to decide to either engage in an incredibly lopsided battle or withdraw. Regardless of the opportunities that present themselves, this is Ukraine's consistent strategy to wage the war.

This is how Ukraine won the battle of Kyiv and why they were going for fuel and supply depos rather than the sexy targets like the tanks themselves (with a critical help from the Belarussian resistence), Russia ran out of supplies in high intensity combat and then chose to pull back rather than fight an in incredibly lopsided battle. This is how Kherson was taken to a T, destroy the bridges supplying logistics, press to force the troops there in high intensity combat to burn supplies and then force Russia to choose between a lopsided battle or withdraw, they withdrew, making occupying a major fortified city irrelevant. Over and over again:

1) Shape up logistics

2) Make their enemy burn supplies in high intensity combat

3) Fight their enemy with an overwhelming advantadge (Each time Russia chose to retreat than fight)

And if we look at the counteroffensive, this is **exactly** what they are doing. Lots of logistic shape up operations, right now we have the 3 engaged brigades forcing Russia into a high intensity combat as the oprations continue, step 3 is what is missing and reaching step 3 can take time, months. Now with all the counteroffensive brigades it is possible this time Russia will not be afforded to choose its poison and they will not be allowed to retreat as Ukraine press with a breakthrough. Of course it is preferable to exploit an opportunity like Kharkiv, which is why Ukraine at first started pressing on at full gas to see if there was one (and they keep looking for one) or it is also possible that with the resistance encountered Ukraine saw that Russia was not yet weakened enough and they went back to step 1. Whatever the case, we can see why after the operational pause they went back to logistics shape up, it has been their consistent strategy since the beginning. This strategy, if it works, make fortifications irrelevant. The most impressive set of fortifications is just an annoyance if the troops there don't get their food, ammo and fuel. The small territory they are taking is irrelevant which is a few kilometers, what is relevant is that they are forcing Russia to engage them in high intensity combat. Of course doing this to a completely continious territory is way harder than doing it to a city connected by bridges like Kherson, but not impossible.

Then we also have to look at what the future holds. While we have yet to see the results of the counteroffensive, we have to understand that even if it fails, its not catastrophic at all, as long as Ukraine and the West are not demoralized. Ukraine in fall or winter is set to receive what I think are going to be their main weapon in the war: the GLSDBs. These are cheap, will be produced specifically for Ukraine and each of them is a smart bomb, they can attack the entirety of Ukraine's occupied territory except (most of) Crimea and they can attack in a 360° angle. While they might arrive at limited numbers in 2023 the production doesn't stop and can be delivered at massive industrial rates through 2024. I also believe this might be why the US is reluctant to send ATACMs, though of course they would be very welcome and would make the situation better, they know Ukraine's main weapon is coming. Now combine this with HIMAR's, Storm Shadows and F16s, each of them being a booster, and you can get a picture of what is coming, giving Ukraine an overwhelming advantadge in artillery and to bomb the battlefield at will. This is also why F16s are relevant even if they come in small numbers, it isn't just about air superiority, is that each of those allow Ukraine to shoot a variety of missiles that will pummel Russian's logistics. Even if the counteroffensive this year failed, all the damage to Russian logistics and defenses during it remain true, in winter the frontlines freeze as we saw last year and Ukraine will just pummel Russian logistics with F16s and GLSDBs in Ukraine's winter temperatures. All while Ukraine keep building more offensive brigades with increasingly superior equipment.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-01-23/index.html

""A strategically significant foothold established by Ukrainian troops on the east bank of the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine has been eliminated following almost a week of heavy fighting, according to the Russian-appointed governor of occupied Kherson on Saturday.

Russian special forces launched a ""surprise attack"" from the rear of Ukrainian troops stationed near the Antonivskyi Bridge, approaching from the river by boat, the official, Vladimir Saldo, said in a Telegram post.

""By 3 a.m., the strongpoint and the hotel, where the Ukrainian fighters were entrenched, had been taken,"" Saldo wrote.

""That's it, no (Ukrainian) 'bridgeheads' on the left bank,"" he added. 

This comes after Saldo claimed an Iskander missile had struck close to the Antonivskyi Bridge, which crosses the Dnipro, killing 30 Ukrainian fighters Friday. Saldo added that special forces would begin a final sweep of the area.

CNN cannot independently verify Saldo’s claims or any other reports on battlefield developments.

More background: Russian and Ukrainian troops have been exchanging heavy fire surrounding the bridge in the southern Kherson region.

Military bloggers reported earlier this week that Ukraine had a bridgehead on the Russian-controlled east bank of the Dnipro River, which Russian officials denied at the time. Now Moscow-backed leaders in the area say it has been eliminated.

Analysts believe the Ukrainian action in Kherson is designed to keep Russian troops in the area and prevent their re-deployment to the front in Zaporizhzhia, a vitally important southern region.

Reclaiming Zaporizhzhia is seen as the key to Kyiv's military cutting off occupied southern Ukraine from the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, which it has controlled since 2014.""",False,1688221767.0,t3_14nl1yd,t3_14nl1yd,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

You can't be ""at war"" with a bunch of rebels squatting on your land, which as far as Russia (Putin) is concerned, is what Ukraine is.

So the official Russian line is that it's **not** a war, which has hamstrung their actions to some degree and made it more difficult for them to move their industry to a war time footing.

Cluster munitions has a high percentage of duds that basically creates unmapped minefields in the target area. If you care about that the area should be habitable or agriculturally usable again in the foreseeable future (which should be the case with the Ukrainian forces, unlike the Russian ones), then one usually does not want to use such weapons.

The fact is that most western armed forces no longer use cluster ammunition, because the general consensus is that they do more harm than they're worth.

Ultimately, in my opinion, the decision rests with Ukraine. With Russia already deploying similar weapons anyway, if cluster munitions were really extremely effective, they could actually reduce the country's bottom line mine contamination, by expelling the Russian occupiers faster and ending the war earlier.

Russian culture doesn't seem to agree in a broad sense. Their identity, their values seem, after having observed them for the past year and a half and doing my best to read up on Russian history, to be placed almost solely in the perception of the state's power and, by extension, the Tsar's power.

Constitutionalism? Institutions that limit the head of state's power? Civic participation? This is all European decadence and weakness! If we allow it to infest our culture, says the Russian nationalist, then they will destroy us and then what will we be?!

More or less. They'd be able to achieve air superiority, take out any exposed heavy equipment, rear bases, logistics hubs, command centers, naval assets, ammunition storage, key supply roads - etc. 

Taking out the entrenched defensive positions from the air however, would be more problematic I would imagine.

A russian missile hit the Antonovsky bridge on the left bank.  This collapsed half of the bridge there, prompting some to say it had destroyed the river crossing.  But this bridge doesn't go anywhere close to across the river; it's missing numerous spans and pillars.  The bridge at this point was likely being used for cover by Ukrainian forces.  The missile appears to have hit on top of the bridge so maybe the cover worked.

There's also a photo from around the same time of what appears to be russian incendiary munitions covering the area on the mainland just beyond the final bridge.  And most recently there is footage of Ukraine firing rocket artillery into Oleshky on the mainland.  These would not be priority targets for either side if there wasn't significant Ukrainian presence in the area.  IIRC in Andrew Perpetua's most recent YouTube update, this was described as ""likely a few hundred special forces"".

We don't know if Ukraine currently has (unlikely IMO) or plans to make a working river crossing.  As far as we know it's only people on foot that crossed by boat, that are being supported by drones and artillery.  Nearly all of the posted video from the area is from the russian side.

At first glance this seems like a difficult place for Ukraine to fight, since crossing the river with heavy equipment is very difficult.  It would require pushing russia out of easy artillery range of where they would build the crossing, then making a lengthy pontoon bridge likely where the partially-destroyed russian one still rests.  Then any heavy armor brought across needs steady logistical support, plus it's resting in what is a post-flood marshland.  And if things go wrong you might not be able to withdraw the armor.

But it's also a hugely difficult place for russia to fight.  Any fortifications or trenches they had in the area would have been flooded out, and there's no drinkable water in this area either.  The Ukrainian positions are  ""along"" the left bank of the river. But this is a historical floodplain, and the main channel of the Dnieper runs just along Kherson but secondary channels run through this area, effectively creating islands.  Ukraine occupies some of those islands, and russia may have fully withdrawn from them.  But even on the mainland on the L bank defense is not easy - Oleshky city is right there, but that was also heavily flooded and may not be a good hub for a defense along the edges.  What gives Ukraine the advantage here is their artillery range and accuracy advantage.  Artillery (and drones for that matter, though since there are no trenches the drone-dropped-munitions aren't helpful) from the Kherson city area can hit anything on the islands, and a lot of stuff well inland on the other side.

We don't know and really cannot predict what will happen here.  Anything Ukraine can do to extend the line of conflict benefits them, so just by forcing russia to bring additional troops into the area it might be a win.  But they also might continue taking over areas in the floodplain here, until eventually they can secure a pontoon bridge to make a real offensive.",False,1688246707.0,t3_14nl1yd,t1_jqathjn,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

1 Ukraine started this war. 

2 Russia never “consciously” target civilians and civilian infrastructure. 

3 Ukraine locates heavy weapons among civilians and civilian infrastructure. 

All 3 are false. Rebuttal: 1/

**1 Ukraine started the war.** 

Of course, it didn’t. It is Russia who invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, attempted to take our capital Kyiv and failed. 

But that’s not quite what Lavrov means. 2/

Lavrov says that Ukraine started this war because …

… it has decided to along itself with the West, wants to join NATO, has become a EU candidate, didn’t fulfill Minsk agreements, attacked ethic Russians in Donbas, etc. 3/

The first three: West, EU, NATO are true. The last two: Minsk agreements and attacking ethnic Russians are not. But even if they were, they don’t justify the invasion. 

Of course, the Kremlin is insulted that Ukraine has chosen the democratic world over them. 4/

They are insulted that they can’t control Ukraine. 

And so in a stubborn streak of stupidity they keep doubling down, culminating in a war. 

This is Russia’s fatal mistake. But I digress, let’s go back to Lavrov’s points. 5/

**2 Russia never “consciously” targets civilians and civilian infrastructure.** 

Hello?  What about energy infrastructure that Russia tracked all winter across Ukraine?

But even if they weren’t “consciously” doing it, their international doesn’t matter. The result does. 6/

And yet their intention is clear after what they did with Mariupol and Bucha. 

They can blame whoever and whatever they want, but they started the war, they give out orders, and they are responsible. 7/

**3 Ukraine locates heavy weapons among civilians and civilian infrastructure.** 

No, it doesn’t. It is tru that Ukraine has air defense in Kyiv, for obvious reasons. Without it, Russia would have killed many civilians in Kyiv and destroyed infrastructure and buildings. 8/

We do not shoot HIMARS or launch Storm Shadows from Kyiv or Kramatorsk. Lavrov lies and advances war propaganda to blame Ukraine for refusing to become Russia.

I very much appreciate counterarguments to Reddits narrative, but this one doesn't work.

Firstly, we know the capacity of countries when it comes to producing war equipment, and its not nearly enough to sustain wars. No matter which country, wars burn trough stockpiles which where produced over decades and decades in a year or two. The notion that Russia could produce a replacement for every lost piece of hardware in real time is several orders of magnitude beyond impossible, which is why we are seeing the offensive stop after the initial few months and tanks built during the Stalin administration on the frontlines.

Secondly, while Russia is often presented as a kind of ""rival of the west/USA"", it isn't. It wasn't really even when it was the much bigger Soviet Union plus all of its satellite states, let alone now.

The entire Russian economy is less than the economy of 3 small European countries:

Now, look at both on a world map:

The more realistic worst case scenario close to yours would be if Russia got kicked out of Ukraine but continued to launch occasional small raids from time to time.

I took “rational” in the post you are responding to to mean rational from the European/ US perspective with respect to relations Russia had with the West.  For example, if we intermingle our economies we will become more dependent on each other and therefore ultimately our interests will align and we will not have overt conflict with each other.  
  
To be fair, that worked (admittedly along with several other factors) between France, the UK, Germany and other countries in the EU.  From wwii on there has been increasing integration in Western and Central Europe and wwiii hasn’t started as a fracas between France and Germany, Britain and France have not had another 100 years war, the Dutch have not sailed warships up the Thames, etc.  We are approaching 80 years of peace in Western and Central Europe (I mean on the continent (1) - not that they haven’t been involved in armed conflicts elsewhere) and I think that might be a record length of time to go without armies marching around Europe.  
  
If you see those policies working in your backyard, then maybe it’s not too far-fetched to think they might also work next-door.  I think the general assumption in the West was that Russia could be integrated into a global community in much the same way.  Retrospectively (since hindsight is 20/20), large cultural differences in Russia seem to have prevented that from occurring — hence the perspective that Russia is not a ‘rational’ geopolitical actor.  Russia could have had much greater economic advancement, better living conditions for its citizens, and could have been been a major force for what is seen as ‘good’ from the West’s perspective.  But perhaps those are not actually the goals of its government and the people who hold power there…

I bet you know this. 

I dimly recall that when Khruschev visited the US, he visited a grocery store and was stunned by the abundance and variety. He thought it was a fake grocery, a prop designed to deceive him, so later in his visit he stopped at another grocery store that *he* picked, anticipating that it would be like Soviet stores.

I live in a part of Massachusetts where a lot of Jewish Russians came to live. I used to encounter them on the tennis court, yelling to each other in Russian; it always sounded like they were swearing LOL.  At the time, there were newspaper articles about what it was like for recent arrivals from Russia when they went to grocery store: they were kind of paralyzed by the variety available, e.g. the number of kinds of coffee for sale, and found it hard to choose.

That makes me wonder if Russians know what they're missing?

Do many Russians watch Western TV shows?

I'm reasonably well-off: I own a comfortable home; I live in a wealthy town; I have all of the usual appliances; and so on. **I often feel like my home and furnishings are inferior to what I see in a lot of TV shows.**

If non-elite Russians see the comparatively splendiferous standard of living portrayed in Western TV shows, how do they respond? Do they think that they are see Potemkin kitchens and living rooms -- that *real* people don't have such nice things? *Or do they realize how inferior they're living conditions are?* If the latter, are they resentful, or just except their situation as their fate, inevitable -- as I assume a lot of poor Americans do?

Hey folks, got another document shared by pavel (an expert on nuclear stuff) . Like last time, do you people agree or disagree?  
  
A major accident is unlikely because the ZNPP is not operating at power.  
  
This quote says enough: Contrary to popular belief, this \[a direct strike impact\] will not cause a nuclear explosion. The reactor is not an nuclear bomb, even if at the time of the accident it is operating at full capacity. There was no nuclear explosion either at Chernobyl or at Fukushima. Even if a strike on a reactor operating at power should damage the control rods (which in the VVER-1000 are located in the upper part of the reactor, which would most likely suffer in the event of an impact) and somehow cause a reactor runaway,then it would sooner fall apart and depressurize than it would release a large amount of energy as the result of an uncontrolled chain reaction. Most likely it would simply depressurize with a release of water, steam and possibly the fuel itself, and the nuclear reaction would be extinguished on its own.  
  
Because the ZNPP has been in shutdown for so long, its reactors have not been producing one of the most dangerous radioactive elements to humans: iodine-131. Additionally, the iodine-131 that was within the reactor has decayed, significantly reducing the amount of this isotope that could be release during an accident/incident. Thus any accident/incident involving radiation release will likely impact a far smaller area with iodine pollution. In addition, iodine relatively quickly dissipates, with a half-life (50% of the material gone thanks to the nature of radioactive material) of 8 days. It stays a potential health hazard for a couple of weeks at most.  
  
This quote: ...outside the southeastern part of Ukraine, the probability of receiving a dose of more than 2.5 mSv is below 0.1. 2.5 mSv (millisievert) is about a quarter of the dose of a regular CT scan and far from a lethal dose of radiation.  
  
Even in what the report calls a 'conservative overestimate' scenario, the release of radioactive matieral (particularly the isotope cesium-137) would not significantly impact any area outside of Ukraine. Any release would be similar to already existing 'background radiation' that we experience on a daily basis.  
  
Any release of radioactive material would likely be in a short, one-time burst, which further limits the spread of radioactive material (Chornobyl was a week-long release of materials).  
  
The primary area affected outside of Ukraine, even if it is very likely extremely minor, would be Southeastern Europe, Belarus and European Russia at most.  
  
In the most dangerous scenario, a meltdown due to power loss/cooling loss, there will most likely not be an explosion. Accumulated hydrogen, the main culprit of the Fukushima explosion (also a meltdown), and formed by the reaction of zirconium nuclear fuel cladding with water vapor, cannot accumulate in dangerous quantities at ZNPP. There are devices in place that combine excess hydrogen back into water. These devices do not need electricity and can operate even when the ZNPP has been completely disconnected. The likely outcome of such an scenario is ground/water pollution at the site, or at most in the Dnieper basin, whose scale is likely to be relatively small because the reactors do not operate at power.  
  
Such a worst-case scenario is unlikely to develop without personnel knowing about it. With ZNPP not operating at power, a meltdown scenatio won't develop over in a matter of hours - it will take several days to come to that.  
  
Spent fuel does not explode. It will only cause local ground contamination if hit (unlikely).  
  
The cladding of the ZNPP's reactor buildings is strong and won't easily be breached by explosives. It can withstand the impact of a direct hit by an airplane weighing 6 metric tons. By comparison, the Chornobyl plant did not have a proper containment building like the ZNPP has.",False,1688225317.0,t3_14nl1yd,t1_jq9iz17,,6,-1,0,-1,0,0,
