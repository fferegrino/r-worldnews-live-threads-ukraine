The so called ""Russian negotiations"" are part of Russian propaganda and not actual negotiations. It serves two purposes. Domestically, the Russians are using them as an excuse in front of Russian people to justify why they haven't ended the war yet. They are fully attacking Ukrainian targets and failing to take them all throughout the so called ""negotiations"" and then they claim on Russia media that the reason why they haven't taken any objectives yet is because troops were not conducting any attacks during negotiations which is a lie as it can be seen in numerous videos and sources.  
  
They did this from the beginning. Like they went to Belarus a couple of days ago and said that they are waiting for velensky there and that they will hold the Russian forces from advancing even though Zelensky never agreed to come to Belarus and the Russian forces are attacking on all fronts. Then Russian controlled media started spamming articles that negotiations are happening(even though zelensky hadn't even agreed to come) and that the attack had been stopped even though it was still going on so that average Russians were to think that the only reason why Ukrainean cities weren't taken was because the Russian forces had orders not to.

**Ukraine -** 

My thanks to those of us who have supported us. My regret that rule 25 has not been properly implemented by its chair.

But I am relieve that this rape of this constitution is over in less than 48 hours.

For those who see no reason in supporting us, despite my letter sent to you yesterday, let me tell you.

The current warnings every day are ""air raids - proceed to shelter"". Look @ the pictures, the aftermath. Russia is failing - and this has ordered the mad Russian leadership to retaliate by shelling residential areas.

And now, i**t is extremely alarming that the Russian President has resorted to Nuclear Blackmail today.**

Rocket launchers, ??? are widely used against Ukrainians. A missile hit the oil depot, causing a massive fire. It also hit a gasline. At least 26 children were killed since 26 - a girl who had been seriously wounded in the kindergarden has now died, same as the children who were wounded in the air attack on the children hospital.

Ukrainian children are born in bomb shelters. Our children have no access to education.

I have brought these facts to your attention to stop all further violence against Ukrainian children in the face of Russian agression, and I;m looking forward to working with UNICEF on the issue.

We have 3400 Russian personnel killed and 200 taken as prisoner of war. We have published this on our Website. Russia denies this.

**Ukraine has opened a hotline - ""Come back alive"" for the relatives of the soldiers who would like to know what happened to their relatives in Ukraine.**

**Over 100 calls from Russian mothers were received from Russian mothers. it is unfortunate that the Russian Prosecutor General, this line and the dedicated website has been shut down and I want to use this opportunity to read this telephone number to anyone in Russia who wants to enquire after the wellbeing of our prisonners.**

The Russian army is fully attacking Ukrainian objectives and failing to take them all throughout the so called ""negotiations"" and then they claim on Russia media that the reason why they haven't taken any objectives yet is because troops were not conducting any attacks during negotiations which is a lie as it can be seen in numerous videos and sources.  
  
They did this from the beginning. Like a Russian delegation went to Belarus a couple of days ago and said that they are waiting for velensky there and that they will hold the Russian forces from advancing even though velensky never agreed to come to Belarus at that time and the Russian forces were attacking on all fronts. Then Russian controlled media started spamming articles that negotiations are happening(even though zelensky hadn't even agreed to come) and that the attack had been stopped even though it was still going on so that average Russians were to think that the only reason why Ukrainean cities weren't taken was because the Russian forces had orders not to.

The one here looks to be a single explosion, probably from a rocket, missile or artillery, that then sets off a secondary explosion - like a chemical plant, or ammo storage being hit by the first explosion.

Let's remain calm and rooted in facts and evidence, and not over-speculate.",False,1645996603.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

Most estimated escalations involved a conventional war breaking out first, the ol' classic 'T-72s flooding the Fulda gap' scenario being a common one.  Then one side or the other realizes they're losing and deploys tactical nukes in order to gain an advantage.

Tactical nukes escalate to 'preventative' strikes on enemy strategic assets, which then progresses into a general exchange.

So basically it's unlikely that we'll wake up one day to find Washington DC, London, Paris and Moscow are smoking craters.  At this point the potential worry for me is Putin getting desperate and using a tactical nuke on a Ukrainian military formation.

The other worry is chemical weapons.  Supposedly the Russians destroyed their last stockpiles of nerve agents back in 2017, but the novichok attacks in London kinda show that to not be the case.  Shit like sarin or VR would be very effective at putting an end to the sort of urban warfare the Russians are having trouble with right now.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",1645998697.0,1645997878.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

That is a no win scenario. You can't negotiate with a scorched earth policy. Putin will threaten nukes all the way through Europe. (Well, maybe not at the rate of skullfucking his troops are getting)

This battle of attrition through sanctions is certainly beneficial for the west, but let's not victim blame here. Putin and the Russian government chose this. Not Ukraine. Not NATO. If he launches nukes, that's on them alone. Not that it will matter, we will all be dead. But one point remains:

If you give him an inch, he will take a mile. And he will keep doing it until we resist.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

addition: men 18-60 are no longer allowed to leave

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

<<During his evening programme tonight, Russian state TV presenter Dmitry Kiselyov delivered a monologue in which he posed the question: ""why do we need a world if Russia's not in it?""

He was considering President Putin’s announcement today that he is putting Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert.

""In total our submarines are capable of launching over 500 nuclear warheads, which guarantees the destruction of the US and all Nato countries to boot,"" he said on his Vesti Nedeli show.

""That's according to the principle 'why do we need a world if Russia's not in it?'

""Russia's nuclear weapons are also delivered by the fastest strategic bombers in the world,"" he said, adding that ""we won't even talk about our Strategic Rocket Forces"".

""In total, Russia's nuclear capability is the most powerful in the world,"" he said.

""Now Russia's entire nuclear triad has been placed on special alert. Putin warned them. Don't try to frighten Russia."">>",False,1645999527.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.


Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.
Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",1645997079.0,1645996980.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

Within days the invaders successfully gained control over Chernobyl, an old nuclear reactor they had fucked up themselves 35 years prior. The invaders, having more helicopters, artillery, soldiers, tanks and fighter planes, suffered significant losses due to a poorly coordinated attack, but quickly showed their strength to the rest of the world by shooting ballistic missiles at civilian buildings, killing children, hundreds of unarmed Ukrainians, paramedics, and by wearing Ukrainian army gear. For a full list of war crimes committed by the invading armed forces, visit the page [War crimes during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine].

96f7342c896bfc06e35c7b3bd7685a0b,t2x5s9,hyotdkm,"I’m noticing many misconceptions among commenters here concerning the probability of nuclear war. When somebody seriously tried to claim it’s more likely that one wins the lottery three times in a row than say, a nuclear war between the US and Russia or even just a nuclear bomb going off at all, the prior is many many MANY orders of magnitude less likely than either latter.

A [study](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF/how-likely-is-a-nuclear-exchange-between-the-us-and-russia-1) conducted by [Luisa Rodriguez](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/luisa_rodriguez), research fellow at the Forethought Foundation for Global Priorities Research who also researched nuclear war at Rethink Priorities and as a visiting researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute revealed the true risk we face every year of suffering a nuclear catastrophe:

“I get a rough sense of how probable a nuclear war might be by looking at historical evidence, the views of experts, and predictions made by forecasters. I find that, if we aggregate those perspectives, there’s about a **1.1%** chance of nuclear war **each year**, that the chances of a nuclear war between the US and Russia, in particular, are around **0.38%** *per year*.”

That’s right. We face slightly over 1% odds of nuclear war each year. This conclusion was reached after analyzing the aggregate data set of information provided by countless experts that know far more about nuclear war than you or I.

There is also another relevant portion of this study which I will share. It’s obvious to anyone paying attention that Putin is acting irrationally here. When I hear arguments that he wouldn’t risk putting his family in danger or that he would abstain from using WMDs for any reason that would involve humanity and rationale, they always omit that **irrational people do not arrive at rational conclusions**. Our worst fear has always been some fanatic coming to power and detonating a nuclear weapon for their own backwards cause - someone that by nature cannot be negotiated with. That’s exactly the threat we face now. We are *already* in a doomsday scenario. I’m not just saying this, either. This is from the study:

“Unfortunately, it’s unclear how sane — or rather, rational — the world leaders with the power to launch nuclear weapons are. It’s easy to imagine that a world leader with few checks on their power would launch a nuclear attack **without sufficiently weighing the gravity of the risks**.”

Putin has already showed his willingness to throw caution to the wind when he ordered the invasion of a sovereign nation. When somebody tells you who they are, BELIEVE THEM THE FIRST TIME.

Stop underestimating the nuclear threat we face. Experts disagree, and it’s not the reality that we live in. You’re far less likely to be bitten by a shark than you are to see a nuclear weapon detonate in your lifetime - and *certainly* the same can be said for winning a lottery ticket *three times in a damn row*.",1645994132.0,1645994081.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,23,0,23,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

If you don't want to read it, don't read it. All y'all Russian trolls don't want to hear it bc it's exposing part of Putin's playbook and how he set the chess board before he made this move, but if we are going to rid the world of Putin, a part of that is going to have to be confronting what helped get us here in the first place.

This is my opinion- Trump's achilles heel has always been his ego. He's incredibly arrogant and thrives on flattery. Putin played him like a violin. Putin has been scheming to bring back the Great Russian Empire his whole career.

What would help him pull this off? Well, an idiot in the White House that's wrapped around his finger, for starters. So cue election interference. It's so obvious now, in retrospect, and the evidence is how Trump praised him so much even after the invasion and look at Tucker Carlson who also was defending him after the invasion. They're all in on it. They're as bad as RT at the propaganda. And then he needed an America so divided that we attack each other even in the face of Russia doing whatever Russia was going to do.

Trump was perfect for this. He's maleable. He was used. And then through Trump and together with the social media meddling, Putin used us to eat each other alive, creating an incredibly divided country.

Also! Remember that Trump cut off aid to Ukraine, which is a huge deal! He did that while he was in office. You think that was coincidence? That he just came up with that all on his own? No way. And Trump wanted to take us out of NATO! NATO without the US would be nowhere near the threat to Putin that NATO with the US is. Again, another idea that would have MASSIVELY benefitted Putin in this war and in his overarching goal to bring back the USSR that Trump supposedly just came up with all on his own.

Aside from the very real and huge chaos Putin is creating in Europe which I dont' mean to downplay in the slightest- The problem is that in the US now we're fucked, even after Putin is kicked out of office. The cancer is here. Dude is going to run again in 2024 and we all hate each other in a very real way. The damage Putin has done in this regard when it comes to how Americans interact with each other and converse is going to be felt for decades. I hope to God that he doesn't win again in 2024, particularly if Putin is still around. There's no way we would have joined in on the sanctions if Biden wouldn't have been in the WH. The EU would be going it alone with Canada.",1645996225.0,1645994770.0,t3_t2x5s9,t3_t2x5s9,,0,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Send in the younger, dumber less well trained 1st, alot of the reports seem to indicate less experienced forces and reports of those captured appear to be young conscripts.

See the reaction to this initial push from the defence and movements. Any gains from the initial wave are a bonus esp against an opponent that is outnumbered

Then send in the more experienced combat proven/veteran units with counter options gathered from Intel in the initial push.

Or instead of sending in the experienced combat units, pull back, throw massive firepower at the issue and then sweep back in afterwards while the defenders are disorganized/routed.

Tearing down the Russian flag was excusable, but it would've been so much better to talk to these people instead. The majority of Russians can't stand Putin, especially the ones abroad. Just spoke with a Russian acquaintance of mine who is stuck in St. Petersburg and can't come back to Bulgaria (she had to go because her visa had expired); she shares the sentiment that many, many Russians are absolutely appalled and ashamed, and that people are afraid, but still anti-war protests are some of the bigger protests Russia has seen in the past decade.


Attacking Russian restaurants in the US is especially gross.

Another advantage to Crypto is the fact that your asset only exists virtually and the only way to get to it if it's not held by an exchange is to know a sequence of words. It sort of has the benefits of a digital bank account without the need to rely on a third party like a bank to hold onto your money.

The crypto community can be exhausting and using a humanitarian crisis to pump your bags is awful. However the actual underlying technology can feasibly be very useful for a situation like this.

So Putin doesn’t really have many options available to him if NATO or the EU or the US were to become bolder with their military assistance in Ukraine. He could impose sanctions of his own, few of which would be effective. But there are a LOT of European countries that are close to 100% reliant on Russian oil and Natural Gas for energy in their own countries. And we’re currently in the dead of Winter… so cutting off those resources to Europe could be significant. We also know that Russia has some fairly sophisticated cyber attack capabilities.

We have stories from all fronts of conscripts saying their NCOs told them they were ""rescuing Russians held hostage"", that they were ""retaliating for an attack on Russia"", that they were engaging in a ""peacekeeping mission on the border"", or part of ""drills."" 

There was a video of a guy driving down a line of broken down vehicles, asking the soldiers outside what they were doing. To a man they seemed genuinely baffled that they were in Ukraine or heading towars Kyiv. Most seemed to think they were still in Belarus or close to the border.

There have also been several tales from the Ukrainians that the Russian conscripts seemed shocked to be fired upon. It doesn't serve Ukrainian propoganda to tell that tale because it could generate empathy for the Russians.

This has actually happened plenty of times as industrial accidents, such as the Imperial Sugar explosion in 2008, where the fuel was sugar dust, or in the Bird's Custard factory explosion, where it was corn starch. Controlled versions of this effect are also exploited for pyrotechnics, using lycopodium powder and non-dairy creamer as fuel. Thermobaric weapons, well, weaponize this. By using the air itself as an oxidation agent, you can make the explosive charge almost 100% fuel, compared to something like black powder being 75% oxidizer.

The key differences between a thermobaric and conventional explosive is the energy density, and the duration of the pressure wave.

This means a much larger blast for the same weight in explosives. The pressure wave also lasts quite a long time in comparison to conventional explosives, which makes them more effective against stuctures.

Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP; Russian: Авиационная вакуумная бомба повышенной мощности, АВБПМ),[1] nicknamed ""Father of All Bombs"" (FOAB; Russian: ""Папа всех бомб"", Пвб),[2] is a Russian-designed, bomber-delivered thermobaric weapon.

The bomb is reportedly similar to the US military's GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast which is often unofficially called ""Mother of All Bombs"" derived from its official military acronym ""MOAB"". This weapon would therefore be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world.[3] However, the veracity of Russia's claims concerning the weapon's size and power have been questioned by US defense analysts.[4]

""FOAB"" was successfully field-tested in the late evening of 11 September 2007.[5] The new weapon is to replace several smaller types of nuclear bombs in the Russian arsenal.[6]",False,1645995925.0,t3_t2x5s9,t1_hyoxgn0,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

>What then is the surprisingly creative argument that might yet work? Well, note how President Zelenskyy says that ‘Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression.’ Basically, because it was Putin who has argued that Ukraine was committing genocide in the Donbas and that it was necessary to intervene militarily to stop it, Ukraine can now say there is a ‘dispute’ between two states, in the sense of Article IX, relating to the interpretation, application or fulfilment of the Genocide Convention. This might work – especially for the provisional measures stage – because aggression is not being pigeonholed into genocide; rather, the argument is essentially that falsely claiming genocide to start a war is a violation of the Genocide Convention, over which the Court has jurisdiction. This sort of makes sense, although it is hard to see which article precisely would Russia be violating in so doing – perhaps the overarching duty to prevent and punish in Article I? To be clear I’m not saying that Ukraine would win on this argument that Russia’s genocidal disinformation is an internationally wrongful act under the Genocide Convention, but it’s most likely enough to get the Court to issue provisional measures.

India might be wrong here, but it isn't wrong in thinking that historically, Russia has supported it more than the US - even when refugees were entering its borders due to genocide in a neighboring country.

Also, small tip: just because something isn't in a freaking Wikipedia page, doesn't mean it didn't happen. However, if Wikipedia pages are the only source of information you're willing to accept, might I suggest the page on the [1971 Bangladesh Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide)?

Nuclear weapons only destroy everything within a relatively small area, outside of that is a big area where a lot of stuff is damaged but surviving the blast is possible.  If you're a hundred miles from any target, you probably won't even be injured.

Medium-term survival depends on keeping away from radioactive ash (don't eat or drink anything contaminated, wear a mask, etc..) and avoiding gamma radiation from the sky for the next week or two.  Ideally that means being underground with a thick layer of dirt over you.  It's possible to build a pretty decent fallout shelter in a day or two, but the problem is we probably won't have that much prior warning.

Long term survival depends on whether enough people and stuff survives to form some kind of society.  If some countries weren't nuked (from the U.S. that might mean Mexico or Canada), then probably best bet would be to travel there.

That also means that, eventually, the chickens were gonna come home to roost and the world would be knocking on Russia's door asking why they were doing such shitty things.

So Putin decided he wanted to have that war on his own terms. By attacking Ukraine, which was on his to-do list anyway, he could gauge what the response to invading other nations would be. Every war crime his army commits is another line in the sand that he's able to step over. Despite the appearance of madness, this is all instead very calculated.

What he underestimated was Ukraine's tenacity to fight back, and how quickly the world would have Ukraine's back. He gambled that his assets in both the US and foreign governments would be able to disrupt organized efforts to help Ukraine.

That alone sets you apart as a grade A dumbass. How can you be sure of anything arguing with someone you don't know anything about? 

The strategy and geopolitical implications of using nuclear force in anything but defense seem to go right over your head but I don't think they go over Putin's.

You're right, a single nuke - like in WW2 - doesn't destroy the planet. But you know what does? Full-scale nuclear war. And that wasn't a possibility when only the US had nukes. It is now. I would even argue it a likely outcome if it was used. 

Even if the whole planet isn't reduced to dust, strategic strikes on population centres by a single nuclear power would definitely be enough to kill 50% of the population - in the world 55% of people live in cities and in Europe 75%.

That's going to happen to Russia, very shortly. Hence why these sanctions were considered ""the sanctions to end all sanctions.""

For context, FDR passed a law in the US to prevent this sort of thing: if a bank in the US fails, the US government will give you the amount the bank owes you, up to $250,000 (this is what it means when someone says a bank is ""FDIC Insured"").
