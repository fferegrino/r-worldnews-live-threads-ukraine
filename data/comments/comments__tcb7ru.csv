""The occupier's army legalizes looting

March 12, 2022
Due to an unsuccessful attempt to launch a lightning offensive, the occupiers were forced to change tactics. Due to significant logistical problems and stretched communications, they are unable to properly provide their units with fuel, food, equipment, ammunition and rotation.

Now the main task of the occupiers is to gain a foothold in the existing positions, hiding from the local population. At the same time, units of Putin's troops remain cut off from supplies indefinitely and have been instructed to move to ""self-sufficiency"" until further orders. That is, to take away everything necessary from the local population and to rob warehouses, shops, drugstores.

So the looting that has taken place around the world in recent days is not an isolated case. In addition, they are accompanied by numerous cases of serious crimes against civilians: murder, torture, rape. Including minors.

This is a purposeful policy of terror of the occupying state, encouraged by its top leadership.

All crimes of the occupiers are recorded. Those who commit them are known. And retribution will be inevitable.""

March 12, 2022
Brigadier General Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, stated this on the air of Ukraine 24 TV channel.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence stressed that all the occupiers' dreams of a quick capture of Ukraine were shattered very quickly. ""We know almost all of their plans. As soon as some ideas are born in large offices, we know about them immediately. Once again, all attempts to seize Ukraine by military means will fail, ""said the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

“18 battalion tactical groups have completely lost their combat capability, another 13 have been completely destroyed. 31 battalion-tactical groups in two weeks actually lost combat capability. These are terrible losses that the Russians have never had before, ""said Brigadier General Kirill Budanov.

According to him , big problems have begun in Russia's military-political leadership. ""Now there are two people left who are openly in favor of continuing hostilities in Ukraine, Putin and the Shoigu. Even the generals of the Russian Federation oppose. Some are more active, some are just silent, sometimes even sabotaging some orders of the Russian leadership, ""said the head of Ukraine's military intelligence.""

""Russia is working on two versions of nuclear blackmail - Kirill Budanov


March 12, 2022
The aggressor state is trying to intimidate the world with nuclear explosions, and in any case to blame Ukraine.

This was announced by Brigadier General Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, on the air of Ukraine 24 TV channel.

“We have information about the development of two options. Which one they choose is up to them. The first is large-scale burning of radioactive forests, a radioactive cloud will rise at once and go in the direction of the wind. The second is the use of artillery for nuclear storage. The result will be the same. ""In the first, in the second case, the Russian leadership aims to blame Ukraine, and its"" Nazi "","" neo-Nazi ""formations, which do not really exist here,"" said Kirill Budanov.

He reminded that it was not the first time that Russia resorted to nuclear blackmail. There was already a deliberate shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, as well as a missile strike on the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, where the experimental nuclear reactor is located.

""It's all about intimidation. Now the Russian leadership understands that their plans for a quick campaign have failed, and they are turning to nuclear blackmail, ""said the head of Ukraine's military intelligence.

The head of the GUR stressed that in any case, no matter what scenario the Russian leadership favors, it will be nuclear terrorism, ecocide and environmental catastrophe, which will affect both Europe and Russia. And Belarus and Ukraine will suffer the most.""

Here's a rough guess of how much Russia lost in $, obviously all of the equipment varies in price but Russia has been using a mixture of modern, expensive tanks and also shitty Soviet ones, so I'll try to average up the prices.

Tank price: $2 million = $724 million lost

MLRS price: $4 million = $248 million lost

Armored carrier: $1 million = $1.2 billion lost

Plane cost: $10 million = $580 million lost

Helicopter cost: $10 million = $830 million lost

Drones: $500,000 = $3.5 million lost

Artillery pieces: $500,000 = $67.5 million lost

AA pieces: $400,000 = $16.5 million lost

I have no idea what the average cost of a vehicle, military boat, or fuel tanks loaded with fuel would be, so I'll skip those.

Russia lost roughly 3-4 billion dollars in 2 weeks and that's just the price of the shit that got destroyed or taken. This doesn't include all the money spent on maintenance costs, fuel costs, rocket costs, guns/armor for troops, ammo costs, supply rations for their troops, etc. etc. etc. and all the other prices that waging war incur.

In total, they've probably invested, and effectively burned through over $20 billion dollars in these 2 weeks. To put it into perspective, the U.S. officially used about $800 billion in over 20 years of being in Afghanistan according to the department of defense (the real numbers may be slightly more) - but the U.S. economy is way larger and the U.S. has way more citizens as well, so $20bn in just 2 weeks is absolutely an absurd amount of money draining from a country that's getting hardcore sanctioned",False,1647078107.0,t3_tcb7ru,t3_tcb7ru,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

“Russia is a remarkable civilization: in the arts, music, literature, dance, film. In every sphere, it’s a profound, remarkable place––a whole civilization, more than just a country. At the same time, Russia feels that it has a “special place” in the world, a special mission. It’s Eastern Orthodox, not Western. And it wants to stand out as a great power. Its problem has always been not this sense of self or identity but the fact that its capabilities have never matched its aspirations. It’s always in a struggle to live up to these aspirations, but it can’t, because the West has always been more powerful. 

… In trying to match the West or at least manage the differential between Russia and the West, they resort to coercion. They use a very heavy state-centric approach to try to beat the country forward and upwards in order, militarily and economically, to either match or compete with the West. And that works for a time, but very superficially. Russia has a spurt of economic growth, and it builds up its military, and then, of course, it hits a wall. It then has a long period of stagnation where the problem gets worse. The very attempt to solve the problem worsens the problem, and the gulf with the West widens. The West has the technology, the economic growth, and the stronger military.

The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with a personal ruler. Instead of getting the strong state that they want, to manage the gulf with the West and push and force Russia up to the highest level, they instead get a personalist regime. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism. They’ve been in this bind for a while because they cannot relinquish that sense of exceptionalism, that aspiration to be the greatest power, but they cannot match that in reality. 

… Of course, this isn’t the same regime as Stalin’s or the tsar’s, either. There’s been tremendous change: urbanization, higher levels of education. The world outside has been transformed. And that’s the shock. The shock is that so much has changed, and yet we’re still seeing this pattern that they can’t escape from.

You have an autocrat in power—or even now a despot—making decisions completely by himself. Does he get input from others? Perhaps. We don’t know what the inside looks like. Does he pay attention? We don’t know. Do they bring him information that he doesn’t want to hear? That seems unlikely. Does he think he knows better than everybody else? That seems highly likely. Does he believe his own propaganda or his own conspiratorial view of the world? That also seems likely. These are surmises. Very few people talk to Putin, either Russians on the inside or foreigners.

And so we think, but we don’t know, that he is not getting the full gamut of information. He’s getting what he wants to hear. In any case, he believes that he’s superior and smarter. This is the problem of despotism. It’s why despotism, or even just authoritarianism, is all-powerful and brittle at the same time. Despotism creates the circumstances of its own undermining. The information gets worse. The sycophants get greater in number. The corrective mechanisms become fewer. And the mistakes become much more consequential.

Putin believed, it seems, that Ukraine is not a real country, and that the Ukrainian people are not a real people, that they are one people with the Russians. He believed that the Ukrainian government was a pushover. He believed what he was told or wanted to believe about his own military, that it had been modernized to the point where it could organize not a military invasion but a lightning coup, to take Kyiv in a few days and either install a puppet government or force the current government and President to sign some paperwork.

… With Ukraine, we have the assumption that it could be a successful version of Afghanistan, and it wasn’t. It turned out that the Ukrainian people are brave; they are willing to resist and die for their country. Evidently, Putin didn’t believe that. But it turned out that “the television President,” Zelensky, who had a twenty-five-per-cent approval rating before the war—which was fully deserved, because he couldn’t govern—now it turns out that he has a ninety-one-per-cent approval rating. It turned out that he’s got cojones. He’s unbelievably brave. Moreover, having a TV-production company run a country is not a good idea in peacetime, but in wartime, when information war is one of your goals, it’s a fabulous thing to have in place.

The biggest surprise for Putin, of course, was the West. All the nonsense about how the West is decadent, the West is over, the West is in decline, how it’s a multipolar world and the rise of China, et cetera: all of that turned out to be bunk. The courage of the Ukrainian people and the bravery and smarts of the Ukrainian government, and its President, Zelensky, galvanized the West to remember who it was. And that shocked Putin!

Around Ukraine, in all corners of this country, Ukrainians are being wakened, before first light, by air-raid sirens.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now calling it a war of annihilation. And when you see the images from one town and city after another it doesn’t seem much of an exaggeration.

This morning we hear of Mykolaiv, in the south-west, on the way to the southern city of Odesa – it’s under intense bombardment.

We hear about Melitopol, also in the south. It was one of the first towns to fall to the Russians. The report this morning is that the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, who was defiant when the Russians came in saying “I will not give up”, was taken away from his office by the Russians, a bag on his head.

Mariupol – there people are freezing, starving, dying, melting snow to drink, chopping wood to cook and people are being buried in mass graves.

It’s not just the south. Chernihiv in the north – before the war a city of 300,000 people – has been under a constant barrage of shelling, aerial bombardment and there too heating, gas, electricity and water supplies are cut.

Seventeen days and this is the situation across Ukraine.

""Hi, guys, I'm russian and I'm seeing a lot of posts pointing at Putin's support among russians. Like young people are against it, but older generation supports the invasion. This is technically true, but there is a huge detail.

Older generation doesn't support the invasion. They support the blatant lie told by propaganda. They aren't evil nor even militarized, they are just deceived.

Here are few things you need to know of how older people know about Ukraine. I know, this looks like a fucking random word generator, but this is what you'll believe if for >20 years if it's the only source of information. So, this is a parallel universe in the head of Putin and media:

There is no invasion to begin with. Zelensky is the head of war junta aimed at the genocide of russian population and ban of the russian language.

Ukrainian government is a puppet government of the US.

The goal of the US is the break up of Russia into several smaller states. This goal is dictated by ethnic hate towards russians and american jealousy about Russia's natural resources.

Ukraine was just about to attack Russia first.

The US had a secret biological laboratory for creating bio weapon that is able to target specific ethnic groups, specifically russians.

Russian army don't fight ukranian army. They fight nazi military groups that hold the entire Ukraine.

Ukraine as a country is fully made up by bolsheviks and it's russian by right.

The goal of ""special operation"" is to destroy nazis in Ukraine and free ukranian people from their reign.

Russian army doesn't bomb ukranian cities nor shoot civilians. They only target war machines, airbases etc. All casualties are the result of ukranian nazis attacks in order to blame russians.

This isn't me making up crazy shit, this is literally our news. Russian people who have no access nor faith to alternative information aren't supporting the war. They just live in the alternative reality. I can only feel sorry for them and I can't imagine the shock if their eyes will open one day.""",False,1647078634.0,t3_tcb7ru,t3_tcb7ru,,0,120,0,120,0,0,

Land - how on Earth will they accomplish that with no direct land borders?

 - airspace closures are to the west. turkey has not closed airspace to russia. https://i.insider.com/621f5a8e75b649001845a149?auto=webp so air is a more viable option than thought

Let me be clear, you can be unhappy with them, but pointing them as a Russian complicit is objectively doubtful and actively unhelpful.
Germany acted the way because it believed the way they approached it was right. After all, of you are responsible for a whole lot of destruction and suffering in two world wars and acknowledge your responsibility is it so far fetched that you do your utmost in preventing other great conflicts or at least try to contain them?
They firmly believed in what they experienced themselves in the slow formation of the EU, a steady improvement of relations to the point that war on the EU soil is unthinkable: ""Wandel durch Handel"" (political transition facilitated by trade). There were signs it wasn't working the same way in Russia on the government level, but it showed some promise in the general public over there.

Concerning the common criticism:
1) Nord-Stream:
A pipeline thorough the Baltic sea makes sense for both parties economically, since cutting the transit fees is like eliminating the middle man that does little for overall performance. It does cut into Ukraine leveraging power, but believing this would have stopped the invasion altogether is unlikely, given that Russia was ready to take economic repercussions. Though they didn't expect the now implemented severity apparently. Possibly it would have made Russia think just a little harder, but my impression from the point they are arguing from (historic, injustice to Russian population - yeah, mostly pretext I know, but even pretext has to carry at least some believability) is it wouldn't have changed the decision by Putin.
On the general dependence on gas it should suffice to say that it's a mix of domestic issues (atomic energy is deploy unpopular, so gas was seen as the way to transition to renewables) and the idea of above ""Wandel durch Handel""
2) Late diplomatic reactions:
Germany believed it had the responsibility to avoid open conflict. Therefore it put in maximum diplomatic effort in until the last minute. Weapon shipments would have cut into the credibility of these efforts especially since they worked have went against a long standing policy.
The turn they took afterwards and the tempo in which they did was actually quite astounding. But in fairness it was only consequential when your believes have been thoroughly shattered.
3) Opening a perspective for Serbia:
Serbia is torn. But there's still a lot political support for Russia. So why should we invite them into the EU especially with those allegiances they show? Well, to offer them a perspective - nothing more is on the table. It won't be more than that for the moment, but it gives incentive to align closer politically with the EU in the future. This is no reward for any action (far from it), but a political move to take them out of Russia's sphere of influence.

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow and met with their government officials.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia.

It gave me new insight into what is animating Putin's madness.

My Cliff-Notes summary of Ilyin's philosophy:

1. The real owner of Original Sin wasn't Adam, it was God who created the imperfect Adam in the first place.
2. Modern liberal societies, with civil service, democratic voting, and an emphasis on individual rights, are Satanic constructions that alienate humanity from God.
3. Ilyin believed that only ""heroic characters out of history"" who willed themselves to power could save humanity from this corrupted state. He was a big fan of Mussolini. and, of course, Hitler. But he believed Russians would ultimately display a ""superior fascism."" far better than the Italian and German varieties.
4. The underpinning of the Satanic liberal order in Europe were the middle classes and civil servants. Both had to be crushed to make way for a universalist order with a strong heroic, masculine leader at the top.
5. Ilyin did not believe that Ukrainians existed, they were merely Russians.  He always used quotation marks around ""Ukrainians"" and believed the liberal West ""invented"" the concept of Ukraine to divide Russia and make her weaker.
6. Empiricism also enabled the Satanic liberal order, replacing ""facts"" with a sense of unifying social oneness between the people and government through fictions would bring about a new virtuous state in harmony with God.
7. Ilyin's ideas have lead Putin to conclude that Russia will become the indispensable beacon of ""Christian Fascism"" that will, in time, overcome the Satanic liberal EU and replace it with a Russian dominated entity that will stretch from Lisbon to Vladivostok.

In this context of Ilyin, Putin's insane and brutal dash into Ukraine has its own kind of sick, internal ""logic.""

“We have warned the US that pumping weapons into Ukraine, which they have orchestrated, from a number of countries, is not just a dangerous move - it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets. We have warned of the consequences that can result from this reckless transfer to Ukraine of such types of weapons as portable air-defence systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on.”

WW3 (and the end of everything) is looming ever closer.

What the actual F?!

It goes without saying they could strike those convoys on Ukrainian soil (after all they kill moms and babies in hospitals!), and once the convoys are IN UKRAINE, they’re driven by UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. Russians don’t know when these convoys are coming, so they can’t do sh*t about it (of course, they’re secret operations). 

The Russian means exactly that: stop arming Ukraine or we’ll hit these convoys o their way to Ukraine. If they will or not, that’s another issue, but Jesus Christ…!

The Russians still have the initiative, meaning they choose whatever their next move is. The Ukrainians are only responding to Russias moves, but due to Ukrainian skill and tenacity and Western real time intelligence, they are knowing how to hit Russia at precisely the right time and place.

I expect the Ukrainians will launch a  major counterattack in 2-6 weeks when the Russian supply and morale situation will be desperate, attempting to cut off the main supply route to Belarus on the Kyiv axis. This is logical because this Kyiv is the grand prize and denying Russia that would be huge and it’s the closest axis to Western Ukraine where a build up of forces would occur.

Ukraine would want to husband their tank, helicopter, and Air Force equipment to build up for this operation, so they can focus maximum force there. Imagine the panic in Russian forces sieging Kyiv if there were suddenly two Ukrainian armored divisions on their supply lines. Depending on success, they would probably either follow through towards Sumy to relieve that siege or consolidate new defensive positions on the Belarusian border and between Kyiv and Sumy.

No, that's just the standard statement they make. It's a purposefully vague threat.

And they're probably not lying there, either. If Finland joined NATO, it's only natural they made some strategic changes to strenghten their military position in the North. That already is a ""military repercussion"".

> The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the solidarity between EU countries in dealing with external threats by introducing a mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union). This clause provides that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.

> This obligation of mutual defence is binding on all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries which are NATO members.

> This provision is supplemented by the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which provides that EU countries are obliged to act jointly where an EU country is the victim of a terrorist attack 

Not to mention that we have a Nordic trilateral defence pact (Sweden-Norway-Finland) as well as the the UK's promise to join if Sweden gets attacked and the US' promise to join if Finland gets attacked.

So regardless of us being in NATO, invading either of us will more or less have the exact same outcome and trigger WW3.

I'd initially thought they were jus gonna try n take the East part of Ukraine, which would've been much more doable. If Russia's gonna maximise its leverage in negotiations it should reorient its troops from a full country wide take over to something more achievable like east ukraine, something it can take back home as a win.

Then potentially Russia could negotiate an 'exit' from the East if they're allowed to be autonomous (as autonomous as Belarus is) in exchange for easing tensions.


As far as war reperations, that's an interesting idea, but I think when that's typically happened its been when a state or military has collapsed internally, has no leverage left.

My current pet theory is that Putin is trying to pull Nato into the war with false flag atrocities and war crimes, the idea being he can ""gracefully"" bow out after Nato smashes his troops up a bit, and it makes him look like the hero for avoiding global nuclear war.  Pretty much everyone in Russia knows that they can't win the war if Nato fights against them, if the propoganda can sell enough Russians and Russia's closest allies that it was really Ukraine at fault for the war crimes and that NATO was really unfair to use them as a justification to bully him, he has an exit to the war that doesn't require him admitting that he was a fucking moron to pick a fight in the first place, and that Russia's troops are weak as shit.

They would *have to* help rebuild, or you'll just get the same Russia we got after the collapse of the Soviet Union - a whole nation of people in abject misery and poverty, looking for another strongman who would quickly and decisively lift them out of poverty and humiliation. This scenario cannot be repeated. We've established now that Russia is the whole world's problem too in this day and age of globalisation. We want peace from Russia? Then we need to help build a foundation upon which such peace can be built.

People here often think with their feelings and don't really think about the 'after'. But the conflict won't end with a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia. It'll only be entering its second, drawn-out, painful phase for both countries. A fragile period where Western powers must help rebuild both nations. Because if they don't, then 30 years from now the West can only blame itself for not securing a docile, prospering, demilitarized Russia. Putin and Russians are a convenient target to place blame upon, but it's easy to say 'well that's not my problem, it's theirs' and then not do jack shit because you expect a bully to not bully.

Bully needs a thorough beating. But after that, the bully needs to be rehabilitated and reintroduced into society, because if you don't, he'll keep bullying. And then your alternative is to basically glass Russia and keep killing them, soldiers and civilians alike, because the WEst finally learned how a society that's been raised on heavy anti-West propaganda will resist playing nice.

His underlings don't know what to do. They rose through the ranks and attained their position thanks to political gamesmanship, backstabbing their predecessors and feeding Putin all the sweet nothings he needs to hear at night in order to sleep with his imperial bear body pillow.

The 'territory' gains by Russia are meaningless in many instances, because they do not control the rear flank at all (hence we see the ENDLESS list of destroyed supply convoys).  Russia is advancing but leaving their rear flank badly exposed.

I expect when the Russians on the west side of Ukraine get close enough to Kyiv they will experience a large counter offensive from their rear and be totally decimated, leaving a corridor on that side of the city open (which is important as that is the key supply line).

Russia has royally fucked this up.  Cities are resisting as anyone who took 5 minutes to look at this knew they would.

In case you are:
1) Germany is currently sending it's minister for foreign affairs into the Balkan specifically in order to make sure the countries see a perspective outside of Russian influence. Supporting a possibility to join the EU should provide that.
2) Serbia is torn. There are signs they support Russia, especially since demonstrations and public events, but there are also signs they don't fully endorse it, like their voting on the UN Resolution and equally public demonstrations (not government endorsed though) pro Ukraine.
3) Calling Germany a Russian asset is some stretch. They have vested interest in keeping in its industry running in transition period away from Russian imports, so they won't support an immediate block of energy imports.

> Vladimir Putin wanted Russia to join Nato but did not want his country to have to go through the usual application process and stand in line “with a lot of countries that don’t matter”, according to a former secretary general of the transatlantic alliance.

>George Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary who led Nato between 1999 and 2003, said Putin made it clear at their first meeting that he wanted Russia to be part of western Europe. “They wanted to be part of that secure, stable prosperous west that Russia was out of at the time,” he said.

> The Labour peer recalled an early meeting with Putin, who became Russian president in 2000. “Putin said: ‘When are you going to invite us to join Nato?’ And [Robertson] said: ‘Well, we don’t invite people to join Nato, they apply to join Nato.’ And he said: ‘Well, we’re not standing in line with a lot of countries that don’t matter.’”

>The account chimes with what Putin told the late David Frost in a BBC interview shortly before he was first inaugurated as Russian president more than 21 years ago. Putin told Frost he would not rule out joining Nato “if and when Russia’s views are taken into account as those of an equal partner”.

Invasions alone are really complex and difficult to execute - nonetheless when you have a botched beginning like Russia has had with this one. Ukraine is on their home turf. They have (mostly) newer and better maintained equipment. Because they’re on home turf, logistics will come easier to them. Invasions call for moving insane amounts of pieces over large swaths of unfamiliar land. Yeah, you can drop your troops into a country or send them across a border, but the further you move in and the longer it takes to capture areas, the harder it is to establish and maintain logistic integrity. The soldiers keep having to move, fight, and ultimately use resources that they’re cut off from like food, fuel, and ammo. Hence why Russia has been taking time over the last few days to rectify the logistic issues. Another issue is that the vast majority of those Russian soldiers don’t know shit about Ukraine, and the intel/instruction they’re getting is clearly inconsistent. This boils down to long-known issues with the Russian military and how they depend on incompetency to prevent the military from becoming to powerful at home (because they would become a threat to Putin) 

There was a lot of chatter recently about Russia’s casualty count being very high - somewhere in the 10ks. Causalities account for deaths, injuries, MIA, deserters, and POWs. These numbers are estimated by taking confirmed deaths and multiplying them between x3-5. So if Ukraine has lost 1300 troops, they’ve experienced roughly 3900 - 6500 casualties. That’s no small amount. Especially when you factor in how many civilian deaths have happened. Russia has lost ~6k soldiers. So the casualties would be in the ballpark of 18-30k. There’s a lot of room for error there, and I’m no expert - but I do listen to experts and this is what they’re saying. Ultimately, if you’re looking at percentages, they’re pretty close in terms of military losses. It doesn’t surprise me that Russia has lost more.

I'd listen to what outside Western officials have to say on the matter, and last I saw the estimates have generally been that Ukraine is inflicting more casualties than they're taking, at maybe like a 1.5x-2x ratio, so if we go by Western officials saying Russia has taken like 7000 KIA, then we can assume that Ukraine has taken at least 3000-4000 KIA.",False,1647110930.0,t3_tcb7ru,t1_i0ebw70,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The Soviet Union was a (very imperfect, but still) socialist state, head of the Warsaw Pact, an economic peer to the US at its peak, had a fairly decent quality of life relative to the west, an exporter of what was at the time an influential ideology, probably the #2 or even sometimes #1 military on the planet, and a superpower.  Not *good* but in many cases, as good as it'd get in that area of the world for a good long while.

By contrast, Russia is 60% the population (290 vs 140 million), less land, a *far* smaller economy, a *much* lower quality of life relative to the west over the past 30 years average, has no ideology at all (fair enough, neither does the west anymore; the new ""cold war"" is intellectually barren), a military that's heavily weighted towards terror weapons & corruption, and is in no way shape or form a superpower.  And though things may have at times improved, they're now going pear-shaped again.

Ukraine is not in NATO, and so NATO has no formal obligation. Support has to be considered, calculated, and measured. NATO needs Ukraine to not fall... but also needs to be wary of setting a precedent in supporting a non-NATO nation. They aren't a world army there to help anyone who needs a big army on their side. They're a fee paying self defense members club. If they backed Ukraine fully from day one, other candidate members, e.g. Finland, Georgia, Moldova, could simply ask for the protection without the fees and participation. The NATO expansion Putin wishes to halt would indeed be halted. NATO also has an aspect of standardisation. One of the key challenges with Ukraine is that they don't use NATO standard equipment. Unlike supporting a NATO member, you can't just send Ukraine some rifle magazines from Germany and ammunition from Belgium, it isn't compatible with Ukrainian equipment. One of the key NATO aspects is full interoperability of equipment at every level. Standardized electronics, interchangeable ammunition, universal adoption of logistics vehicle sizes. The entire issue around the MiGs is exactly this. NATO providing non-NATO nations with fighter jets is both an escalation and political challenge in proving it is not an escalation, and also a literal physical and logistical challenge because the systems on board aren't compatible.

Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia? They're in NATO. An attack on them gets the kitchen sink in response. All of NATO rolls in and everything is geared up for support.

In Greek literature, Ares often represents the **physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality and bloodlust (""overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering)**""

**In the Iliad, Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion** toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the battlefield at Troy

 >The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (Russian: Всеросси́йская чрезвыча́йная коми́ссия, tr. Vserossíyskaya chrezvycháynaya komíssiya, IPA: [fsʲɪrɐˈsʲijskəjə tɕrʲɪzvɨˈtɕæjnəjə kɐˈmʲisʲɪjə]), abbreviated as VChK (Russian: ВЧК, IPA: [vɛ tɕe ˈka]), and commonly known as Cheka (Russian: Чека́, IPA: [tɕɪˈka]; from the initialism ЧК, ChK), was the first of a succession of Soviet secret-police organizations. Established on December 5 (Old Style) 1917 by the Sovnarkom, it came under the leadership of Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat-turned-Bolshevik.
 
**[Chekism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekism)** 
 
 >Chekism (Russian: Чекизм; from Cheka, a colloquial name of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, the first Soviet secret police organization) is a term to describe the situation in the Soviet Union where the secret police strongly controlled all spheres of society. It is also used by critics of the current Kremlin authorities to describe the power enjoyed by law-enforcement agencies in contemporary Russia.
 
**[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Soviet_secret_police_agencies)** 
 
 >There were a succession of Soviet secret police agencies over time. The first secret police after the October Revolution, created by Vladimir Lenin's decree on December 20, 1917, was called ""Cheka"" (ЧК). Officers were referred to as ""chekists"", a name that is still informally applied to people under the Federal Security Service of Russia, the KGB's successor in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For most agencies listed here secret policing operations were only part of their function; for instance, the KGB was both the secret police and the intelligence agency.

The West is a series of institutions and values. The West is not a geographical place. Russia is European, but not Western. Japan is Western, but not European. “Western” means rule of law, democracy, private property, open markets, respect for the individual, diversity, pluralism of opinion, and all the other freedoms that we enjoy, which we sometimes take for granted. We sometimes forget where they came from. But that’s what the West is. And that West, which we expanded in the nineties, in my view properly, through the expansion of the European Union and nato, is revived now, and it has stood up to Vladimir Putin in a way that neither he nor Xi Jinping expected.

If you assumed that the West was just going to fold, because it was in decline and ran from Afghanistan; if you assumed that the Ukrainian people were not for real, were not a nation; if you assumed that Zelensky was just a TV actor, a comedian, a Russian-speaking Jew from Eastern Ukraine—if you assumed all of that, then maybe you thought you could take Kyiv in two days or four days.

 >Deutsche Physik (German: [ˈdɔʏtʃə fyˈziːk], lit. ""German Physics"") or Aryan Physics (German: Arische Physik)  was a nationalist movement in the German physics community in the early 1930s which had the support of many eminent physicists in Germany. The term was taken from the title of a four-volume physics textbook by Nobel Laureate Philipp Lenard in the 1930s. Deutsche Physik was opposed to the work of Albert Einstein and other modern theoretically based physics, which was disparagingly labeled ""Jewish physics"" (German: Jüdische Physik).

Here in the west we have heaps of people who think vaccines contain microchips, or that celebrities sacrifice children for their adrenochrome, or that JFK Junior is going to return from the dead and become the next president.

People are very vulnerable to manipulation - and the common misconception is that it's just dumb/gullible people, but that's not actually the case. What happens is people get gradually manipulated in small ways, until they've become so invested in a particular group/belief system, that due to the sunk cost fallacy, it's a bigger concession/leap to admit they were wrong, than to accept the next ridiculous claim the group makes. So a normal every day person can go from accepting a few small (and believable, if there's no fact-checking done) bits of misinformation, to eventually believing something as ridiculous as 5G causing COVID, or the earth being flat. 

Now imagine you're living in a country where all of the main news outlets are propaganda. Russian state TV looks like obvious propaganda to us as outsiders, but compared to some of the ridiculous Q-anon, flat earth etc nonsense that people have been led to believe, it's not even as big a leap to get someone to believe their nonsense. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who read/watched RT news back when I was younger and didn't realise it was a Russian propaganda outlet, it wasn't until I saw them speaking about Russian-specific issues that the bias became evident. So imagine you're an older person, not super tech savvy, and living in a country where EVERY major news outlet is like that, and getting most of your news from the TV? Of course most of them are going to be brainwashed unfortunately.

Hell I live outside of Russia and one of my family members (who was otherwise fairly intelligent and not the type to fall for dumb propaganda) buys the Russian propaganda narrative and thinks the war is fake and that Ukraine is bombing themselves. So I'm not surprised people *in* Russia have been brainwashed to believe that. Especially when you're born into Russia and so there's a certain added cultural pressure to support your country and believe that Russia is the ""good guys"".

> A suspicious device resembling those used in the bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September.[6][7] On 23 September, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War.[8] Three FSB agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police.[5] On 24 September 1999, head of FSB Nikolay Patrushev announced that the incident in Ryazan had been an anti-terror drill and the device found there contained only sugar.[9]

> [...]

> Parliament member Yuri Shchekochikhin filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events, but the motions were rejected by the Russian Duma in March 2000. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev.[10] The commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Kovalev Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, have since died in apparent assassinations.[11][12] The Commission’s lawyer and investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and served four years in prison for revealing state secrets.[13] Former FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who defected and blamed the FSB for the bombings, was poisoned and killed in London in 2006. A British inquiry later determined that Litvinenko's murder was ""probably"" carried out with the approval of Putin and Patrushev.[14]

> ...According to some historians and journalists, the bombings were coordinated by the Russian state security services to bring Putin into the presidency.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Others disagree with such theories.[24][25][26][27][28][29] Independent investigations have faced obstruction from Russian security services, raising further suspicions about their involvement in the attacks.[30][31]

A few years ago I was tasked with helping to build a new fence along the Norwegian/Russian border. I was using a helicopter to put a new camera surveillance towers along the new fence. The Russians were on their side of the border watching and making sure we didn't make any transgressions. What kind of transgressions you ask, well not an inch and I mean INCH of our equipment was supposed to cross to the Russian side and well that meant that I couldn't hover with my nose into the wind because the tail of the helicopter would come over on the Russian side and their commander would throw a shitfit. The length of the helicopter was around 37 ft total and if I were to turn nose first I would be around 1-1,5 feet inside their border making my job hell of a lot easier.

The old fence didn't go exactly along the border but turned a bit into Norway and the new fence was to go exactly on the border between the two. Meaning I had to be careful when delivering material to the new points. I did well but some other poor fella didn't. At the end of the day one person was missing from the meeting, we first thought that he went home but he didn't show up in the evening.

The next day he showed up and told us a doozy of a story. Apparently as he was walking along the new border to get to one of the new sites where I had put up a tower and all of the sudden he was confronted by two Russian guards that claimed that he had trespassed into Russia and was promptly taken into custody for questioning over night. The GPS track showed that he had not in fact crossed the border and they basically kidnapped a Norwegian citizen. Nothing came of it all because relations and all.

Another fun fact, the sami people who had reindeer in the area could freely move between the countries.

Another fun fact, between the border of Russia and Norway along the river there are these surveillance towers that are still manned to this day to watch the Russian border.",1647078033.0,1647077813.0,t3_tcb7ru,t1_i0cmr96,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

It's equally easy to think that everyone is a fucking traitor when that bubble gets burst and you're still on the other side of a screen from everyone and don't know who's saying what to who anywhere that you can't listen

Putin is paranoid, everyone around him is paranoid, everyone under them is paranoid. they should be.   

there's definitely at least one person preparing some Stalin type moves besides Putin right now, probably several, and step one of that game is eliminating your peers - everyone who put stalin into power was dead by like 1937. most of the people who put putin into power are dead. 

so I would guess most people in power right now are either plotting, fearful of others plots, fearful of Putin, fearful of being thrown under the bus by a colleague to escape consequences, or out of a window so that they are out of the way. 

It's likely that level of paranoia where everyone is afraid to be honest just as much as they're afraid to lie, communication breaks down because there's no trust whatsoever. 

pretty much everyone in a position of power in Russia right now has multiple other people who stand to gain if they are dead.

 >An Associated Press (AP) investigation revealed in 2017 that more than 100 United Nations (UN) peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti over a 10-year period and none were ever jailed. The report further found that over the previous 12 years there had been almost 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other UN personnel around the world. AP found the abuse to be much greater than originally thought. After the AP report, U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, urged all countries to hold UN peacekeepers accountable for any sexual abuse and exploitation.

He rigs the elections so he can claim smashing victories of 75%, not because he wouldn't win otherwise. We don't know exactly how many are actually voting for him but we can assume it's over 50%. His support outside of Russian big cities is substantial.

The reason he goes to the trouble of rigging the elections is to prevent any kind of opposition from getting any legitimacy or growing momentum and to convince any undecided citizens that he is inevitable.

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. Then-prime minister Vladimir Putin's handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.

Its domestic airline is going to crumble within a year with it being extremely dangerous to get from one end of Russia to the other by air.  Many industries are going to fall behind by being cut off from most of the World's technology.

They really are going to be living in a bubble 10 or 20 years or more behind the rest of the World with a standard of living far below what they have now which was already below that of the West.

NO ONE wants nuclear war, not you, not me, not the US, not the UK, not PUTIN.  The lines are very very clear and they don't exist inside Ukraine.. Ukraine is no man's land as far as nuclear doctrine goes.  If we cross into Russia or Russia crosses into NATO, we have a different discussion.

I made a big long post in the early days acknowledging the fear of the newer generations having to deal with this for the first time.  I got told I was karma whoring by the same group (despite sympathizing with them).  Sigh.  

Regardless of what folks want to think here, there is no magical line in this conflict (again so long as native borders are respected).  A NFZ is not automatically nukes for example.  Troops in the ground isn't nukes.  Naval warfare isn't nukes (unless inside territorial waters).  The concept that there are levels of grey seems lost these days.

Javelins and Stingers are more combat effective. They're also predominantly defensive, and short range. Unless Ukrainian troops actively reached the Russian border in a counteroffensive, they can't be used to strike Russian soil.

MiG-29s are multirole aircraft with substantial range. They're not a ground attack aircraft but not are they an interceptor or pure air superiority fighter. They could be used to overfly the Russian border and launch standoff air-to-ground missiles or directly strafe or bomb targets within Russia. That's a very different proposition and a very different sort of liability to giving Ukrainians some man portable missiles.

Giving Ukraine better SAM systems like the S-300 is a much smarter choice. They can intercept even high altitude bombers but don't risk fuelling Russian claims of Ukrainian aggression.

For what it's worth, the MiGs *are* political theatre. Ukraine has at least 80% of its fixed wing air assets intact. Frankly, they're not using the MiGs they have.

I never once said anything of that. But if you take the image of Putin in 2022 and want to apply to the Putin of, lets say 2004, its just not factful and very disingenuous, because Putin back then did not behave the way he does now.

In his early years he worked to improve the relations between Europe and Russia as well. And it worked, thats what led to the complacency in the first place.

Coincidentally enough, Bush pushing this hard for Georgia and Ukraine to be in NATO likely accelerated the invasion of Georgia in 08. 

Thats also why Germany vetoed Ukrainian NATO membership in 2013, because Merkel feared it would lead to another war.

I’m no expert but obviously have been reading a lot about this topic over the past few weeks and this idea has been talked about by a lot of actual experts, even years ago.

It’s counterintuitive for the west to want to defend Ukraine from Russian advancements yet not have them join NATO but it’s actually the best scenario that forces a “stalemate” on paper for good.

On paper Ukraine will have to say they will not join NATO or the EU but in all actuality we know that western ideals and economics would out compete Russian ones in a neutral state. Just look at Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland for example (I know they are in EU but they’re not in NATO). Still, they are far more aligned with NATO than Russia because countries with democracy and free markets naturally come together more so than any amount of political or economic influence Russia could try to exert.

What you can say, is that there is disinterest and negligence directed eastwards. This is true for the eastern part of Germany as much or even more to the countries behind it.
This may be due to the Reunification bring an euphemism, as West Germany swallowed the East and replaced all institutions with its own. The kind of belittlement continues to follow eastwards, general notion: ""You still have to prove you are one of us Western democrats."" And with recent troubles with Hungary and Poland they even feel their concern reinforced.

The notable exception to that negligence is German economy, which sensed great opportunity for cheaper labor and new export markets. Energy dependency from Russia wasn't really a thing of public concern. Instead energy providers reigned in conjunction the pet projects of politicians that praised the the closer ties that would give Russia to Europe.
If anything, the debate was quite short, being Russia would hurt itself so much ceasing exporting oil, gas and coal they would be stupid to even consider endangering it. So Russia appeared tamed.

When there was war in Georgia it wasn't big news like it is now. The annexation of Crimea produced outrage, but there was a feeling that it went so smooth, that you can do very little but refuse recognition and apply sanctions.
There was serious routing for the Maidan movement though. But the general public was appeased with having sanctions set in place. The issue of energy dependency still hadn't reached the public interest or sparked debate.

There was approval to be won when politicians had good connections to Russia (there might be the source of the Moltov-Ribbentrop 2), as the expectation was that this would allow to solve issues and keep Russia from straying to far (idea being the good angel on Russia's shoulder). Antagonizing Russia in contrast would at best seen neutral.

A normal government, presumably responsive to its citizens, would want to avoid conflict as much as possible, since international conflict distracts from the central mission of providing for its people. I wonder how much provocation is typical or average before a government like that reallocates its attention and resources to national defense?

You are right, because I have a bias where US and its allies created this whole Ukrainian crisis by not respecting Russia's influence and interest in the region. I believe they pushed for a coup in 2014 and kept making short promises to Ukraine while actually using it just to weaken Russia.

Basically I believe US and Russia are playing geopolitics in Ukraine, and I pity Ukrainians. I find their president extremely naive, I mean, he was a comedian not a politician so this is hardly surprising, who didn't recognize the danger, and instead of playing fool to catch wise led to a pointless war where Ukraine is in a lose-lose situation. There's literally nothing to gain here but prayers.

Everyone will lose in the world, including the US that might be happy of a foe getting much weaker, even if that will mean increased energy bills for some time they are the least concerned.

So all this tragedy, suffering, which is obviously prompted by russian agression and imperialism, by putin's soulless fixation with history and his delusions has been created by a massive lack of ""realpolitik"" by Ukrainian and most importantly European/American leadership that thinks we live in an idealistic rather than a ""real"" world.

I truly believe those poor Ukrainians are being used by as a piece for foreign geopolitical chess, and I pity their awful leadership that didn't knew how to play it.

Look at Mariupol. Look at Kharkiv, look at the refugees. And here you fools gloating on sanctions that hit only us, russian civilians, but have 0 chances of helping anyone in Mariupol at all.

I haven't rejected it at all.

I get that there are a lot of bad faith actors hanging around here right now, and I've tried to explain my stance already, but I'll say this again to be clear: I don't support Putin, I'm 99% sure that he orchestrated or was involved in this and other crimes, but precisely because the Russian state frustrated any attempts at properly investigating the matter we do not have concrete proof of what happened. It's very likely that it was all destroyed and anyone in the know that was deemed a risk murdered. I'm old enough to remember both the assassination of Litvinenko and, more recently, the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in my own country so its not exactly news that Putin will resort to that.

But it's important to recognise exactly what the weight of the evidence you have is, because if you make accusations with *any* holes at all then the Russian disinformation machine will bog you down in the minutiae instead of letting you discuss the bigger picture.

Part of the cultural upheaval in the US is that the Republicans represent a racially and culturally homogenous notion of what being an American is versus Democrats effectively championing a pluralistic liberal democracy that, at least in word if not deed, offers the possibility for true integration of all races and creeds into an American identity.

With Israel based largely on being a Jewish state, it *requires* a notion of ethnically based citizenship in spirit if not word. Assuming Republicans do not destroy American democracy, it’ll be hard for the next wave of American politicians to not increasingly object to Israel‘s perspectives and actions. Case in point, Ilhan Omar’s calling out Israel and Biden’s pivot to multiculturalism. While she was forced to step back somewhat, she was not run out of office for being an Antisemite, suggesting popular opinion did not support it enough to realize it. This was likely including a significant Israeli lobbying push because allowing her views to become normalized would lead to more damning questions being asked.

We moved back into my childhood home, which was a rambling, uninsulated money pit. I love it, but we took out loans on the home itself to get insulated, convert to solar, get batteries and an electric car.

It probably cost 80K which we did not have, but it allowed us to keep our house now. We were paying $400 for heat in the winter, this month if we hadn't, it would probably cost $1200 in this crisis. 

Our energy bills went down by 75% on the house and the car went from putting gas into it to putting sun into it, so ABSOLUTELY we have benefited and it's worth it. Home heating/cooling bills down by 75% and the car drives for free as well as NJ giving toll decreases to anybody driving an electric car.

We were extremely lucky and have a huge roof space with unobstructed Southern exposure. Most people can't do this, it's true, but it's proof of concept.

Batteries and solar are a good investment. Particularly in a crisis. If you're not doing it as a government, it's rather criminally stupid and cruel and furthering the narrative that oil is more important than human suffering.

It's still less expensive to charge an electric car off the grid than it is to buy gas.

On 30 November the Red Army also attacked Finland, in the Winter War of 1939–1940. By autumn 1940, after conquering its portion of Poland, Nazi Germany shared an extensive border with USSR, with whom it remained neutrally bound by their non-aggression pact and trade agreements. Another consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, carried out by the Southern Front in June–July 1940 and Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940).

The president has ten days (excluding Sundays) to sign a bill passed by Congress. A regular veto occurs when the President returns the legislation to the house in which it originated, usually with a message explaining the rationale for the veto. **This veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House. If this occurs, the bill becomes law over the President's objections.** A pocket veto occurs when Congress adjourns during the ten-day period. The president cannot return the bill to Congress. The president's decision not to sign the legislation is a pocket veto and Congress does not have the opportunity to override.

Even when a whole justice and law enforcement system still largely exists and plays a role in society? What do you mean when the arbiter of justice is gone? I hope you do realize that a weaker legislative and executive branch don't translate into a weaker judicial branch. If anything, laws have largely been a massive player in ***systematic*** racism. Take the War on Drugs which has effectively imprisoned large swaths of minority communities over senseless laws. Take the War on Terrorism which to this day still violates our rights in the name of ""counter-terrorism,"" especially towards Muslim communities.

Your so-called ""arbiter of justice"" hold a massive stake in injustice.

>To the minorities, the powerless, the abused... They see no difference given both yield a survival of the fittest paradigm.

You mean governments consistently fucking these people over and blocking entry into actually gaining any form of political, economic, or social standing are suddenly their biggest supports? Spare me, there's still a massive wealth gap over half a century later for when local *governments* enacted Jim Crow laws and the federal government approved of segregation. Look at the Texas abortion ban, where the government is trying to deny women the right of bodily autonomy by skirting around conventional legislation.

> If you're pro war crimes go ahead I don't care what you think.

Go ahead cite what part of Geneva convention. I'll wait. Or maybe you don't know anything.

> Support your position. Lol

I have many times. Don't make the country killing civilians stronger. My position is easy to support.

> Redditors can be absolute morons

Once again look in the mirror. You don't even know what a war crime is.

> Let the adults have discussions without getting all emotional

Adults know what a war crime is.

You should read this you'll see sanctions on medication is not a war crime
