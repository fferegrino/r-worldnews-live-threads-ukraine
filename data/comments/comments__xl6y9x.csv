Day 211 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet day, no shelling, and no missiles fired at us, at least not yet, but it’s already 3am, so it *probably* won’t happen. Though it was somewhat loud here, but not because of explosions. We just got a new air raid siren installed nearby, and it almost sounds deafening, which is a good thing. Before this we had no nearby working sirens in our district, so the only siren we heard was from an app on our phones.

With that missile strike from yesterday all they managed to destroy was 1 car and a garage that it was in, but they were most likely aiming at the apartment buildings that were nearby. And a couple of days ago the missiles that they fired at railway infrastructure in Kholodna Hora district hit a refrigerator train car, and that refrigerator had bodies of their own troops. Are they now trying to avoid paying compensation to the families of the dead Russians by completely destroying the bodies or something? 

I’m getting disappointed by Russian “protests”, it looks like they already stopped protesting, and it hasn’t even been 2 days yet. They are already getting conscripted with no resistance, just some crying from the families of conscripts and that’s it. I guess slaves will always be slaves, no one but themselves can help them. Maybe mountains of corpses will help change their minds, 50k dead is already done, next milestone is 500k, if that won’t wake them up, then it will be 5 million dead next, and 50 million after that.

.“It’s not a partial mobilisation, it’s a 100% mobilisation,” said Alexandra Garmazhapova, president of the Free Buryatia Foundation, an activist group that has reported on the draft in the region. In the past day, she said, she and her colleagues had received and identified more than 3,000 reports of povestka, or draft papers, being delivered in Buryatia within just 24 hours of Vladimir Putin announcing the draft.

>Despite assurances that Russia would be seeking men who had recently served in the army and had combat experience, activists pointed to a number of cases of men in their 50s receiving draft notices.

>One woman said a 52-year-old relative had been delivered a povestka shortly before the president announced the draft the previous day.

>Yanina Nimayeva, a journalist from Ulan-Ude in Buryatia, complained that her 38-year-old husband had received a draft notice despite never having served in the army.

As they were led from their prison cell deep inside Russian-occupied Ukraine, Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Huynh contemplated their uncertain fate: Were they about to be freed — or would they be killed?

Days after their capture in June, the Kremlin proclaimed that the men, both American military veterans, were suspected war criminals and refused to rule out that they could face the death penalty. In a phone call with his aunt Thursday, Drueke said that in that moment, it seemed things “could go either way.”
“That was one of those moments,” said the aunt, Dianna Shaw, “where it was a gut punch for me.”
The Americans were released Wednesday as part of a prisoner exchange between the governments in Kyiv and Moscow, an agreement as stunning as it was sprawling. In addition to Drueke, 40, and Huynh, 28, the Russian government agreed to release eight other foreign nationals who had joined the war on behalf of Ukraine, plus 215 Ukrainians. Fifty-five Russian fighters were freed in exchange, along with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian opposition politician who has such warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Putin is believed to be the godfather to Medvedchuk’s daughter.

Being based out of Texas I’ve signed up for hurricane relief duty three times. The first was run by HEB, a large supermarket chain here. Our job was to get food, water, and medical supplies in to people who had been cut off because their infrastructure had been destroyed.


Before the food trucks could roll a whole series of specialized crews had to blaze the trail in a specific order. The line-crews and the chainsaw crews went first, as long as the road itself was still intact. They opened it up for the bulldozers and the compactors to get to where the road was washed-out so that the chainsaw crews could go forward. Then the food and water trucks could go. Just getting one truck in to one place took a whole choreographed dance of specialists and specialized equipment working in concert.




They had set up temporary distribution centers where trucks full of just one thing could get unloaded and re-loaded with mixes of what a community that had been cut off for days might need. That was the most impressive part. If you’ve ever seen someone new to driving a forklift compared to someone who is really good at it? You know, it’s a HUGE difference. I’d pull in to the center and immediately a whole team would descend on my truck with bar-code readers, with lap-tops, and they would get me unloaded and re-loaded blazingly quickly, and then know exactly where I should go and how I should get there and send me on my way.


Everything didn’t go perfectly smoothly. “For want of a nail…” A fuel-truck that was meant for a truck-stop had broken down. Trucks backed up waiting for it. One truck being delayed caused hundreds to be delayed, and that rippled through the entire operation. But the logistics experts at HEB adjusted their plans, things slowed down a little for a few hours, but they didn’t break, and then everything got up to full speed again.


That was my first hurricane relief. My second was run by a group that had formed in response to the hurricane. It was a disaster on top of a disaster. I think that we probably did more harm than good. Reefer trucks ran out of fuel waiting to be unloaded and all of the food spoiled. Distribution workers didn’t even have bar-code readers. We clogged up precious truck-stop lanes that HEB drivers could have put to better use. I learned my lesson. Stick with the pros.



You know the cliché about tactics and logistics. It’s a cliché because it’s true. Having big new state-of-the-art bulldozers at the front of the column would be nice. And that was where the journalists wanted to be to take pictures of the relief efforts that were underway. But sometimes the only thing available was an old bobcat. HEB would put a really good bobcat operator on it, and they’d get the job done.



I understand the desire to see fancy new equipment on the front-lines of the war in Ukraine. Fancy equipment is nice. But this war is going to be won by well-fed Ukrainian soldiers who have plenty of bullets and boots and first-aid kits and proper clothing, and by the Ukrainian truck drivers and chainsaw crews and road crews who got it to them.",1663873831.0,1663873751.0,t3_xl6y9x,t3_xl6y9x,,0,217,0,217,3,0,{'gid_1': 2}

A bipartisan group of lawmakers asked the Pentagon to send advanced drones to Ukraine in a letter sent to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Sept. 21 and obtained by CNN.

""Ukraine could better confront Russian threats"" with advanced Unmanned Aircraft Systems, or drones, ""like the MQ-1C Gray Eagle or the MQ-9A Reaper,"" a group of 17 bipartisan lawmakers wrote in the letter to Austin.

""These advanced UAS systems, which could be staged far from the war's front lines, would provide the continuous surveillance and long-range precision tracking and targeting needed to counter Russian rockets and missiles,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Lawmakers stressed in the letter that it is important to complete the assessment of whether to send MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones ""in a timely manner.""

""While important, thorough risk assessment and mitigation should not come at the expense of Ukrainian lives,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the letter.

The Pentagon is aware of Ukraine's request for MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing at the Pentagon Thursday.

""We are aware that Ukrainians have asked for Gray Eagles, or have an interest in Gray Eagles, no decisions have been made in that regard,"" Ryder said.

The US has, throughout the conflict, given Ukraine other weapons that include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities like Puma drones, ScanEagle drones, Switchblade drones and Phoenix Ghost drones, Ryder said.

Russia does not have an NCO corps because NCOs equal autonomy on a troop level, which means that the military could pose a threat to the ruling class.

By not having NCOs, it keeps the grunts dependent on high level command for everything including combined arms coordination, and this deliberate impotence prevents the army from acting without orders.

Of course, it also prevents the army from fighting basically any combat style used since the middle of the 19th Century and is part of why Russian forces (and before them Soviet forces) would rack up such high casualties - the death of additional extra peasants was seen as a small price to pay for having an army that could not pull off another revolution like 1917.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoyNGHkjeyM

I've been super impressed by this guy - he's not just one of those YouTube commentators, he's putting in primary research and analysis. He even beat the New York Times to the punch recently in verifying and geolocating the location in Russia where prisoners were being recruited. In addition to these types of 'event analysis' videos, he has a lot of educational videos that explains military stuff in a way that civilians can more easily digest, which can help understand why many decisions are made the way they are, and helps counter propaganda that preys on misunderstanding. 

So if anyone is looking for good, informative content I highly recommend this guy. He's not just one of those talking head types who do daily war recaps and stuff, he's a primary source for good information.

Another YouTuber I've discovered lately that's putting out great content is Joe Blogs:

https://www.youtube.com/c/JoeBlogs

This guy focuses on financial analysis, which sounds boring, but he does a great job of breaking down what the impact of the war, sanctions, etc is having on Russia and making it understandable (it's a complex topic, so his ability to convey the information is very helpful). Here's a great recent video of his that expresses that based on what's happened already, Russia's economy could take 8 years to recover, and that's if things don't get worse:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhwGw_n5lQ

Anyone else have some recommendations for good YouTubers that aren't just recap talking heads that replay other people's stuff with commentary, but provide good original content?

Edit: I changed 'the Russians were lying' to 'The Russians are lying'. because it's a current event.

Second edit: I want to clarify that Ryan McBeth isn't the guy to follow if you just want war updates, there are plenty of people who do that. His content consists of dives into specific stuff relating to the war and military stuff in order to help people understand the specifics about how this stuff works. For example, he did a long form deep dive video a while back about jet maintenance, and how it takes something like 19 man hours in maintenance for every hour of jet flying, which is why the question of why we don't just send Warthogs or whatever to Ukraine is more complicated than it may seem to people not familiar with how all this stuff works.

He just lies all the time and you should know that. So

1. There's no such thing as partial mobilization. And there never was. You can check up Russian legislation. It never used such a term for 30 years of modern Russia existence

2. A mobilization is a mobilization regardless of what Putin says, especially, when you consider Putin always lie until the contrary is proven

3. To understand that it's nowhere near a partial mobilization you should check up on who and how Russian Federation takes on the frontline right now. It's young men regardless of military experience, it's people from protests, it's basically everybody they can reach

4. A mobilization everywhere foresees waves or turns. What Putin labeled as partial in fact is just the first wave of mobilization. There are zero evidence they wouldn't be next waves.

If we are using cold-war Era realpolitik to analyze this situation, we should conclude that Russia will not use nuclear weapons and we should not base policy on the assumption that they will.

Part of the MAD doctrine was that Russia needs to believe we are as ruthless as they are in order to maintain either an edge over Russia or at least equal footing. 

That's why Nixon utilized the [madman theory ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) to achieve goals such as ending the Vietnam War when the US was taking a beating...

> I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Sounds familiar right? 

> I call it the Madman Theory, Ivan. I want the Ukrainians and the  West to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Putin is obsessed about border security. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Zelenskyy himself will be in Prague in two days begging for peace.

In my opinion, you can judge what most international actors are willing to due by assuming they are pragmatic actors with no morals or ego, only the goal of advancing their position.

There are no outcomes to using a nuclear weapon that advance Russia's position. If they use a big nuke and start a nuclear war with the West.... we all die and Russia gains nothing. If Russia uses a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine they will lose their only benefactors - India and China - who both see that as a huge red line. Again,  Russia would end up in a worse position.

Yeah, that would earn a NATO response and a nuclear Holocaust.

But a low yield, or tactical nuke used in a battlefield context is something that exists in a grey area of NATO responses.

Say they got eyes on the next cluster of equipment for a counteroffensives and shot an artillery round with a small warhead at it, wiped a couple of brigades.

Do you meet it with a full NATO response? You sure can, but I'd have to think I'm this situation you wouldn't want to approach it in a way that incentivizes escalation or another strike. You'd simply want to stop another use.

Now what that looks like could be complex. Russia using it as a way to negotiate with NATO could be a decent reason. Maybe they want to stop Western equipment from being provided to Ukraine. Maybe they'd just like to sign a peace treaty and see if they can force Ukraine into losing it's occupied lands before their counteroffensives claim everything back.

The things that make democracies appear weak to authoritarian thinkers is actually their strength.

A free media means the Russia can project Russian propaganda into democratic countries. But because of having a free media, the population in a democratic country is smarter and more discerning.

Individualism means there is endless time spent addressing seemingly small issues and from the outside it looks like the country is dominated individual selfishness. In reality, addressing the small issues is what ties a country together.

Elections can be manipulated, but there is nothing that demonstrates the legitimacy of a government more than transparent, regular and well regulated elections. Authoritarian governments will always struggle for legitimacy, and so need to expend most of their energy projecting power internally, they have to make sure every part of the population, the government and the military is subservient to them. Democracy cuts out that need, and so can apply its energy elsewhere.

This is faster than what most experts expect for a reason. To have effective soldiers, you usually need somewhere between 4-6 months of training at least. That's why Ukraine's troops mobilized in February and March started hitting the battlefield in July and August with new batches coming all the time, usually ones that received additional training on new toys. 

You can send out soldiers mobilized a few days to weeks before, but they are basically just bodies for the enemy to mow down. Mind you, sending lots of people to overwhelm an enemy can work, but it is very costly and usually only works when the enemy has strained logistics. It also relies on having 5-10X more people than the enemy. So Russia is trying to go with its favorite tactic of Zerg rushing with lots of people even if they don't actually know how to operate weapons, etc. It's going to turn into a bloodbath. Worse, Ukraine claims to have almost a million troops at its disposal. Even if Russia brings in all of its conscripts and the newly mobilized, the numbers are 1 Ukrainian soldier for 1-2 Russian soldiers.

Tactical nuclear bombardment is definitely on the table here. It's a serious enough threat at least for NATO to have contingency plans to ""deal"" with it.

For the sake of Ukrainian operators and any Russian intelligence analysts that might be reading, I won't go into too much detail on Western tactics, but here's my understanding from the point of view of a lowly footsoldier;

1. Tactical nuclear bombardment would be used in preparation of a larger offensive into Europe. Employment of such weapons would outrage the world, leading to a near certain escelation to global conflict, and Putin knows this; so he's either bluffing, or he's crazy enough to try to stand toe to toe with NATO by keeping the fate of the world hostage, probably with the hopes of forcing a Ukrainian surrender.

2. Tactical nuclear bombardment, in being used for the purposes of battlespace preparation, would strike Ukranian targets in terms of how important they are to the war effort and how viable it is to hit. We can draw a few conclusions from this, but really it depends on just -how- many weapons Russia plans on deploying. Our most likely scenario (if they did it) would be a small, limited strike, demonstrating to the Ukranians why they should imminently surrender.

So what would they target?

   a. Priority number one would be military targets on the North Eastern front. They'd probably conduct a limited strike on Ukrainian formations approaching the Russian border, preferably at a riverine crossing.

b. Secondary targets would probably include military bases and known Ukrainian forward operating bases.

What wouldn't they target?

   a. To limit public outrage from both Russians and abroad, they'd likely entirely avoid metropolitan centers/civilian targets if possible.

   b. Targets in Western Ukraine would likely be spared due to the risk of collateral damage with NATO allies.

How would they do it?

    a. They would most likely deploy a tactical nuclear weapon via aircraft; a missile would be detected before the strike, and the Russians would probably want to have visual confirmation of the target they intend to strike. Not to mention, launching a missile requires the approval of an entire command staff; dropping a bomb only requires two loyal pilots.

Why wait?

   a. Weather conditions have been blowing Eastward for a little bit now, and the Russians don't want fallout falling on their cities.

   b. Ukrainian airspace is deadly, and sending an aircraft into Ukraine with a nuclear payload would be a gamble to say the least.

   c. They might need to finish mobilization in order to be ready to capitalize on the insuing confusion and panic as effectively as they can

   d. Putin's reign could be threatened by an uprising by Russian civilians, especially with a worsening will to fight, low morale, and anti war sentiment higher than ever

   e. Putin is full of shit and trying to buy himself more time with strongarm politics to allow his newest wave of referendums to ""pass"" in occupied Ukrainian territories, so he's in a better seat at the negotiating table. (And less likely to actually be held accountable for war crimes).

Imagine.

The land borders of your suburban house/plot of land are wrong, your parents have always told you this. Your neighbors used to be friends, but they put up a fence and are living on land that's rightfully yours - you know this in your bones. Your parents have always told you stories of what those neighbors do, ""they're Nazi's"" ""they're horrible to their kids"", everyone you talk to at your house, and all your friends knows these things.

You send some young men into the neighbors property, the neighbors fight back, but it's not their property, and you're just taking back what's rightfully yours, so they're the bad guys because they're killing your young men.

In that frame of mind, Russia's actions make 'sense'.

In November 1975, disillusioned by corruption and stagnation in Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union, he led a mutiny on the Soviet anti-submarine frigate, Storozhevoy (Russian: Сторожевой, Storoževoj, meaning ""Sentry"") in the hope of starting a Leninist political revolution in the Soviet Union. His mutiny failed and he was executed for treason nine months later.

It's slightly more complex than ""Russian soldiers are being given Mosins"".

Almost all of the Mosins have been in DNR/LNR militia hands rather than Russian regulars. The few Russian regulars with them appear to be battlefield acquisitions as they all have a secondary rifle with them, usually a 5.45 AK.

*Most* of the Mosins we have seen have been the sniper variant, with a PU scope. Now, it's not as simple as just slapping a scope on a regular infantry rifle, in order to clear the scope mount and lens, the bolt handle on a Mosin PU is a different shape to a standard rifle. In fact, the whole rifle is specifically selected at the factory from the highest grade components passing a substantially more stringent QC process than a regular line infantry rifle.

So these aren't ordinary Mosins.

Are they obsolete? In the sniper role, no. Plenty of militaries around the world still use a bolt-action 7.62 rifle in the sniper role. Many also have a semi-automatic option but many ""proper"" snipers prefer to shoot bolt action, because the manual bolt cycling improves sighting after firing for confirming a hit and kill.

Could Russia give DNR/LNR snipers a newer rifle? Yes, they could issue something like the SVD, but the downside is that it's a substantially harder rifle to maintain in the field without an armourer to fall back on, it's harder to learn, it's harder to field strip. If you have a militia force where the snipers are simply local hunters with a good eye and aim who are fast tracked into sniping based upon prior experience, the Mosin is a much better ""military spec"" platform to transition them onto.

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,xl6y9x,ipimhm9,"So many images coming from Russia and Ukraine that I thought I would never see in my lifetime. A young Russian soldier, a child nearly still, tired, famished and bewildered - being offered a cup of hot tea by Ukrainian civilians and afforded the opportunity to call his mother. Ukrainian men with thousand yard stares voluntarily going back home to enlist, not knowing what their fate will be. Mothers crying for their children as they are press ganged into military service. Civilians murdered wantonly, their corpses scattered around the streets. Mass graves filled with victims of war, torture and sadistic mutilations. Cities broken into rubble, citizens drinking out of puddles and eating rats - lining up for water rations from their oppressors. 

And while this war has certainly also inspired greatness, unity and bravery, I don't think those are the things I will remember most. It will be the pain, the suffering and the destruction. Not just in Ukraine, but also as we see now in Russia - as fathers, sons and husbands are ripped away from their families to likely die in a needless war of petty ambition. It is truly a tragedy of our times, and I wish I didn't have to see it, or remember it - though I suppose I should count myself lucky: as I don't have to live it like so many others do.

Often since the start of the conflict, I've been reminded of this stanza from Yeats, written shortly after the first world war. Then known as ""The Great War"", since there had of course, only been one of it's kind:

> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   

> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

> The best lack all conviction, while the worst   

> Are full of passionate intensity.

How can you not look at images as the ones we see, and not think these words are true now. A full century later, and we are there again. Though thankfully, not quite. It's not a great war of many nations gladly marching their soldiers into combat - it is one agressor and many who wish for peace. One that fights gladly and by choice, and everyone else that fights reluctantly, because they have to. I suppose that's progress - though tell that to the grieving mothers of Russia and Ukraine, and see what they think about that.",False,1663878907.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipiiu8l,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Russia's use of a nuclear weapon isn't rational, nor is it likely. Not yet. But with each successful defeat on the battlefield, it becomes more so. Personally, I believe Putin would order the use of NBC weapons rather than admit defeat; the only question, for me, if is his regime will survive long enough to do so.

So yes there are guns out in the countryside; probably fewer in the cites. But people from the cities go to the country to hunt, so presumably yes for there too. 

That was in the late Soviet union.

Another detail worth noting is that way Russian money was being funneled to the National Rifle Association in the US a few years ago. I feel confident the money way coming from the Russian government, but the existence of gun clubs in Russia provided the cover. 

I'd say say those facts suggest there are a fair number of guns in Russia. That said it also seems an actual armed uprising against the authoriatarian/totalitarian regime is quite unlikely.

For example, Europe may be willing to accept some Russian energy exports again, but they are going to work hard to become completely independent of Russian energy so they cannot be held hostage again.

The west will make sure Ukraine is armed to the teeth to discourage any future attempts by Putin or his successors.  They will be willing to do this because there is now little chance that Ukraine will willingly get under the thumb of another Russian bootlicker, and so those weapons will not fall under Russian control.

Russian geopolitical influence will be very, very badly damaged.  They will try to bolster it with cheap energy exports but in the end they are just being used and will have trouble gathering real allies since no one wants to partner with a country that is way more belligerent than they can back up militarily.

Russia is probably going to have to suffer a lot more losses before they give up.

What the referendums are, is Russia administering (fraudulent) elections in the parts of Ukraine that they've occupied.  Once the referendums have passed, they will declare that four new countries have been created: the Donetsk People's Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic, and whatever made up names they're calling Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  

However, the rest of the world is *extremely* unlikely to recognize these new countries as legitimate.  Ukraine and the entirety of NATO certainly will not.  A handful of close Russian allies will immediately recognize them.  China and India are likely to make non-committal both-sides statements about wanting fighting to come to an end.  

So to directly answer your question: no, this has a 0% chance of ending the fighting.  The fighting will end when either Ukraine or Russia decides to stop fighting.  Period.  This is probably not going to happen unless the West tires of sending Ukraine aid, or there is a coup in the Russian government.  Even if Ukraine fully retakes all their conquered territories, the most likely ""end"" to this war is a militarized border between Russia and Ukraine until Vladimir Putin leaves office or dies.  

To provide an analogy.  These referendums are the equivalent of you breaking into your neighbor's house and using crayon to write out a deed to their home in your name.  You might recognize it, your crazy uncle might recognize it, but it would not be recognized by any of the people that would meaningfully need to recognize it: the police, your neighbor, etc.  You can declare anything you want, but without broad enough recognition the rest of society will simply drag you out of the house and arrest you.",False,1663869662.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_iphuwtu,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

By committing civilians to the meat grinder, Putin is signaling to the West that there will be no capitulation. As long as you’re only engaging career soldiers and mercenaries, you can always withdraw, claim some sort of half-victory, and go for a truce. But the moment you send civilians to die in that war, you can’t just back down and call it a day. The stakes are suddenly much higher.

The mobilization of civilians may not be that effective militarily (they are under-trained, under-equipped, and under-motivated). But it’s an effective diplomatic way of removing one outcome (capitulation) from the chessboard, and potentially forcing NATO to make more compromises out of concern for a total war.

In parallel, once the referenda are over and the occupied territories officially become Russian land, Putin has a legal channel for using nukes (which are only allowed under two conditions, a nuclear attack against Russia or *a conventional but existential threat to Russian sovereignty*).

By doing both of these things in parallel, Putin is initiating a game of chicken to test the true resolve of Western countries in supporting Ukraine in the face of a potential runaway escalation.",False,1663902120.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipjvxmi,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

Cremation is a waste of energy. Burying embalmed bodies in laminated wooden boxes so they won't decompose is absurd, a waste of energy and resources and it poisons the environment. Breaking down bodies biologically is natural and doesn't add additional impact (unlike making an elaborate coffin just to burn it with gas). Composting corpses is simply rational. Cremation and burial are unsustainable with a population approaching 8 billion. I wouldn't suggest using the composted remains to grow food for people as this can carry the chance of disease spread.

The problems of increased production came up in April with regard to Javelin missiles.  Lockheed announced that they could possibly ramp to 4000 Javelins per year but more was impossible.  They had problems with the supply of electronic components.  

I would take that to imply that they could increase Javelin production they were just limited by things like propellant or tubes or things like hiring temporary employees and going three shifts. 

The 9000 number for M31 was announced in 2021.  Two factors are different for M31 relative to Javelin.  The electronics are probably simpler since they do not lock on to anything.  That suggests rapid ramping.  On the other hand M31 missile production was already ramped up.  They were expecting to restock the Army inventory and then scale back.  The 2021 numbers might be the full maximum capacity for the facility in Arkansas.  I have no idea and it could go either way.  

It is a thing I am curious to find out.  Until then 9000 is the yearly production rate.  50,000 is the total built in 2021.  A large number were fired. 

USA has sent Ukraine about 1/3rd of its Javelin inventory.  I have no idea what that means for M31s.  Almost certainly there will be less than ""everything gets shipped to Ukraine"".  The idea ""you don't need that many guns right now"" does not go well in USA.  The reason we have so many arms is because people feel driven to be in possession of them.  

A few thousand precision strikes can be very disruptive.  The topic of sending more launchers keeps coming up on Reddit.  Even if Lockheed-Martin could ramp up to 90,000 M31 missiles per year and sends them all Ukraine already has enough HIMARS and MLRS on hand to fire all of those missiles.",False,1663895193.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipjfw6b,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

That's not what needs to be true.

What must be true, is that Russian commanders / politicians must **believe** that a tactical nuke has the same costs as a strategic nuke.

They already miscalculated upon the Western response to the war in Ukraine. I can see them making that miscalculation again.

-----------

Once the tactical nuke is used, then the world enters the debate over tactical vs strategic, and escalation paths moving forward. I'm convinced that the tactical nuke will warrant a smaller response than a strategic nuke: everyone knows that Russia has bigger nukes and a path for further escalation **must** be kept.

What the overall plan / diplomacy / decision will be at that point, I don't know.

And how could the West stop them, if it is shown that having nukes does basically let you do whatever you want. North Korea's already shouting about pre-emptive use now. 

If you validate nuclear threats as a political tool, you'll have a lot more crazies with nukes. Then nuclear war becomes an inevitability.

The German Defense Minister just today:

That's a political consideration.

Additionally, per Politico:
> This debate over tanks is the latest skirmish in the back-and-forth over weapons between the West and Ukraine. At each step, the U.S. hesitated for months before providing a certain weapon – first the Stinger anti-air missiles, then later the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System – concerned they would be a “red line” that would risk provoking Russia into a new escalation, only to change their mind and transfer the weapons as the war evolved and battlefield needs changed.

If USA sticks with conventional forces, the best Russia can do is use tactical nukes in response. USA won't want to respond with strategic nukes, because the Russian counter-escalation to strategic nukes would lead to unacceptable losses.

If Russia escalates to strategic-level nukes, then USA wipes Russia off the face of the Earth. So Russia also wouldn't want to escalate.

There's a huge difference from lobbing 100,000 ton nuclear weapons, and lobbing 20,000,000 ton nuclear weapons. Everyone sees the difference. USA's response to a 100,000 ton nuclear weapon will be different than a 20,000,000 ton nuclear weapon.

--------

MAD isn't quite as MAD as you might think. That's actually the scarier part, because the public's knowledge of nuclear weapons is so dogshit.

The only valid response we have as the USA is to threaten to properly join this fight if Russia escalates to tactical nukes (ie: 100,000 ton nukes).

They are exposed to a lot of anti-West and anti-Ukraine propaganda in schools and some are even encouraged to snitch on adults for being against the war…books like the Foundations of Geopolitics are on the curriculum.

Could Russia go to producing a bunch of heavy armour? Maybe…we don’t know the answer. Sanctions might inhibit what technology they can put in it. If they have engine factories, steel factories and turn lada production to tank production it could work. 

Interestingly, here is Axis and Allied tank production in WWII, you can see how long it took to produce meaningful numbers.

Biden has said multiple times, if Putin uses anything nuclear the US will respond in kind.

The US knows, at all times, where every single nuclear sub Russia has is located. They are so loud that they don't even have to bother too much to locate them. They are poorly maintained, and their engines haven't been upgraded in a long time.

If you think the US/NATO don't know every single Russian launch site, you are delusional. Those would blow up so fast Putin won't even have time to ask what time it is.

Russia is a country that barely has any satellites in functioning order, with recent reports stating they still depend on satellites that take pictures on film then they send the film back on ground.

The US and NATO have invested a lot in technologies to intercept missiles. And Russia has old missiles.

Don't fall for the ""hyper-sonic"" propaganda, Russia doesn't have hyper-sonic anything, just some upgraded old rockets that have been stripped down to go faster. Those can't deliver a nuclear warhead, definitely not in an intercontinental context.

And, once the seal is broken, if he is stupid enough to use a nuclear device, the other nuclear powers will burn Russia to the ground.

China doesn't want a nuclear war, China wants money, China likes money, China is already tired of Putin's tantrum. China made it clear.

India doesn't want to give anyone the idea nuclear weapons are anything other than a deterrent. They are not meant to be offensive. India has a lot of headaches being surrounded by China and Pakistan. It doesn't need those two countries getting idea that nuclear devices can be used.

Israel most likely won't react, their only issue is Iran, and if Israel is ever going to use a nuclear device it is going to be against Iran.

There is no scenario where Putin is using nuclear weapons, zero chance of him thinking he can get away with it. It's an empty threat, and it's mostly aimed at his own people, to project a sense of power.

As you can see, the reaction from the rest of the world was not in Russia's favor, and the allied nations that are helping Ukraine are now deciding to send even better weapons to Ukraine. The modern world doesn't respond to these threats the way Putin expects it to answer.

Sure, in dark rooms at Pentagon and other security institutions around the world this matter is taken seriously, and the plan how to respond is already in the works, if not already decided.

Additionally, the convention establishes a framework to support victim assistance, clearance of contaminated sites, risk reduction education, and stockpile destruction. The convention was adopted on 30 May 2008 in Dublin, and was opened for signature on 3 December 2008 in Oslo. It entered into force on 1 August 2010, six months after it was ratified by 30 states.

An embarrassing little call intercept the Russians leaked back then and that the State Department more or less admitted happened. Made it sound like the US ambassador at the time was playing kingmaker for the Ukrainian opposition. And maybe that was the case, who knows. Politics can be messy like that.

Let me put it like this -- do I think Euromaiden was an astroturfed CIA psychological op like the Russians claim? Absolutely not. No way in hell it would have worked without genuine popular support from the Ukrainians. But would I be shocked if it turned out the US provided - say - covert funding to the opposition and the protesters at some point, possibly through some nonprofit or another? Also no. But it doesn't matter, because as far as I can tell, Euromaiden is what the majority of Ukrainians genuinely wanted. And besides -- any untoward tricks the US/West might have pulled back then likely would've just balanced out everything the Kremlin was no doubt doing for the loyalist faction. So it was all most likely a wash.

And you are speculating that Ukraine has a desperate need for tanks, they have received hundreds of T-72's from those that operate them. Not only the 200 plus modernized versions from Poland but even though numbers haven't been made clear they have also received many from other countries as well, who knows just how many they have gotten.

> If that's not an infantilizing take, I really don't know what would count.

When various nations have given them literally hundreds of heavy weapons, everything from M777 howitzers, hundreds of M113 armored personal carriers, hundreds of various other armored vehicles, dozens if not hundreds of self propelled howitzers including top of the line PZH 2000's, HIMARS and M270 rocket launching systems how is Ukraine being ""infantilized"" by being told they couldn't handle using new tanks? Seems like they are being rated as highly capable of using and maintaining new weapon systems.

The most likely answer for tanks is the hundreds of T-72's they have been given mostly fulfill their current need for tanks and there is no point in giving them yet another new weapon system they have to get up to speed on when they already have so many others to deal with as it is. They desperately needed artillery, they have received hundreds of towed and self propelled pieces. They desperately needed armored personal carriers, they have received hundreds of them, maybe even thousands by now as the numbers aren't always announced. They desperately needed counter battery radars and the US has given them dozens as well as spent months in secret training Ukrainian's to use them before they announced it. The same for MIG 29 parts, although they deny sending entire airframes all indications are other MIG 29 operators have been sending just about everything they have to Ukraine and I bet that includes airframes.

And of course Ukrainian politicians are always going to try to pull every diplomatic lever to try and get more equipment for their army when they're fighting a war for their survival, that's part of their job, but that does not mean there is a desperate need for new tanks right this second. 

So is it that NATO is playing the overbearing parent reluctant to get their kid a puppy for fear they won't take care of it or is it maybe that right now they already have enough tanks because of the *hundreds of T-72's they've been given in the last few months?* I'm going to go with if they desperately needed tanks they would get them, just like almost every other weapon system they really needed, but that they probably don't need them as much as you think they do.",False,1663904133.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipj985s,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

There SO many people have Ukrainian heritage. You'll go to like a folk dancing show in Manitoba and it's literally just hopak lol You'll recognize so many family names. Here it's very separate from the rest of Canada - different people, history. A lot of the things we share in common are actually just American influences on us both lol

So, French. Quebec is, these days, very francophone and protective of that. The neighbouring province of New Brunswick is bilingual (mostly an urban south that's English, and a rural north that's French. It's kind of like Canada's Belgium, with a lot of people thinking the English should join Nova Scotia, and the French, Quebec. But it functions on its own and doesn't listen to any of that). The other 8 provinces are English-speaking, officially (obviously, very diverse country, hundreds of languages everywhere).

All of Canada's 10 large provinces have some francophone history and current residents. And it varies widely.

So, my province for example, Newfoundland and Labrador. In the past, half the island was controlled by France, their capital was in Plaisance (modern-day Placentia). I think it was the end of the 100 Years War it all went to England. My city was destroyed by the French as recently as the 1600s.  Our French mostly came from Brittany, and central France regions. Their French has always been very different from what is spoken in Quebec. We also have two islands off our coast, St. Pierre et Miquelon, that are still part of France to this day ([http://www.spm-tourisme.fr/1/](http://www.spm-tourisme.fr/1/) ). You could throw a rock and practically hit them, but it's an international border haha. They are VERY Basque in heritage, but francophone. Gorgeous, friendly place.

So, in daily life, you might encounter it all the time. So I think the equivalent in Ukraine would be national (Canada: federal) and oblast (Canada: provincial) government. Every province/oblast has national/federal institutions and jobs. A lot of them you are required to be fluent in English and French. So every province has at least a few hundred people in such jobs. And then you have historic French areas, and modern French ones. Again, my province as an example, we have a francophone community, there are 5 French-language schools here, almost everyone is an immigrant from St. Pierre, so they speak/study Parisien French, not Quebec French, etc. Obviously, in Quebec, that's not the case. It's a very large federation, Canada, and each piece of it has a different relationship with the French language.",1663888406.0,1663888175.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipj4te1,,8,5,0,5,0,0,

Obviously Ukrainians are fully committed to the path started in 2014 today, you're crying over what now? That Ukrainians were able to break free of Russian control?

And I agree that Ukraine had the right to get out, and it's good that they got out. HOWEVER it's a shame it happened that way. West should have reacted when Crimea got taken. I've been saying this for 8 years.

BTW I strongly agreed with president Lech Kaczynski from Poland (who died in the plane crash) that first it was Georgia, then it will be Ukraine, then it will be Baltic countries, and then it will be Poland.",False,1663878481.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipikuth,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I also believe that China is planning on deploying Tactical nuclear weapons vs US Supercarriers. Maybe not as Plan A or even Plan B, but they're planning it just in case. Its certainly on the table. If Chinese hypersonic missiles fail (either because their homing mechanism fails, or because USA's missile-interception tech AEGIS Cruisers protect the carrier adequately), then China has no other choice but to go (tactically) nuclear to continue the conflict.

I don't think USA would nuke Beijing over the loss of a US Supercarrier. And because US won't escalate into strategic nukes, Beijing would never nuke Washington DC.

I can see a war without MAD occurring, even as tactical nukes are deployed. Taiwan is important to US / China, but not worth losing Beijing or Washington DC over.",False,1663874649.0,t3_xl6y9x,t1_ipi6lys,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
