Senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, the New York Times reported, quoting Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report.

The New York Times said the intelligence report indicated senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s plans or intentions to invade Ukraine before Moscow launched the operation last week.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that China had made the request but declined to provide details. The source declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

“The claims mentioned in the relevant reports are speculations without any basis, and are intended to blame-shift and smear China,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington.

They are seeking, through email campaigns and online petitions, to persuade firms such as internet security company Cloudflare Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc to do more to counter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Companies should try to isolate Russia as much as possible, as soon as possible,” said Olexiy Oryeshko, a staff software engineer at Google and a Ukrainian American. “Sanctions are not enough.”

He was one of nine tech activists interviewed by Reuters who are of Ukrainian heritage or are Ukrainian immigrants and are responding to a call by Kyiv to form a volunteer “IT army”.

Many companies have severed Russian ties due to new government trade curbs, but the activists are demanding more.

They are appealing to cybersecurity companies in particular, asking them to drop Russian clients, especially publishers of what they say is disinformation. If that happens, the publishers would be more vulnerable to online attacks.

Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station. Air raid sirens have been heard wailing.

In an update posted to his Facebook page late last night, city mayor Vitali Klitschko thanked his citizens for their endurance and reminded people to stay at home or in shelters.

“In the city, in some areas in the yards, several shells got in,” Klitschko said, adding some people were injured in the blasts as cars caught fire.

“Fighting took place next to Kyiv - Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel. The enemy is trying to break into the capital,” he added.

Russian forces resumed offensive operations against Kyiv’s western outskirts on March 2 after pausing for resupply from February 27 to March 1 but failed to secure any additional territory. 

Russian forces launched offensive operations in Zhytomyr Oblast, expanding their envelopment of Kyiv further west than ISW previously assessed—likely to outflank stronger-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance and limited Ukrainian counterattacks in Kyiv’s outskirts.

Russian forces renewed advances toward northeastern Kyiv on March 2, reaching a line approximately 65km from the city center on that axis.

Russian forces assaulted central Kharkiv and continued to heavily bombard the city on March 2, likely increasing civilian casualties.

Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender.

Russian forces continued to reduce pockets of Ukrainian resistance in Kherson on March 2 and will likely secure the city in the next 24 hours if they have not done so already.

The Russian Ministry of Defense released implausibly low Russian fatality counts for the first time on March 2, preparing the Russian population for the arrival of injured and killed service members back to Russia.

The Kremlin made inconsistent statements regarding negotiations with Ukraine but agreed to a second round of talks scheduled for March 3.

The Kremlin continued trying to control the domestic and international narrative around the invasion by restricting Russian citizens’ freedom of speech and access to information while framing Ukraine and the West as aggressors.

The Kremlin continued to struggle with Western sanctions while it set conditions for longer-term domestic capabilities.

Ukrainian defense officials claimed Ukrainian forces thwarted an assassination attempt targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after a tip from anti-war Russian intelligence officers on March 1.

Western states announced additional sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus while more private companies suspended operations in Russia.

NATO and EU countries continued delivering lethal military aid to Ukraine on March 2.

International organizations and Western leaders are increasingly concerned about Russia’s indiscriminate targeting of civilians and use of banned weapons as civilian casualties rise.

The UN General Assembly voted on March 2 overwhelmingly in favor of a motion demanding Russia stop military operations in Ukraine; China and India abstained.

Record-setting refugee flows began to strain the support structures in states neighboring Ukraine on March 2.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Ukrainian officials urged caution as Russian forces advanced toward another Ukrainian nuclear power plant on March 1 and 2.

Global oil and gas prices continued to skyrocket despite Western efforts to avoid sanctioning Russia’s energy sector.

I'm often asked about economic sanctions.


In short. my scientific conclusion, as a Finance Professor and PhD from Chicago University - the
Russian economy is fucked.


And what makes it double fucked is that Russian citizens, even the educated ones, for the most
part don't realize what awaits them.


Let me count this on my fingers.


Very soon, Russians will be faced with shortfalls of basic products. I'm not taking about iPhones,
the import of which was already banned, but about food, clothing, cars, white goods, etc.


Russia is very heavily integrated into the world economy. Already, major operators are refusing to
send containers to Russia.


However, even if you managed to find someone who, for a massive amount of money, would be
willing to ship containers to Russia, the question becomes how are you going to pay them?


Export profits are going to be decimated because buyers will be trying to divest away from
Russian products.


We can see that even oil companies that aren't currently under sanctions are struggling to sell
their oil. Gazprom, Russia's major gas exporter, is already under sanctions, so it's not entirely clear
how it's even going to receive foreign currency payments.


The Russian central bank has accrued massive reserves, $650 billion USD. Except more than half
of this has already been seized, and it's not entirely clear what it can actually do with the gold. It's
going to be hard to find a bank on earth willing to buy from the Russian central bank, so as not
to find itself sanctioned or facing massive fines.


Many think that Russia, over the last few years, has built a huge number of factories. Only thing
is, those factories - cars, aerospace, household goods etc. rely on imported components. 

So therefore in coming months what awaits us is the halting of entire production chains, with all of
their feeder and dependent businesses. We're talking about product shortages, unemployment,
the resultant government revenue shortfall with its implied struggle to pay civil service and
government employee salaries.


Planes, even inside Russia, will also soon stop flying. They're almost all imported, and the West
has already banned the supply of spare parts, so we're likely to soon see a mass removal from
service of aircraft.


The internet, as we know it, will also be blocked. They've already blocked a lot of informational
websites, and any day now they plan to block Wikipedia. They have already slowed down Twitter,
Facebook, and they plan to disconnect YouTube.


On to agriculture. Are you aware that in Russia, the share of imported seeds is around 40%? In
potatoes it's 90%. I mean, of course eventually farmers and agricultural institutes will come up
with something, but at least in the short term we should expect a shortfall in basic commodity
production and resultant price hikes.


And even that's not all.


Everyone who can leave the country, is going to start leaving. In fact, they're already leaving. The
government understands this, and so it's brought in today a range of measures so as to keep IT
workers in the country. Except the won't work. Therefore soon, it's very likely the government
will bring in exit visas for certain categories of citizens, or just completely close the country.


The only plus side of this entire thing is that those, who nostalgically yearn for the USSR will get
to experience all of its glories for themselves. And it won't be the comparatively herbivore USSR
of the Khrushchev/Brezhnev/Gorbachev era, but a USSR at the head of which stands an insane

While the Russian army definitely has the combat power to achieve these scenarios, does Russia have the logistics force structure to support these operations? The short answer is not in the timelines envisioned by Western wargames. In an initial offensive — depending on the fighting involved — Russian forces might reach early objectives, but logistics would impose requirements for operational pauses.

It’s important to keep in mind that with any occupying force, every second of the occupation is an act of hostility, and those occupiers make themselves willing targets in ongoing war as long as they are there in that manner.

As the conditions in Russia get worse for their under-informed citizens they will galvanize against the West….I sincerely hope there’s enough people there who can see truth and implement change.

c5e9cc51fb793ade1157f9a7c00adaf2,t5fa76,hz4hisc,"Continuing my cosplay as a geopolitics, foreign policy, and psychology expert since someone asked me to explore possible outcomes from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t4e9ng/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/hyxv1h6/). I won't entertain nuclear war because if that happens we're all dead and nothing matters anyway.
&#10;  


Consider the following assumptions:
&#10;  

- Quality of Russia's forces is low, but even with mass desertions there's enough of them to cause trouble.
&#10;  

- Russia has air superiority but not supremacy.
&#10;  

- Ukraine's military is well trained and supplied in comparison but they're still heavily outnumbered.
&#10;  

- NATO will not get ""boots on the ground"" involved.
&#10;  


Next steps/survival for Putin:
&#10;  

- Unlike with the Nazis, Russia does not have more men than they have bullets. He must cut off all NATO supply lines and smuggling. This will be hard because he must reach the Western border, and their logistics is shit.
&#10;  

- He must brute force his way to major cities. Soften up defenders by bombing non-combatants, prevent food from reaching civilians, and hold them hostage. Use that as leverage in negotiations. 
&#10;  

- In Russia he must go hard on all dissenters and clamp down on all outside information. This is his only chance to die in his mansion as Tsar of the Hill rather than suicide in the back of the head.
&#10;  

- 50/50 whether he goes for inner circle purges. 100% chance at least one wants him dead, but none dare currently. A purge may scare them into submission or drive them to act before he kills them first.
&#10;  

- While we'd love to see Russians overthrow him and install democracy, sadly it's more likely someone in his inner circle takes advantage of the unrest and axes him. Russia spins the shit ruler roulette again. I wish they could break the cycle but history gives me little hope. Cities are more willing to protest but large swaths of rural areas are more conservative + have less exposure to outside news.
&#10;  


On Lukashenko:
&#10;  

- His survival is tied to Putin's. Even so, it's possible that Putin will be too busy quelling civil unrest, staving off economic meltdown, and retaining his own power to waste energy propping up Lukashenko. 
&#10;  

- Consequently, his only hope is same as Putin: double down on brutality to scare people into submission as Belarus, encouraged by Ukraine, starts protests anew.
&#10;  

- Deciding factor is likely to be the army and whether or not they want to end up flattened like those Russian conscripts. With Putin's shadow of power flickering they might have a chance. If he loses control of military, it's over. 
&#10;  


If Ukraine wins:
&#10;  

- Zelensky is a hero. Tourism skyrockets. Ukraine gets EU/NATO membership. Russia will protest diplomatically and continue to spy/troll farm/send assassins, but unable to do anything else.
&#10;  

- EU takes their military spending more seriously. While still friendly to US, member states head towards military independence.
&#10;  

- In Russia, either Putin was already overthrown and his successor withdrew, or he's trying to spin this as ""we totally won and now Russian forces are peacefully returning home"" all the while furiously stamping out any dissent. Regardless, his days are numbered.
&#10;  

- Russia is economically boned, period. As long as Putin stays in power, international sanctions will not lift. Even basic necessities will be gone. All their factories run on imported parts and 40% of their seeds are imported. Boeing/Airbus dominate aviation industry and with them no longer shipping spare parts, planes will be grounded. Either people starve and rebel or starve and die. Only time will tell if they can break the cycle of shitty corrupt rulers or if another strongman despot fills the power vacuum. 
&#10;  

- Scenario where someone overthrows Putin/voluntarily withdraws from Ukraine is less bad economically. Such a leader must do diplomacy to repair international relations and lift sanctions. But Nord Stream 2 is still cancelled, Europe has woken up to the fact that they don't want to be dependent on Russian gas anymore, and foreign investors will no longer trust their market, so still bad.
&#10;  


If Putin succeeds in takeover:
&#10;  

- If Zelensky dies he's a martyr. Else he continues to lead the resistance de Gaulle style. Either way I don't see Ukraine capitulating. Even if a Zelensky-less government surrenders, the country won't.
&#10;  

- NATO money/weapons continue to back Ukrainian partisans. Russia is bled dry. The US with all its wealth lasted barely 20 years against Afghan goatherders. I give Russia a few years, tops, even if they go full North Korea. North Korea works because their people, including their army, have been completely cut off from the outside world since the beginning. The NK army hasn't been boots on the ground in a foreign country, ever. It's harder to keep up the lies with soldiers in the field meeting Ukrainians personally.
&#10;  

- Ukrainian infrastructure is destroyed, but hopefully international support will help them rebuild after inevitable Russian withdrawal.
&#10;  

- Russia's economic situation will be the same or worse as if they had failed, but Putin has a better chance of surviving.
&#10;  

- Possibly Putin doesn't try to occupy long term, merely uses ""win"" as leverage to retain control over Crimea/Donbas + restore water to Crimea. Puppet government collapses as soon as he leaves, like Afghanistan. Resulting mess will be for his successor to deal with.


Regarding separatist regions:
&#10;  

- Hopeful but unsure if they return to Ukraine. If Zelensky pushes hard and Putin is dead, maybe. 
&#10;  

- Putin knows this so he's on full damage control mode. Maybe when he runs out of money and cuts losses. Next best thing is cause as much civilian damage as possible to get a strong spot at the negotiation table. Push for Crimea+canal, Donbas, Ukraine's continued neutrality/lack of NATO/EU membership. More realistic is settle for return to the post-2014 status quo. Anything which lets him go home and say ""look we won"".
&#10;  


More on Zelensky's survival:
&#10;  

- I have high hopes that he's one of those rare genuinely well intentioned politicians. He ran on a platform of reducing corruption, but he had difficulty getting anything done because of systemic issues + Putin causing trouble. But as a goddamn hero and with Ukrainian pride at an all time high he will have more power. So if he lives and Ukraine gets all that sweet sweet EU/NATO aid we might just see incredible things.
&#10;  

- If he dies his successor will have a hard time filling his shoes. Time will tell if Ukraine will properly rebuild (either by winning immediately, or by throwing out the invaders after a few years of occupation), or get stuck in corrupt politicians.
&#10;  


The rest of the world:
&#10;  

- EU/NATO expands membership + renew desire for unity + boost military spending. 
&#10;  

- Poland, Romania, and other countries accepting Ukrainian refugees will struggle more.
&#10;  

- Everyone will jump on the ""hate Russia"" bandwagon as long as it's prudent.
&#10;  

- China remains neutral and continue peacebroker angle. Push comes to shove and they'll side with the West, because $$$.
&#10;  


So who will win short term? 
&#10;  

- Given the state of those poor conscripts Putin's only hope is to amp up war crimes / civilian bombings, hope people's fear overrides anger, and make sure inner circle fears him more than Western reprisal.
&#10;  

- Ukraine wins if the people's spirits hold out longer than the treasury in Moscow or the anger of Putin's underlings.
&#10;  

- I personally think Ukraine will come out on top. Each civilian death makes people more angry than fearful. Even if Russian troops occupy multiple cities and cut off Western supply lines, Zelensky government will not surrender. You'd have to murder and torture more people than the Nazis to make them capitulate. As bad as things are, these occupiers don't have the same ""you are subhuman scum"" mindset.
&#10;  

- Give the sheer quality of US intelligence, there's multiple people in high positions who have traded amnesty/$ in return for ratting on Putin, so fear of Western reprisal for those people is gone. The longer this war goes on, the less fear of Putin himself will be. Eventually both fears will drop below the ""wah my money"" sentiment enough to embolden at least one of them.
&#10;  


After the war?
&#10;  

- Recap: Russia screwed, Ukraine will need lots of help, EU strengthened, NATO likely grows. Sadly, Ukrainian blood will benefit the EU most, rather than Ukraine itself, but I suppose if they join the EU things will be alright.
&#10;  

- Russia keeps throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Propaganda, assassinations, etc. Even if Putin dies it doesn't change Ukraine's position in Russia's overall political strategy so if NATO/EU welcome them into the fold it has to be ASAP while Russia is too destabilized to protest/follow up on their threats.
&#10;  

- If Zelensky survives the war he's not safe yet; he'll be dodging assassination attempts from Putin as long as he lives and then some. Of course we all want Zelensky to live long and well, and die of old age surrounded by family and friends. But if not, then at least long enough to set up a stable government and transition of power in Ukraine.",False,1646269751.0,t3_t5fa76,t3_t5fa76,,0,87,0,87,3,1,{'gid_2': 1}

The move is being seen as a break with Japan’s reluctance to accept refugees and asylum seekers - it approves just a few dozen applications a year - with Kishida describing the offer as a “demonstration of solidarity with the Ukrainian people at such a crucial moment”.

It is not clear how many Ukrainians would consider taking refuge in Japan or how long they would be permitted to stay. Kishida, speaking to reporters after a call with the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said those with relatives or friends in Japan would be given priority.

“But we will not stop there and will respond [to other applications] from a humanitarian perspective,” he said.

“The Ukrainian situation is tense, and refugees are growing in large numbers. We will make preparations to cope with this situation as soon as possible.”

Ukrainian refugees would not be counted among the 5,000 people, including returning citizens, permitted to enter Japan daily under its Covid-19 border restrictions.

In 2020, Japan accepted just 47 refugees and 44 people on humanitarian grounds out of nearly 4,000 applicants. Rights groups have long accused Tokyo of doing too little to help those fleeing conflict.

The subsequent public comments and claims made about the size of the aircraft fleet the EU was procuring for Ukraine may have been a result of miscommunication, bluster, or even propaganda designed to boost morale like the mythical 'Ghost of Kyiv.' Maybe another source outside the EU can be worked out, but that will take time and there will be other hurdles.

It seems that Russian authorities has its own propaganda and the Russians do not know what is the reality in Ukraine. We can get online in touch with Russians telling them and sharing videos and any information that can open their eyes. There are many proofs that there is no ""special military operation"" and actually there is a war. Show them videos with towns bombarded and ruined,  kids in tears, shocking videos with dead bodies of kids, women, men being killed by Russian troops and videos where russian soldiers are not welcomed with flowers as Kremlin propaganda says and instead of that they are welcomed as Invaders and occupiers.

And yes, before someone brings it up, I am doing everything that I can to help Ukraine.

Someone asked why NATO wasn't responding in a more straightforward manner.

I was going to respond to them, but they deleted their comment, so I'm putting it here instead. I feel like it gives some context and I need to get stuff out of my head. Please also understand that I'm angry and stressed and worried and scared and try not to judge me too harshly.

The comment was something like:

>Why isn't NATO getting involved... theyre providing weapons but they're helping the enemy by not getting involved. They're sitting on the sidelines...

My reply is:

Because NATO is scared that Putin will use nukes.

I somewhat agree with your statement. NATO is helping via intelligence support, weapons, ammunition, and the sanctions, but they seem unwilling to actually take action.

This is already WW3 (per Fiona Hill anyway), it's being fought financially, and with Ukrainian blood. NATO is defensive and is falling back on their (false, imo) statement that they are a defensive organization. They (or at least some of their members) can be offensive when it suits them.

Arms and financial funding are great, but what happens if Ukraine gets cut off from the west? Will NATO help Ukraine bring in the weapons and supplies? Or will they just sit on the borders of Poland and Romania and watch?

As someone with family in Ukraine, NATO's lack of action is sickening and depressing, especially considering the intelligence analyses being released. It makes me wonder if Putin actually does decide to attack a NATO country if they'd even use article 5. I hope to God that they will. I wish they, or at least some of their members, would do something more substantial.

I know why they aren't, and I know people will tell me why they aren't, but those of you who don't have anyone who may be killed by Russian aggression and NATO's fear/inaction don't get how the start of WW3 can seem like a good idea if it means saving your loved ones.

I am not advocating for WW3, just trying to give context.

I am guilty of making fun of the shit show that Russia has made of it’s initial invasion, however some folks on this thread need to be reminded of reality.


Many here completely underestimate the overwhelming force that Russia could bring to bear if they so wanted. Putin could glass the entirety of Ukraine with strategic bombers, and not bat an eye.


This was a land and $$ grab. He originally wanted Ukraine with its infrastructure intact. He thought Ukraine would just lay down and cower in fear over 190k troops / vehicles bearing down on them. It didn’t work out that way, and now we are getting a preview of how Putin plans to save face.


This world-class narcissist will destroy as much of the country as is needed in order to force Ukraine into submission. Ukraine WILL fall. Russia WILL try to occupy it. They will spend years, and billions/trillions of dollars trying to keep it.


Eventually, they will be forced to pull out like we (the US) have had to do nearly every time we have tried to hold / occupy an enemy territory without the support of the population of that territory.

Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night.

According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken.

In a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said:

There were armed visitors in the city council today.

My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side.

We don’t have Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here!

The developments follow a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city.

Kolykhaiev indicated he negotiated with the invading troops.

I made no promises to them. I just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people.

Other restrictions imposed on the city include aa curfew from 8pm until 6am with cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city.

Public transport is set to restart soon and pedestrians are being told to “walk one by one, maximum two’.

“The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand. They do not conflict,” Kolykhaiev said.

We have shown that we are working to secure the city and are trying to eliminate the consequences of the invasion.

So far this is how it is. Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.”

Earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said: “We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.”

* It's pronounced KEE-ev not Key-EV.
* His name is Zelenskyy not Zelensky or Zelenski, please respect him and spell it correctly.
* Please stop your 'mental health check' and 'F putin' posts, we can tell its a sad karma farm attempt and spam.
* Post your sources before sharing things to stop the spread of misinformation.
* If you feel the need to tell everyone the Ghost of Kyiv is a hoax, just don't. Let the Ukrainians have hope and a hero. It's like telling a child Santa isn't real. And for all you know it may be true!
* Stop fear mongering, Putin is not going to nuke Ukraine into submission or the West. And if he tries, he'd face instant world-wide consequences.
* Take everything you read and see with a grain of salt. Misinformation and propaganda is coming from both sides. Many places in Ukraine are now without reliable power and internet, expect communication to be slower. Be patient and verify news sources. 
* If you want to do something to help from home, use a VPN and go to Russian review sites like Google/Yandex and post updated news as reviews on places like takeout, restaurant, hotels, clubs, stores and businesses to help the Russian people circumvent the media blackout there. Post the numbers they can use to call about their POWs and other factual and helpful information. Even small bits of information can change the minds of many, plant the sunflower seeds and watch them grow.
* The convoy is 40 miles long. It's been measured via satellites. No, it hasn't moved much. Yes, it's still a concern. It is assumed by intel that they are correcting some logistical issues but it is expected to continue moving in the coming days.
* You can help personally to hit Russia in their wallet by boycotting Russian products (and Chinese too). Here are some Russian products to boycott: 

\* Russian Standard and Standard Gold Vodka  
\* Husky Vodka  
\* Polugar Classic Rye Vodka  
\* Beluga Noble Russian Vodka  
\* Ustianochka Vodka  
\* Fabergé (Russian jewelry company)  
\* Kaspersky (Antivirus software)  
\* Bosco Sport (Clothing)  
\* Avtovaz (Vehicle Lada)  
\* Aeroflot (Russian Airlines)  
  
Ukrainian Products to Buy:  
  
\* Khor Vodka (Made at Ukraine's Khortytsa Distillery)

I was too young to be aware of Yeltsin, so growing up, Putin was, as I got interest in politics, this guy who had ripped up Russia's failed attempt to integrate with the west, and had bought in a harsher more serious tone, as a leader who was both harsh but fair, and deserved keeping in mind as just someone who you don't fuck with.

.
.
.
.

This was a guy who we had on video firing bosses at their own companies, and was prepared to trash entire cities in order to keep the country stable.

He was also seen to be just doing things that were useful, although in hindsight I'm not sure what exactly.

I kind of fell for the Strongman thing hook line and sinker, as an impressionable teen basically, and was getting the Putin who fakes historical discoveries, and who was depicted as a superhero more than once.


I'm not sure when his bubble burst for me, but suffice to say that I just no longer see that in him.

.


The Kursk disaster, the way they botched the response to the hostage taking in the theatre, the out of control corruption, the stuff that's become a meme, like the time he supposedly got 140% of the vote in one district, 

hell, even the fact that in Moscow I wouldn't be able to hold hands with my girl without getting the ever loving crap beaten out of me.

Leaders such as Putin are a threat yes, but at least part of the threat has to be how seductive they are to impressionable idiots such as myself, even when they either can't or won't improve the lives of anybody who actually supports them.

Snowden had to go into hiding in Russia because he exposed that yes, the US government was monitoring EVERY SINGLE EMAIL, TEXT AND PHONE CALL in the entire US, something the day before was only said by crazy conspiracy theorists and the mentally ill.

Here is a question, why do they need money to fight the war? I know realistically they do, but if they have the material resources to manufacture the tools and weapons of war and the manufacturing capability within their control then they could technically continue fighting until they ran out of people to fight. 
 
In reality it would be nearly impossible to do this without trade or assistance from outside sources, unless they resorted to fighting by hand with sharpened sticks. But an example that comes to mind is North Korea. They effectively have no real economy on a scale that should be able to fight a war. But with a control economy, the government can make a factory build tanks and compensate them with something of no value to outside nations. 

My point is an extreme nation could continue a fight indefinitely with a horrible economy because “the economy” of a country exists in relation to trading partners. Their ability to fight war is tied to their ability to supply men and equipment. If they can manage to supply men and weapons without the need of any outside interaction, than economic damage by itself would not destroy their ability to continue fighting.",False,1646273747.0,t3_t5fa76,t1_hz4lzu8,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

And you are right.  This world class narcissist will destroy as much of the country as is needed in order to force Ukraine into submission. Ukraine WILL fall. Russia WILL try to occupy it… **AND** they will spend years, and billions/trillions of dollars trying to keep it.

Eventually, they will be forced to pull out like we (the US) have had to do nearly every time we have tried to hold / occupy an enemy territory without the support of the local population.  It is inevitable.

Many here completely underestimate the overwhelming force that Russia **could** bring to bear if they so wanted. Putin could glass the entirety of Ukraine with strategic bombers, and not bat an eye.

This **was** a land and $$ grab. He originally wanted Ukraine with its infrastructure intact. He thought Ukraine would just lay down and cower in fear over 190k troops / vehicles bearing down on them. It didn’t work out that way, and now we are getting a preview of how Putin plans to save face.

This world class narcissist will destroy as much of the country as is needed in order to force Ukraine into submission. Ukraine WILL fall. Russia WILL try to occupy it… **AND* they will spend years, and billions/trillions of dollars trying to keep it.

Eventually, they will be forced to pull out like we (the US) have had to do nearly every time we have tried to hold / occupy an enemy territory without the support of the local population.  It is inevitable.

All while Russia’s economy collapses at home, and they are increasingly cut off from the rest of the world.

A latin-alphabet example would be the german letter 'ü'. The correct way to represent it without the points would be 'ue'. For example, it is completely correct to write 'Muenchen' instead of 'München'.

However, english speaking people usually don't care and rather substitute it with an 'u' - like in 'Munic'. (Or 'Munchen' if they tried to write the german name). Which is wrong, but happens rather often.

Ultimately, the most important thing is that everyone know who you are talking about. I guess a lot of the different transcriptions come from people speaking another language that got used to an alternative maybe even mixing it up with the english one.

Syria's Aleppo is smaller (population-wise at least) as well as less defensible (due to modern buildings I'd imagine), had magnitudes less support (and consequently much worse supplies and equipment)... it took Russia et al (they had multiple allies) 4 years of besieging. And since then Russia's military is in a much poorer state, they have the environment (cold, mud, etc) against them... and after a mere week in Ukraine their losses are 2500~3000% greater than their losses during the whole Syrian war. Not to mention that in Ukraine, the invaders seem to be much more spread out and have less of an air advantage. And even more importantly, this is a war of attrition; for every day that passes, Russia's economy tanks further and their support dwindles.

Of course, this is comparing apples and oranges; but I think it at least provides a bit of a frame of reference as to what a a monumental challenge Russia has ahead of them (one I hope with all my heart that they'll be unable to overcome).

Armies literally run on their motor pools.  They are also fuck-around central.  I am pretty sure those two things are probably universal laws of Army.  There is loads of stupid, unimportant, meaningless shit that needs to get done, tracked and documented, and it never ends.

One of those things is simply, you know, turning the vehicle on and using it a little regularly.  And a big reason for this is to rotate the tires so the top halves don't get baked to brittleness while the bottom halves slowly deform from the massive weight of vehicles.  

Anyway, twitter guy's theory based off of seeing some of the pics is that they haven't been doing that, and that it's caused the tires to basically shred themselves when powering through deep mud.  And in terms of war, making a road impassable is child's play - that's why an army is designed to be able to go around them.  

If broadly true, it goes beyond a resupply fix and that convoy isn't going off road until the mud dries.

Anyway, it's an absolutely fascinating take and if it's broadly true it's going to be wild and go down as one of the biggest blunders in the history of war.",False,1646274123.0,t3_t5fa76,t1_hz4n3g8,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The 'KyivNotKiev' campaign is part of the broader 'CorrectUA' campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

I saw my dad furiously checking the mail, wondering if he was going to be recalled back in into the service after be being out for 15 years.

And the thing is, while you could argue that technically they're right, they made the whole nuclear situation sound so much more unpredictable than it really is. At this point, the truth is that everything that Putin has said about nukes is likely to just be rhetoric and posturing. They definitely did not give enough attention to the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction and how unlikely it is that Putin would risk the annihilation of Russia.

While we have lobbying and influencing, what makes an ""oligarch"" different is they have, due to their wealth and influence over a sector of the Russian economy or underworld, a meaningful and significant amount of political leverage.  They get to determine what laws are written, what officials get elected, what officials get deposed, etc.

&#x200B;

Putin rose to power in part because he facilitated many of these men's rise to power and influence.   They depend on him for their continued collective prosperity and wealth, but he also depends on them to keep Russia as a country in-line and answering to him, as they control all of its economic and political mechanisms.  Individually, when oligarchs fall out of line or dissent, they can, and often have been, quietly disposed of.  Seemingly random ""shootings"" or ""suicides"" that just happen to occur right when one speaks out or does something politically inconvenient for Putin.

&#x200B;

Putin has, up until now, been able to carefully manage them and consolidate his power in such a way--in part because of his connections to the Russian intelligence community--to keep them beholden to him.     But it's a symbiotic relationship.   All of these sanctions placed on them, and on their industries, change this dynamic.   All of a sudden the man they placed on top can't make them rich, keep them rich, and protect them anymore.   And if he can't, maybe someone else could.   Individually, Putin can dispose of dissidents, but if many of them come together and conspire to replace him, *he* might be the one that's a victim of a sudden, seemingly conveniently timed suicide.

&#x200B;

Putin is terrified of this happening.  It's been said, years ago, that he's obsessed with the video of dictator Muammar Gaddafi's men turning on him and gruesomely torturing and killing him.   It's his greatest fear and the source of much suspicion on his part, so he takes great pains to prevent it from happening.   So even if none of said oligarchs can or do step up to depose him, the sanctions have arranged for a perfect storm of conditions to where they have every reason to want to.   And I think you can imagine how that might affect his decision making.

Christianity is about faith and following God, not praying to God to get your “prayers answered”. He’s not a genie. Bad things happen to good people, but in a Christian worldview with an afterlife, that’s okay and not important in the bigger picture.

Add to this continual drone strikes on russian armoured vehicles (honestly at this point they need to be targeting artillery) and the Russian advance is likely to slow down. The goal is to make any potential victory Pyrrhic.

But the vast majority of the world, especially the west, reacted with a level of solidarity, empathy and support that was driven by 'heart' (though certainly paired with more clinical strategic reactions).

He didn't count on the entirety of Europe, both the leaders and the general population, responding to the extent that it did with the support that it did. Not only did it throw the invasion off it's game in tangible equipment and sanctions, but it gave Ukraine a massive morale boost for an already extremely determined people. And in turn that's increased the wider publics resolve in backing Ukrainians, which even further in turn has reduced the morale of Russian forces!

There are plenty of reasons why it hasn't gone as they seem to have planned, but I'm willing to stick my neck out and sound dumb to say that human 'heart' was the most unexpected defence Putin triggered.",False,1646276612.0,t3_t5fa76,t1_hz4ti78,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

 >Kievan Rus' or Kyivan Rus' (Old East Slavic: Роусь, romanized: Rusĭ, or роусьскаѧ землѧ, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę, ""Rus' land""), was a loose federation of East Slavic, Baltic, and Finnic peoples in Eastern and Northern Europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century, under the reign of the Rurik dynasty, founded by the Varangian prince Rurik. The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. The Rurik dynasty would continue to rule parts of Rus' until the 16th century with the establishment of the Tsardom of Russia.
 
**[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Kievan_Rus')** 
 
 >The Mongol Empire invaded and conquered Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, destroying numerous cities, including Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir and Kiev, with the only major cities escaping destruction being Novgorod and Pskov. The campaign was heralded by the Battle of the Kalka River in May 1223, which resulted in a Mongol victory over the forces of several Rus' principalities. The Mongols retreated, having gathered their intelligence which was the purpose of the reconnaissance-in-force. A full-scale invasion of Rus' by Batu Khan followed, from 1237 to 1242.
 
**[Tsardom of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia)** 
 
 >The Tsardom of Russia or Tsardom of Rus' (Russian: Русское царство, romanized: Russkoye tsarstvo, later changed to: Российское царство, Rossiyskoye tsarstvo), also externally referenced as the Tsardom of Muscovy, was the centralized Russian state from the assumption of the title of Tsar by Ivan IV in 1547 until the foundation of the Russian Empire by Peter I in 1721. From 1551 to 1700, Russia grew by 35,000 km2 per year.

 >Martial law in Russia (Russian: Военное положение в России) is defined in the Russian law as a special legal regime that is introduced in conditions of external aggression or its threat. In this way, it differs from the state of emergency, which is introduced in the event of an internal threat such as an attempted coup, unrest or disaster. Martial law should also be distinguished from the State of War- a term that refers to the period between the outbreak of hostilities and their end. The procedure for introducing and abolishing martial law in Russia is defined in the federal constitutional law “On Martial Law” (2002).

Zelenskyy is the most inspiring politician in a generation and is an international icon.  He's gone well beyond just an admired figurehead of the Ukrainian people.  He's the kind of figure in crisis that you read about in history books; that sound far too big and bold to be true.   If you wrote a fictional story about a war like this and made a character like him star in it, the character would be derided as unrealistic.  The point I'm getting at here is... he is now in a position that killing him only makes things worse for the Russians.  He becomes an ideal that can't be erased; a martyr.  He's the kind of man people willingly lay their lives down for.   At the end of the day, there is every reason for every involved party to keep this man alive, because the alternative may well be worse.  

&#x200B;

If you take everything I said up there and flip it upside down, you get where Vladimir Putin sits right now.   Every day this continues, his being alive is more damaging to the very people that put him in power and support him.  He has, through his own actions, painted a bigger target on his own back than any other individual in the entire world; a target that grows increasingly appealing even to those immediately around him.   To the point that, even holed up in isolation with little contact outside of a select few, it is increasingly possible he is in more danger than a man who deliberately put himself in the middle of a warzone.

Propaganda. 

Everyone would agree that the US is immensely better than Russia when it comes to sussing things out and getting to the bottom of fact or fiction, but 3 words for you: WMD’s in Iraq. IIRC, some of the captured Russian soldiers thought they were at war because Ukraine attacked a Russian city. On top of that, Russias justification for going in was basically to liberate the Ukrainian people from their Nazi rulers, (which is beyond funny because the president of Ukraine is Jewish). So I’m saying that something like this wouldn’t be said:

>""Do you rather lose everything and die in nuclear fire or rebel against me?""


Instead it would be:

>The US has launched nuclear weapons against us. We must retaliate! The bombs will be here in 30 minutes!”


All it would take is a couple of idiots to believe that and it’s on like Donkey Kong. They wouldn’t even have to launch *all* their missiles, too. Let’s say that 5 manage to get fired. What then? Do we, or any country that they targeted, respond in kind? Or do we just hope that someone calls off the strike on Russias end and splashes the missiles in the sea?

 >A proxy war is an armed conflict between two states or non-state actors which act on the instigation or on behalf of other parties that are not directly involved in the hostilities. In order for a conflict to be considered a proxy war, there must be a direct, long-term relationship between external actors and the belligerents involved. The aforementioned relationship usually takes the form of funding, military training, arms, or other forms of material assistance which assist a belligerent party in sustaining its war effort.

I think that part of the problem, and why leaders such as Putin always get kept around too long, is that on the surface level, and as far as how they sell themselves, they are like catnip to myself and a lot of other people.

It is exciting, it is powerful, it promises great things without having to work for it, and by the time the cracks start to show, you're already screwed.

And I know this is straight out of the Authoritarian Toolbox, but it took me a long time to actually pick up on what it was.

.
.
.

And to try to actually address your point,



I do agree with hindsight that 2014 was a screw up. Having Ukraine basically fight with one hand tied behind their backs, because the rest of the world had other stuff to deal with, and Ukraine were presumably trying to fight a Russian backed Insurgency without just getting invaded by Russia.

If we could hop in a time machine, and take back the knowledge that Ukraine would get invaded anyway, I am wondering how much different the tactics would have been.

Like Czechoslovakia, we should have been a lot more on it, as well as us actually listening, when alarms were sounded that Russia were interested in our political systems.

We lost at least 4 years there, where we should have at the bare minimum been introducing Ukraine to modern weapons tech, rather than now going back and forth on whether to hand over MIG 29s.

.
.
.
.


And as far as being our Poland, the jury is still out, for me. I don't know if we even can go in, because I don't have that data, and we presumably have people a lot more in touch than me, running risk assessments, burning through other options, and debating whether we would get nuked or not.

Not a singe Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either. Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces from the alliance would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement, mentioned in your question, was made in that context. Kohl and [German Vice Chancellor Hans-Dietrich] Genscher talked about it.

>Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled. The agreement on a final settlement with Germany said that no new military structures would be created in the eastern part of the country; no additional troops would be deployed; no weapons of mass destruction would be placed there.

- China did NOT want Russia invading Ukraine in any way during the Olympics because this would be terrible optics for China to have an ally (in the loosest of terms) act as an aggressor while the eyes of the world are on them.  Chinese culture is all about saving face and their heads would have been covered in eggs had Russia gone ahead with their actions during those 16 days of athletic competitions.

- China was okay with Russia going forward with the invasion because it would very quickly reveal the strategies and mindsets of much of the geopolitical landscape.  It was a free way to see the current modus operandi of the US and EU and how they would react to such a military exercise, and thus gives China a way to start formulating their own counters and strategies for potential future economic and military engagements.

- Should Russia come out resoundingly victorious, their opportunity to significantly shift their power in the global sphere of influence had arrived, and this was made clear in a roundabout way in that accidentally released victory letter.

-  If Russia was resoundingly defeated, they would know that their opportunity to start spreading their own form of authoritarian rule would be met with more hostility around the globe and that it would be best to hang back and keep on their current path or relatively benign, purely economics based foreign policy for now.

- Should Russia run into severe economic pain, it would be an opportunity for Beijing to get it's fingers into Russia's energy sector by keeping it propped up in the face of turmoil, thus giving it greater and cheaper access to energy sources not under more Western control.",False,1646278434.0,t3_t5fa76,t1_hz4jsch,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

So, any field maintenance was out of the picture for us. It often had to be towed. And for any vehicle stuck in the mud, it would take at least twice the power to get the stuck vehicle out (and a cable thicker than your forearm). 

Tractors and dual wheel axles have those massive tires
For floatation, and these vehicles just don’t have the footprint for travel other than roads. And to outfit these trucks with mud paddle tires or the right gear to dig through the mud, would limit their speed and smoothness in ride. 

(Just putting my thoughts here in case you don’t get the military expertise you’re looking for)

Edit: we’ve even left our own equipment in the field when it got stuck in too muddy conditions, and waited for it to freeze or dry up.

Aeroflot had by the end of 1945 carried 537,000 passengers, compared with 359,000 in 1940. : 16  The government made it a priority in the immediate postwar years to expand services from Moscow to the capital of the Union republics, in addition to important industrial centres on the country. To enable this, the government transferred to Aeroflot a large number of Lisunov Li-2s, and they would become the backbone of the fleet.

""In response to a question about whether U.S. citizens should be concerned about a nuclear war breaking out, Biden said ""no."" He was responding to a shouted question at the end of an event at the White House.White House officials said earlier in the day the United States sees no reason to change its nuclear alert levels at this time, a point press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated during her briefing with reporters.""We are assessing President Putin's directive and at this time, we see no reasons to change our own alert levels,"" Psaki said.""

Here's another one: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/russia-nuclear-weapons-putin-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/russia-nuclear-weapons-putin-threat)

""Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, said the UK did not recognise the terms Putin used. “That is not a term that is in their doctrine,” the minister told the BBC on Monday morning. The move was, he said, designed to scare the west and “remind the world he’s got a deterrent” and that it was a distraction designed to ensure that the west was “talking about it rather than the lack of success they are having in Ukraine”.""

This is the same as what military experts in my own country (Norway) have said. I believe US intelligence also said that they hadn't seen anything to indicate that Russia is about to attack anyone with nukes, and I'm sure they're keeping a very good eye on these things right now. There are lots of these examples if you look for them. And I'm also noticing that people who experienced the Cold War seem calmer about the whole thing, probably because this kind of rhetoric from the Russians was not that unusual back then.

Also, the current situation does not fit into Russia's nuclear doctrine, which was signed by Putin himself in 2020. They have four scenarios where the use of nuclear weapons is permitted: 1) If there is a nuclear attack on Russia; 2) If there is a conventional attack on Russia that threatens the country's existence; 3) if there is an enemy attack ""on critically important government or military facilities of the Russian Federation, the incapacitation of which could result in the failure of retaliatory action of nuclear forces""; and 4) if they get reliable information about an impending nuclear attack on Russia or its allies.

Finally, if the Western politicians believed that Russia might actually attack their countries, they would for sure take several steps back from this situation instead of hitting Russia with the mother of all sanctions.

The new system, based on the digital transmission of operations orders bypassing intermediary levels straight to the launch pad, allows the prompt targeting and retargeting of missiles and ensures the effective command and control of all units and subunits, Defense Ministry spokesman Dmitry Andreyev said. The fifth-generation system will use wire, radio and satellite communication channels that are well protected from jamming and other forms of interference, he added. The system is compact and reliable and boasts low energy consumption, secure information transmission and imperviousness to external impacts, the spokesman said.

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago. He has been described as the most influential realist of his generation. Mearsheimer is best known for developing the theory of offensive realism, which describes the interaction between great powers as being primarily driven by the rational desire to achieve regional hegemony in an anarchic international system.

The conflicts in the middle east were eroding the country and harming the world. The US said we are going to figure out how to drop this dependency. They literally invented a new technology to extract gas, and became the largest producer of oil AND natural gas in the world. It took ten years or so. 

The US still imports some of it's energy and continues to work towards renewables, but it has the capacity now to be cut off completely and carry on. 

They are doing the same thing now with rare earth metals and building computer chip foundations to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. It's going to take years to get there.

>The situation is dynamic, so this remains an estimate on what is militarily possible. This U.S. official also could not say when the sanctions that have been rolled out so far will have a practical impact on the Russian military. The low morale and shortages of food and fuel are not a result of the sanctions now in place. At some point, however, the Russian military will be impacted by the sanctions.

>Given the durability of the Ukrainian resistance and its long history of pushing Russia back, **the U.S. and Western powers do not believe that this will be a short war. The U.K. foreign secretary estimated it would be a 10-year war. Lawmakers at the Capitol were told Monday it is likely to last 10, 15 or 20 years — and that ultimately, Russia will lose.**

Secondly, it’s Russia. You don’t get a promotion because you’re good at your job, you get a promotion because you’re an extremely loyal brown nosed yes man. I can’t see Putin stacking the HC with people who would oppose him in any way, shape, or form.

Putin - Launch the missiles. 

Ivan - No, I don’t think I will obey that order. I’ve got too much to lose.

Even if they all ended today, it would still be REALLY bad and take time for them to recover. I think even if they were just reversed instantly, it could possibly throw Russia into a recession. Less people likely to lend to them or affiliate with them, etc. That would rely on China so heavily, that China could strong-arm the hell out of them.

But with this current rate... I wouldn't be surprised to see bread lines sooner than later. This could lead to Great Depression levels for them.

And the thing is... The Russian people know ""oh the stock market went bad"". Even with propaganda, they know ""Putin did this and we're all paying for it""

It would be amazing if this resulting in Russia getting full on democracy without any hitches (or at least compared to the US. As in, problems for sure, but overall *is* a democracy for now).

I mean, remember that there was a hesitant *debate* about SWIFT. Saying it might hurt too much. And it's been days since that went through. They're getting it so hard.

It also presents, and also ridiculously, as a sound idea that 'the military difficulties met by the Mongols in storming fortified towns' 'eventually made it difficult for them to continue the conquest'. 
Right, tell it to the Chinese and various Muslim rulers that expected the same.

Chinese anything does anything anywhere and headlines will say ""CHINA does something something"". Which in the classic racist view of Asians in America as mindless drones, the hoard, or the masses of people without any voice or identity.

Where as a Russian oligarch will never ever be referred to as ""RUSSIA DID \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" in a news headline. Being Caucasian they will be referred to as an individual and not talked about in an overtly racist conspiratorial role.

It's the same old trope over and over again. You see coverage of this war from the perspective of ordinary Russians on the street with street side interviews. Yet, the American media almost never interviews Chinese people on the street. It's because Russian look like you, you feel like you can relate to them. Chinese people and Asians do not look like you and thus Western reporters give them no agency and ignore that people over there might feel differently on issues.

The same tone that China is talked about is the same tone Japan was talked about in the 80s. As a kid growing up in America I remember how odd it was seeing movies from the 80s that had a very ominous ""The Japanese are going to be our overlords."" tone. Like Johnny Memnomic, Black Rain. I laughed when I saw a book titled ""The coming war with China"" because I knew there was a book published decades ago called ""The coming war with Japan"".

The Russian government has been doing everything in it's power to undermine American democracy and far more aggressive about it than China by interfering in the elections and massively influencing people via social media. And yet outside of the election interference, Russia is not spoken of in a war like conspiracy against America. No one is saying we're going to war with Russia tomorrow.

Meanwhile China in a similar position has been constantly spoken of since 2014 as someone we are going to go to war with tomorrow and that anything and everything related to China is a conspiracy against America. The racist overtones are obvious to the Chinese American community. Before 2014 I never experienced open racism as a adult, since 2014 I have experienced it many times. I am also backed up by skyrocketing hate crimes against Asians even before COVID.

NASA is banned from cooperating with China while Russia, who teaches their citizen that war with America is around the corner, is not banned from cooperating with NASA. 2 nations with similar positions, 1 Caucasian one not banned from NASA, one Asian one banned from working with NASA. The racism is obvious.

However, the drug had never been officially authorised for such use in the country; its use was merely promoted by the chair of a non-governmental medical association in Tokyo, and it has no established benefit as a COVID-19 treatment. Meaghan Kall, the lead epidemiologist for COVID-19 at the UK Health Security Agency, said that Campbell was confusing causation and correlation.

This occurred after attempts by the Tibetan Government to gain international recognition, efforts to modernize its military, negotiations between the Government of Tibet and the PRC, and a military conflict in the Chamdo area of western Kham in October 1950.
