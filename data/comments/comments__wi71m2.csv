Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 August 2022
 


- The poor performance of Russia's armed forces during its invasion of Ukraine has been costly for Russia's military leadership, highly likely resulting in the dismissal of at least six Russian commanders since the start of hostilities in February 2022.

- The commanders of Russia's Eastern and Western Military Districts have highly likely lost their commands. General-Colonel Aleksandr Chayko was dismissed as Commander of the Eastern Military District in May 2022. General-Colonel Aleksandr Zhuravlev, who has commanded the Western Military District since 2018, was absent from Russia's Navy Day in St Petersburg on 31 July 2022 and has highly likely been replaced by General-Lieutenant Vladimir Kochetkov.

- General Aleksandr Vladimirovich Dvornikov has subsequently been removed after been given overall command of the operation in Ukraine, and General Sergei Surovikin has assumed command of the Southern Grouping of Forces from General Gennady Valeryevich Zhidko. These dismissals are compounded by at least 10 Russian Generals killed on the battlefield in Ukraine. The cumulative effect on consistency of command is likely contributing to Russian tactical and operational difficulties.

1. In the last three days only, Ukraine has destroyed approx. 10% of the total anti-aircraft equipment destroyed during the whole invasion (14 systems out of 132). All of them in the Southern front if I've understood correctly.

2. In the South, Ukr is increasingly using their Air Force to conduct strikes on ammo depots, command centers and troop concentrations, as opposed to HIMARS. 

I find it very likely that these developments are connected. I don't know why Air Force is preferred to strike these targets. It could be more cost-effective than firing HIMARS rockets or inflict less strain on Ukr logistics? HIMARS priority has shifted from ammo depots to taking out anti-aircraft & clearing the way for the Air Force?

Its basically a form of accelerated attritional warfare. What they have done is tried to tempt the Russians into sending forces into an area where its easier for Ukr to do this.

So my guess is that the Ukrainians will not rush forward in Kherson over the next week--they will take advantage of the fact that the Russians are giving them much easier targets to hit from a safer Ukr perspective.""

Day 165 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled again, this time at 10:15pm. There were around 7 explosions, most likely they used MLRS, but it could’ve been some artillery. They hit some infrastructure facility in Kyivskyi district, and there’s no info about what else was hit yet, but thankfully it seems there were no casualties.

They also did their usual missile strike much earlier this time, at 1:05am. They used S-300 again; it’s pretty much the only missile system they use by this point to fire at Kharkiv, they also fire it at Mykolaiv daily. They fired 6 missiles, 2 of them blew up right after launch in Belgorod and their fragments fell in the city. The other 4 missiles landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, no info about what was hit yet. 

Some guy from Belgorod posted a video with a big chunk of the missile in his hand, which he said, fell within 10 meters from him, and almost killed him. He also said that chunks like that fell everywhere and damaged some roofs. Nice one Russia, shelling Belgorod with your own hands so we don’t have to, though it would be better if they hit some of their own military’s positions with it. That would be a proper denazification.  

And one of the yesterday’s missiles hit the ground in one of our parks, with nothing but trees around the place of impact. I wonder if they have some good people who intentionally aim their missiles at non-targets just to waste them, or is their aim just that bad? It would be better if it was the former, but we probably won’t be able to find out. Though that is a good thing, if we know about it, then Russians will know about it too.

People saying we are just too optimistic on this sub, things couldn't possibly be going so well for Ukraine etc.  I'm not sure if its a troll, a bot, or some one new/ignorant to what has been happening during this war.

Ive been obsessively following this sub since day 1 of war and it has not all been good for Ukrain. I wrote some personal observations as a recap of what I've seen on this sub.

Initial shock at invasion became terror as Russia penetrated deep and quick.  Within a couple days terror turned to disbelief as Ukraine mounted a heroic defense.  

But make no mistake Ukraine got real bloody real quick. Many lives were lost and military infrastructure took a pounding.  Russian success was, thank god, overshadowed by its failures.  Logistical nightmares, poorly maintained equipment, ill prepared soldiers, Kyiv was saved and Russia repelled from much of Northern Ukraine.   Javlins and similar antiarmor weapons were the tools and the Ukrainian military and terrirtorial defense the heroes.

Then came the second phase Russia regrouped and pushed hard in the South and East.  Those were some dark days.  Russia rained down hell, thousands of shells, artillery nonstop.  Promises of Ukraine mobilization coming through training and Western weapon deliveries were all we had going for us.

Then a few weeks ago god damn HIMARS came online. Suddenly Russian HQs vaporized,  ammo dumps became the 4th of July. The third phase was here. Ukrainian troops fresh out of training (real training not that shitty Russian hazing) Western weapons arriving in mass.  We started seeing increases in strategic targets taken out by Ukraine.  Supply lines, antiair, weapon caches Russian artillery fires at a fraction of what it used to.

So sure if you've been following the sub for a few weeks it looks too good to be true but this has been a bloody war, Russian war crimes abound (fuck off Amnesty International).  Ukraine has paid a heavy price to defend democracy, to defend the way of life so many of us take for granted.",False,1659924762.0,t3_wi71m2,t3_wi71m2,,0,47,0,47,1,0,
bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,wi71m2,ija125v,"Ok - this is a discussion point.

In the previous post I was told that “both Russians and Ukrainians are facing genocide”

I was also told in a seperate conversation “that the US had also done the same in Iraq as Russia is doing in Ukraine now.” The world is being unfair to Russia.

Let’s discuss false equivalence and whataboutism.

Firstly, false equivalence is when you falsely claim two things to be the same thing.

For example, Ukraine fighting against Russian forces in the Donbas is not the same as Russia trying to invade Ukraine. Firstly, the Donbas is part of Ukraine. If Russians in the Donbas want to be part of Russia, they can move there. Ukraine attacking the Donbas is not “genocide”, it is fighting for its land. Even if Ukraine takes the Donbas, Russians and Russian culture will continue to exist …in Russia. 

As opposed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin has said from the start that he regards Ukraine to not be is “a real country” and Ukraine is really “part of Russia”. If Russia achieves its stated goals, Ukraine will cease to exist. Ukrainians will have no land and the Ukrainian culture will die. This is genocide.

These two things are not the same, and saying so is a false equivalence.

The second issue is the lazy whataboutism is so often seen from Russian propagandists.

Whataboutism is bringing up past actions of other people to minimise or justify current bad actions.

Brining up past examples of what other people have said is a great way to create a false argument to support actions that you know are inexcusable in the now.

“Yeah, but I slept with your wife because you slept with another guys wife in the past”. It doesn’t make the bad actions in the past ok. Neither does it make your actions now ok. It can’t even be characterised as revenge because the slight wasn’t against the person saying it. It’s simply a statement that they are willing to continue bad behaviour. It’s not even close to a justification. In fact, it is an admission that the person knows their current behaviour is wrong.

“Our invasion of Ukraine is ok because the US invaded Iraq “ is an example of both of these things.

Firstly, it is a false equivalence because the US goal in Iraq was regime change, not taking over or removing the Iraqi culture. Secondly, it is classic whataboutism. In no way does it justify Russias attempt at genocide in the now. In fact, it only illustrates that Russia and Russians know that their behaviour in the now is wrong.

Russians are in fact stating that they know the invasion of Ukraine is a crime when they say this.",1659850923.0,1659850437.0,t3_wi71m2,t3_wi71m2,,0,86,0,86,0,0,

The reason for an Air Force is ""immediacy"".

HIMARS and M777 take 2 minutes from firing the projectile... before it lands. Yeah, 50km or 70km shots take a long time to travel, even if you're traveling at supersonic speeds. Mach 1 is only 1234 km/hr, or 20km/minute.

That's if everything is dialed in and ready to go too. If the crew needs to aim the weapon (IE: it didn't know where it was shooting at before you give the message), expect another 2 or 3 minutes added on top of that as the crew aims the weapon.

-----------

If you've got an airplane fighter-bomber / CAS flying overhead? As long as it is in the area, it can **immediately** fire upon the enemy. It may take 10 minutes to launch from an airport and it is of high risk to the pilot (any sane enemy will want to shoot down enemy airplanes ASAP).

But once the airplane is there, it can shoot at a target and immediately hit it. No delay what so ever.

---------

That means an airplane can reliably kill a **moving** target. Not just still targets like a HIMARS. (M777 is cheap enough that you can lob 20 or 30 rounds at an area and ""hope"" you hit the moving target, but its still not as reliable as asking a pilot in an airplane to just shoot at a target)

---------

Why not a loitering drone? Well an airplane has more bullets. An airplane can fire at a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th target.

-------

> We are the people of the strongest nation in the world. A nation that fights. A nation that is also reforming itself. A nation that has ensured the most powerful unification of democracies in history.

> We are a nation that has the strength to celebrate the Ukrainian Statehood Day on the 162 day of a full scale war against Russia. We have made it so that the values of the free world didn't stop at rhethoric and have started working to protect the civilization. We have made it so that the European Union is more united than ever since its foundation and it is becoming stronger thanks to our strength.

> We have shown the power of democracy to the tyrants of the world.

> We have done that, the people of Ukraine. All of us -- civilians and military, public servants, businessmen, politicians, media and influencers... Every man and every woman who has sincerely done everything they could for one reason -- for Ukraine, for their families, for our future.

> We have done that, the people of a country boasting more than a thousand years of history. More than a thousand years of culture. More than a thousand years of character -- the unbreakable Ukrainian character that has held our ground against multiple invaders.

Do ideally the AA Unit doesn’t just have their radar running exposing their position, they’ll have it turned off and will wait to be fed information from other units or from their command on the general area of enemy aircraft, at which point they’ll turn their own radar on, attempt to gain a lock for a short period of time, launch the missile if they do get a lock.

At then, ideally, they move position, they pack up a drive a mile or two away and set up a new position there. The classic “shoot and scoot”.

Once again, I'm not sure if the UA military is even ""truly"" advancing upon Kherson. They show off some tanks moving in that direction, but they post the movements publicly.

Were they?  I distinctly remember UK and US government briefings from the earliest days of the invasion that they anticipated (and were preparing for) a long, protracted conflict lasting perhaps 10 years or more.  By contrast, Ruzzia was expecting it to be over within 3 days.  So who exactly was the ""everyone"" that was predicting 30 days?

The war will, unfortunately, go on so long as Putin continues to send Russian boys to their deaths in an unending meat grinder.  It's terribly sad, but that's the way it is until he finally realises the devastating mistake he has made and withdraws from Ukrainian territory.

*Edit*: I actually think that, since those early predictions were made, the situation has shifted substantially in Ukraine's favour.  Nobody imagined Russia would be failing on such an epic scale, or in such basic ways; and the Ukrainians have met (and even surpassed) the very best expectations.  I think it's now preposterous to imagine Russia can sustain this conflict for anything like those initial predictions: frankly it's unlikely they can even sustain it for 10 months, let alone 10 years.  On the other hand, the west are perfectly capable and willing to help Ukraine sustain their defence for as long as it takes.",1659907083.0,1659903743.0,t3_wi71m2,t1_ijcotsa,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

The Russia needs an enemy to rally its people against. They politically need to be a victim so they can get revenge and ""set the world right"". 1984 was a user manual. All this points to a long, drawn-out low level fight.

You have grossly oversimplified and generalised things in your comment. The wider the generalisation, generally the less true it becomes (the irony of this sentence is not lost on me but it tends to be true nonetheless).

>Everybody says Russia has been losing dramatically and non-sustainably from Day 1 of the war.

You need to understand timelines and scale in war. Unsustainably means it cannot continue forever on current trends, we have seen this demonstrated at each stage of the war. Their casualty and equipment loss rates have been high throughout the whole period.

In the first stage we saw Russia retreat from large areas of Ukraine and adjust their war aims to be smaller, demonstrating their war as conducted was unsustainable.

In the second stage we saw them concentrate a large portion of their forces in the East and then make very small, incremental ground, this eventually stopped, and they have ceased being effective offensively, this demonstrates that even with smaller offensive goals, their losses were unsustainable.

And in the latest phase they've shifted some force elements from the East to the South West due to Ukrainian methodical offensive success, demonstrating they are now on defensive footing and that their losses to date were unsustainable. You don't shift from an offensive focus to a defensive one if relative power ratios to the enemy are in your favour.

Thus the degradation of Russian forces has continued to be unsustainable for the means and goals they were being used for. If it continues, even occupying the territory they have will become tenuous.


>I much more believe experts that have said this war could go on for YEARS.

>If we're as bad commentators as Russians, then what are we ?

This is a more complicated thing. Wars take years, with some exceptions. This one was always going to be an intense conflict, but has the potential to be shorter than comparable peer to near-peer conflicts.

Our commentators are NOT as bad as Russian ones. But as with most commentators on most subjects, they get things wrong and news outlets frequently give air time to the wrong ones.

Russian news outlets are blatantly propaganda, meaning the messaging is driven from the government and will bend, twist or break the truth for any narrative.

Allied news outlets are generally biased in some manner to varying degrees, but this bias is primarily driven by their consumers, albeit with some owner-driven bent.

The problem in the media is that our news outlets were getting their information from analysts who don't know what they're talking about militarily. Most of the mistakes came about because of surface-level glances at personnel and equipment numbers, not an in-depth knowledge of military power, force multipliers, C3i, logistics or just Ukrainian people and culture.

Having some experience in some of these areas, my worst case scenario I could see at the start of this war was large territorial loss for Ukraine in the East, and then an intense partisan and guerilla campaign with Russia slowly being bled dry while NATO supplies and trains Ukraine to take back a chunk of their lost territory, how much was an open question. This was simply because Russia didn't commit enough forces to effectively occupy and control Ukraine, let alone half of it.

I wasn't too far off but better analysts than me (particularly in logistics and military strength) were much better at predicting the issues Russia has. In combination with a brilliant defence by Ukraine, we get to where we are presently.

If you go looking for the information, it's there but can be hard to find and hard to tell who to trust.

Gen Hertling has been great, as has Mick Ryan, but there was even an in-depth analysis of the Russian military from someone as far back as 2015-16 IIRC that effectively assessed that Russia would struggle to supply itself more than 160km or so from its borders without effective rail access.

As for how long it takes Ukraine to liberate her territory, that's open for debate and depends on many factors. What I do know is that they will want some sort of big success (e.g. liberate a major population centre) before Rasputitsa in September, so keep your eyes on the different information coming in. A wide pattern of towns and areas being liberated are a sign as to Ukrainian intentions.",False,1659926294.0,t3_wi71m2,t1_ijdw357,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

This is the key part. This sub is forward looking, and can see major changes (eg fire location shifts, troop movements, HIMARS impacts etc.). For example, I was able to pick the turn in skirmishes when Ukraine switched from fuck-all daily artillery kills (when Russia was artillery-pushing in the east, while Ukraine was stuck in a salient), to HIMARS wiping out ammo dumps and starting to push against enemy artillery again (which slowed down in fire saturation, as Russia's major offensive stalled).

Similar we track AA kills and Ukrainian sorties increasing, logistics changes (including train and bridge attacks), etc. 

All of this feeds into sustainability. It may take years to push Russia completely out of Ukraine (as they adapt and compress logistics), however it won't take years for Ukraine to turn the tide and start pushing Russia back. I predict it will happen before the weather kicks in, and we'll see at least one or two major liberations in that time.

Media doesn't really project long-term, they're only looking for snapshots at a given moment. Military analysts are much more forward looking, but write conservatively to protect the political will to support Ukraine (it's a bad idea to underestimate the enemy).

The war has transitioned multiple phases, all swinging in Ukraine's favour (withdrawn frontlines, slowing offensive, stalled offensive, building counterattack). In addition, Russia has a limited force (no mobilisation), while Ukraine is fully mobilised. Russia has an initial stockpile and limited development, Ukraine has increasing supplies and modernisation through western weapons.

If you look at a snapshot of the war today, Russia is seemingly winning. But if you follow the projection from day one, you'll see (which has always been the case), that every day Ukraine survives and pushes back is an improvement to their chances of defeating Russia (and we're at 6 months now).

A few weeks ago there was doom and gloom all over the threads because Russia was still advancing and the southern offensive was radio silent, then people were worried that Ukraine wasn't retaking any territory (while using western tactics to soften the enemy through long-range bombardment), now we're in a position that Ukraine can either consider a counter-offensive in the south or pivot back to the east (or continue softening).

Not to say any of it is easy for Ukraine, but Russia's invasion is currently unsustainable.",False,1659924438.0,t3_wi71m2,t1_ijdw357,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

There was a post just like this about an hour ago (speaking about the over optimism).  Replying is better, but sometimes it is hard to find.

There's not doubt that this is a Ukraine supporters forum, but objective analysis and correct reports should alway be the ideal.  I feel people here want to be optimistic about the war but are cautious to get ahead of themselves; otherwise, you would not see so many posts continuing to support as much arms support as possible or decrying those organizations/countries who do not sanction or denounce Russia thoroughly enough. People are worried it is not enough.

It may be perverse comparison, but it's like being on a sports team: it's important to be objective about the facts of the game, but its also important for morale not to dwell on the negative, praise the positive, and to focus on the path that leads to victory, no matter how slight.

Most of the older cars bought through the program were scrapped. This removed a large number of older vehicles from the market. The point of the program was to stimulate the car industry after the great recession of 2008-2009, as well as replace older vehicles with newer ones that met the new EPA standards. 

The problem of course is that it has created scarcity in the used car market, plus so many people had cars that are about a little over ten years old that they want to exchange for newer vehicles all at once.

Those fragments could have been from anywhere (ex: USA shot them at Wagner in Syria or something 5 years ago... then they collect the fragments and then pretended that they are fresh missiles from today).

The news does come in combination with the announcement from the UA MoD that in the last few days several anti-air installations have been destroyed. 

Additionally, there is limited value for the Russian's to plant this type of false evidence. It doesn't really reshape the core narrative or present any type of significant escalation from the West, but it *does* portray the Russian side as vulnerable to this new type of weapon. In essence, this news makes Russia look weak and Ukraine look strong, without offering any opportunity to escalate on the Russian side from a political point of view. For instance, if there were US soldiers found in Ukraine, that would likely allow the Kremlin to call for a full mobilization. But some missile fragments doesn't give them any type of political advantage. 

So all in all, I would take this news as credible.

I live in Russia and I hear ethnic slurs about Ukrainians on a near-daily basis, something I'd heard rarely until March. 

I'll give you one example of what's happening in Russia and maybe it will help give you a better idea of what people are thinking. I know a woman who grew up in Crimea who considers herself to be Russian. She now lives in Russia. Her first boyfriend and childhood friend is Ukrainian and now lives in Kyiv, and they are still in contact (for now). She's recently told me that she thinks she will have to cut off contact with him, because every time they speak he begins lying to her about what's happening in Ukraine (her words). She adds, 'He sounds like his Nazi president' and 'He's probably afraid of dying because his country has started conscripting people to fight and he thinks he will be next. Can you believe that?'

America). 

I'm currently working in the UK, get 29 days paid holidays, 6 additional sick days, and healthcare and employment insurance not tied to my employment, in addition to the option of up to a year of paid mat/pat leave (though I'm nowhere near having kids). These are largely standard benefits that come with most employment contracts. And the UK doesn't exactly have the strongest labor movement, just a history of a strong social security net and the remnants of strong labor movements of the 60s-80s. 

Other countries in Europe are even better for work-life balance, benefits and security. 

Meanwhile my brother who works in finance and has an incredibly well-paying job in the States gets a max of 3 weeks holiday, excellent healthcare but tied to his job. And he's quite lucky in terms of benefits. 

Better unions and more unions means more worker power. Better labor movements means better lives for workers.

The problem in the States is the fact the power of unions has been greatly undermined since the 70s, to the point a lot of unions are little more than extensions of corporate leadership (in some cases union leadership is in lock-step with leadership or even appointment by leadership). In those cases the union has been compromised and is no longer functioning as it should.

At that point, worker solidarity becomes essential to either changing union leadership, establishing a new union, or leaving the job altogether. That's where social labor movements become important: when healthcare is not tied to employment, when a society generally has stronger labor laws and unions, when workers are empowered, it makes it easier to leave unions that are not working for your benefit for ones that will. In this case you've been let down by your union, you should be able to leave safely to either be non-union, or for a union that actually works for you. But unfortunately the lack of labor support in the States makes this difficult for a lot of people.

Chinese immigration tells you something about Chinese people.  Almost nothing about the Chinese government except that it is oppressive and authoritarian.  I have no reason to doubt your assessment.
