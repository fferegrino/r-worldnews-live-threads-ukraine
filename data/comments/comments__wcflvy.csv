Day 158 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled during the day again, thankfully with no casualties. In the morning, at 4am, missiles from Belgorod were fired yet again. They fired 8 missiles this time, definitely from an S-300, the amount of damage on the building that was struck matches up, as the 500kg warhead would cause much more destruction.

In today’s strike they destroyed a printing house, which mainly printed school books and books for kids. Yeah, it’s far too dangerous to leave standing in Russian eyes. Books and kids are the number one enemy of Russia, a worthy opponent for the “2nd strongest army in the world”. The fact that they are using AA missiles to strike ground targets is absurd by itself, and that is after they said that they are not running out of missiles.

After they destroyed that technical college Russian MOD said that they “killed 350 nationalists from Kraken battalion” in that one strike. Why don’t they even try to make their claims at least somewhat believable? Saying stuff like this could lead to doubt even in the most loyal zombies, but I guess they don’t care? 

When one of the Kharkiv residents noticed that the Russian MOD said that there are “MLRS and air defense systems hidden in a college” close to him, he went to this college and filmed it on video. The fence is see-through, and there is no military equipment in sight, which once again confirms that they are just choosing random buildings in the city and say that there are Nazis hiding in it.

Also just 30 minutes ago there was another missile strike, it was much earlier than usual, at 2:10am, and they fired at least 8-10 missiles, we heard 11 explosions somewhere far away, apparently they aimed at Merefa this time, as that is where loud explosions were reported. At least one missile straight up just exploded in the air right after being fired and it was filmed on video.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 July 2022
 

- On 28 July 2022, Russia fired at least 20 missiles into northern Ukraine from Belarusian territory. This follows Russia's use of Belarusian territory to launch the main thrusts of its failed attempt to take Kyiv in February.

- Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko continues to follow Moscow's line on the Ukraine conflict, stating on 21 July that Ukraine must accept Russia's demands for the war to stop.

- His regime has become ever more authoritarian, with the expansion of the death penalty for 'preparing terrorist acts. His increasing and baseless accusations of Western designs on Belarus and Ukraine likely indicate that he has become almost wholly dependent on Russia.

>Once deterrence fails and a war begins, the Ukrainian armed forces will find themselves in desperate circumstances almost immediately. Ukraine does not have anywhere near enough forces to credibly defend against all the potential avenues of attack, which means it would have to choose between defending a select set of fixed strong points—ceding control of other areas—or maneuvering to engage Russian forces that outnumber them. 
>
>In short, the military balance between Russia and Ukraine is so lopsided in Moscow’s favor that any assistance Washington might provide in coming weeks would be largely irrelevant in determining the outcome of a conflict should it begin. Russia’s advantages in capacity, capability, and geography combine to pose insurmountable challenges for Ukrainian forces tasked with defending their country. The second argument for aid—changing the course of the war—thus does not hold water.
>
>In normal times, there are many good reasons for the United States to provide military support to Ukraine. But these are not normal times. Military assistance now will at best be marginal in affecting the outcome of the crisis. It might be morally justified to help a U.S. partner at risk of aggression. But given the scale of the potential threat to Ukraine and its forces, the most effective way Washington can help is to work on finding a diplomatic solution.

1. Kharkiv is right along the Russian border. This means, unlike Kherson, the supply chain is relativelty short. There aren't lines of ammo dumps or supply bridges just ripe to be HIMARed away at. Also, Ukraine has displayed great hesitancy at attacking targets in Russia(partially due to fear of losing Western support, partially due to not wanting to make Russian citizens more pro-war), Kharkiv is close enough to Russia that minimal dumps in Ukraine are needed, and it would be nearly impossible to cut off all the roads. So supplies are relatively safe.
2. It's also the closest to Russian troop re-supply and among the furthest from Ukraines heartland of activity. We saw this in the Kharkiv Counteroffensive, where despite early success's, Ukraine couldn't fully acheive their goal of retaking the border and getting the city out of shelling range because it was far too easy for Russia to re-direct troops there quickly and even lob some shells from across the border when they did get close. Hence they shifted to Kherson where the supply situation heavily favors them.
3. Russia has tried MANY times in the Donbas front to pull off encirclements to eliminate Ukrainian troops and break their moral, and almost everytime it failed due to the Ukrainian army simply being too mobile. Mariupol was caught early in the war, and even then it's port and the time of year lengthed the siege and ended up making martyrs out of Azov. Kharkiv isn't that. Kharkiv is the second biggest city in Ukraine and Ukraine would never simply let it go.

I suspect Russia wants to cut off and surround Kharkiv, as the city is close enough to the  border that HIMARS effectiveness at crippling supply lines will be limited. Then siege the city out during the Winter(no heat, no water, bad combination in December) in order to force a surrender and take all the soldiers stationed there, and I assume, HOPE that the moral impact of losing Kharkiv City would send Ukraine to the negociating table.

Is it a good idea? Ehhh....I mean, trying to take an unfriendly city of over a million people is never a GOOD idea, but it's probably a less bad idea then continueing to feed conscripts into the Kherson front.

>Some Western strategists are predicting that even with allied help, the best outcome will be a stalemate. They reason that Russia is larger and has more resources than Ukraine. So, even if Russia cannot win outright, it can prevent Ukraine from winning. Thus, they conclude, a stalemate is the most likely outcome. Given this, the reasoning continues, it’s best to stop the fighting and negotiate a solution now to prevent more suffering. I wonder if these same strategists would have recommended that to the Continental Congress after George Washington’s 1776 defeat on Long Island and in New York? After all, Britain was a global military and economic powerhouse compared to the American colonies, and at the time success looked impossible to many.

>Putin will not stop until he is stopped. His overall purpose is to re-establish a greater Russia.  First reuniting former Russian states — the Baltic countries, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.  Then, when and if possible, Russian “buffer states,” nations of the former Warsaw Pact — Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Subjugating Ukraine is one step toward this ultimate goal.
>
>The Ukraine war is actually being fought and waged at two levels. The first is strategic, in Ukraine: the allies staying true to their word and supplying Ukraine with what it needs to create negotiating conditions favorable to the Zelensky government increases the probability that Putin’s aggression will fail. The second war is grand-strategic, beyond Ukraine: preventing the kind of world in which force plays an increasing role. The rules-based world created after World War II is one in which America and its allies, as well as many other nations, prospered. A future with weak rules and more wars is not one conducive to any country’s prosperity.
>
>The war at both levels is worth fighting. And both, worth winning. Preventing future war starts with stopping Putin in Ukraine. Those who are suggesting that we negotiate with Putin now are not thinking about what’s at stake should Putin’s aggression pay off. The Zelensky government, the Ukraine people, and its allied supporters still have the ability to write the outcome.

- Russia bombs the port of Odessa immediately after signing the grain agreement with the Ukrainian government with an independent mediator present

- A video leaks of Wagner Group mercenaries castrating and later killing a POW (apparently there are more videos of them doing the same to others as well, but this particular video was seen by millions of people)

- Russian artillery lay some of (if not *the*) worst shelling of civilian areas in the East since the beginning of the war over the last several days

- A Russian embassy representative on twitter posts that the Azov POWs do not deserve to be treated as POWs, but instead should be executed immediately

- A day later the DPR commits another massive war crime by then locking the Azov POWs in a prison camp barracks and unleashing incendiary munitions/explosives inside. The camp itself was also located too close to the front line, so even it it was a HIMARS strike by Ukraine on the camp (which is highly unlikely due to the camp already being a well known location and having no military value to Russia) the camp would have been a giant crater. Instead the bunker is burned up and the corpses and bunks are still in tact, as they were all likely asleep on their beds when the DPR executed them

- The close proximity of the POW camp to the front line was also a war crime in itself. It's location to the front line would also make using a HIMARS system ridiculous, as the munitions are very expensive and made to be fired at targets very far from the front lines. If Russia wanted to lie they could have used any of a handful of other methods that the UA allegedly could have used that wouldn't be HIMARS. The photos presented by Russia are also believed to be the same fragments of HIMARS munitions that have been claimed to have been used in many other strikes but only confirmed by UA in one such case

- And now, two days later, Russia targets a Ukrainian agricultural billionaire and his wife because of their support of the government. A producer from RT even brags that it was a purposeful targeting, again saying the quiet part out loud. Even if it was an accidental killing (which wouldn't surprise me either), that's an extremely bad look

More seriously M31s are made in a plant in Alabama.  The Army was rotating out M26 so production was relatively high.  Yearly production was 9,000 M31 in 2021.  Total ever produced was 50,000 but many of them have been fired already.  

Lockheed was asked to ramp up production of Javelin missiles in March.  They do not have a parts inventory.  Lockheed cannot exceed the supply that other companies offer.  Though ""cannot"" might mean something like ""that would cut into profits"" or ""how much you got"", or ""we can cut corners and sell you cheap crap for the same price"".  Hard to say which.  Maybe the M31 has better suppliers that can ramp up or maybe someone had the good sense to run an inventory.  Economics programs teach managers to cut inventories unless the customer demands that an inventory is maintained.  Despite the supply chain excuses they still expect to double production to 4,000 Javelins. 

Building a second M31 plant would require investing assets.  There is no guarantee that the war will be in progress years from now.  Stockholders prefer no uncertainty and want profits/dividends backed by taxpayers.

They are required by law to go to war. At least in the event that “peaceful” means are no longer possible.

However, war with China could easily be achieved by shutting off their shipping lanes. China receives the majority of its oil through a very small strait. Any blockade of their access to oil would immediately cut off something like 60% of their energy supply. Their country would have to rely heavily on coal. And last I checked cars don’t run on coal. Nor do most military apparatus. 

They have other sources of oil but it’s nowhere near enough. Their economy would be in shambles.

Taiwan's military doctrine is to attempt to fight China on china's territory - they're maintaining a blue-water navy, which... This isn't the greatest idea. If you're holed up in Mariopol, why go to your opponent?

More recent *discussions* in taiwanese doctrine involve fighting the Chinese in the littoral regions of Taiwan, that is, nearer to Taiwan's coast.

The issue is that I don't think Taiwan has exactly prepared yet for that kind of war. Granted, they'll have time when they see the Chinese mobilizing, but how much and what they can do are open to question. 

In addition, Taiwan almost certainly has a large number of Chinese agents - it's just too dang cheap to try and recruit over there as opposed to blasting your way in. Not to oversell the parallel with Ukraine at all, but one of the reasons Russia thought they could come in cheap, per Reuters investigative reporting, was because the Russians had a large number of Ukrainian sleepers. Thankfully, only like 30% of them activated. Reuters cites the orders for the Ukrainian national guard unit defending Chernobyl to lay down arms as an example of this.

So yeah, people generally get the idea from the term - kinda like you know porn when you see it, but then try to get people to agree on exactly what does and doesn't qualify.  Is it democracies in general?  The US and friends?  Is it defined by Clash of Civilizations so Russia area would be The Orthodox (and if so why aren't they ever called that in popular media)?  Does it include everyone in NATO? Does it include the countries of the UN who voted to repudiate the Russian invasion resolution ES-11/L.1?  Is it culturally secular/pop culture or religious-based?

The definition also says things like this:  ""The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the theological, methodological and emphatical division between the Western Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches."" which doesn't exactly seem like the foundation of modern context most of the time these days.

To me it's more as an outgrowth of post-WWII mentality when the major powers US/UK and friends (western EU + west of the Atlantic) ended up squaring off against the Soviet Union (Russia + eastern EU) immediately after and over the next few decades.  Part of that same mentality and Putin's interest in Foundation of Geopolitics and restoring USSR ""glory"" as the other big power on the world stage is likely a big part of why this mess is going on.

Germany actually had a ship full of weapons near Durban but in the end thought better of it. France sent advisors who fought in the field with the Boers.

Before WW1 Russia and Japan fought a few wars, and Japan completely smooshed the Russian fleet.

WW1 happens, and after the 1917 bolshevik revolution England actually invaded Russia in an attempt to free the Tsar, but was stopped by General Winter.

In the 1920's the great depression and spanish flu swept the globe.

1920-1938Europe was under a massive recession. Eastern Europe fell victim to engineered famine by Stalin.

Japan invaded China and other nations.

Russia invading Ukraine is the first conventional war where conquest is the aim since the 1970's Israeli wars with their neighbors, the 1980's Iran Iraq war, The India Pakistan war over Bangladesh, Sodamn Insane invading Kuwait.

1. Economic - The system is CRAZY expensive. $1 billion for a single patriot battery, $3 million for each individual missile. The US could supply Ukraine with untold amounts of just as effective weapons systems for that amount of money.
2. Logistical - The system is, apparently, VERY technically complex. Far more so than any other system that Ukraine is being trained on at the moment. Sure, the US could train people to use it. But that training costs time, money, and manpower, all whilst Ukraine is in the midst of a war for it's very existence where all three of those things are very precious. The time spent training a soldier on using a patriot battery is time that could have been spent training them on a system that is far more useful NOW, during the ongoing conflict.
3. Application - A patriot system can be used for high to medium range missile defense, but so can plenty of other systems that aren't nearly so expensive or complex. Using a patriot missile (cost of \~$3 million) to defend against the type of missile attacks hitting Ukraine at the moment is just wasteful. It's like using a howitzer to swat a fly. The real party piece of the patriot is as an anti-ballistic missile defense. Something which Ukraine doesn't need right now, and which leads in to point 4.
4. Political - Installing a patriot defense system in Ukraine, especially at the current time, would be a MAJOR escalation of the conflict. Because of what it is, a nuclear deterrent, Russia could very well see it as an existential threat, and escalate things accordingly. With that in mind, the possible benefits of a patriot system are far, FAR outweighed by the potential catastrophic consequences of installing one.",False,1659296292.0,t3_wcflvy,t1_iif0h0x,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

the UN has only the powers the member states decide to give it. What you want from the UN is much more than they can ever give. They are not a police force no matter how much you want them to be. They cannot ever be this. They are not a world government. Their authority is what the member takes choose to give it. 

I'll keep my focus on the UN because that is what I know best. I don't know enough on the Red Cross' rock-and-a-hard-place to really talk about that. People *always* shit on the UN for being weak and spineless, because they want a police force to do something to the bad guys. But the UN exists as a place for diplomats to lie to each other, in a way. If that prevents a war, or prevents a war from spreading, or shortens a war, then the world gets a win for all the losing. 

But you  can't prove a negative, so the only thing the UN can be seen to do is fail. Calling them out on this failure is useless to improving the situation and only serves to further weaken the institution, which the bad guys like.  

>doesn’t mean we must pretend they are a force for good 

Saying the UN is not a force for good is profoundly ignorant. As I said, you can't prove a negative. Even trying to prevent war is a force for good, because war is quite literally just about the worst thing that humanity can do. 

Yes everyone who understands these institutions wishes they could do more, but they can't. And diplomats suggesting diplomacy is hardly an eye-opener, is it? Suggesting people get together and be less terrible to each other is generally speaking a virtuous idea. When one side is a bunch of violent psychopaths then the outlook is not good, but trying in itself is still not the worst idea. War is the worst.

My big point is what do you hope to gain by criticizing these institutions? Sure they are sometimes ineffective and sometimes they even get played. But without them, what? There are no alternatives to fill their shoes, and without them we have *nothing*. And nothing is guaranteed to be worse. That's why they are trying in the first place. 

OP called the UN and RC *corrupted by Russian money*. Come on, people! Lets get real here.

You say ""in faiirness not many people expected back then we would have the situation we have now"", but this is completely false. Perhaps Germans were wilfully burying their heads in the sand. This seems to be the case, with senior politicians trying to get Russian businesses around sanctions after the invasion of Crimea, or continuing to work closely with Russia. But it was clear from 2008 what the direction of travel was with the invasion of Georgia. Who blocked EU aid to Georgia? Germany. From 2010 Germany's close allies, the UK, the US, Poland, and France, all highlighted at various points that Germany's reliance on Russian gas was a strategic weakness for all of Europe.   


German politicians rejected a South Europe pipeline in the 2010s, which would have sourced gas and oil from Africa via Spain. They rejected a LNG port facility near Hamburg which would have allowed LNG from the US to be shipped in. They rejected a gas and oil pipeline from Azerbaijan and Armenia via Turkey. They rejected a gas and oil pipeline from Norway. But they did accept Nord Stream 2, which further bolstered their dependence on Russia.   


It was  known for a long time that Germany reliance on Russian cheap gas was a strategic weakness of Europe, and that Russia was an increasingly unpredictable global actor.

Maybe you can imagine it should be silent criticism or internal criticism, but time and again we see that not working with many institutions, until finally they are called out in public and things change. See the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal for an example. For those who believe institutions can change for the better, meaningful criticism is the only way.

Or maybe some of our institutions need to be replaced by something better. The League of Nations was replaced by the United Nations in part because of its utter failure to prevent World War II.

As long as MAD is possible, even belligerent countries are very unlikely to resort to nuclear warfare against each other. The problem comes in when one country seemingly has a defensive advantage over the other.

It hasn’t been done up to now because it wasn’t enforced. We were stupid enough to wait for Putin to enforce it instead of ourselves setting the agenda.

Now that companies are forced to reduce or substitute gas they are doing it. As it should have been expected in a market economy where prices and therefore availability dictate behavior.

Politicians tried to protect business interests, that’s all. Now we can see clearly that it‘s not that big a deal, or at least a lot of a less big deal than has been proclaimed out of self-interest.

> Also, war fatigue is a thing. The more the war drags on the more people want it to be resolved one way or another so they can return to normalcy.

If there is one thing we should have learned since 2016 it’s that Brexit is a thing. People can and will get used to a new status quo rather quickly. Even if it is objectively worse than before.

Help people with low income through the crisis and people will cope.

You’ll be surprised by the amount of people who see blame in the West or both the West and Russia or Ukraine. Then take a look at the surveys reporting the contrast between people who want “justice” aka a fair settlement of the war where Ukraine gains its lost territories and Russia pays and people who want “peace” aka the war to end at any cost usually meaning stop arm supplies and pressure Ukraine into negotiating concessions. Then look at the ones in the middle who are undecided and ask yourself, if after all these war crimes they have not picked “justice” are they likely to do that when they find themselves in financial hardship?

I didn’t even need to read the surveys to have this idea either, if I would go out to a bar and sit in a group and ask about gas prices there would for sure be at least one person that will say we shot ourselves on the foot and we need to ease sanctions and let the war be between Russia and Ukraine. It’s not really an unpopular view, just not represented as much online or dismissed as propaganda.

I personally am worried about the winter. If Russia cuts gas and that tosses us into a recession it will be like the refugee crisis all over again. Alt right parties will be on the rise and the amount of division and political discontent the EU will go through will once again be massive.

People will cope. We need strong leadership though. Somebody has to tell the people the truth, that freedom comes at a price.
