From CNN's Josh Pennington and Hira Humayun

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday that the time until Ukraine is liberated “grows shorter” every day, and that it is “just a matter of time” before Ukraine takes back Russian gains.

“Ukraine will take everything back [from Russia]. This is an imperative,” he said, “And it's just a matter of time. Every day at this same time, the time until liberation grows shorter. Everything we do is for this.”

Zelensky said the situation in the Donbas remains difficult, especially in the areas of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut and Popasna.

“Above all, in terms of weapons supply, every day we are getting closer to outnumbering our enemy,” the Ukrainian president claimed.

He added: “We will dominate the occupiers with technological and conventional striking power. A lot depends on our partners. They are ready to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. So I expect good news on this already, next week.”

Zelensky said Russian forces inflicted “barbaric blows” on the Sumy region using rockets and mortars. He also referenced Saturday’s Russian attack on Mykolaiv, which struck a residential area 20 meters from a kindergarten, killing one person and wounding seven others.

“Such was the target that the Russian Federation chose. Over and over [such actions] will remind the world that Russia must finally be officially recognized as a terrorist state, a state sponsor of terrorism,” Zelensky said. 

He said Russian forces are preventing Ukrainians from evacuating the Kherson region.

“Those who are confident in their position would certainly not make such decisions. This is clearly a sign of weakness. What it shows is that they have nothing to offer the people, and the people do not want to take anything from them. So, they resort to taking people hostage,” Zelensky said. ",False,1653790795.0,t3_uzfb6c,t3_uzfb6c,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

Day 94 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet almost the entire day, but at midnight, exactly like yesterday, they started shelling again, not as much as yesterday, but the problem here is that it could mean that this is their new schedule, and we might get shelled every day at this exact time going forward.

They have been firing cruise/ballistic missiles at Merefa almost every day this past week, and it always happens at night, it’s not anywhere near the frontline, but they continue firing missiles at it anyway. Yesterday they destroyed a solar power plant there, no military targets were harmed. Is this their way of saying that they hate renewable energy?

It’s pretty funny how Russia now threatens nukes every day. They always need to remind everyone that they have nukes. It’s like their only answer to anything that’s bothering them is nukes. Can they stop threatening to end the world for once? Do they want to die that badly, or do they not even understand what a nuke really is?",False,1653791075.0,t3_uzfb6c,t3_uzfb6c,,0,58,0,58,1,0,

Leverage: “Ukraine has a wonderful lever in its hands — the Druzhba oil pipeline,” Zerkal said. “Something could happen” to it, and “in my opinion, it would be very appropriate if something happened to it.” She said it would be up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decide “whether we really wants to speak with Orbán in the language he understands and which he imposes on the European Union.” (Watch it here, in Ukrainian.)
Zelenskyy also ups pressure: “Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia,” Zelenskyy said in his video address last night. “Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions. But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures?”

A ship has entered the Ukrainian port of Mariupol for the first time since Russia completed its capture of the city, Russian media reports.

A spokesperson for the port told the Tass news agency that metal bound for Russia was loaded at the port.

Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova said the shipment amounted to looting.

""Looting in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine continues,"" she wrote on the Telegram.

""Following the theft of Ukrainian grain, the occupiers resorted to exporting metal products from Mariupol.""

After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol fell to Russian forces this month.

As in, [this bridge](https://odessa-journal.com/russian-federation-launched-a-rocket-on-the-bridge-in-zatoka-for-the-fourth-time/).

Readers of the last thread will know that I figured out that [Romania is repairing an old Soviet rail line](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-grains-romania-idAFL2N2WO1BX), which supposedly should be up and running in the next two months. That should allow the Ukrainians to more easily ship out grain via rail through Moldova and NATO member Romania. In particular through the Port of Constanța, which [claims on its website to have over 1,800,000 tons of silo space available](https://www.portofconstantza.com/pn/page/np_terminale), far more than Odesa does. (Look under the ""Dry bulk"" header.) It may not enable grain shipments to quite the same level as unblocking Odesa would, but it's something. And it might just be enough to avoid a food crisis.

So what's the problem? I finally tracked down the Ukrainian railways map. And guess what?

[Everything - absolutely *everything* - heading south apparently goes through that one bridge at Zatoka.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B.svg) Which has supposedly been out of commission since late April. (Reports are vague as to whether or not it's been destroyed entirely. The Russians keep bombing it, so I suspect otherwise.)

There doesn't seem to be any other rail connection through Moldova that doesn't pass through Transnistria. It might (maybe) be possible to construct another rail line from [Biliaivka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliaivka) around the end of the Dniester Estuary through the marshlands of [Lower Dniester National Park](https://goo.gl/maps/zjWKzesqxXdrzL1QA), roughly following the path of the M15 highway, but that would at the very least take months.

So forget about de-mining Odesa. Forget about sending in NATO to wipe out the Black Sea Fleet. If NATO can just do something to help Ukraine repair and protect **this one bridge** (and maybe get the Moldovans and Romanians some more money to help speed things up on their ends), that should let the Ukrainians ship wheat through Moldova to Romania and out through Constanța. Which might just be enough to upend Russia's food war strategy and keep the world fed.

Logistical chokepoints. Don't you just love 'em? 😅

*Edit:* In case anyone's curious, here's the exact logistical chain we'd be talking about here - the grain would go from Ukraine through Moldova to the Romanian town of Galati via rail. (All of which, yes, is the same rail gauge. That's why they're repairing that one specific rail line - it uses the old Soviet gauge, same as Ukraine and Moldova.) In Galati, it'd be loaded on river barges and sent down to Constanța, where it'd be stored in silos and shipped out via the Black Sea. Everyone got that? 😆",1653785546.0,1653782391.0,t3_uzfb6c,t3_uzfb6c,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

From a strategic point of view, the extra 15km of land that Russia will gain from taking their current objectives is not even close to the value of troops and equipment they are losing.

The only result that can come from Russia’s attacks in that area is a hastening of their demise.

Keep in mind that as the balance of the war shifts, Ukraine will not counterattack here. This will be one of the last areas Ukraine will take back. Areas like Kherson and Izyum are far more practical and strategically important to Ukraine. So is Southern Ukraine and then Mariupol.  

By the time Severodonetsk is re-visited by Ukraine, the battle for the Donbas will already be over. Russias supply lines will be already cut. Ukraine will not pay the same price Russia is paying now to take it back.

The only rational explanation for this offensive by Russia is it is purely for reasons of internal politics and propaganda. So Russia can still print headlines about the Russian army being “on the attack” and being able to “push the Ukrainians back”. It’s sacrificing its troops so the public can be kept in a fantasy world where Russia isn’t failing.

It’s foolish, horrific, and needless.

Worse than that, it is politically counterproductive as the continued violence of these attacks is attracting the supply of even more powerful weapons to Ukraine.

I mean we have seen that Russian tanks are no match for modern ATGMs, of which Ukraine has plenty, the Russian air force is too aftaid to operate in contested air space, and Russian missile strikes, while harmful, are nowhere near plentiful enough to make a real difference.

But Russia has a truly incredible amount of artillery and virtually infinite shells once the get their logistics to work (which seems to be the case now in the East). So they just level entire towns with thousands of shells, the Ukrainians are forced to withdraw to save their asses, and the Russians move into the rubble uncontested.

Correct? So then HIMARS, if it can be provided to the front lines in time, can make a huge difference. While the Ukrainians won't be able to match Russians on raw firepower, they will have an advantage on range and precision. The Russians may have infinite shells, but they don't have infinite artillery systems.

From CNN's Stephanie Halasz

The leaders of Germany and France held a phone call with Vladimir Putin on Saturday, in which they pressed the Russian President to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and withdraw Russia's troops from the country, German officials said.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Putin for 80 minutes “on their initiative,” according to the German government's press office.

“The German chancellor and the French president urged an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops. They called on the Russian president to engage in serious direct negotiations with the Ukrainian president and to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict,” the German government news release said.

A statement from the French Presidential office, the Elysee Palace, said: ""Any solution to the war must be negotiated between Moscow and Kyiv.""

In the call, Macron and Scholz also called for the release of about 2,500 Azovstal defenders who have been taken as prisoners of war by Russian forces, the French readout said, in a reference to Ukrainian forces who were captured after defending the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol for weeks.

In addition, the two leaders urged Putin to lift the blockade of Odesa to allow the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea in order to avoid a world food crisis, according to the statement.",False,1653752139.0,t3_uzfb6c,t3_uzfb6c,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Defense Express has learned from our own sources that the enemy is launching the Caspian flotilla missile corvettes, with Caliber cruise missiles aboard.
Specifically, two missile corvettes Grad Sviyazhsk and Velikiy Ustyug of the 250th Division and can carry up to 16 Kalibr missiles, came out of the waters of Caspian Sea between May 23-24, 2022.
Russians has had 4 Kalibr cruise missile carriers in the Caspian Sea: the Dagestan patrol ship, 3 corvettes (Grad Sviyazhsk, Uglich, and Veliky Ustyug)—a total volley of possibly to 32 missiles.
These Rashists, of RF’s Caspian flotilla, now “insure"" their ""colleagues"" of the Black Sea Fleet. Presently, there are only two Kalibr ships in the Black Sea— frigates Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov. (The remaining missile ships are at bases, due to the storm.)
But just four days ago, the UA Intelligence reported that the sailors of the Caspian flotilla were afraid to go out to sea because their Command had stolen the funds intended for spare parts for their ships, and the sailors believed the corvettes were in an emergency-type situation because ships not sea-worthy.. The sailors went so far as to petition Shoigu and Putin directly. They received only reprimand and an order to go to https://defence-ua.com/army_and_war/rashisti_doplavalis_bojatsja_zapuskati_kalibri_z_avarijnih_korvetiv_u_kaspijskomu_mori-7483.html",False,1653782133.0,t3_uzfb6c,t3_uzfb6c,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

a19689edaf578a4117b3bc372b8517a2,uzfb6c,iaaasfp,"Right now the biggest problem is getting the fluttering hands brigade among Western leaders to realize Putin is bluffing about WWIII--he's deluded about many things but not about how suicidal trying to nuke us would be for him.

We have Western leaders like Macron who are eager to trade land that isn't French territory for peace (have you noticed how universal this trait is? How about Macron offering Corsica for peace?).

This is as much wishful thinking as Putin's have been,. But Putin still thinks he can win by  sheer ruthlessness, even though he's playing a weak hand economically, and his his, ramshackle military is not a dangerous joke.

The simple fact is that Ukraine is stuck with mostly holding tactics and hit and run insurgency until they get heavy weapons and the training to use them--from a week or two to train on our deadly 155mm howitzers to a year for an F-35 (more for an F-35B).

Note that giving the Ukrainians Western weapons is immensely beneficial to the West wholly apart from defending democracy against tyrants. We're seeing how our stuff works in real combat against one of our two main enemies. And potential buyers of our weaponry are seeing how much better is is than the stuff of our cheaper Russian competitors.

I bring this up especially for when you're discussion the war on Ukraine with those who fail to see how it benefits us.

Our artillery has a longer range than the Russians' and higher accuracy and lethality. Our missile systems have even longer range. They are critical to breaking the Russian blockade of the Black Sea, which is throttling the Ukrainian economy and causing starvation around the world.

I've heard President Biden and other leaders are worried about the Ukrainians using such missile systems to strike Russian territory, which Putin has described as a Red Line.

This is short sighted. If Putin attacks Ukraine with missiles and shells launched from sites in Russia, that's fair game. What's Putin going to do about it? Nuke us? That's preposterous. Like I said he isn't suicidal. What he is is a poker player. And we keep playing into his hands by all this hand wringing about what Putin is thinking, what's provoking Putin, ooh WWIII!

Let Putin worry about what we're thinking. And give Ukraine those fighters Poland wants to give them that Biden nixed. Seems like he was second-guessing Zelenskyy, believing that Russia had control of Ukrainian airspace, which it doesn't, and that the Russians would destroy the airfields the Ukrainians need for those fighters,.

But those Russian fighters are designed with reinforced landing gear and modified air intakes to let them take off and land from ordinary highways and even, sometimes, grassy fields.

So this looks like a situation where Western leaders are making incorrect assumptions based on what our fighters need (apart from the F-35B and maybe the A-10) and on getting fooled by Russian propaganda and Putin's gamesmanship.

Biden keeps doing the right thing weeks or months later than he should have. Negotiations are useless with both nonstate and state actors that have proven repeatedly that their ""word"" is worthless, and that they believe ""rules are for fools"".

Putin believe there is no such country as Ukraine, and that its current government and people are illegally occupying Russian territory. Any negotiated settlement will just enable him so rearm and relaunch his invasion--like he's already done between 2014 and now,

The belief in negotiations is wishful thinking by people who desperately want to avoid facing the hard fact that Ukraine faces a war of extermination against the country, the language, the culture, the people. Seeing what Russia has been doing everywhere it has occupied shows this. We looked the other way when Turkey tried to exterminate the Amernians. When Pol Pot killed Cambodia's middle class. When Rwandans tried to exterminate the Tutsis. What China is now doing to the Uighurs (including sterilizing Uighur women) and the Tibetans. These are all crimes against humanity, not the ""normal"" conquests our species is so fond of.

It also represents not a contest between autocracy and democracy, as Biden idealistically but wrongly believes, but a contest between international law and order--starting with respecting sovereign nations' boundaries--vs,. nations that believe might makes right, and the stronger nations should get to do whatever they please with their weaker neighbors

International law and order is vital to American prosperity. Isolationists harm America. ""America First"" really means ""America alone"" and powerful as we are, we still get by with a little help from our friends.

Here is the best article I've seen on how to deal with Putin, from Foreign Affairs magazine (not behind a paywall):

12f21e3813304238ae03417c8e427f43,uzfb6c,iabbq03,"Vacuum tube amplifiers were used in high power radars , EW and communication military gear. From linearity to bandwidth they have many advantages over solid state amplifiers in these applications. The biggest problems are they are very delicate , very big and are power inefficient.

Western militaries have moved from these at least 20 years ago excluding legacy platforms.

About 15 years ago , most western designs were solid state based SSPB/HPAs using GaAs or LDMOS  (eg iron dome gen 1 uses GaAs for their large kW amplifiers for their tracking radars) depending on what drawbacks and advantages of each had to be considered (eg LDMOS more linear but less efficient than GaAs) 

About 5-10 years ago (depending on what your industry had access to) most designs shifted to primarily GaN based amplifiers for the large output stages. The power density  and efficiency of these were just too appealing to ignore. Imagine designing an amplifier that is 10% the size of a TWTA or 50% the size of a GaAs based unit for a radar in the F35

Frequency, bandwidth and linearity problems plagued many early versions of these devices especially but for the most part they have been overcome now and are used in everything from the latest SATCOM systems to the new radars Raytheon is producing.

Russia only recently started to get access to some of this technology through purchases from companies like IAI but for the most don’t have the domestic ability to design, procure or manufacture any of these items effectively…even if they are EAR99. 

On top of that , many of their most talented engineers in this field were Ukrainian. A large brain of people that have the ability to do this left to greener pastures during the 90-00s and continues their work for western countries. Many of the younger and recent engineers don’t stay in Russia to do this. On top of that, the ability to design these things isn’t something you learn in a year or two. It takes at least a decade to become confident in making real contributions

The catalogue of parts they can also choose from is limited compared to what’s available to western defence vs US commercial programs vs Russia.  If I’m working on a defence program I can find a GaN MMIC that is already designed for the exact frequency bands I want with a lot of the functionality I want already built in  vs if it was a commercial program I’d have to design it all myself and take up significantly more space. Russia would be even worse and probably not even have access to this device.

The last thing is that these devices can be prohibitively expensive. A single FET might cost you $500 and you’ll need 128 of the for your radar. More likely the designer will reach for the MMIC  may cost $1000+.  Adding this to the cost of everything else you have amplifiers that will run into the 6 to 7 figure range.


TLDR : western militaries don’t use many TWTAs anymore and have shifted to solid state amplifiers 20 years ago. Russia’s capability to design and manufacture these is fairly limited due to limited access, knowledge, ability to manufacture and cost , especially the latest and greatest",1653761094.0,1653746870.0,t3_uzfb6c,t1_iaalee5,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

The troop concentration in Severodonetsk is insane. They have 80%+ of their forces there. So does Ukraine as far as their heavily armed units go (you can't really attack with foot infantry).

If Severodonetsk is encircled then it's a huge blow to Ukraine and it will free up that huge mass of troops to go slugfest somewhere else and steamroll once again.

Ukraine is pushing back individual BTG's that are forward deployed to give some breathing space for logistics (lesson they learned in the north). That's 200-300 people spread over some villages.

Why does this matter? You need a 3:1 advantage to attack the enemy and win.

A single BTG will have 1-3 artillery batteries attached to it, a tank company and 2-3 mechanized companies. That's a few dozen armored vehicles and 6-18 guns. They can shell a 300m x 300m area for a few minutes but they can't control a large area without spreading themselves too thin. You need a brigade (~3 battalions + artillery regiment) to push them back.

10+ BTG's will have a few HUNDRED armored vehicles and a few hundred guns. They're capable of shelling several kilometers worth of terrain for hours or even days. You'd need a division (~10 battalions and an artillery regiment or two) to win against that.

You can't stop that without heavy weapons. And Severodonetsk is currently de-facto cut off for any significant resupply of equipment and manpower and Ukraine is starting to run out of artillery and armor.

on top of that they have a large nuclear arsenal that they need to to kepp serviceable somehow

there are a few tricks that they can and do to update old technologies to keep them reasonably lethal, but given the inefficiencies in the system, clepto corruption, overal desidia and the short amount of available capital it is not possible to keep such large apparatus well oiled so they try to focus in their elite show offs, they manufacture and sell weapons and they need to woo their clients and if there is a business in this planet where corrupt practices are rife that's arms dealing

In all seriousness this raises a *lot* of questions in the context of the day's big news: harpoon missiles, and lots of them. Ukraine would need to open a safe passage for grain shipments if they plan to ship them out of Odesa, which they could protect with missiles instead of mines. But Russia could then try and mine the corridor so as to sabotage the effort and blame blowing up a ship on Ukraine. So maybe this is Russia getting out in front of what's going to happen anyway, to make it seem like they are being reasonable and not using grain shipments as economic warfare and instigating a global famine to get migrants to disrupt Europe again.

Remember Russia lies about everything, and is totally doing this. They would totally create a humanitarian disaster in Africa to put pressure on ""its enemies"". They are at war with the world in their eyes, and everyone not helping them directly is an enemy that deserves to be destroyed or a tool to use against their enemies. 

The idea clearly originates in Russia, and this hot take speculates actions by Germany and France and  their motivations. I personally see Germany and France not as undermining but as a foil pretending civility and diplomacy and being the adults in the room.

There's functionally two bridges across the Dnieper river around the fighting. If the Russians were to blow those bridges, it would somewhat simplify things because the Dnieper is freaking WIDE at that point, so setting up a pontoon bridge would be even riskier than normal (it would be such a long construction project, on the scale of warfare anyway, that I highly doubt Ukraine's army could get it done before coming under significant fire). If the Russians DON'T blow the bridges, things get complicated. They definitely have the ability to take out the bridges through cruise missile attacks, so there's a very real risk that if Ukraine crosses the Dnieper, they might get cut off.

My guess is that Russia will blow the bridges and attempt to utilize the natural barrier of the Dnieper to their advantage.

The Russians still attacking in the East is suicide.

From a strategic point of view, the extra 15km of land that Russia will gain from taking their current objectives is not even close to the value of troops and equipment it is losing in this fight.

The only result that can come from this fight is a hastening of Russias demise.

Keep in mind the Ukraine will not counterattack here. This will be one of the last areas Ukraine will take back. Areas like Kherson and Izyum are far more practical and strategically important.

By the time Severodonetsk is re-visited by Ukraine, the battle for the Donbas will already be over. 

The only rational explanation for this offensive by Russia is it is purely for reasons of internal politics and propaganda. So Russia can still print headlines about the Russian army being “on the attack” and being able to “push the Ukrainians back”.

It’s horrific and needless.

They are gathering up the last of their offensive strength for a frontal assault on an urban center that they do not have encircled.

This is essentially the mistake the Germans made attacking Stalingrad in WWII. They gathered up the strength of their army and forced it into a meatgrinder. By doing so they managed to capture most of the city but in doing so they 1. Took too long and 2. lost too much of their offensive capability in the attempt to take the urban fortress.

This resulted in the Nazis neglecting other parts of their front line and the Soviets mounting a counterattack which then destroyed the entirety of the German sixth army.

Not suggesting that something so disastrous is likely to happen to the Russians or even trying to push forward the narrative that ""Ukraine actually has them where they want them"" because the Ukrainians are obviously in a very perilous position here.

I'm just pointing out that as much as the Ukrainians are in a perilous position...so are the Russians. The political nature of their need to succeed in SOME way in the Donbas has essentially forced them to 1. attempt to close the encirclement around the city in a way that would result in them having Ukrainians in front of them AND behind them and 2. attempting to storm a city that they have not yet enveloped and can only attack from a few predictable directions.

What the Russians are *hoping to gain* is strategically irrelevant. Say they take Severodonetsk. Okay? The Ukrainians simply fall back to the next city and the whole bloody process starts over again. The Russians are forced into a position where they are trading the strength of their army for a single win. A battle they MAY win that could ultimately lose them the war.

Ukrainian command knows this which is why despite the risk of the men defending Severodonetsk being encircled they have chosen to stay and fight instead of pulling out of the city. All they've got to do is hold a road to the city open and they'll grind the Russians down by a thousand cuts until the Ukrainian reserves which they've been mobilizing for months can land a decisive blow somewhere else along the line where the Russians have more lightly defended out of the desire and political need to succeed in Donbas.

Unfortunately, there has been a fertile ground for the intersection of pro-russian-nationalist (tankie) narratives, and socialist narratives, since the 1960's or 1970's (if you ignore Stalin's/Russia's genocides). 

And a lot of people in this head-space unfortunately fall for it. They either accept the hypocrisy, lack nuanced thinking, or let their emotions blind them to the cognitive dissonance.  

I think there's at least two mass-shooters who have manifestos or backgrounds showing that they support or used to support Bernie Sanders - even though these guys were both clearly white-supremacists - a position that would be diametrically opposed to anything Bernie himself believes in or promotes.  Either they were lying, or they were telling a very confused truth. But in either case, they're fertile ground for being exploited by russian propagandists in this way.  Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with democratic socialism. It just means that russians are very good at promoting disinformation, and exploiting conflicting narratives to achieve their political aims.

Russia will keep attacking until it runs out of resources. The only way this ends without substantial destruction is Russian exhaustion. The alternatives are far worse to consider, escalation into a Russia - NATO war is the other end scenario.

The resource it will run out of first is tanks and IFVs.

The best way to destroy them is in bulk, on railcars. It's fast, it's efficient, and it minimises human casualties on both sides.

ATGMs are great. Artillery strikes on vehicles in the field are great, but you're cutting one head off the Hydra doing that, locating and eliminating assets one by one. Pretty soon you're tying up huge quantities of your SIGINT and ELINT capabilities in tracking individual vehicles at a localised level. That's something Ukraine is contending with right now in Sievierodonetsk.

The trains are easy to spot and hard to hide, so hitting them is a much less intelligence intensive task. It also means a single fire mission can immobilse if not eliminate dozens of vehicles in a single hit - if you derail a freight train at full throttle in the right place, its cargo will be physically smashed to oblivion.

Washington did not promise unlimited support. The Budapest Memorandum contains security “assurances,” not “guarantees.” Guarantees would have implied a commitment of American military force, which NATO members have. U.S. officials made clear that was not on offer. Hence, assurances.”

If Ukraine starts to break it’s agreements it loses in the eyes of the west. It must continue to try and maintain its integrity so that it continues to get support.

There is no need for Macron or Scholz to go to Kyiv for that. Btw the French embassy (don't know about the German one) was one of the first to resume functioning in Kyiv, way before the American one for example, what does it tell you ?
