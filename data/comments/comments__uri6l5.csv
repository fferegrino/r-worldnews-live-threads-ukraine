From CNN's Tim Lister, Oleksandra Ochman and Katharina Krebs

Negotiations with Russia on resolving the conflict have been suspended, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

It was because ""Russia is still in its stereotypical mindset,"" he said on Ukrainian television Tuesday, adding that Russia doesn't realize that the war ""is no longer going on according to the rules, their plans, and schedule.""

Since the two delegations met in Istanbul, ""there's no significant changes, no progress,"" he said. ""The resistance of Ukraine, the professional resistance just grows, that’s why there’s no way Russia achieves its goals.""

Podolyak also rejected any territorial concessions.

""The war will not end if we give some of our territories there. This is not acceptable for Ukraine, and it will not be accepted by Ukrainian society. Minsk-2 could be signed by another president. President Zelensky will not sign it. Because any Minsk-2 is a postponement of the war, even more destructive, for example, in a year or two,"" he said.

Minsk-2 would have accorded significant autonomy to the territory in the east that has been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.

Meanwhile, Russian state news agency reported Tuesday that Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko confirmed negotiations are not happening, but he reportedly said it's because Kyiv withdrew from the process.

Kyiv did not provide a response to the draft treaty proposed by Russia, Rudenko added.

Day 83 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Well, I guess the streak of quiet days is over. Just around 2 hours ago we heard a loud explosion, which we didn’t understand what it was at the time, but it was very loud, and a lot of people heard it. At first people thought it was nothing, but soon it was reported that a fire started after that explosion, so it was either shelling from an MLRS or a cruise missile, as there was just a single explosion and nothing else.

Because we are already used to our artillery being very loud, we thought that this was just our artillery doing its job, but it actually turned out to be shelling. Actually a major downside of getting used to being shelled is that it seriously dulls your sense of danger, and you might not even pay any attention to it after some time, which is very dangerous, you never know where next shell/rocket will land.
 
Today we read some more of Russian social media, Odnoklassniki this time, where my mom still has around 1300 people on her friends list from over 10 years ago, and it was horrible. Russia is a literal cult of war; almost every photo in the feed is someone wearing military uniform and holding either Russian or USSR flag. All the kids are also wearing military uniforms, this is just insanity.

The funny thing is that my family, who lived in the USSR says that it wasn’t like this back then, basically nobody had this weird obsession with military, but now it seems like they can’t live without it, parading their kids in costumes of tanks and planes. 

~~There was even a photo from an event where people were decorating strollers in military theme, some were in camo, some looking like tanks, and then there was one stroller that was very different from others. It was solid white in color with a red cross on it and a *big 200* written on it. They wrote fucking **cargo 200** on their kid’s stroller. What the fuck even is this, are they predicting the future?~~ After looking a bit more into it, it was actually photoshopped, and it wasn't 200 written on it, but 03. Still militarizing strollers is pretty fucked up, teaching your kids about war since their birth.  

And then those same people are telling us that it’s us who are brainwashed to hate them and that actually nobody is shelling us, and even if they do, it’s not Russians who are doing that, but our “Nazis” because apparently they have nothing better to do than shell their own cities.",1652835597.0,1652833968.0,t3_uri6l5,t3_uri6l5,,0,121,0,121,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

From CNN's Jennifer Hansler

The US State Department on Tuesday announced the launch of a new program “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”

The program, called the Conflict Observatory, “encompasses the documentation, verification, and dissemination of open-source evidence regarding the actions of Russia’s forces during President Putin’s brutal war of choice,” according to a media note from the State Department.

“The Conflict Observatory will analyze and preserve publicly and commercially available information, including satellite imagery and information shared via social media, consistent with international legal standards, for use in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms,” the note said. “This includes maintaining rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions.”

The information will be shared publicly via an online platform, the statement added.

The State Department said the program is a collaboration with “Esri, a leading geographic information systems company, Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai,” and the “the U.S. government has also contributed commercial satellite imagery to these efforts.”

The State Department said it expects international partner organizations to join the program. Reports will be available at ConflictObservatory.org website.",False,1652841298.0,t3_uri6l5,t3_uri6l5,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

> Russian military propagandists say a ban on photography/filming is one of the conditions of Azovstal surrender. The Russians observed it yesterday, except for one short video of a wounded soldier. They made a propaganda coup out of Azovmash surrender last month.

> Russian sources claim the Ukrainians now hold around 600 Russian POWs vs a couple of thousand Ukrainian POWs held by the Russians even before the expected full Azovstal surrender, so one to one exchange won’t help Azovstal defenders much.

> Given the number of the wounded cited by the Ukrainian side is around 600, it will take all of the remaining Azovstal defenders to carry them out, assuming most of them can’t walk by themselves.

And from today:

> Russian propaganda has un-embargoed videos of Azovstal POWs, so now there is plenty on TG channels. They typically show four able-bodied soldiers carrying one wounded on a stretcher, which explains the ratio - 51 sent to hospital vs 200+ moved to a POW camp after surrender.

> In any case, the consensus on the Russian pro-war side seems to be that, unlike regular Ukrainian soldiers, members of Azov regiment should stand trial “under DNR laws” which envisage capital punishment (unlike Russian laws). To be sold to public as “denazification”.

In a statement, the company said negotiations over a long-term gas contract with Gazprom were now in dispute, and it would now take Gazprom to arbitration.

Gasum said it had been in contract discussions with Gazprom since last year, but in April Gazprom sent a letter saying it required payments in rubles.

Gasum said it ""does not accept Gazprom Export's requirement to switch to ruble payments and will consequently not make payments in rubles or under Gazprom Export’s proposed payment arrangement.

In addition, the companies are in significant dispute concerning other claims submitted under the contract.

""Overall, this is something that Gasum cannot accept and has decided to take the disputes regarding the supply contract to arbitration based on arbitration in the contract.

""The matter will be considered in arbitration.""

Gasum warned that would lead to an increased risk of its natural gas supplies from Russia being halted. The company said it has been preparing for this situation with its customers and the government.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in March that ""unfriendly"" nations would have to pay rubles, rather than the euros or dollars stated in contracts.

Buyers could make euro or dollar payments into an account at Russia's Gazprombank, which would then convert the funds into rubles and transfer them to a second account from which the payment to Russia would be made.

Gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria were cut off after they refused to pay in rubles and other big European gas companies have told CNN they are working on ways to pay for Russian gas, while not breaking EU sanctions.

Oleh Syniehubov told Ukrainian television Tuesday that fighting was underway northeast of Ukraine's second-largest city, toward the town of Vovchansk, along the Russia-Ukraine border.

The town has become a resupply route for Russian forces as they try to sustain their offensive into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions further south. Disrupting that supply line could compromise the Russians' ability to reinforce their offensive towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.

""Active hostilities are taking place in settlements north of the region,"" Syniehubov said. ""The enemy is focused on holding positions. Our troops have to repel (them on) every inch of our territory.""

Syniebuhov added that Ukrainian advances had helped reduce — but not eliminate — Russian artillery attacks on Kharkiv. There had been ""relative silence for the last two weeks,"" Syniebuhov said. ""However, the enemy sometimes hits with artillery strikes.""

There were strikes in the Saltivka and Shevchenkivskyi districts close to Kharkiv on Monday, Syniebuhov added.

""Two people were killed and nine were injured in the past 24 hours,"" he said.

Syniebuhov said Russian shelling of other parts of the Kharkiv region continued.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,uri6l5,i8yjofu,"In rare public criticism of the conduct of Russia's military operations in Ukraine, a former senior Russian officer has warned on state television that the situation will get worse.

""Let's not drink 'information tranquilizers,' because sometimes information is spread about some moral or psychological breakdown of Ukraine's armed forces, as if they are nearing a crisis of morale or a fracture,"" retired Col. Mikhail Khodarenok said on Monday’s edition of Rossiya One’s 60 Minutes show. ""None of this is close to reality.""

Despite pushback from the show’s presenter, Khodarenok said that Ukraine could arm one million people. 

""Considering that European aid will come into full effect and one million armed Ukrainian soldiers can join the fight, we need to see this reality of the near future, and we need to consider that in our operational and strategic calculations. The situation for us will frankly get worse,"" he said.

Khodarenok, a regular commentator in Russian media, also commented on Russia's broader isolation.

""Let's look at this situation as a whole from our overall strategic position,"" he said. ""Let’s not swing missiles in Finland's direction – this just looks ridiculous. The biggest problem with our military and political situation is that we are in total geopolitical isolation. And the whole world is against us — even if we don’t want to admit it.""

Khodarenok warned before the invasion started that it would be more difficult than many anticipated to wage war in Ukraine.

In an article in February, he said, ""the degree of hatred (which, as you know, is the most effective fuel for armed struggle) in the neighboring republic towards Moscow is frankly underestimated. No one will meet the Russian army with bread, salt and flowers in Ukraine.""

Expert claims that Russian forces will defeat Ukraine in a short period of time ""have no serious grounds,"" he had said.

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow and met with their government officials.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

From CNN's Angus Watson

Human Rights Watch says it has documented a litany of alleged crimes against civilians in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions of northern Ukraine.

A HRW team visiting the area in April and May said it “investigated 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances, and seven cases of torture,” according to a report released Wednesday.

The alleged crimes are believed to have been carried out in February and March by Russian troops as they controlled much of the area. 

HRW said it had interviewed 65 people between April 10 and May 10, including the families of victims and people who said they had been detained and tortured by Russian troops.

The group said it has compiled physical evidence further implicating Russian troops in “numerous violations of the laws of war that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.”

Among testimonies collected by HRW was that of 66-year-old Anastasia Andriivna from the Kyiv region, who said she found her adult son’s body in a barn after he was apparently executed.

“He was lying there in a fetal position, with his hands tucked under his head, and his jacket draped over his shoulders,” Andriivna told HRW.

The organization also reported testimony from villagers who said they were among 350 people kept for 28 days in a cramped and squalid basement in Yahidne, near Chernihiv. Other villagers there were killed by Russian troops, HRW said.

HRW's Europe and Central Asia director Giorgi Gogia called the alleged Russian atrocities “abhorrent, unlawful and cruel.”

These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted,” Gogia said.",False,1652857741.0,t3_uri6l5,t3_uri6l5,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

This could make the case for NATO to say that they are going to enforce the free passage of cargo ships to Odesa and maybe other ports to transport Ukrainian wheat with the goal of avoiding a massive humanitarian crisis.

I have no idea if this would have less potential for direct conflict between NATO and Russia than a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Could NATO enforce this without having to attack Russian facilities first?  I'm sure if Russian naval vessels decided to go after the cargo ships then the conflict would escalate quickly, but I would also assume that it would result in the quick destruction of whatever assets were used in the attack.  Maybe Russia would rather just let the cargo vessels pass rather than have their Black Sea fleet eliminated.

I had this thought (and no, I don't belong to any ""It's just a feint"" copium group): Is it possible that Russia has decided on ultimately giving up its gains west of the Oskil river, and Ukraine has essentially given up on holding east of the river?

Someone one the Russian side might have decided that with uncontested Kharkiv in its flank, holding out at the Izyum bridgehead is going to be difficult anyway, but clearing out everything east of the Oskil river is not threatened by that. Likewise Ukraine might have decided that holding Lyman is ultimately untenable, but removing the Izyum pincer is of the utmost importance. 

That would explain why both sides seem to have successful offensives going on so close to each other. Ukraine is fighting a delaying action at Lyman but have already given up on it, and Russia might be doing the same at Vovchansk/Kupyansk direction. I.e. since the Izyum pincer and Kharkiv offensives have failed for Russia, all the occupied territory west of the Oskil river is of no value anymore *except* as trading chips to keep Ukraine busy while Russia digests everything east of the Oskil.

Presently, conditions in Russia are created that all but ensure another strongman, because not only will be a fledgling democracy too fragile and untrustworthy to survive, it's also not going to be able to act quickly enough to change Russians' living conditions, especially if reddit's wishes for sanctions to remain in place unchanged for decades are acted upon.

Then, of course, a replay of the 90s happens when democracy dies in poverty and filth, and then of course we all can go like 'seeee? They're all corrupt and rotten, they don't want democracy, so fuck them.'

And then 30 years later we can all pull a shocked pikachu face again as if we didn't know what was coming.

I don't know what a better course of action would be, I'm no specialist, but I do share a border with Russia so I've had the ""privilege"" of knowing that country's history and playbook. And frankly if reddit had its way, they'd cut off a man's legs and tell him to run, then, when a legless man can't run, they say 'see? He doesn't want to run. So let him die right here of exposure, he doesn't want to save himself.'

And as satisfying it would be emotionally to be able to watch that scenario play out with the man replaced by a country, it also means that we forfeit any right to be shocked and surprised when the legless man doesn't die, learns to walk on its hands, and cuts your hamstrings one day.

1. Argentina, 1982. New government wanted back some islands from the British and screwed it up every which way. The sinking of the *Belgrano* was surprisingly like the loss of the *Moskva* except even more inept, the British were trying *not* to sink it, just disable it, but Argentina's sailors were so chaotically trained their damage control sucked and the ship sunk with almost all hands.

2. USSR, invasion of Afghanistan, 1979. Everything that could go wrong, did. Lack of clear objectives or exit strategy.

3. USSR, Winter War, 1940. A numerically and materially superior Soviet army got absolutely destroyed by a relative handful of Finns.

4. Imperial Russia, 1914-1917. Their appalling handling of the Eastern Front in WW1 literally catalysed the Bolshevik Revolution. The losses were so high and the military asked to do such silly things that they revolted and pledged allegiance to the revolution that they were ordered to suppress.

5. Imperial Russia, 1905. Their navy lost spectacularly against a much weaker Japanese force despite starting with advantage and some factor of surprise. They lost their flagship and a ton of other vessels for zero gain. Also the highlight (or lowlight) of the career of the *Kamchatka*, possibly the worst ship to ever sail. *Do you see Japanese Torpedo Boats?* - Kamchatka, in the English Channel, on the way to Japan.

fb0f41aee122aa3bd23b7d61b09b5b77,uri6l5,i90b5yr,"This is mainly about Crimea.

Throughout history, Crimea has been owned by many different empires, including the Swedes, then the Russian Empire.  Since that time, Russia has wanted/needed to maintain access to Sevastopol as their main warm-water port, to give them access to the mediteranian via the Bosporus. This was very important, historically. Then the Turks took over Constantinople and re-named it Istanbul. 

During the Russian Revolution, around 1917-1921. Crimea entered the USSR (declared by the Russians who dominated the USSR), as an independent autonomous Soviet state.  Crimea had been one of the last holdout areas, when the Reds took over. 

During the 1930's,  Russia (under the guise of their political domination of the USSR) starved (to death) and deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and Crimean Tartars to Siberia. Then Russia resettled these areas with Russians.  So you can imagine: pro-Russia sentiment was NOT strong in these two areas.

1942-1944; the Germans had it.
During this time period, the Nazis had some collaborator allies (of which, was a Ukrainian Nationalist named Banderas - so you hear about him, because some Azov Battalion ppl still idolize him, though they're not explicitly pro-Nazi like the Russians say.  You can imagine the butthurt Russians feel over this.  OF COURSE people you starved and genocided are going to side with the next conqueror who comes along to 'liberate' them. But if you think that an ethnically diverse group like the population of Crimea is totally down with the Nazi Aryan ethnostate idea, I sure as fuck don't know what you're smoking).

1946: the Russians again, declared Crimea independent, but as an Oblast, not a state. Then they deported hundreds of thousands more Crimean Tartars (""because they collaborated with the Nazis"" - - which they didn't but that doesn't matter. Sound familiar?)

In 1954; Crimea was handed over to Ukrainian Control (since Ukraine was an independent Soviet Socialist Republic).

In 1991, Ukraine declared independence from the USSR. Russia bitched and moaned about losing Sevastopol, so Ukraine promised to keep leasing it to Russia.

In 1997, Ukraine passed a measure that put an expiration date on the lease. Russia was supposed to pack up their shit and go by 2017. (this was after a shit ton of Russia not paying their fees, and also pulling all kinds of economic bullying bullshit to try to prevent Ukraine from becoming more of a regional power, due to the port-access they enjoyed). 

This is why Russian Nationalists like Putin went ape-shit.  They thought they could simply control Ukraine through political fraud and economic bullying, and Ukraine fought back. 

So then Russia's puppet, Yanukovych, in 2010, changed this measure, to extend it out to 2042; but rather functionally indefinite.

So then Euromaiden happened, to kick out Yanukovych, and reverse his changes to the measure (among a shit ton of other things). In 2014. Then Russia occupied Crimea. Then they built a multibillion dollar bridge to the Russian mainland over the Kerch Straits. 

So in response, Ukraine cut off Crimea's water supply.  

Then Russia, instead of constructing their own water supply, and piping it in via the bridge (or by ship), decided to invade and take all of Eastern Ukraine, so they could control the freshwater access to Crimea. 

So this is really all about Crimea. 100%.  

And Crimea is going to be VERY difficult for Ukraine to get back.

First of all; Ukraine's gotta take back all the land that connects it to Russia. 

Next; Ukraine's going to need to disable Russia's black sea navy.

Finally, Ukraine will have to blow up the bridge, and invite the hundreds of thousands of Russians who have moved there since 2014, to kindly leave via a land route. 

Moving forward, it's pretty obvious that Ukraine can not allow Russia to have Crimea, because it's too easy for Russia to invade from there.

Russia probably could have cut a deal with post-2014 Ukraine, for continued access to Stevastopol.  But apparently Putin would rather have gone THIS route.",False,1652829550.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i8zui11,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

He said that the invasion would have never happened under his watch (which of course is bullshit). Republicans have also blamed the invasion on Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal, suggesting that Russia only invaded after US showed ""weakness"" by withdrawing from Afghanistan (ignoring, of course, that Trump negotiated the withdrawal). 

A prior talking point was that Obama was soft on Russia, and that not arming Ukraine directly led to the annexation of Crimea, so historically there has been Republican support for the arming of Ukraine.

Trump sold missiles to Ukraine in 2017, but they were delivered a year later and never deployed, kept boxed to serve as a ""deterrent"". He then froze $400M in security assistance and attempted to extort information on Biden in exchange for more missiles. 

So..in general, Trump has ~~directly~~ provided support to Ukraine, but very minimally and in a very transactional way. He's certainly a Putin apologist and wouldn't take as aggressive a stance as Biden has. There is precedent for both support and isolation. 

Best case scenario? He deflects and delays, providing minimal support to Ukraine in order to get something in return and/or to appease Putin and appear isolationist. Ukraine suffers and they are less capable at defending against Russia. That doesn't mean a Russian victory, but it certainly means more success.

Worst case scenario? He orders direct military intervention and starts WW3. If this doesn't happen because of NATO, he withdraws from NATO, and then all bets are off, even if there is no military involvement in the war. The US leaving NATO would be enough for Russia to extend the war into new countries.",1652800788.0,1652797586.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i8y24pa,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Similarly, the US teams that specialize in these kind of missions have aircraft specially modified for them and they tend to receive 3-4 times as many flight hours in a year as a standard pilot.

Circumstances are a.bit different.  The population density on the front is much lower than it was in 1917.  That speaks for opening up into fluid warfare.  The Eastern front moved quickly in WW1.

44e116d18b785a52dd3c04bb430377f1,uri6l5,i8yudjn,"> One of the most fervent supporters of the Davy Crockett was West Germany's defense minister Franz Josef Strauss, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Strauss promoted the idea of equipping German brigades with the nuclear weapon, to be supplied by the US, arguing that this would allow German troops to become a much more effective factor in NATO's defense of Germany against a potential Soviet invasion. He argued that a single Davy Crockett could replace 40–50 salvos of a whole divisional artillery park – allowing the funds and troops normally needed for this artillery to be invested into further troops, or not having to be spent at all. US NATO commanders strongly opposed Strauss's ideas, as they would have made the use of tactical nuclear weapons almost mandatory in case of war, further reducing the ability of NATO to defend itself without resorting to atomic weapons.

The area around Kherson seems to be a lower priority right now for the UA; the Russians have been digging in there for several weeks and it will probably take redeployment of forces for the Ukrainians to make significant progress there.  

As the UA are cleaning up around Kharkiv they will most likely send troops east from there to try to pocket and destroy the Russian forces in Izyum.  It will be interesting to see which units they dedicate to that operation as they should probably also send some south to reinforce the defensive line of the 24th and 25th brigades, which are both falling back a bit, most likely due to taking sustained losses from the battles around Propansa and Donetesk.  The Russians have captured Propansa and seem to have broken through the defensive lines that were prepared North of the town, but lack the troops to make rapid progress in that area.

This war was fought between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history. Paraguay sustained large casualties, but even the approximate numbers are disputed.

They lionized a Ukrainian Nationalist (Banderas) who briefly sided with the Nazis during WWII (until they asked him to participate in a genocide).

First of all: Stalin also sided with the Nazis.

Second of all: You think the USSR was popular in the 1940's?  Russia just got done with their first round of genocide against Ukraine.  Shouldn't surprise anyone that there were people in Ukraine who fucking hated Russia, and wanted out of the USSR, even if their liberators were objectively worse.

Finally: in retrospect, Ukraine taking this formerly private militia of fairly rightwing Ukrainian Nationalists fighters into the formal Ukrainian Military as the Azov Battalion was probably a good move - in that Ukraine wanted to be able to leverage a seasoned fighting force that had already fought a battle for Mariupol (in 2014), and also to bring them under some kind of regulated control to clamp down on the neonazi stuff. But maybe Ukraine should have been a bit more high-profile with how they were handling the ""bad eggs"" in Azov (some were kicked out).  Maybe investigate whether any of them committed any crimes while defending Mariupol back in 2014 (as Russian agitprop alleges).  The west SHOULD be squeamish about supporting a group with such a checkered past (even though, in this current conflict, they have conducted themselves with honor, bravery, and extreme mettle). It's never an easy call to say exactly how far one should go to counter POSSIBLE future propaganda disguised as criticism (valid or otherwise).",1652837025.0,1652836735.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i90mt58,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

""In information warfare you will sometimes release products designed to be of bad quality in order to focus your targets attention towards that product and create a false subconscious association to what your information warfare material looks like. After this you can continue a trickle of very low effort information warfare products while also injecting very high level products which are much harder to identify. 

One example of this would be releasing obviously staged videos from the front where many details reveal it to be a staged with the goal of building the narrative that they are bad at creating staged videos and then later releasing very expertly made fake videos which no one will be able to tell are fake. 

Within the context of Reddit everyone knows there must be large information warfare operations targeting all social media platform including reddit so if reddit has not identified any that only increases people defense levels and suspicion against posters but if reddit has thwarted several instances people feel more relaxed and are easier targets for misinformation.

Mass mobilisation doesn't fix any of the systemic problems afflicting Russian forces.

It doesn't improve morale; everyone will get the same dose of dedovshchina all the other conscripts get. It doesn't transform the Russian NCO corps into better leaders, planners, and trainers, or give them the kind of institutional knowledge that only comes from long service. It doesn't make their skilled trades any smarter or more efficient.

Mobilisation doesn't fix their C4ISR issues. The top brass don't have good situational awareness, and Ukraine is constantly exploiting opportunities inside the Russians' OODA loop. Some Russian forces are using unencrypted civil radios because their secure battlefield comms system is actually dependent on the enemy having functioning civil cell phone network.

It doesn't pour billions of dollars back into poorly-maintained Russian vehicles, aircraft and weapon systems that lack adequate parts and supplies. It may give them some more maintainers, but mechanics still need parts to fix things.

More bodies in uniform doesn't make Russian ground forces' railhead-dependent logistics footprint any less railroad-dependent; having to supply even greater numbers of personnel through the same limited  railroad infrastructure is only going to exacerbate their supply issues.

It doesn't improve their weapon/ammunition/supplies/parts production, and doesn't fix sanctions which are presently crippling all of those.

If your country is losing so hard that you need to mobilize to defend Crimea, it isn't going to instill a lot of confidence, especially in the big urban centers where the general mood is apprehensive and concerned. 

Whatever happens, and whatever side of the argument a Russian falls on, the fact is that very few would like to be conscripted, even Putin supporters. In my experience a lot of Putin supporters are fine with whatever he does as long as it doesnt affect them. The more it does affect them, the less support he will have.

They were always downvoted and shut down almost immediately though. I was always like ""is this seriously what you think that liberals actually think?"" Apparently it was.

It is true that capital controls and monetary policy are propping up the ruble's value—but far from being in Russia's favour, this inflated ruble value results in conversion to *far fewer rubles* than would otherwise be the case!

But actually, the rate of exchange is irrelevant, because the requirement is to transfer *the contracted euro/dollar amount* into the nominated account and then convert to rubles.  Hence the same amount of euros/dollars are transferred either way.  It's *economically irrelevant* at what exchange rate those euros/dollars are converted to rubles: it has the same foreign exchange impact either way.

The suggestion (which I've read here) that customers performing the conversion somehow has a different impact on the currency to the same conversion being performed by suppliers is completely economically illiterate.",False,1652818494.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i8zkmke,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

It is hard to see the moving parts in this point so it's easy to just read 'storage makes renewables not viable'.  


Thorium reactors are theoretically wonderful - but they're not there yet.  Best bet for energy indepencence is to invest in storage technology, and people are. 

You need to read up on the path we're on.  Solar (and wind, but mostly solar) is being installed at such a signficant pace and efficiencies improving so quickly that even if Thorium reactors were actually more than just schematic plans on a computer, by the time the reactor(s) would be up and running with reactors that are real functioning units not just prototypes you could have used all those billions and installed 2x the electricity generation for half the cost of what those reactores are going to put out.  

With the pace and speed of Storage improvements on the highly-predictable technology adoption and cost curves the Storage is becoming a massive thing too. 

THe Storage is coming.  It's definitely the ares needing the most advancements but a funny thing happens about that - people will find ways.   Renewables bring the cost of generating electricity down to almost nil, the cost of maintenance of the facilities down to almost nil, and so what you have left is the Storage puzzle. 


If ""renewable generation and maintenance + storage costs for the dark and not-windy days < costs of current electricity and any future production from other means"" then it'll happen.  And it is happening. 
  
And interestingly one of the most interesting grid-level storage areas to look at is molten-salt batteries.  The issue isn't really cost anymore it's figuring out scale and in fact it's also getting governments to approve the installation of these projects.  

What I'm saying is, the days of high-priced and decades-to-build projects where (many of them...) that have inherrent dangers involved just doesn't make sense over 'cranking up renewables' because over the time it takes to build the reactors the production levels and costs will be surpassed by renewable tech. 

You're discounting or dismissing the storage discussion which is the area that needs advancemnt but also the area advancing the quickest.

Do you think they would have surrendered if they didn't have some guarantees that will not happen? It's not like the Ukraine's high command could do something to force those soldiers to surrender. If it happened, it means they agreed to it.

However, we know too little about what is going on to draw conclusions already. Both parts seem to agree to make an effort to keep this whole thing quiet. Which is encouraging in itself because it means they are holding on to a deal, at least for now. We don't know what the deal is but given what is visible, it is unlikely to be a simple surrender. It's definitely something else and people who know more are sending signals of optimism, even if they are bound to not say more.

And to answer the question in your first comment: Russians could very easily sell this deal domestically as a way to bring Russian soldiers back home. I know Putin doesn't give a shit about his soldiers, but as a PR action, you can never go wrong with a justification like this.

3) No countries joining NATO would change the outcome of the war. The war would go nuclear in all likelihood, so non-nuclear states barely matter. Even if it didn’t go nuclear, the advantage is so stacked on NATO’s side little would change. 

If nuclear weapons didn’t exist NATO expansion could be risky because possibly in some imaginary world NATO would push for regime change in Russia under the Iraqi model. However, MAD makes this an impossibility.

The thing is, what would happen if gas and oil imports went down? Probably nothing would change regarding the war. Also the less is imported, the higher the revenue/unit for Putin might be. So it might be best to say to Putin: We either pay half the price as long the war is going on or we stop imports altogether.

One, a saturation attack means treating drones as munitions, which drives their price down by economies of scale.

Two, the roof of an armored vehicle is very thin, a few inches of steel for a tank.  For a BMP or such, it's much less.  That's pretty easy to pierce, a 12.7 can punch through that.

Three, the AI can be distributed, or it can be controlled by something else.  In distribution, well, AI software is expensive but the computers to run something like this is cheap, and the general networking ability to do it isn't unheard of--missile networking for redundancy is common now, like how the Granit missile does it (and that came out in the 80s).  Jam-resistance is also common, using local sensor nets & such.  You can navigate inertially towards the target area, fire up a frequency-hopping net with dirt-cheap gear, and go.

Finally even if the drone itself can't destroy a hard target, it can tell something else to kill it.  Or it can kill something more valuable.  Even COTS microdrones have a *terrifying* potential to be used for political violence.  Thankfully, Western militaries are getting better at defending against at least the basic threats, and the US Army is adding ballistic computers to their rifles which might have an anti-drone capability (I believe France also has something similar).",False,1652802654.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i8y3uzb,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Take fishing, for example.  In-shore fishing has generally suffered, since most of the stuff they catch doesn't have quotas anyway and now they struggle to bring it to market on time with additional border checks and paperwork.

Fish farming has barely seen a difference at all since they offer a premium product with well-established markets, and it is largely processed domestically so doesn't have the same delivery time pressures to worry about.

The sector of fishermen that were most vocal in favour of Brexit were the deep-sea and pelagic fleets, the ones that have to deal with EU quotas.  They have seen some benefits (especially in terms of low-value, bulk stuff they are allowed to catch for a mostly domestic market) and some drawbacks (they still have to deal with very tight delivery times which aren't helped by extra border checks and paperwork) so far.  

They are still the ones that shout the loudest, and it's probably fair to say that things haven't quite worked out as well as they hoped.  I think they saw themselves more as 'hunters' than 'farmers', in that they were more focused on how they could catch more fish rather than how they were going to bring their product to market.

The thing is, you mentioned emotions, this is the kind of thing that elicits an emotional response in a population and in a government, the kind of thing that can be a flashpoint especially if the rest of the cards in play are in your favour.

You mention nukes - there's a very simple reason Putin likely won't use a tactical nuke in Ukraine. Not that he won't, he's seemingly more madman than just madman theory, but nuclear weapon use by an aggressor and war instigator is, well, unprecedented, arguably. Certainly it would not be anything like the scenario that led to Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

The *only* option if Putin nukes Ukraine is for the other nuclear powers of the world to respond, either in kind or with a massive conventional response. Think NFZ over Ukraine plus driving all Russian forces out of Ukraine, plus destruction of the Black Sea Fleet, NATO liberation of Crimea and likely also NATO interdiction in Russian interests around the world, e.g. toppling of the Assad regime by Turkey with NATO's blessing.

Otherwise, Putin sets a precedent that nuclear powers can operate with impunity and use nuclear weapons on the battlefield with impunity. That would be hugely destabilising as North Korea, India, and Pakistan all have reason to use them tactically to break stalemates. Other nations like Iran and Brazil would seek to participate in rapid nuclear proliferation. Everything we'd worked for through the Cold War would be for nothing.

He wants to stay in power. If losing in Ukraine puts him at risk for losing power then what does he have to lose if he launches a nuke. Tell me about any person like him in history who left office and had a good life. You can’t say Gorbachev. He didn’t rule like Putin does. Someone like Putin. They don’t leave office. 

So either he leaves office (highly undesirable for him) or do what he can to stay. NATO response will just boost his support within Russia. He will be galvanized. Some idiot earlier said moscow would get glassed. That’s crap. If moscow got glassed say goodbye to the entire world. 

Will nato respond by attacking Russian troops in Ukraine? NATO is supposed to be a defensive force and Ukraine is not a member. Some of the nitwits here are gonna say Poland is next. Or crap like that. But he is smart enough to know after this fight to be happy with some off-ramp. He isn’t gonna go after a nato country. I know people rave about how well Ukraine fought.

Therefore, you need to frame the question as ""Does nuclear use help Putin retain power?"" The answer to this question, almost invariably, is ""no"".

If he's defeated conventionally, he's ousted for certain, if he even survives. He wants to be in power but modelling him like a player in a game theory scenario, he'd rather be alive and ousted than dead. Although ousted is undesirable it's an overall net gain over death. It's not the desired outcome but it's also not the worst. Given the choice, he'll put surviving first because power is irrelevant if you're dead.

The thing is, very simply, if he uses a nuke he will set in motion a chain of events that guarantees he will not survive. If he does not, he has a chance. He understands this. At a very high level, nuclear use is therefore entirely undesirable.

If he orders nuclear use, there's a nonzero chance he's killed by his own, in self preservation, to prevent that order being carried out. If it is carried out, then the inevitable end is the destruction of all Russia. Again, he dies. Putin's choice would be to go out all guns blazing if he went nuclear, but he would die in every conceivable scenario. This is not what he wants.

If he doesn't go nuclear, he can perhaps negotiate peace or at least come away with no further losses. Is that enough to save him? Unclear. It's at least something better than absolute defeat. Even ousted from power in name, there's still the option to run things from the shadows. He's done just that before under Medvedev.

The question really comes down to how egocentric he really is. As you say, his worldview might genuinely be that nothing matters except him, in which case for him there is no discernible difference between being killed for losing and being killed starting an all out nuclear exchange. However, few people, even true psychopaths, truly view those as equivalent.

Essentially, the main reason for him not to do it is that using nuclear weapons results in a guaranteed worse outcome than any other choice at all. That's the simple truth. There's no situation in which using nuclear weapons improves his situation and in almost all it makes it worse. Essentially, Putin's in a Nash Equilibrium right now, no change in strategy by him can improve upon his current situation. Most options will make it worse.

Therefore, assuming he's still sane and rational, he just won't do it. If he's not sane, all bets are off. You're right that nothing physically prevents him from doing this. However, he hasn't so far, which implies he's rational.",1652833727.0,1652833453.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i90ffkm,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

That is an empty statement.

He was asked to give his assessment regarding why the Russians were suffering from bad intel gathering capabilities in relations to their failed bridging operation. 

He counters with ""how do you know they have bad intel gathering"" and then goes on to simply say bridging operations are difficult.

Upon further prompt by the interviewer he says possibly there was pressure by Gerasimov to make a push which would explain a hurried bridging attempt.

Boil it down he has simply said ""you dont know they had bad intel"" and ""they may have been in a hurry""... 

Saying ""you dont know they had bad intel"" is not an assessment. 

An assessment would be ""I believe they had good intel"" or ""I believe they had bad intel"" or ""i have insufficient insight on the matter to make a assessment on their intel capabilities at this point"" but simply saying ""you dont know that"" is just disagreeing without actually putting your own opinion out there. 

Regarding the ""one push left then need to consolidate"" is lifted directly from UK defense intelligence statements which are published daily thus again he is simply regurgitating something late and even then he is couching it in ""possibly, maybe"" etc

Even in this interview he snapped when the interviewer made a statement which could be interpreted as him having gotten some assessment wrong in the past. 

He is just trying to survive without saying anything that can be used to show he has no idea what he is talking about later on.",False,1652817677.0,t3_uri6l5,t1_i8z9yn4,,8,1,0,1,0,0,
