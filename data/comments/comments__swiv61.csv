There is a disturbing tendency I'm noticing lately on Russia's state TV: referring to Americans and Ukrainians as ""dogs.""

>COVID is ripping through the units stationed in Belarus. Official stats have case numbers breaking all records. Army units have *really* high numbers at all ranks & they infecting the locals. Many soldiers are treated in field hospitals (tents?) as local facilities are full

&#x200B;

>Local residents are concerned with the behaviour of soldiers, who blow off steam & the article hints that soldiers from other parts of Russia (non-Slavic) are the centre of tensions. Nothing like racism to help an army unite.

&#x200B;

>RU military seems to be stripping whole areas of forest of firewood to heat camps & food,leaving little left for locals to heat their homes. Nature park areas are also damaged with the Russian army not cleaning up after themselves.

&#x200B;

>An extended period of heavy vehicles in the area has damaged roads & other infrastructure. The article says the Russians don't care and that probably there isn't the money to repair what were new roads anyway.

&#x200B;

>That soldiers drink is well known but the soldiers are taking it to extreme.Some nearly froze to death drunk on moonshine,they haven't got a lot of money to buy booze & property has started being stolen to pay for it. Drinking is ""non-stop"", dangerous moonshine being no barrier

&#x200B;

>Videos of soldiers complaining of bad food have been uploaded to social media. If unable to barter for food (see next tweet), domestic animals vanish.  Locals are too scared to report any of this to their authorities who probably can't do much to young men with guns anyway.

&#x200B;

People are saying that if Russia *doesn't* invade at this point, it's a complete and utter failure from Putin. That it hast cost too much with nothing to show for it. That Russia will look weak both internally and externally. But will they, really? 

If (and I pray to every deity that this is the case) Russia does step back and calls this off, will it be a complete loss for them? No. They have created widespread fear and panic of the ""Russian bear"" over pretty much the entire western world by words and positioning alone. Because people *are* scared. They have shown that Russia still has some power and weight, and therefore relevance. More importantly: It will be very easy to spin it to the Russian public in a way that shows that this was a success for these exact reasons. 

Avoiding war at this point won't show Russia as weak, not in the way people on here are saying. It would still show that without doing much, they made everyone aware and scared. And that is a massive political win for Putin.

I’m here in Stanytsia Luhanska, once a suburb of the city Luhansk, but since the war, has been separated from it by a frontline.

Raisa Malashenko was trundling her rusty bicycle, laden with bags of food, through the centre of Stanytsia Luhanska on Saturday afternoon. The 81-year-old did not flinch as booms of artillery sounded in the distance.
Her five children have all left this frontline town, some for Russia and others for safer parts of Ukraine. “It’s just me and my cow now,” she said mournfully.

Like many older people in eastern Ukraine, Malashenko said she missed the Soviet period, and said she blamed the Ukrainian army and Kyiv’s western backers for the current escalation. But she also said she was terrified of a Russian invasion.

“God forbid the Russians come, and then with them their Cossacks and Chechen fighters will come. Imagine what a hell it will be then,” she said, a tear glistening in one of her eyes.",False,1645317613.0,t3_swiv61,t3_swiv61,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

It would keep any nuclear armed nation from getting attacked directly which would not fuel them to retaliate with nuclear arms. It would largely take place in Militarily important but non-nuclear nations, like Poland. Once one side sees theyre losing, nuclear arms are always a fallback to negotiate at least a stable peace, no one side can get too far before they leave the other nation with no choice, and diplomacy before absolute annihilation will always be the goal of the winning power, especially in a highly costly war. 

Russia would lose this war in most scenarios and would concede land and probably break apart, but nuclear weapons aren't a win, it's like flipping the board and then telling yourself you never get to play that game again. 

Its such a weird avenue of tech humanity went down, something we applied and used instantly upon its creation as a weapon, like multiple things during the war, but it was then immediately stowed way and never used again.

Oil and gas price increased help US export.  US LNG export to Europe had overtook Russia now.  High oil price also make fracking profitable again.

Been caught in the middle with a ruthless neighbor and a war that could result in death of millions.
Economy in a wreck (or on the way) with investors and the rich people in the country on an exodus. 
No control over it own destiny, negotiation on Ukraine often not even involved Ukraine.

Russia wants to take over Ukraine because Ukraine wants to join NATO.
Russia could somewhat get away with it as they are not a NATO ally yet, and so they want to take over and kill any official that supports Ukraine NATO.

That is why, for example, all of Europe and US is throwing with sanctions: not approving Russia but nobody really wants to take the red giant head on. Especially one that is this aggressive and has nukes. 

To be fair, Russia doesn't want a war with NATO directly either for the same reasons: a combined superforce with nukes.

My question: if Ukraine would join EU/NATO Right now, litterly Right now Right before Russia invades, wouldn't the Russians back of?

Here's one to think about: Russia annexes the Crimea and NATO does nothing. 8 years later Ukraine is vying for inclusion in NATO so Russia begins massive buildup of troops to prevent this while using the nuclear option to frighten NATO into inaction once again. NATO them threatens with sanctions if russia invades. All of thi is known so far so let's continue with the hypothetical.  Russia doesnt invade bit instead supplies and emboldens separatists to begin a civil war. As civil war rages Russia can now begin to withdraw troops without losing face. Win for Putin. If any of this looks familiar it's because it's the standard playbook of geopolitics for the last 80 years. 

Meanwhile, a civil war keeps Ukraine out of NATO.  Win for Putin. Separatist forces, with supplies and support from Russia, begin to take massive amounts of territory. Win for Putin. Eventually there's a coup in the Ukrainian government to end the civil war. Win for Putin. 

Tldr. Putin doesn't invade but instead incites a civil war. NATO stays out, Russia gains territory and no sanctions are levied. The only losers are the Ukrainians.",False,1645315458.0,t3_swiv61,t3_swiv61,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

So they take Ukraine and Belarus back into some kind of new unified state. Belarus might become white Russia while Ukraine returns to being 'little Russia'. Look up pre Soviet maps but the Slavic people being absorbed back into the motherland is probably to stave off demographic issues. The only population above replacement are Russia's Muslims and this could spell trouble in coming decades, look at Chechnya and Russian history under the tsars. 

Next a huge recession is coming and when it hits, Russia needs to have all the resources it can to insulate itself. Better to move the tanks now before things get worse for all parties in Europe and Asia economically. Russia might not be able to afford power projection in a few years. 

Nukes are off the table. The US will defend the Baltics, which are protestant and culturally distinct from Slavic Orthodox Russia. Poland to Romania is in the NATO camp too and the Russians won't cross that red line. The west has said it won't do anything above sanctions and neither gas not SWIFT payment system is on the chopping block. But what about the nukes and world war 3?! Well....as I'm to understand it, Russia has said that so long as Russian territory isn't bombed, no nuclear retaliation will come. 

So if the Polish military decided to send in troops to Ukraine or Europe could agree to an expedition force, they would fight the Russians IN UKRAINE. Not the Baltics nor Kaliningrad oblast. Maybe if Poland went into Belarus, things would get dicey but it's also possible Russia destroys the polish army in Belarus and doesn't head west. Poland recently conducted wargames and found that a hypothetical Russian invasion would reach Warsaw in two weeks and occupy all of Poland inside a month. Poland is doubling the size of it's military to counter. 

Lastly we are looking at Ukraine but it's easy to see china and Russia coordinating so that Tawain is the 2022 surprise no one saw coming. 

In the end Russia's leaders have to do what keeps them in power and the Russian people will bear the burden with stoicism. By any measure Russia's future is bleak.

The US being largely responsible for Russian aggression isn't a fringe idea, it's basic geopolitics. And it's something we've seen coming for almost 30 years.
  
>''I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,'' said Mr. Kennan from his Princeton home. ''I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves. We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. [NATO expansion] was simply a light-hearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in foreign affairs.''
  
It's not about morals or legitimacy.

If it lands, best case is that a city sized area is levelled. There's a good resource here that shows an estimated area of destruction: [https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) . Keep in mind that newer and more 'improved' bombs are worse.  


If it is shot down in the air, the explosion could still happen. The radius of destruction would just start a bit higher in the air, but would probably destroy a similar area in size. If this is above a city, the city is still destroyed. If it is in transit, this destroys the surrounding area.  


Even if, somehow, the nuke were out of range of directly destroying its target by being too high in the air, it would still cause massive immediate damage. The nuclear EMP effect is typically not seen because, y'know, the area is destroyed by the explosion, but nuclear explosions emit a massive EMP wave which can damage electronic technology severely. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\_electromagnetic\_pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse) is the wikipedia page, which gives a much better description.  


Then there's nuclear fallout and its health concerns, which have permanent effects in a much larger area than the impact site itself. From US testing in Nevada around the second world war, every person in the US born since 1951 has been exposed to some amount of radiation [https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/rf-gwt\_home.htm#:\~:text=Before%201963%2C%20the%20United%20States,weapons%20tests%20in%20the%20atmosphere.&text=The%20study%20found%20that%20any,tissues%20have%20received%20some%20exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/rf-gwt_home.htm#:~:text=Before%201963%2C%20the%20United%20States,weapons%20tests%20in%20the%20atmosphere.&text=The%20study%20found%20that%20any,tissues%20have%20received%20some%20exposure). Wikipedia has a section on short and long term affects [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\_fallout#Long\_term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout#Long_term) . In the area where the explosion occurs, these effects are much worse, and radiation can stay for hundreds of years.  


In the case of an iron dome, when a missile is stopped it results in a small explosion high in the air with some shrapnel and stuff falling from the sky. For other missiles, you \*may\* be able to redirect them to an uninhabited area using a decoy. But since nuclear weapons have such massive, widespread damage, there isn't much you can do once it is launched. The only real winning scenario is that it is a dud and doesn't go off.

The situation in Russia is a lot more complex. No less authoritarian in real terms, but this is not the same. 

Russia has A LOT of internal problems and divisions. Putin's had periodic waves of mass protests against him for the past 10 or so years. The country is an economic mess. And on top of that its politics in real terms barely exist. What I mean by that is that the ""official"" Russian government is just the figurehead of a network of oligarchs and organized criminal groups that act like (and often just straight up are) the mafia. While the government uses a kind of bullshit post-Soviet nationalism to drum up public support the reality is these people literally only care about money and power for themselves. Every single thing Russia does, anywhere, is about the business interests of the oligarchy. On a surface level that's not much different then any country with a highly unequal private sector (now could that be?), but in Russia it goes far, far, deeper. It isn't like in the US where somebody's offering ""campaign contributions"" in exchange for sponsoring a bill or something. In this case the people with the ""contributions"" *are* the government, and if somebody else in the government says no they will just flat out shoot them. 

Putin doesn't have total control of anything. He's a powerful person but his power is contingent on the wishes of the oligarchy. The people with the real unquestioned power in Russia are people with names you will have never heard.",False,1645307425.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxml929,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

It is full of either people who identify as Russian and want to be part of Russia and/or actual Russians, soldiers or otherwise, who are there pretending to be Ukrainians who want to be part of Russia.  This area has two cities - Donetsk and Luhansk.  So far, that's where most of the activity has been occuring.

The Ukrainians basically refer to this area as 'ungoverned'. It's still Ukraine by most people's definition, but the central Ukrainian gov't has very little to no influence or control there.  So much in fact that you'll probably hear of the ""DPR"" and ""LPR"", which is the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.  Those are the local governments in these areas, they are loyal to Russia and antagonistic towards Ukraine, even though they're *in* Ukraine.  (Example, if you're American:  Across the border from Detroit is London, Ontario.  Imagine if a bunch of pro-American, anti-Canadian people - who may even be American to begin with - set up shop in London, Ontario and declare themselves loyal to America and fight any Canadian forces that come in to the area to try and restore order.  Then imagine Canada says ""whatever, stay in your area, and we're cutting off anything coming in or out of London, Ontario.)

So on to the latest developments.  These are pro-Russian folks that are *in Ukraine* but are *pro-Russian* living in an ungoverned area that Ukraine can't or won't control at the moment.  They desperately want Russia to get into the game, so they (or Russia themselves, via these Donbas proxies) are sending up mortars from this area, targeting the very edges of the disputed territories.  So when a bomb/mortar/missile goes off (which they or their Russian cohorts actually launched), they say that it's Ukraine attacking their border.  They make sure there's plenty of people around with cameras to record 'the carnage', and that gets sent to Russian media for internal consumption by the masses, making it look like Ukraine is the one attacking the poor hold-outs in Donbas.  Which is absurd, because if we go back to my example, imagine Canada attacking the people of London, Ontario with deadly force while the United States has Canada surrounded from all sides with nearly 3/4 of our entire military ground force.

On the one hand, I agree with your assessment. It’s easily the best conclusion the data provides. 

On the other hand, I can show you quotations by decision makers from as late as August 16, 1914 stating, just as definitively as you just did, that there would be no wide European conflict springing from Frank Ferdinand’s assassination on June 28, 1914.  The First World War began two weeks later. 

The messages of the run-up to the First World War are that 

History is the unintended consequences of intentional acts. No one can ever be certain about what will happen.

Russians have about 1000 soldiers in Transnistria (our pro-russian separatist territory)

Additionally there is the Transnistria army with numbers unknown but probably about 2-3k soldiers. Of course official numbers state about 30-50k ""troops"" - but usually this includes everyone from internal affairs ministry, including secretaries that bring coffee and fire fighters.

Moldova has about 4k active troops, a big number of them are professional contract soldiers trained by NATO, even participating in Kosovo peace keeping ops.

Yes, Transnistria has more tanks than us, but we have better anti-tank systems, yes Transnistria has Russian support, but we have Romanian support (we're basically the same people) and Russia is far away, but Romania is right there.

Additionally, we have strategical superiority - our territory is defendable, as it is connected to Transnistria by a couple of bridges (we're separated by a pretty large river)

And even if they try to enter our territory - they will have to cross bridges and then right away pass through some valleys between steep hills, on small roads, tanks are easy targets in such areas.


But anyway, Russia still has a lot of influence over us without even needing a war, we have a big chunk of pro-russian population, and a big part of our parliament is also pro-russian.

Considering how big of a disappointment the pro-EU government is, and the lack of alternatives, probably next elections will be won by pro-russians...  So all they have to do is wait a couple more years and keep sabotaging the current government.

p.s. most Moldovans speak Russian as a second-language, Romanian is the main language. We have about 10% of russian- only speaking population.",False,1645307835.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmidru,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is where people go wrong. He is most certainly not an unstable lunatic. The same goes for North Korean leadership. This isn't a defense of him at all - he's clearly a sociopathic dictator, but few things he's done could ever be considered ""irrational"" from his perspective. Bad for Russia? Probably. Bad for the world? Most certainly. Bad for himself? Well, I don't see anything that points to that, honestly. Especially considering there's a lot we don't know, about him, his actual goals and the internal situation within the politics of Russia.

He has the same destiny all Ukrainian presidents had without exception. He was loved first 100 days by his electorate. Then his approvals numbers fell down to 25%.

Objectively he is handling this situation good, in my opinion. But I won't be surprised if he switch last minute and agree on Putin's terms. Zelentskiy is obsessed with his image and people's love. He was sincerely sure he will stop this war when he was president campaigning. He thought he will talk to Putin personally and other naive stuff. He has a lot of personal connection in these circles. I guess two-three months after his winning someone finally explained to him how our budget works and what will happen with our budget if he plays both sides. Also, Putin isn't going to ""meet"" him informally as Putin is avoiding people like hell. 

Right now people a lot of ppl are rallying behind him just because it's best thing to do. Not all, as some people started to like him more. 

Zelentskiy made some dumb decision concerning military before this. Our army will pay for it which is devastating. Some good stuff came from him later and right now I believe he will do sincerely his best not to let our soldiers to be a meat wall just because we (as a country) can't give an order to fire back. Doing his best may cost us independence and dignity.

Ukraine is the last one so far to edge away from Russia and Russia has no way to stop it, bar using 60% of it's military might.

Russia will keep trolling from their borders, it’s cheap and keep the Ukrainian civil war hot enough to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato. That’s the goal, Ukrainian were winning against corruption and dissent in Russian speaking provinces (thanks for US mingling) and that was a big deal for Putin, he had to do something to prevent that and show his people how strong he is.

US gov will keep acting as if the world is on the brink of WW3 because it’s a great way to keep their citizen’s attention away from some recurring policy failures: a failed attempted coup, failing infrastructure, raging inflation, unfair access to education, a 3rd world health system, discrimination policies, and they have to justify why more than half their budget is spent on military instead of making anything better when there’s no new war going on. And they need Nato going on especially when Eu was beginning to think about having their own army.

Neither US or Russia want a war or an invasion, but having EU think it might happen is a good move for both powers for entirely different reasons.

Putin is many things, but an idoit isn't one of them.  

2. Involves as in sends help to Ukraine? If they do, it'll likely only be on a small scale. NATO will likely be the ones coordinating assistance to Ukraine, as they are a valuable ally, but not a member.  

3. Nuclear war would only occur if Russia wants to destroy itself. It would be suicide for them in every sense of the word. No one is going to use nukes.

Edit: the amount of money needed isn't something an online fundraiser can really do. NATO and the U.S will provide aid, and likely many more parts of the world if Ukraine is actually invaded, as there would be a new refugee crisis in Europe. The entire world would be see it if they are, but again, I highly doubt Russia makes that move. The only scenario that I think shifts the likelihood is if China is involved behind the scenes, and there's many reasons why they would be.",1645312258.0,1645311442.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmuzqq,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

It gets wider and wider towards the east and when it reaches Russia it's basically this huge undefendable front. Throughout history, Russia aimed to control the Plain as far to the west as possible, because towards the west it gets tighter and tighter until it's a pretty small bottleneck. During the Soviet Union, Russia had perfect control over the plain and the bottleneck was super tiny and controllable (East Germany). Russia was as safe as it geographically can be during the time of the Soviet Union.

Ukraine and Russia are sister countries, like Germany and Austria or Australia and New Zealand. Eastern Ukraine has always been the closest to Russia, but when the eastern Ukrainians tried to secede and join Russia (as is legal under international law), Ukraine's dictator with American backing stopped them. 

America capitalized on the situation. Ukraine is rich in natural resources and is a traditional Russian geopolitical ally, so having them subservient to the US would be in the interests of the US government. America sent ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, much of which wound up in the hands of far-right and neonazi paramilitary groups. The US knew about this, and didn't stop. Members of these groups have made their way into Ukrainian government, with several ministers having been photographed giving the Hitler salute and an explicitly fascist paramilitary having been integrated into the Ukrainian military. 

America has done this before in South America, Asia, and Africa. Arming and giving geopolitical backing to fascists in order to bring about conditions favorable to capitalist exploitation is basically muscle memory for the CIA at this point. 

Russia is trying to defend the autocracy of the ethnically Russian majority in the East, as well as countering fascists and neonazis with the only language those people understand: violence. 

**This is not my opinion.** This is the Russian angle as I, an American, understand it. America has an angle too. What few people listen to is the Ukrainian point of view.

Under no circumstance will he allow Ukraine to join NATO.

 >A nuclear electromagnetic pulse (commonly abbreviated as nuclear EMP, or NEMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation created by a nuclear explosion. The resulting rapidly varying electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical and electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges. The specific characteristics of a particular nuclear EMP event vary according to a number of factors, the most important of which is the altitude of the detonation. The term ""electromagnetic pulse"" generally excludes optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (such as X-ray and gamma radiation) ranges.
 
**Nuclear fallout** 
 
 [Long term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout#Long_term) 
 
 >Late or delayed effects of radiation occur following a wide range of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after irradiation and include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues or organs. Some of the possible delayed consequences of radiation injury, with the rates above the background prevalence, depending on the absorbed dose, include carcinogenesis, cataract formation, chronic radiodermatitis, decreased fertility, and genetic mutations.

Normally the missile canisters are horizontal — an indication that they are not at the ready. But when they are ready to launch, they appear to point straight up into the air.  
  
This is how the canisters at Dzhankoi airfield in Crimea appeared by Feb. 10. In an image taken by Capella Space’s Synthetic Aperture Radar on Thursday, the S-400s could be seen with their canisters in a firing position, ready to launch.

“Although the Russian government continues to state they are removing troops from the region, I do not believe Russia has relaxed its military posture,” said Steven De La Fuente, a researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “These images show Russia’s military forces are still on alert and ready to attack.

”Imagery from commercial satellite companies has been one important source of information as tensions rise over Russia’s military buildup surrounding Ukraine. Unlike traditional overhead imagery, the Capella SAR satellites can monitor sites even when there is cloud cover, as has often been the case in recent weeks over Ukraine.

Other outside experts have also raised questions about Russia’s claims of a drawdown. An analysis written for Janes, the defense intelligence company, concluded that “there are no indicators that a large-scale drawdown has begun.”

Janes analyzed satellite imagery, social media posts and Russian government videos purporting to show tanks leaving the border areas. The videos were inconclusive, and appeared designed to confuse, said Thomas Bullock, a senior open-source intelligence analyst with Janes.Janes said it has monitored the deployment of air defense systems, long-range artillery and army units moving to sites about 18 miles from Ukraine’s borders, and the deployment of transport and attack helicopters to a site 25 miles from the Ukraine border.",False,1645305851.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmio29,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

What is Russia’s reason for this invasion? They can’t have Ukraine join NATO or the EU. Ukraine has been slowly but surely building its military and they have a missile development program in the works. The boarder between Russia and Ukraine is flat, there are no geographical features separating the two. If Ukraine were to join nato, Russia would have NATO directly along its boarder which is a massive threat to their security. Their one driving point this entire time has been that they will remove all troops if they’re given guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join. NATO and Ukraine have declined this option. It is now or never for Russia. 

Russia will likely complete this attack in 3 phases, firstly by taking the southeast, then the northeast, followed lastly by a pincer movement (using troops launched from the northeast and Belarus) to encircle Kyiv. At each phase they will offer terms for surrender. However, chunks of eastern Ukraine are already held by pro-Russian separatists so we likely wouldn’t see Ukraine give in until perhaps the third stage of the invasion or potentially even force Russia to hold Kyiv before any kind of surrenders are agreed to.

Edit: I wanted to give this more context in that traditionaly to to be considered a true world superpower you need to be able to project power via ALL catagories in the definition. And while China, Russia, & the EU can project power economically & politically,  nobody but the US can project GLOBAL military power. While China & Russia have strong militaries and can defend themselves effectively, they have no way of transporting their military effectively to other parts of the world in the same way the US can. Therefore nobody but the US can meet the definition in all catagories.

They don't think like that most likely. Ukraina has been Putin's personal mission since 2006 once they shut down the gas pipes. Putin is viewing the history of Soviet Union and tries to leave his personal mark.
If you look at the map and check Russians borders, the only significant outlier is Ukraine, since Belarus is already kinda puppet state. They think Ukraine people as misguided Russians. If they join into the Nato or EU, it is kinda lost case, and it is not going to be part of Russia for foreseeable future.

Only thing that matters is the fear of Putin that it fails so badly he loses his position.",False,1645311994.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmvrun,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

“Putin- that’s why.

Vladamir Putin was a KBG agent for the USSR. While he himself was something of an anti-communist he viewed the USSR as one nation. When the USSR fell the world viewed it as nations taking back their independence while Putin viewed it as the collapse of an Empire.

Putin’s main political goal as been to reestablish the USSR.

Now when the USSR fell the US got aggressive. It moved into Eastern Europe, which has previously been Soviet territory and began adding previously Soviet nations to NATO- ensuring the USSR could not reform.

Russia didn’t like this. NATO exists purely to be an anti-Soviet alliance. This act was viewed as the US moving into previously Soviet territory and setting up camp.

Then Ukraine began to talk about joining NATO and the EU. This was a step too far for Putin. Ukraine is not only the largest nation that broke away from the USSR, it’s also right on the border. If Ukraine joined the EU and NATO, it would become a dagger at Russia’s throat.

So Putin wants 3 things

He wants to reestablish the USSR. Taking back Ukraine-a large nation of 44 million people with ample natural resources- is a big step in that direction.
He wants to permanently keep Ukraine out of NATO and the EU
He wants to add a buffer between Russia and NATO nations
The problem for Putin has always been the USA. Prior American administrations would never abide a full-out invasion of a sovereign nation. Actually, they may have, but Putin wasn’t going to risk all-out war with the USA and NATO.

So for over a decade, Putin has slowly been encroaching into Ukraine. He’s made bold political moves, invaded border regions, and annexed Crimea.

Now finally, Putin sees his opening. He has found a moment in time where he can invade Ukraine and where the US and NATO will not respond. Why?

NATO nations and the US are still recovering from COVID. War with Russia would be expensive and bloody and it’s a cost nobody can afford
Technically nobody has a treaty with Ukraine to protect them from a Russian invasion. The whole world can look the other way here if they want
Biden is not a popular or “strong” President. He is not the type to get into a pissing match with world leaders. Putin likely thinks Biden lacks the political capital (or ability) to rally the US for a conflict in Eastern Europe.
So Putin is going to make his move. I previously though Putin was just positioning himself for diplomatic talks. I guessed he was threatening the region with war to get a “Ukraine will never join NATO” deal on the table. At this point, it’s clear he is invading.

Russia has positioned a huge chunk of its military along the border in attack positions. This is extremely costly keep in mind. Additionally, Putin seems uninterested in diplomatic talks around Ukraine. More worrying, Russia is staging false-flag attacks likely to justify war against Ukraine.”",False,1645310921.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmtqr6,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had some influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

I agree that most people don't truly understand what a world war entails, but there comes a point where you just have to say, ""Enough is enough.""

Russia is basically the bully in the schoolyard that shakes all the other kids down for lunch money that all the adults have turned a blind eye to because the bully's bitch mom has already threatened to sue the school if they accuse her precious diddy-kins of being a thug again. In this analogy the bully's ""mom"" is the nukes Russia always uses as an unsaid threat. This has been going on for decades: ""Hey, I'm going to keep being a bullying asshole that never has to face serious consequences because I've got these lovely nukes I could always drop if I'm not given everything that I want!"" 

Hell, Putin doesn't even really have to use the word 'nukes' to get his point across as he constantly pushes his boundaries and takes more and more for himself while the West turns a perpetual blind eye to his bullshit out of fear of starting WW3. For decades, Russia (the schoolyard bully) has been slowly but steadily graduating from petty theft (Russia's citizens and all border states will pay me 'protection money' or *else*), to misdemeanors (Ahh, nothing says 'Communism' like human rights violations within Mother Russia's reach), then to felonies (Oh, hey Former Soviet States; You're mine now or I kill you all!).

The questions are thus: If you keep letting the schoolyard bully bully unchecked isn't it kinda not such a surprise when that bully starts to ask for more than their victims are willing to give? Where does your line in the sand stand (as the not-so-responsible adults that have stayed silent to keep the peace)? Will you just let the bully keep robbing, even if you have no hard evidence that it's going on? What if the bully starts to sexually assault your students as well after they realize that there are no consequences for them thanks to their ""Mom"" always being there as a threat to keep others silent? Will you just let the kids endlessly suffer or will you finally call the police, the bully and their bitch-ass mom be damned? (The US did this with sanctions via the Magnitsky Act; let's pray this time the threat of worse sanctions actually does the trick).

If Russia takes Ukraine it won't be long before a domino effect ripples across the other former Soviet states that aren't already part of NATO; and after Russia has absorbed (and utterly annihilated any resistance left in) them into its sphere of influence how long do you think NATO countries will have before Russia's knocking at *their* doors wanting to absorb them, too? Do you think Russia will be satisfied with *just* the former Soviet states? What if, instead of invading the EU countries, it asks for 'protection money' from them, too ""Or Else""? Or a million other ""Or Else's"" that you can think of that will in some way completely shift the balance of power in Europe and then, possibly, the entire world. It's a true nightmare scenario, especially for democracy in the world. Not just in Europe, but *the world*. And that's with China staying out of the entire debacle which, let's be honest, is an optimistic scenario (especially with Taiwan an ever-present-twinkle in China's Communist eye).

Where does it truly end? Do *you* trust Russia to only stop at Ukraine? Do you trust that if they take Ukraine the fighting/blackmailing/threatening/meddling will utterly stop and World War 3 won't be coming down the pike in the next decade or two once Russia has enough bodies and money to be a real threat to all of Europe? Keep in mind that Ukraine has the largest army in Europe and if Russia takes it and assimilates it into their own army all the EU countries won't stand a chance in hell against an armed invasion with Russia as back-up.

This whole situation is a powder-keg and, yes, it might ignite WW3 prematurely, but honestly, speaking from a logistical standpoint, having WW3 start now vs have it start a decade or two later with Ukraine's army as part of Russia is a less scary thought if you're over in Europe. It's a damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don't situation that has no real right solution, only shitty answers. The only 'good' solution, at this point, is Putin standing down completely after being called on his bluff now that NATO is united against him, but I doubt that will ever happen (Putin is too enamored of power to ever make himself voluntarily look weak to the world and his own people). So, if Putin goes ahead and invades Ukraine anyway, even with NATO's threats of severe consequences, WW3 will eventually come knocking at all our doors sooner or later unless we want to become used to constantly having to pay the schoolyard bully for fucking with us all day, every day---metaphorically and figuratively.

Nobody really *wants* war: What we really want is peace and stability and the way things are looking the only way we can really have that is if Russia stands down completely (or at least partially on Ukraine) or we achieve it via another World War and a fuckton of death. It would just be easier to win a World War with Russia if they don't have Ukraine and god-knows-how-many-other Former Soviet States in their army by the time we actually grow enough balls to get around to *doing something about it*.

“We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to, intend to, attack Ukraine in the coming week, in the coming days,” Mr. Biden said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.”

Asked whether he thought that Mr. Putin was still wavering, Mr. Biden said, “I’m convinced he’s made the decision.” Later he added that his impression of Mr. Putin’s intentions was based on U.S. intelligence.

Previously, the president and his top national security aides had said they did not know whether Mr. Putin had made a final decision to follow through with his threat of an invasion of Ukraine.

Still, Mr. Biden implored Russia to “choose diplomacy.”

“It is not too late to de-escalate and return to the negotiating table,” Mr. Biden said, referring to planned talks between Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Russia’s foreign minister next week. “If Russia takes military action before that day, it will be clear that they have slammed the door shut on diplomacy.”

Mr. Biden also underscored that the United States and its allies were united behind imposing severe economic sanctions if Russia’s forces cross Ukraine’s borders.

The president spoke after holding another round of virtual talks with European leaders on Friday afternoon.

Tensions in the region escalated as Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine called for a mass evacuation of the area on Friday, claiming that Ukraine government forces were about to attack. Western officials denounced that as Russia’s latest attempt to create a pretext for invasion.

Mr. Biden’s remarks follow a new assessment by American officials based in Europe that Russia has as many as 190,000 troops massed at the Ukrainian border and inside two pro-Moscow separatist regions, Donetsk and Luhansk.

Mr. Putin insisted on Friday that he was prepared for further diplomacy. But Russian officials said the country’s military would conduct drills over the weekend that would include the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.

The prospect of testing the country’s nuclear forces added to the sense of foreboding in the region.

“We are ready to go on the negotiating track under the condition that all questions will be considered together, without being separated from Russia’s main proposals,” Mr. Putin said at a news conference.",False,1645305836.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxmisq0,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

,swiv61,hxoc227,"It's more of a package of geopolitical games.

NATO is indeed put it's bases closer and closer to Russia.

The Baltic countries hate Russia for the Communist occupation all the while border towns live off rubles.
Also there still is Kaliningrad one the most militarized piece of land and only russian harbor in the Atlantic. Which is situated between countries that hate Russia's gut.

Ukraine has Sevastopol one of the most important hot harbor for Russia to dominate the Black Sea. When the revolution started Porochenko demanded the Russians to go. Problem and that's what the rest of the World don't seem to understand is that Sevastopol has more Russians than Ukrainians. Same for the whole Crimea region. Think Kosovo or Montenegro. But since Russia is not a small country like Albania, we are less inclined to make Crimea or eastern Ukraine an independent region.

The present situation and Biden. Biden is just following up on the 2014 crisis and what Obama kick-started.
Obama was making a visit in Brussels when he made a statement about liquid gas to be imported to Europe.
It's there that a lot of analysts were dumbfounded to see how involved the US was in the Maïdan revolt.
The US hate the gas pipeline. Why? Because they cannot sell their products to the EU( too expensive and polluting). Their preferred partners are also losing money. See how they push to the EU (Qatar). Biden is widely unpopular and wars often boost popularity.

We also have to take into account that even though they have Jewish president, Ukrainians have a weird fetish for the Nazis ( like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).
Even stranger when some officials said that Russians wouldn't bomb Kiev has it is the cradle of Russian civilisation. Weird statement as it could be interpreted by russian supporters as admittance that Ukraine and Russia are one. 

UK, Boris Johnson is definitely tanking in the polls with the whole partygate and heavily needs to look like a stern world leader. But all he does is reminding everyone of the Irak war involvement under Blair.

Putin, he sure as hell don't want to see Gazprom losing an enormous investment that was made for the Nordstream pipelines. But he also cannot lose face and let NATO at his door. And he won't let go of the Donestk region. Putin is the one with the shitty hand but not the only one.

EU, don't want a war on its territory but has been accused for years of being weak. To Russia but to the USA too.
Because let's admit it every sanctions that were imposed to hurt Russia. Ended hurting the EU more.
Since the heat went up in Ukraine, Russia made the gas prices soar. Germany don't feel it too much but smaller countries that heavily depend on gas are choking.
The population is looking very angrily towards their respective governments. All this after two years of pandemic crisis. My reasoning is that Europe is lifting pandemic restrictions to not have a popular revolution on their hands. So they opened the clubs and other activities that people blow off some steam.
The issue is that our reliance on gas is mainly due to the massive influence of German green parties. Same green party that Olaf Schultz comes from and he's the chancellor. He takes a very different approach than Merkel where he seems more NATO oriented.
Still he relies on Russian gas. So his statement that he wouldn't use NS would be hard to follow.
Nuclear plants have to be build and it takes a good 10years to have a finished working plant.
That's why we see France, Netherlands planning to build hybrid nuclear plants that would only take six years to build. Belgium is a shit show as usual with dogmatic green parties that are ready to die on the hill of no nuclear. Also unprecedented inflation for every countries in the EU. So really not the moment for open conflicts with neighbors.

So we have the EU that don't want to take the brunt of the conflict that the US want to start. Ukraine that is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Russia between looking weak or losing economic assets. The only one getting unscathed for starting shit they won't finish is as per usual the USA. They'll be bragging that they resolved the conflict and brought freedom and democracy all around like Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Lybia,...",False,1645338900.0,t3_swiv61,t1_hxo5iw0,,3,-2,0,-2,0,0,

Because it's not just killing all people then we build back in a few years. Full nuclear exchange effectively ends all humanity for forever. Even if you make it to the bunker, that's your whole life and it's the last of humans, you will be in charge of nothing, you are wealthy from nothing, you are a mole in the ground just trying to survive. Even if you survive, humanity is dead, and therefore everything you do is in vain. It's like if you could won a dick measuring contest but as a result your dick fell off after. 

>Hell in the UK Jeremy Corbyn was lambasted by the media for daring to suggest he WOULDN'T press the nuclear button if PM. Wouldn't be surprised dictators would believe themselves safe in a bunker, and would rule over ash instead of fall from power.

Because people expect the east to fire against us unrelentingly almost immediately. People don't except the fact that if Russia and the US went to war tomorrow, it'd be a long time before nuclear weapons became an actual option.

All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbas in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

Even as I was writing it I was wishing that there was a way to use Russia as a snake and the Ukraine as something better. But just so there isn’t any misunderstanding here, I choose to side with the Ukraine because they are a sovereign nation and they have done nothing to provoke this war. Putin has no right to dictate to another country what alliances they can and can’t form.  The whole point of sovereignty is that a state has the right to maintain its autonomy and that fact is beyond reproach to anyone except that POS Putin.

As for your second point, I think you are telling me the truth that you would fight like hell if someone assassinated your president. You’re right, all of us would. But I’m reminded by the words “faith like fire burns out and is extinguished. Faith like water is always renewing and is never extinguished”. Everyone will fight when they’re threatened and angry enough. But that passion would burn out so fast when faced with the full force of the Russian military. They will undoubtedly start with a “shock and awe” assault that would immediately create doubt in Ukrainian minds. And with now benevolent leader to look to in these difficult times the tendency is to loose faith, get tired, and give in. All Putin would have to do is maintain a powerful momentum to discourage his enemy enough to break their spirit. It would be costly, but once that breaking point is there and the defenders are really demoralized, Putin would be been primed for victory. 

I’m an idiot and I have no military experience of my own. But I’ve been studying the Art of War by Sun Tzu as well as other canonic writings by Chinese generals since about 2005. Ive studied the classical historical battles “from Marathon to Waterloo” (kudos if you get that reference and want to make fun of me for it lol), I follow every modern war closely in the news, and contemplate strategy every time. In one of the Chinese texts (I forget which one), there are the five descriptions and the five actions. The first says that when your opponent can be described as “awesome and powerful” you act with humility and respect, and it continues like that through the other five until ultimately you reduce your enemy to become “slow and yielding”. 

The scenario that we are talking about would have the Ukrainian fighters fighting a vastly superior military force with great passion. That is a strategy that does not work. You over exert yourself, make emotional decisions, fall for deceptions, etc. that’s how the fire goes out. And when that happens they would be slowly reduced down the hierarchy to the fifth description — slow and yielding, to which the response is to “surround the enemy and force their surrender. If they refuse, close in”. 

Of course all of this is hypothetical speculation now that Zelinskiy is returned to Kiev. But the point is that in the scenario that we are talking about, the passion of the Ukrainian forces would burn bright for a short time, but that momentum would stop dead in its tracks when the Russians actually start to flex. They would ultimately loose momentum and morale and then they would be slow and weak. It would ultimately be a losing battle.

Ukraine and maybe even Moldova seem to be fair game for the Russians.

Sanctions get put forward as a punishment, but personally it's hard to see if they really are. If the war does go ahead the sanctions seem to be targeted at oligarchs, but I doubt Putin would pull the trigger on an invasion without the oligarchs being on side in the first place. From my viewpoint they've accepted that risk if he goes ahead.

I'd worry more about nukes if they were massing on the borders of Poland and the Balkan states because that feels like more of a gamble for Putin, would NATO really risk nuclear war for Poland et al? And if they wouldn't what does that mean for NATO in general?

- expanded emergency relief and exercised the defense production act. Franklin Turner, a partner and co-chair of the Government Contracts and Global Trade Practice Group at the law firm McCarter and English, said ""this administration in particular has been quite skillful with respect to its use of the DPA.""

- he's protected the most at-risk groups and has advanced medical equity across racial, ethnic, and rural/urban lines. Meaning he's prioritized at risk members of society while still making sure rural areas receive as much access to supplies as urban areas (urban areas tend to be prioritized). Gaps in vaccination and death rates between the majority white population and communities of color have greatly narrowed or closed.

You don’t want to conquer with nothing more than brute force because when you eventually win you will be left with years of maintaining an occupational force in distant territory with an active and unending resistance. Sun Tzu says that one must allow the enemy to feel as though they have done the best that they could and were simply beat by a greater force. He says this because if they feel like they have done their best, it is easier to submit.

I think that if we play out this little war game of ours you would see the following: Putin kills Zelinskiy, the public is impassioned and enraged, Russian invasion begins, initial shock and awe campaign for several months of constant bombardment, Ukrainian forces grow tired, relenting, Putin would probably ease up his momentum at this point—enough to keep his enemy discouraged, but also slow enough to draw it out a while, give them a fighting chance, following Sun Tzu, but ultimately he would whittle them down until they are either “greedy and suspicious” (fourth description) or slow and yielding. I think that in this scenario they would ultimately surrender willingly and rejoin Russia. 

Of course, all of this assumes that we are playing this war game in some isolated vacuum with no outside influences. But that’s not how the world really works. Of course other countries would influence, impact, and/or intervene to alter the course of things. All generals must adapt to change, but what I’m talking about is a strategic trajectory.

The intervention was launched to resolve a constitutional crisis caused by a disputed presidential election. The intervention began in January 2017, and in June 2017, the term of the ECOWAS military mission was extended by a year. The mission is ongoing as of August 2020, and is expected to continue through at least 2021.

You said a lot of dumb shit, but that really takes the cake. You are very confident in your opinion, projecting your own shortcomings on other, but this statement completely devalues every opinion you have on military conflicts.

You break down the Afghan war to a Kill:Death ratio and exclaim that this is domination. 

The USA is undoubtedly a super power and spends more money on their military complex then any other nation.
