This was stated by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a speech at the plenary session of the European Parliament.

She also noted that gas prices in Europe are now lower than before the russian invasion of Ukraine, and Europe is investing in clean energy and energy independence now more than ever.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 February 2023  


* On 09 February 2023, Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev called for an increase in Russian tank production while visiting the Omsk Transport Machine Construction plant.  

* his follows several public comments by President Putin urging the defence industry to better support the ‚Äôspecial military operation‚Äô.  

* In a televised meeting on 12 January 2023, Putin castigated Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for the defence industry, for ‚Äòfooling around‚Äô; one of the president‚Äôs strongest public outbursts since the invasion.  

* Senior Russian leaders are likely aware that the state‚Äôs military industrial output is becoming a critical weakness, exacerbated by the strategic and operational miscalculation of invading Ukraine.  

* Production is almost certainly falling short of the Russian MoD‚Äôs demands to resource the Ukraine campaign and restore its longer-term defence requirements.

>As tensions in Ukraine continue to rise over a new offensive that may be carried out by Russia, Kyiv's Ministry of Defense said they were receiving intelligence from Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

>""In war, we use all means allowed by law. We have found a mechanism of cooperation even with people very close to Putin. These people are beyond any suspicion, they are known as supporters of 'great Russia',"" Andrii Cherniak, representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, said in an interview with the Greek news outlet Iefimerida.

>However, Cherniak pointed out in many cases the reason for these Russian officials to cooperate with Ukraine wasn't their friendly feelings toward Kyiv. It was because many in Putin's inner circle did not support the current Russian policy with regard to Ukraine.

>""They are all doing this for their own benefit, it is in their interests. Some do it in order to save their lives. Some because they are losing money. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a lot of people started losing their money and influence far too quickly. They don't like it,"" he explained.

>Cherniak said these people do not plan to carry out any coup d'√©tat in the Russian Federation, but ""if he [Putin] loses power, they will destroy him.""

-ATACMS would be an amazing capability to give Ukraine, but I think the main reason they are being withheld is the likelihood of them being reverse engineered if shot down. The GLSDBs don't have the range of ATACMS, but are precise and can push russian command and ammunition depots further back as well as striking high value targets such as EW equipment, artillery pieces, and troop concentrations


-It's possible that we haven't seen another push from Ukraine since the Kherson counter offensive because they are focusing on attriting the russians in Bakhmut while waiting on Western military hardware to arrive to improve their ability to maneuver and reduce casualties


-We'll likely see aircraft supplied by allies used more to support armor and infantry rather than attack targets deep behind enemy lines. It will be interesting to see Western doctrine of aircraft, armor, and foot soldiers working in cohesion used against the russians 


-Bakhmut has been labeled as being a relatively small city of little value, but Popasna lies 20 miles to the East and is an important rail hub russia uses to bring in troops, equipment, etc. It's possible that russia has continually attacked the city to keep Ukraine from retaking Popasna, further disrupting their chain of logistics


-The heros of Ukraine have suffered heavy losses over the past few months in and around Bakhmut, but one very valuable thing this allowed them to do is wipe out most of Wagners convict army. russia must now use (and lose) more experienced troops in order to make further territorial gains

Highlights: 

- he confirms that due to the ""tank coalition"" not existing in reality, only 17 modern Leopard 2A6 tanks will be delivered to Ukraine (14 German, 3 Portugese). Nobody else was willing to donate and as such they fell short from the target of 40 modern tanks. 

- Poland (which is coordinating the older Leopard 2A4 variant as agreed between Germany and Poland) has gotten ""about 30"" commitments, which again is less than the 40 tanks they aimed for. 

**- ""we will not reach full battalion strength"" [with modern tanks]**

- ""Sweden is still considering whether to provide tanks and to what extent""

-  The Netherlands are financing 20.000 rounds of ammunition for Leopard 2A4 (they will not donate tanks themselves or finance them)

- conversations are ongoing with Ukraine and partners about logistics, ammo, spare parts and further tank donations. 

- A large part of the tanks will be delivered in March/April, others a few weeks later as they need maintenance

- On the good news, Pistorius announced that 120 instead of 100 old Leopard 1s will be delivered to Ukraine. (Note: I guess this is Germany trying to make up for not getting EU nations to donate more modern tanks) 

- In total 5-6 battalions will be equipped with german tanks this year, but only 1.5 of those (at best) will have Leopard 2 tanks with at best one oversized company having modern variants of it. 

- on the plus side Pistorius also said that Germany had managed to acquire enough stocks for Gepard ammunition and now has at least as much in storage as Ukraine has already used so far, so supply issues there should not be happening.

> 5/ According to @washingtonpost  US defense planners assess that Ukrainian forces are unable to simultaneously defend #Bakhmut and launch a spring counteroffensive and have urged #Ukraine to prioritize the spring counteroffensive over defending Bakhmut.

I have for a while been confused about Bakhmut. On one hand, there are those who say that controlling it isn't important. As far as I can tell, this seems to be a relatively common view. On the other hand, there's been intense fighting there for a long time (why would someone fight this long and hard, sacrifice this much over something that isn't important?). Moreover, I recently saw that Prigozhin wants to capture Bakhmut [""for its resources and ""underground cities.""""](https://kyivindependent.com/news-feed/wagner-head-explains-why-he-wants-ukraines-bakhmut).

Are those who say that Bakhmut isn't important underestimating its relevance, or are both Russia's and Ukraine's political/military leaders overestimating it? 

Unless there's something crucial about Bakhmut that I'm unaware of, I suppose holding it shouldn't be prioritized at the expense of a wider counteroffensive. However, there's *still* the question of what to make of the city, considering the fighting that's been raging there for quite a while.",False,1676481035.0,t3_112oymx,t3_112oymx,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

They've got missiles that can accurately drop 500kg+ warheads on targets hundreds of kms away. What they don't have is an equivalent of the GMLRS.

I don't think that's the issue so much as the US being really cautious giving Ukraine anything other than very obviously tactical weapons. No one can mistake a GMLRS for something that could carry a nuke.

I wish Iran was on Ukraine's side rather than Russia's. Some of their Emad MRBMs would make Russia's logistics a nightmare.",1676455791.0,1676454552.0,t3_112oymx,t1_j8m5ldw,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Keeping them mothballed but in decent condition would have been expensive, but in the current state we will be relying on stockpiles as we won't be able to ramp up by the time any large scale conflict is already over.  We're talking many years.

-Germany has in very real terms lied. I know Germans on this sub get angry when Germany is questioned so apologies. Actual Leopard 2s vs Leopard 2s on paper are very different. Alot of IOUs and money changed hands without actually tanks...

-Scholz was pushing back about Leopard 2s not because of the dreadful state of Leopard 2s in Europe but because he's an asshole.

They had to sell what possessions they had to buy food, assuming there was food to buy. People cut down the trees in the parks to heat their homes.

Solid but cliche RTS design is the rock paper scissors, where each unit beats something else, and forces other units to be bought in for coverage.

Real life, combined arms is one of the hardest things to put together despite being vital for offensive operations.


Infantry get mowed down without both armoured protection and a way to pulverise defensive positions from distance, 

tanks almost never engage tanks any more and need to be screened against infantry as well as anything flying but are also good cover for infantry against lighter weapons,

aircraft engage each other until control is attained and then pulverise ground targets,
 but are vulnerable to anything on the ground that hits back, 

and artillery are good against most things on the ground, but unless heavily mobile are too easy to take out, and can make life harder by creating ruins of what you wanted infantry to take, as well as being incredibly hungry for ammunition when used this heavily.

At least that's my understanding.

The regime in Beijing would likely fall back, as the Kremlin has, on lobbing ""vergeltungswaffen"" at civilian areas in frustration.

On land and in the air, if someone out there remains unpersuaded, by the poor performance of the Russian army in Ukraine, that NATO has more than adequate air and ground forces in theater to defend any alliance member, then I don't know what more evidence they need.

Another would be, that Germany said from the beginning, that it would send Leopard 2 (only) together with its allies. As soon as the allies were ready to commit (or at least stated that they are ready) Germany was on their side. Without wasting any time. 

As with all other major weapon systems given to Ukraine, like SPGs, AA-systems, IFVs etcetera, Germany was always among the first to deliver.

There was no instance were Germany was lagging behind or even holding up.

Germany didn't change course, but acted determined from the start. 


My personal opinion: The reality most likely is somewhere between the extremes.

Germany was in fact more reluctant than others, regarding military support. For obvious historical reasons. Until one year ago, German policy was to not export any weapons into war zones and don't allow export of German weapons by third parties. This shifted radically, but there is still some reluctance to be the one who is pushing Europe in regard of military involvement.

Only a tyrant, a Putin-like clone, can survive is such a deeply corrupt and cut-throat system. Any threat to Putin is already dead, in prison or exiled and sometimes killed in exile.  

I really do wish it weren't so, but I don't see how anything else could realistically happen.

Julia Ioffe mentioned towards the end of an interview for PBS Frontline that there are people far worse than Putin.  

In the past Julia wrote about some Russian people who are very nationalistic and want nothing less than the total conquest of Ukraine. In one article early on in the war she interviewed a Russian man staying with friends in Ukraine. He was debunking Kremlin propaganda online. His mother back in Russia publicly denounced him as a traitor to Putin and to Russia.  

That man said his mother wanted Putin to rebuild the Soviet Union. She was a member of an online group who really took the Kremlin propaganda to heart. He said her real motive for wanting the return of the Soviet Union is because before the collapse her husband had a well paying job as a pilot. He brought goods back from other countries. Since the collapse her standard of living has fallen to the same level as other people. Put simply, she wants her luxuries back.

You will see a lot of rampant corruption, people being badly beaten, people starving, the bio-robots cleaning up the nuclear disaster without adequate protection, mothers trying to ID their missing sons by watching video tapes of dead and broken bodies shipped back home.

Secondly, it's not as if the Soviets pulled out of the Afghanistan war when they changed leaders.

There's always someone who wants to seize power. Maybe in such extreme circumstances it's also a case of seize power or die by the hands of your rivals should they gain power. I look upon the Russian government as like the organised crime gangs which they're often linked to. Those gangs have often fought and killed each other on the streets in their own bloody warfare.  

Sheer brutality seems to be their thing. Soviet and Russian leaders, along with other would-be leaders, haven't shied away from using the military on the public, political opponents and the Russian government buildings themselves. I remember video footage in the news at the time showing tanks firing on their own government buildings and running over protesting members of the public.  

If Russia were to collapse and even break up as some believe then it would be a major humanitarian crisis. People would starve. Many would die. What effect would that have on neighbouring countries? Would it cause hate and resentment towards foreigners if refugees entered those countries? How would that shape those countries internal politics?  Would the collapse allow organised crime to seize even more control in what's left of Russia and neighbouring regions?  

The regions of Russia or whatever is left may even break out into wars themselves as they fight for power and against ethnicities, etc.

We're in agreement. However, as you point out, these are complex issues. And will take a long time to work out. We've already delayed too long, and further waffling over *whether* Ukraine is going to get jets, from the West, as opposed to taking steps to make it happen, is creating a gap not only in Ukraine's ability to defend its airspace if this war drags out for years, but also in their postwar capability.

Whatever a NATO member decides to send, on a possibly shorter timeline but definitely not battle-ready any time soon, the US should be signing a deal to get, at minimum, F-16s to Ukraine as soon as can be practically accomplished, and already be working on those logistical and support issues.

With an even longer-term plan, intended for postwar implementation, that opens the door to F-35 irrespective of NATO membership (Ukraine wouldn't be the first such non-NATO prospective export customer).

As for whether jets are what Ukraine really needs, the White House says they've been in close communication for some time with the Ukrainians on what these needs are. So there's a pattern of respecting Ukraine's ability to recognize what is needed, and not be shy about asking for it.

So when Zelensky, publicly and privately, begs for fighter jets for Ukraine's air force, I'm inclined, as the White House should be, to take this to mean they are needed to maintain the defense of Ukraine.

Because, sitting here in my swivel chair, I certainly don't know better than they do. Or better than Zelensky does.",1676473068.0,1676472682.0,t3_112oymx,t1_j8n07st,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Speaking of North Korea, I remember seeing people blaming the public for not rising up and overthrowing their dictator. I've seen the same talk regarding other dictatorships. Back when this war first started I had people calling me a traitor for trying to explain why life is so difficult, the control that Putin and the Kremlin have and that not every revolution leaves the people in a better position. Many just don't want to know.  

Tony Blair was the same when it came to Afghanistan. He refused to even speak with a delegation of real experts on the culture and the state of affairs in Afghanistan. People have said that Blair only wanted to know who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. He made it sound like a simplistic western film where the bad guys wear black and the good guys are obviously good as they wear white hats.  

That not wanting to understand lead our troops to being used by the warring gangs and factions. They used our troops as the equivalent of hired hitmen. One gang would point at their opponents and say ""They're Taliban!"" and off our troops went and killed them. Then another gang would retaliate by telling our troops that ""They're Taliban!"" and off our troops went and killed them.  

A captain actually said in a documentary that *none* of those gangs or factions were Taliban.  

That captain who recounted this is in the BBC documentary called Bitter Lake. That documentary was made by Adam Curtis who also made TraumaZone. Like TraumaZone it features a lot of archival footage from that time.",False,1676517608.0,t3_112oymx,t1_j8pxlkl,,7,2,0,2,0,0,
