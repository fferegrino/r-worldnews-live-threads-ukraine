The new sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country's elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks.

The sanctions, announced today after Trudeau attended a virtual G7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers.


Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones.

Trudeau also says the federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine.

Our country, on President Putin's orders, has started a war with Ukraine. And there is no one to stop the war. So along with the grief, we and I feel ashamed.

But we will publish this issue of Novaya Gazeta in two languages - Ukrainian and Russian. Because we do not recognize Ukraine as an enemy and Ukrainian as an enemy language. And we will never recognize it.

**Dear Ukrainians!**

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It’s a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON’T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON’T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

Europe hasn't seen war in most young people's lives, and even the older generations haven't seen developed nation states battle each other like this, not since WWII. The age of information wasn't around to capture it like we can today with cellphone's and social media. 

I just witnessed a terrible video clip of a Ukrainian child, no older than 5, getting blown away by some kind of explosion. It was a modern setting, paved streets, 2020+ model cars, H&M outlets, etc. Terrifying and haunting, as if it was right next door.

And that's my point, while we've seen plenty of awful war videos over the years through liveleak and other sources, it's easier I believe for people to not care too much, either because of vastly different cultures, or the areas appearing underdeveloped (""third world"").

,t0g9v1,hy9rvq9,"Russia seizes Chernobyl nuclear site, Ukrainian official claims
Russian forces entering Ukraine from Belarus have taken control of Chernobyl, the decommissioned nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Energy claimed Thursday.

Demchenkov Yaroslav claimed that the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate informed him that the Chernobyl, including all installations and repositories, “is fully controlled” by Russian forces.

The plant was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when a nuclear reactor exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other government officials earlier claimed that Russian forces stationed in Belarus were trying to seize Chernobyl as Russian incursions continued across the country. 

A Ukraine advisor to Interior Ministry Anton Gerashchenko had said in an earlier Facebook post that the Russian forces entered the exclusion zone from Belarus and that Ukrainian national guardsmen were “fighting hard” to defend the area. 

The plant lies in northern Ukraine, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital of Kyiv. The nuclear incident happened while Ukraine was still part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The US will not put troops on the ground. As tough as it is to acknowledge, Ukraine is not a NATO country nor valuable enough for us to risk involving ourselves in a ground war with the Russians. At most we’ll reenact the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, supplying money, weapons, and other means of support to the Ukrainian military and eventual insurgency, while I’m sure the international community uses every sanction and condemnation at their disposal.

The course of this war depends on Russia’s endgame. If they simply intend to sweep through, handicap the Ukrainian military, and bounce after teaching them a lesson and demonstrating their resolve to the West, I can’t see it lasting longer than a few weeks. If they mean to occupy/absorb Ukrainian territory or install a pro-Russian government, this will last years, as a Ukrainian insurgency will eat away at the occupying forces.

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_ and I am a constituent from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I am also an advocate for the maintenance of world peace. I write you today imploring that we, as a state, country, and as a world community stand together with Ukraine in defense in this catastrophic war. I suggest, along with many other constituents, to cut Russia off from the SWIFT financial system entirely & to seize all Russian assets currently in the west.  
  
We need to be coordinated in our response and I fully support crippling sanctions for the Russian economy.  
  
I support sanctions that would be even on the brink of acceptable if it meant we avoid further conflict in Europe and in turn the world.  
  
Thank you much,

Biden has been presented with options for massive cyberattacks against Russia

The options presented include disrupting the internet across Russia, shutting off power and stopping trains in their tracks.

President Joe Biden has been presented with a menu of options for the U.S. to carry out massive cyberattacks designed to disrupt Russia’s ability to sustain its [military operations](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/live-blog/russia-ukraine-conflict-live-updates-n1289655) in [Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-news), four people familiar with the deliberations tell NBC News.

Two U.S. intelligence officials, one Western intelligence official and another person briefed on the matter say no final decisions have been made, but they say U.S. intelligence and military cyber warriors are proposing the use of American cyberweapons on a scale never before contemplated. Among the options: disrupting internet connectivity across [Russia](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-launches-attacks-key-ukrainian-cities-rcna17482), shutting off electric power, and tampering with railroad switches to hamper Russia’s ability to resupply its forces, three of the sources said.

The source for majority of Russians allegedly supporting invasion is a fucking CNN and that's why it's their opinion that that type of sanctions are justified. It's bizzare how many of those types of people are on that sub and they're getting worrying number of upvotes.

Apparently the region's been experiencing severe shortages of various goods up to and including fresh water. There's also the matter of russia getting and keeping port access to the black sea, which is very important both economically and strategically. My personal theory is that the war was actually a hasty plan B after Russia found themselves unable to extract concessions from Ukraine/NATO with the threat of force. That's why the Russian false flags were so shoddy and quickly assembled, and why their troop numbers suddenly spiked from 120k to over 190k immediately before the invasion. Backing down would have been a huge loss of face for Russia, and so they basically backed themselves into a corner. 

Hopefully this conflict ends up being like a bear eating a porcupine.

Putin probably sees this as the last chance to grab back a part of the soviet union that was ""lost"" to Russia before we enter a future where war is impossible to wage due to mutually assured destruction and more countries joining NATO.

I made another relevant comment I'll copy:

Russia is a very nostalgic country and many of the oligarchs are very attached to the history of the Russian empire and to Russian history, most of which included current Ukraine as land just the same as Moscow is. Their ancestors fought in Kharkov to keep it free. ""Russia"", really the Russian Empire which became the Soviet Union, was broken up following the fall of the soviet union and ever since the rich class of what remained Russia has been pining for a return to the days when they had all of this land unified. They want a reunited Russia and believe that Ukranian indepdence is a farce engineered by the west after the fall of the soviet union. They do not recognize the country as real, basically, and they want ""their"" land back.  
  
It's like if California left the US today then started making alliances with China...the US would be pretty spooked. While that example is a little more straight forward that is roughly an approximation of how the oligarchs feel. They feel like ""their land"" was taken by rebels and those rebels are now dealing with NATO which is a threat to Russian existence(in their minds).

These additional sanctions are:

An intention to impose asset freeze on all major Russian banks with an immediate freeze against VTB which has assets totalling £154bn
To introduce legislation on Tuesday that will prohibit the ability of all Russian companies to raise finance on UK markets
To issue sanctions against individuals, entities and their subsidiaries which include Rostec - Russia's largest defence company
Look to imminently ban the ability of Russian airline Aeroflot to land in the UK
To immediately suspend the use of export licences to Russia - an example being electrical components or parts of military trucks
To lay legislation ""within days"" that will prohibit a wide range of high tech exports to Russia.
Look at introducing legislation that would limit the amount of deposits Russian nationals will be able to hold in UK bank accounts.

Russia planned this for months. The constant talk on Reddit was how equipped Ukraine was now with western arms and how they had 8 years to prepare. And as usual the gun enthusiasts who have fantasies about insurgent warfare came out en masse to tell me how that was what Ukraine would turn into.

The reality is Russia's military, even though far inferior to that of what NATO can muster, is extremely capable relative to the Ukrainian forces. The vast majority of Ukrainian arms are leftovers from the USSR era and they spend a bare minimum to modernize and maintain their forces. This is the equivalent of the US steamrolling Iraq in a massive combined arms effort. I do hope Ukraine can do everything it can to make it painful for Russia though including yeah... shooting down easy targets.

Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine. This is a well documented historical fact. 


>He did not attempt to disband NATO, he wanted European nations benefiting from NATO protections to increase the share that they were paying into the group because everyone benefits from US protection while lambasting the nation.

Multiple officials from his administration confirmed he wanted to leave NATO. The 'pay your fair share' bullshit was just the opening salvo. Just laying the groundwork for his exit and abandoning US allies.

>Literally Putin got nothing during trumps presidency. Great job creating an entire story that led to zero game for Putin, meanwhile two times under Biden now Putin has invaded a foreign nation

He got nothing other than the multiple things I listed. Such as the bi-partisan sanctions he refused to implement. You know the ones you conveniently ignored and refused to respond to. He handed Syria to Putin as well. Not to mention letting Putin off for interfering in US politics, which both parties agree he did. 

Imagine being so brainwashed you look at all these easily provable facts and think ""hmmm Putin got nothing"". He got everything he could hope for and then some from his little lap dog.

>Jesus man I don’t even like Trump but you’re bitten by the propaganda snake

I'm just repeating facts, with links to sources, while you get more and more upset. Clearly you must be such a moderate and rational person to get upset over someone just providing sources to back up their points. You clearly don't like Trump since you are refusing to accept all available sources on the topic and instead resorting to name calling rather than just accept reality. Definitely something a reasonable, definitely not Trump supporting, person would do.



But no worries here's a list of easily provable facts that your refuse to respond to and instead resort to hand waving and personal attacks. I'll keep reminding you of the topics each time you attack me personally and try to hand wave away reality. 

* bi-partisan sanctions Trump refused to implement
* Handed Syria to Putin
* Let Putin off for interfering in US politics, which both parties agree he did
* never once challenged or criticized Putin and still to this day only praises him

Have you watched Putin's speeches recently? He seems unhinged. 

>while he can be crushed economically with the stike of a pen?

Putting is betting the west doesn't have the balls to do it. And he's right so far. The correct thing to do is to kick him from SWIFT and have EU states buy gas from elsewhere even if its 10x the cost (while absorbing the costs). He knows the west needs gas and is hoping that spineless EU leaders abandon Ukraine by refusing to take a financial hit themselves. 

>but it is ridicolous to think it would influence his war effort in any significant way.

You are delusional if you think the war will continue if the ruble is worthless. All his rich buddies will gang on him when they all of a sudden become poor thanks to his antics. 

The worst part is by refusing to seriously punish him he's only becoming more brazen. This is the same as Hitler annexing  Austria. Letting him get away with it will only lead to worse things down the road.",False,1645726279.0,t3_t0g9v1,t1_hy9q9zd,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

Multiple advisors and appointees in his administration said he was going to. Several were not anonymous. It's like there are other ways of knowing something is true besides just official statements. Weird how that works. The goalpost moving is I provide the only available information on the topic and  you move the goalpost to 'if he didn't say it, it's not true'. Sorry that's not how reality works. You have a long list of his own advisors and appointees telling us he said it. Sorry it doesn't fit your right wing narrative but reality exits.

>Are we in NATO? Yea. Did he say he’d leave nato if Europe didn’t pay more into it? Yea. Did we leave? No. Did EU nations pay more? Yes.

Correct Trump tried to use 'pay your fair share' as an excuse to leave NATO. We're still in NATO because [both parties](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/01/23/us-house-votes-overwhelmingly-to-bar-us-exit-from-nato/) told Trump to kick rocks.

>Did he sell more weapons to Ukraine? Yes

Did he block military aid to Ukraine? Yes. Who said he sold more or less? He blocked aide. period. 

>Did annexation of Crimea or invasion of Ukraine happen under him? Nope. Biden 2x

Did Trump give Putin everything he wanted, yet somehow conservatives want to pretend he was 'tough' on him? Yes he did.

Again here's all the points you refuse to respond to or disprove. Happy to provide them again if you want to repeat your baseless cult right talking points.
