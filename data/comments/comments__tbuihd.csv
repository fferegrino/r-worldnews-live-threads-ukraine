>German source: [https://twitter.com/ronzheimer/status/1502393910806597637](https://twitter.com/ronzheimer/status/1502393910806597637)  ,  tweet containing the BILD article, retweeted by the Ukrainian Ambassador so I'm putting some faith in the contents of this article.

&#x200B;

Interesting to note that Schroeder (also nicknamed ""Gasprom-Gerd"" or ""Putin's lapdog"" in Germany), has made tons of money in Russia.

>Immediately after he lost the 2005 federal election to the center-right candidate Angela Merkel, he switched from politics to the Russian gas business. Schröder masterminded the Nord Stream project together with Putin while he was still chancellor. Then he became head of the supervisory board at the Russian state energy company Rosneft and chairman of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, which built and owns the two parallel gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea.

Directly after the war started:

>Since the war began, the former chancellor spoke out publicly only once. Two days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Schröder took to LinkedIn to call on Russia to end the war as quickly as possible. However, the 77-year-old avoided holding Putin responsible. Instead, he wrote of ""many mistakes"" that had been made ""on both sides.""

U.S., Allies Look at Sending Soviet-Designed Air-Defense Systems to Ukraine

WASHINGTON—The Pentagon is exploring ways to shore up Ukraine’s air defenses by facilitating the transfer of Soviet-designed antiaircraft equipment, according to U.S. and European officials.The U.S. is trying to determine which type of air-defense systems would work best, with Soviet-designed systems—ideally mobile ones—being the best option because they would require less training for the Ukrainians, a Pentagon official said.

They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago.The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.

A European diplomat said that Soviet-made systems like the S-300 would be easiest for the Ukrainians to integrate into their arsenal and employ quickly and effectively. The European diplomat suggested that the countries closest to Ukraine geographically that possess such systems could provide theirs to Kyiv on the understanding that other allies would replenish the countries’ stores with comparable systems.

“The Russians are changing their tactics, so the Ukrainians need to, too,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the House of Commons on Wednesday, calling Moscow’s airstrikes “indiscriminate and murderous.”

These shoulder-fired weapons, which are effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, are far less capable than the S-300.",False,1647027004.0,t3_tbuihd,t3_tbuihd,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

- Obviously, the US is not conducting top secret WMD research on Russia's border, especially not after 2014. Why would any such labs be located outside of the US?

With that premise established:

- It's a false flag to swing internal and external public opinion to Russia's side

- Justification to occupy Ukraine while they oversee dismantling of the biolabs

- Putin is raising hell about biolabs as a coverup to protect him from when he actually uses a chemical weapon. He'll simply say its US or more likely Ukranian terrorism

- Blaming the US for any sort of biological WMD-related research gives him justification to attack the US (or get his allies formally involved), but why would he want to pull the US directly into the conflict?

- Why does china support the biolab scare stuff? How do they benefit from this? or are they genuinely concerned?

But he does, so our best bet is to increase what we're currently doing to the highest degree, and avoid anything involving direct conflict such as a NFZ or something like boots on the ground.

Ukraine's economy is mobilized for war, so foreign aid is massive. If Russia gets completely cut off SWIFT that'd be great, but in order to do this we'd need to make assurances to and assist dependent countries in Europe

If we can't provide aircraft, why not tell drones like Turkey is doing? If that's still too much, give Ukraine millions more to buy TB-2 drones from Turkey

These things are key and we should do as much as we can right now to cripple the Russian economy and so war machine and bolster Ukrainian resistance in order to make a negotiation, not escalation, the only realistic way Putin can come out of this not being coup'd or humiliated

To be clear, I'm the first guy to call for and sign up to go for a WW3 and appeasement is disgusting, but now nukes exist it's an entirely different situation

This doesn't mean never do anything at all that upsets someone because they could nuke you, but fundamentally understand and accept the increased risk of nuclear war with each action, and weigh it up to see whether it's worth it.

For example, providing MANPADs significantly helps Ukrainian military capacity, whilst having a very small chance of massive nuclear retaliation from Russia

Direct conflict with Russia would have a massive impact on defeating Russia, but also carry a massive risk of nuclear war-- even if by accident, anything that could be a nuke might be assumed to be one, and they retaliate in turn.

I went to read it to get a sense of whether an uprising in Russia was likely. Their conclusion, for what it's worth, is that sanctions are _not_ effective in forcing regime change.

_No economic blockade in the past 200 years has coerced a country into surrendering its sovereignty. The reason is that modern states can adapt to supply shortages, and civilian populations are usually willing to endure enormous punishment to defy a foreign enemy. The most comprehensive blockade in history was the U.S. blockade of Japan in the early 1940s (code-named Operation Starvation), which slashed Japan's imports by 97 percent. Japan, however, surrendered only after the United States decimated Japan's military, leveled most of its major cities, dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and got the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan in 1945._

Putin creates a  narrative where Nazis have infiltrated the FSB and committed treason.  FSB fascists  fabricated evidence of WMDs,  working with Imperialists in the CIA, Nazis in Ukraine’s government, and traitors among the Russian military. 

Putin received credible reports from Nazis in the military and FSB outlining plans for a Nuclear terrorist attack to be  carried out by Ukrainian Nazi militias, including the Azov battalion in Ukraine. Their intent is to frame Russia as a terrorist state. 

In response, Putin launches a massive covert military operation designed to secure the sites and prevent Nazis in the Ukrainian government from reacting. 

It was supposed to be quick to avoid a major armed conflict their fellow Slavs. Sadly traitors in the military disrupted the operation. 

At this point Nazis among Nato nations implement  devastating sanctions on Russia’. Nazi military officers then sabotage the operation leading thousands of Russia’s soldiers to their deaths through reckless and futile engagements without even explaining to the soldiers under their command what they were doing Ukraine . 

These Nazis in the military carried out terrible war crimes in an attempt to sow hatred and division between the Slavs of Ukraine and Russia. 

Attempting  to save Zelensky from antisemitic assassins, Putin publicly denounced  him claiming he needs to be removed from office. Still the Nazis continued their assassination attempts. 

Against overwhelming odds, Putin was able to counter the Nazi conspiracy,  successfully securing  Nuclear power plants that could be sabotaged to kill millions. Putin did his best to avoid bloodshed with Ukraine emphasizing this was a special military operation not an invasion. 

To his surprise, Putin’s investigation at these sites revealed is there was never any plot to create a nuclear disaster. 

It was all a lie intended to isolate the great nation of Russia and cripple its economy and military.  Putin uncovered this before Nazis in NATO invaded Russia in order to commit genocide against the Russian people through mass killings using biological and chemical weapons. 

Unfortunately the imperialists still managed  to devastate Russia and Ukraine. The unfortunate reality is the West will always see Russia as the enemy, because both Russia and China stand in the way of Western imperialism. 

Now without the America’s corrupting influence,  Russia will emerge stronger but first it must make sacrifices. 

Putin returns Crimea as he has thoroughly denazified the territory over the past decade. Out of his faith in Russia and its people he chooses to return Crimea demonstrating to Ukraine they are both the same people and will one day unify peacefully.

Copied:

Fuck leftist westplaining

Mar 4th

Earlier this week, the Polish parliamentary progressive left party, Razem, issued a statement in which they announce that they are cutting ties with two European organisations: Progressive International and DiEM25.

“The Russian aggression in Ukraine demands a lot of work from us and- unfortunately- explaining of many issues to the west European left,” Razem states on their socials, “Yesterday, our National Council decided to leave Progressive International and DiEM25. Why? For reasons incomprehensible to us, both movements did not unequivocally condemn the imperialist and aggressive actions of the Russian Federation and did not unequivocally support the sovereignty of Ukraine, dangerously relativising this war.”

I support this very polite and carefully worded statement, but this is Freedom so let me deliver this message by Razem differently: Fuck.You. Or, at the very least, Shut.The.Fuck.Up.

This text isn’t specifically about the Western anarchists. Despite an odd “Ukraine’s Nazi army” here and there, I think the anarchists are not too bad on the issues of Russian imperialism: both presently and historically.  Some more work needs doing for sure but, especially compared to some other parts of the UK, and wider, Western left, I give my anarchist comrades a B minus here. You still know fuck-all about Eastern Europe and the only word in the relevant languages you are familiar with is “kurwa”, but at least most of you are not struggling to establish who is the baddie in the current situation. Now, you pathetic tankies and other cranks, it’s your attention we wish to have for the next few paragraphs.

This text isn’t exclusively about the ongoing Russian invasion in Ukraine either as much as it is about a much wider trend in Western leftism. You can apply the points raised below not only to the discourse around Eastern Europe and the so-called post-Soviet world. Similar themes were, disgracefully,  displayed in the leftist discussion around the Syrian War, for example. Large parts of the left, supported by their glorious leader Jeremy Corbyn, struggled to identify who is in charge of the vast majority of the war crimes committed in Syria (Spoilers: it was, ofc, Assad supported by Putin). But, while back in the day I partook in some Syria solidarity actions, I also do not think it is my place to speak about this conflict. There are better people to do this, and if they are so inclined then I can say: be my guest.

This text was written with consultations with other Eastern European comrades. I am signing it with my name, mainly so you can then give me the joy of an accusation of myself being CIA-funded or something, but be informed that many East Europe leftists are on the same page here, and we have been discussing it for a while now.

This text will be a bit chaotic and I request you put up with this. Like most Eastern Europeans, I have spent the past week or so living in some kind of haze, where news cycles really last 24hrs, there is no sleep, and your phone rings constantly. Some of my friends, those from Central and Eastern Europe mostly, want to share their worries, they are organising support networks collecting money, publishing How-To-Flee-Ukraine guides in multiple languages, cooking, driving scared and exhausted people to their temporary accommodation. Many, rightfully, share their disgust in the differences in how the Polish state and society (and wider, European states and societies) approach another “refugee crisis” just a bit further north, on the Belarusian parts of the Polish border, or the “refugee crisis” in other parts of Europe. Some are facing the very real possibility of finding themselves in combat soon. Some worry about their family currently in a war zone, some are in this war zone themselves. All are angry. All are sad to the point you are unlikely to understand.

While you are exchanging hot takes on Twitter, we are busy.

Every day, I wake up and the first thought in my head is: the Russian Army is invading Ukraine. After a few days of a sluggish parade, it looks like they are now seriously aiming at Kyiv. I have never thought I will be coming up with such sentences in a present tense. It is terrifying. You, the Westerners, will never get it. Partially because most of yous have a completely different experience of history, and it is that of living your life in a dominating country. Partially because you can’t be arsed to listen, and you never were. It is just simply inconvenient for you to give an idea that won’t fit to your already established view of the World a thought, and let’s face it, deep down most of you think that your ideas and your concepts are better, and more legit. Western exceptionalism is a worm in your brain, a worm you pretend to escape, only to parade your yankee, Queen of England ignorance around. You are better and more legit. You have better insights. You are used to being listened to. You not gonna use Google translate, because how come things are not in English, the terror!

But the Westerners call too, so I do my best explain the basic stuff I grew up with and some of the stuff that was passed on to me by the generations of trauma. Or what is the correct pronunciation of Kharkiv. Or, the worst: they want to explain to me how this is a NATO created conflict, or, if they happen to feel more generous, they come up with some kind of “both sides to blame” rhetoric. Look, Ukrainians are waving national flags, FASCISTS! If we could erase and dismiss your entire regions as easily as you do ours we absolutely would, sadly the internet is once again, also pretty much controlled by your lot. Well done – direct action right now would be log off, at least our timelines would be polluted less.

Your lack of knowledge on the issues of Russia and the rest of the world formerly behind the Iron Curtain is, frankly, astonishing, surprising and the lack of curiosity – shameful. In London and the wider UK, you got comrades coming from all these countries that joined the EU since 2004 and apparently you have never bothered to even attempt to understand what we are about. We were good for some things, mainly, in the leftist reflection of the mainstream trope of a “Polish builder” or “Lithuanian cleaner” (good, hard-working, simple people), we were good for more hands-on stuff. But never good enough for actually having opinions: apparently even about the stuff we grew up with. The unique version of Orientalism that you hold towards us, seeing as either simpletons, or racist, primitive, but honourable – you know exactly what we mean, admit it.",1647031611.0,1647031382.0,t3_tbuihd,t3_tbuihd,,0,-27,0,-27,0,0,

>I would like to make the following points. First we meet at the request of Russia following allegations of a possible program of development of biological weapons in Ukraine. We listen to their statement very carefully. Madam President any issue regarding weapons of mass destruction should never be taken lightly. As we just heard from the USG, the United Nations is not aware of any of the alleged program inconsistent with international treaty obligations including on chemical or biological weapons. We heard about health facilities in Ukraine. We have heard repeatedly also a firm rebuttal at the highest levels from both the US and Ukraine; therefore, Russia’s allegations are, in our opinion, part of the information warfare – false, unsubstantiated, part of the usual propaganda, and the disinformation coming from Russia are conspiracy theories not worth our time. The council should not be served with fantasies or starry-eyed stories as proof, independently verified or corroborated. This is not the case. However regrettable all this is, it is highly surprising since everything – absolutely everything – we have been hearing from Russia regarding Ukraine has been false, fabricated, or distorted. These are all in the public space and do not deserve mentioning, but the real *pumdo* goes to the Russian declaration just two days ago according to which Russia has not attacked Ukraine. Well, as we saw last week the UN General Assembly has a different account. In every other situation everyone would’ve thought that this is a joke except for the fact of this joke is destroying a country, is killing civilians, and is responsible for more than 2.5 million refugees and counting. That translates to 7000 people per hour. Reportedly this is also responsible for the death of several thousand Russian soldiers, but this is an issue for Russia and it’s people. All of the more reasons for the immediate cease-fire and leave place negotiations, Second, Madame President, Russia has a long and well documented track record of using chemical weapons, including an in attempted assassinations, and in poisoning its own citizens, like the opposition leader Alexey Navalny or Scripal. Bellingcat reporting has been brilliantly able to make a direct and irrefutable link of the attempted deadly poisoning with GRU high officials. We should therefore be very worried that in spreading such disinformation, a crescendo of allegations about weapons of mass destruction could serve as yet another pretext for Russia to prepare the ground and use chemical biological or weapons during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine while accusing others. After all, Russia has accused Ukraine of genocide in Dunbas, which is ridiculous. It has also accused *them* of seeking to produce nuclear weapons weapons, which is outrageous. It has accused Ukraine of bombarding it’s own cities, which is preposterous. As we have heard many times, including yesterday, Russia has and continues to support the regime of Bashir al Assad in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against the civilian population. My colleagues, what should retain our attention and deserves our time is the escalating situation that is wrecking two countries, and threatening in a whole continent and disrupting the entire world. 15 days into this brutal invasion and the growing *ormint* might of Russia, with the open complicity of Belarus, has stalled before the steel-clawed and indisputable right of a nation to defend its land. Russia’s goals are as abhorrent as the means it is using to achieve them. We are horrified by the catastrophic situation in Mariupol, another besieged city where civilians are starved by the use  of closer munitions in urban areas as we heard in the briefing. By the re-doubling of blind shelling and bombardments by more than 26 assaults on various health-related facilities, including ambulances, as confirmed by the WHO and confirmed during this meeting by outrageous and immoral acts which constitute war crimes. These are facts. Nothing seems to be going as planned in Ukraine. The unprovoked, unjustified, and premeditated act of aggression by Russia, again with the complicity of Belarus, lacks any legal or moral ground. The very ones that in turn empowered Ukrainians to fight heroically, be ready to die for the ideals they believe in, for the right to choose who they want to be, to be shapers of their own destiny. In this respect, we welcome the conclusions of the European Council, which among others, we welcome Ukraine to join the European Union. We are warm hearted by the Ukrainian resistance, incomprehensible maybe to the invader, and which should be seen as an inspiration and a reminder that freedom always prevails over tyranny. Let’s not forget colleagues, if Russia makes its way into Ukraine, it will not stop there. It will want more, and as history minds us, aggression works like a drug. This is why David must, and will, prevail. Thank You.",False,1647023265.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i09j71r,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

- A Naval blockade is implemented 
 - US Pacific Fleet destroys the Russia Pacific fleet and blockades Vladivostok 
 - Turkey Blockades the Black Sea and Air to Sea Attacks cripple Russias fleet in Black Sea 
 - Denmark closes off the straits to the Baltic Sea and NATO ships blockade St. Petersburg.  
 - The GIUK  is patrolled and Russian ships are blocked or captured. 
- Missile strikes would destroy all known Russian AA in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. This will probably take multiple days. 
- Air superiority will be established over Belarus and Ukraine
- Russia defenses will be softened by air raids and missile strike in Ukraine and Belarus. 
- Baltic States would see a massive influx of NATO troops already stationed in Europe to defend their borders. Setting up strong fortifications along that border. 
- Remaining troops from the NATO reactionary force establish and hold a front along Belarus
- NATO countries would begin mobilizing and deploying forces into Eastern Europe. This will take 1-2 weeks if not more as  supply lines are established, weak areas are reinforced, and battle plans are drawn and agreed upon. 
- Either after last step or during a force will build up on the Ukraine-Poland border and then eventually push into Ukraine to push Russia out of Ukraine. This will probably be easier as Russia will have redeployed a good chunk of these invasion forces to other borders. 
- Even higher priority then Ukraine Kalingrad will be sieged and the Suwalki Gap (Polish-Lithuania border) will be secured. This will initially be the weakest point on the front as Russia could cut off the baltic states from rest of NATO. 
- Once the force build up is complete NATO would push through Ukraine and Belarus to the Russian border. At which point NATO would try to negotiate a peace with Russia. 
- Should those talks fail NATO would probably hold this front and continue to full blockade Russia and implement a Korean style DMZ with Russia on the Eastern Front. 
- We are unlikely to invade further imp as that will risk Russia attacking with Nuclear weapons if they think Russia will fall and the amount of manpower and wealth it would cost to occupy Russia as NATO moves towards Moscow would be very very high. 
- If somehow we get to this point and Russia hasn't Nuked us the war would settle into a ceasefire or peace treaty or a perpetual war. 
- China would be a major player in this war. Russia would need China to help to survive. China is unlikely to engage militarily to save Russia but could economically assist Russia giving them a lifeline. If China turns on Russia or remains natural then Russia would probably collapse.

It's a very human thing to look for patterns but I can absolutely tell you that one has nothing to do with the other.

It's called a false equivalency.

For one thing, this is a Russian offensive, Russia isn't fighting for survival; Ukraine is. And that means a lot.

If anything, there are more similarities with drawing the comparison on the inverse.

But what happened in WW2 has literally zero influence on the outcome of this war.

That could be good or bad, we just don't know at this stage.

All we do know is that everyday Ukrainians are being killed and everyday Russians will be dealing with an economy that's collapsing.

Whatever Putin or any other figurehead from Moscow says now is purely for political theater in Russia, for their news and their versions of 'Tucker Carlsons', 'Alex Joness' etc.

The whole fast operation to remove the Ukrainian govt, quickly occupy at least the east of Ukraine pretty much failed so far.  Russian troops were not met with flowers in Russian speaking areas and the UA Army didn't run and in fact so far is embarrassing itself with shit logistics, heavy losses etc. They are bombing predominantly Russian speaking Kharkiv, Mariupol and while the media in Russia is heavily controlled, there are ways to get this information.

So again all of this is for propaganda at home. There a sizeable minority which is against the war, a sizeable minority which supports the war and majority of  people are indifferent and just want to lead their lives w/o drastic changes.

All of these sanctions, the unified response from the west has this majority slowly, very slowly start to ask the question ""are we the baddies?""

So Russia is going to be turning to information warfare. 

i.e ""See the UN Security Council doesn't want to hear about bio weapons in Ukraine, Russia is defending you Russian citizens from the west, from their schemes etc etc"". All of this is for carefully cut video segments for their media.

Actually no, to my mind things have started to become balanced. The first few days of the war felt very unstable to me, as there were no implied rules of engagement between NATO and Russia. Putin's sabre rattling about the nuclear arsenal and the Ukrainian calls for a no-fly zone, a lack of deconfliction hotline, the fear that Russia would take over Ukraine and head to places like Moldova next, the uncertainty of Russia's response to crippling sanctions, potential attacks on weapon shipments by Russia in NATO territory, etc.

Now however, things have settled. NATO is not going to get directly involved, that much is crystal clear. Likewise Putin is not looking to antagonize NATO and Russia has seemed to accept the overt lethal aid and real time intelligence that NATO is giving Ukraine, and while they have blustered about the sanctions, they are not using them as a reason to escalate the conflict militarily.

The issue on these ones is that we can only really speculate on what might happen based on past Russian behaviors. And past Russian behaviors in recent history basically mean that if Russia denies doing something, they are almost certainly doing it, and if Russia accuses someone else of doing something, it's because they are planning on doing it.

So their gigantic rhetoric storm accusing the US and Ukraine of setting up various WMDs is concerning.

First, Russia accused us both of working on a nuclear dirty bomb. So they attack nuclear power plants, directly firing on reactor buildings in the process. When that failed to accomplish anything, they have started specifically targeting Ukrainian nuclear research facilities, which thankfully hasn't caused any radiological releases.

So, in lieu of being able to play the nuclear defense card, their rhetoric has shifted over to biological and chemical weapons. And it makes sense if you assume they intend to false-flag that. It's basically impossible to deploy nuclear material anywhere without it being traced back to you. But biological and chemical weapons? Unless you're seen deploying them, it can actually be near impossible for a third party to PROVE it was you that did it. Sure there can be mountains of circumstantial evidence to point to it, but it's not like your anthrax spores or nerve agents say ""Made In Moscow"" on their biological/molecular makeup.",False,1647032649.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i0ablci,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I think this clarity and transparency has been a smart move and a powerful move. The Biden Admin has focused on telegraphing and being clear, both in what they do, and what their intelligence says Russia will do, and it has earned them trust and credibility (btw, something the US badly needed to rebuild on the global stage after four years of Trump). 

I also think it’s good for Biden to be positioned as the anti-Putin on this. Consider that at this point no one trusts anything that Putin says, good, bad, indifferent… you can’t trust him. By contrast, Biden has delivered on everything he’s said, and so at this point he’s taken at his word. 

There’s power in that. With every other breath from Putin being a new threat, many without action behind them, most of the world now rolls their eyes and ignores the blustering. The West can’t trust him at his word and continues to test him with more sanctions, more arms to Ukraine, etc., counting on their own intelligence and making Putin’s own declarations irrelevant.  

By comparison, when Biden says “we will defend every inch of NATO territory”, there is no guessing what the US response will be if Putin wants to test it. If he weren’t clear and transparent publicly, then nothing he’d say would matter, and Putin would continue to test the boundaries, being more likely to cross them and lead to confrontation.

Putin has been plotting the conquest of the former Soviet States for over 20 years. In 2008 the Russian army struggled with Georgia. So he began a rearmament plan and an alternative soft-war strategy that focused on destabilizing NATO leaning governments and NATO governments. He took advantage of the Syrian Civil War to train his army.


After Ukraine ousted his puppet in 2013 and voted for a NATO leaning government he tested the efficiency and resolutness of NATO by invading Crimea and the Donbas. When that went largely unopposed he started making larger plans.


He began a pervasive online influence operation throughout NATO members, he began calling in favors with politicians, he began funding nationalist groups, he began astroturfing causes that would destabilize his geopolitical opponents. Trump, Brexit, le Pen, Twitter bots, Cambridge Analytica, etc. Those were all parts of this phase.


In 2016 he succeeded in getting a puppet (likely compromised in the 1980s) elected as the American president. This was perfect from Putin's perspective. Trump would destroy NATO, sour international relations, prevent the US from supporting allies and make a mess of diplomatic stability. All Putin had to do was wait until the moment was right.


Then came COVID-19. Well that's a set back, but it presented a great opportunity to continue influence operations. Now no matter what happened in the 2020 American election Putin could be sure of a divided America. And there was no way that Joe Biden could actually fix international relations that quickly, he had to deal with an actual insurrection in America, and economic woes and all sorts of problems.


So Putin began the build up of forces in 2021. By December it was clear something was going to happen and the world started talking. In January it was inevitable.


And it still all makes sense to Putin. NATO is in disarray, Ukraine is alone and isolated, he's had a decade of rearming and modernization. The weather is right. Everything says that it's time for the next step in his gamble to build a new Russian Empire.


*Except* he had two of a kind while NATO had a full house. NATO was United. Biden had rebuilt the relationships. Ukraine wasn't weak and ready to fall.and the weather changed.


He was just wrong. Not irrational.


Edit: And now he's still not irrational. He's just not acting how you would act. He knows that he'll never get another chance if he backs down. So he's going all in to at least control half of Ukraine.

Russia was prepping not to cut the lines but instead forcing companies to not be reliant on outside infrastructure to function. ie forcing companies to store data on servers in RU.

Such actions give Russia finer control when it cuts off Western tech companies. If they ban Facebook. Well Facebook scripts are integrated into basically every website with logins, data, etc. This move means that a website won't go down and have to rush to fix stuff.

Yes, we've enacted sanctions but those take time to hit with full force, meanwhile, the Russians continue to kill civilians, bomb hospitals, rape and murder with impunity. Yes, they are also being killed, but they are doing more and more damage while the world watches Putin's genocide unfold.

You're more worried about hypothetical death and destruction than actual death and destruction. You do understand that Ukraine is a major producer of wheat and other food products. There will already be famine. There is already death.

Your argument is basically as long as NATO is untouched we can let every single Ukrainian die and you have no problem with it.

This plays directly into Putin's hands. The Russians will continue to escalate to de-escalate. They will keep escalating to make NATO say over and over and over that they won't escalate, that they won't enforce a no fly zone, that they will let Russia continue to kill, rape, and maim Ukrainian civilians without lifting a finger more.

Every single person posting about how we can't fight back for fear of provoking Russia is saying that it's fine if Ukrainians die because they aren't our people. You'd rather watch an entire nation become an insurgency than lift a fucking finger. Sanctions take time to enact, how many innocents have to die before Russia falls? How many hospitals have to be bombed, how many humanitarian convoys attacked, how many evacuation routes have to be mined?

According to you and the rest of the non-intervention crowd it doesn't matter. The Russians can do whatever they want and we won't change our tactics. We'll enact more sanctions and send through more aid, but that's it. I want to make it very clear that I support the sanctions and aid being sent to Ukraine and I think there should be more of it.

Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland could easily become a battle field. Masses of people fleeing in the millions to more western parts of Europe. Missiles hitting targets in major cities. Shipping lanes disrupted by submarine convoy  raids. Thousands of soldiers dying on both sides. Civilians getting caught in crossfire. 

A NATO-Russian war even if not nuclear will make the situation worse not better. Make it worse for Eastern Europeans who we do have a strategic and moral obligation to defend, make things worse for Ukraine whose country will be the front line of all out war larger and more destructive then it is now. It would take over a million troops to push into Russia. Trillions of dollar reallocated away from needed human investments towards making weapons of war. 

This doesn't even get into fact that once Russia begins losing grounds they are likely to use tactical nukes as a bargaining chip. Things can escalate quickly in such a war.

If Russia escalates any more tho then I could see this or an air corridor working.  I would think of it this way, to avoid nuclear war you have to make sure there is someone in the military who thinks it’s a mistake and that Russia messed up.  If we do an air corridor or convoy too early it risks pissing off the Russian military.  If Putin does something dumb and evil, it would likely piss off his military(many of whom consider Ukrainians cultural brothers) and the military would likely prevent Putin from escalating further when the us/nato does this.

A general good cost strategy is cost/profit times chance.  If there’s a .1 percent chance of nuclear war that kills most life(let’s say 6 billion), that would be .001*6B= a cost of 6 million lives.  So In this case of the chance is .1% or probably isn’t the good time to go in.  But if Putin continues to fuck up and I don’t know bring militias from Syria and Africa to fight and kill Slavic ukrainians(which won’t sit well with a lot of Russians), the odds go way lower.

""Why cant these idiots think for themselves?""

Suddenly while perusing the purpose build discussion thread on a specific topic he sees people asking questions explicitly related to the topic at hand.

""This is unbelievable! how dare these people attempt to break their ignorance and learn something I already know about! Can't these people use google!"" he thinks to himself.

Necorus sinks into his seat as he furiously hammers his keys, letting everyone know what he thinks of their low level conversations on the internet, how dare these anonymous people he has never met, nor will ever meet have the gull to ask questions. 

Necorus pisses his pants in a fit of rage, opening his window he spits on a group of small children, when their mother looks up and asks why he did that, Necorus simply yells ""GOOGLE IT YA DUMB BITCH"" and slams his window closed, the blinds crashing down.

The sound of the blinds crashing down reminds the others in the house Necorus exists, his wife yelling ""Honey what was that?"", shortly followed by his wife's boyfriend saying ""Never mind babe just get back to it"".

Putin is a pig, his soldiers are animals, the war is an atrocity. The cancer ward, the children's hospital, the attacks during seize fires and all the other war crimes are abhorrent. But it is not a geoncide!  Putin doesn't carpet bomb them into submission. He is not going to starve Mariupol to death. He lies and deceives, he steals and kills and sucks all around. But he is not trying to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. No matter how much the Russian army suck, they could've killed a hundred times more civilians so far. Why have they not even tried to do that, if this is an attempt at a genocide? They've been trying to take Ukraine for two weeks, with a full invasion, and ""only"" killed 1.000 civilians. This is not a genocide, it's just the totally immoral attempt of stealing a country's right to decide for themselves. The reason for the war isn't Putins hate for Ukrainians, it's Putins fear of losing Ukraine to the west. And money, of course. He will succeed with this, unfortunately. And he will do whatever he has to, in order to succeed, maybe even kill millions. But he hasn't done that yet and there is no reason to believe that that's his goal.

So you can't really judge land lost as a metric of Russian success. The major cities are the place Ukraine is intending to put up its actual fight. 

It makes Russia tanks less effective and easier to counter with the vast amount of AT weapons Ukraine now has. It will soak up Russia troops forcing more decisive battles in which Ukraine will have a homefield advantage. More troops need to siege a city means less troops to defend their supply lines making for easier targets. Cities are easier to defend then open fields especially in an area as flat as Ukraine reducing the effectiveness of Artillery and Air power. The land they traded for time was used to fortify Kyiv. Cities are easier to hide in. Allowing Ukraine to pick its battles, setup ambushes, and pick away at the Russian army. 

We won't know for sure how Ukraine is doing (normal people anyway) until the war is decided one way other the other. Ukraine is doing better then anyone expected. 

The war imo hasn't really been the actual war yet. It has been Skirmishes as Ukraine delays Russian advances on cities and takes attack of opportunity on weaker Russian units.  Russia is trying to soften up Ukrainian positions with air strike and Artillery while its ground forces get into siege positions. Russia is struggling to supply its advances to the Cities.

As he explains, the Russian aggression is not motivated by a fanatical ideology like the Nazis, but rather Russia is a mafia state controlled by wealthy and powerful people motivated by greed. They are not willing to die for Putin.

Essentially, he believes a No Fly Zone would show Putin the West is serious and a force to be reckoned with. In his eyes, the time for diplomacy and sanctions as effective tools is behind us.

It's preferential ignorance, because the worldview they espouse makes sense to them - and critically, because that means the world is, at its core, understandable as a whole. Most of the time, they know they're wrong. But they *need* to be right, because if they're not, then beyond just being unable to understand the world, they don't really matter to the world. And if they're just another bystander, they're unable to make sense of today and tomorrow. They need to be right, because if they're not, then they're unable to process their place in the world or have any control over what comes next. 

They've chosen a knowably false reality because being a scrappy rebel fighting against the world allows them to be the hero of the story, rather than just yet another meaningless NPC blown about by the whims of the world's events. It's narcissism masked by ignorance and fear. 

Is this an excuse? Fuck no.

Should the US just threaten Belarus to stay out of it then with nuclear threats? May as well keep it to a 1v1.

2. Ukraine's neighbors that are so incredibly powerful not taking a more active role for fear of nukes. Especially Germany, but also Poland and Turkey. War isn't something that can be nicely contained and Poland is already getting millions of incoming refugees and it'll only continue to grow. I'd expected huge humanitarian convoys to be going from Poland to provide support or through the Black Sea.

Also beyond that I have never understood limiting Immigration. Literally every single person I know that has immigrated to the US are some of the hardest working people I have ever met. Study after study shows that at least in the US immigrants are a huge economic boon for us. We give them a place to thrive and thrive they do. They are a huge part in my opinion of how the US became the power that it is. 

- Sergey Brin Founder of Google is a Russian Immigrant. 
- Einstein fled Germany to US
- Arnold Schwarzenegger  immigrated from Austria

Those are just some of the more well known ones. For each famous one you have millions of others that start successful businesses, become doctors, engineers, scientists. 

It is just stupid to stop our long tradition of being a land of immigrants.

If enough citizens act, they CAN fix this. Yeah it's awful, horrifying, terrifying and all things bad, but so is what's happening now and it's effecting 2 nations simultaneously. Well, actually, it's effecting damn near every nation on the planet, now.

But here's the thing. It's clear there are not enough citizens who care yet. It's also VERY clear that yes, this IS a war imposed on by their government and that it is NOT one that all of the citizens support, but there's a major problem, MAJOR problem *if* the number of people in Russia who support what their own government is doing is greater than the amount of those against it, then it has so much more fight to go through to help fix any of this that it my actually be impossible.

Hence my question as to whether or not they care yet. My wonder is *when* that care effects more than 50% of the people. I don't mean for the sake of voting since that's clearly been taken away from Russia quite a while ago (by Putin himself). I mean for forcing the issue publicly to such a degree that the ONLY entity in Russia that's for the war is then literally just the govt. and that not even 1 citizen is for it.

Once THAT happens, things should be able to move faster to a logical conclusion for current Russian leadership in that all other entities would have finally been painted into the tiniest possible corner and must now act for their own survival.

The Budapest Memo granted ""security assurances"" to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Those security assurances are defined as:

""Respect Belarusian, Kazakh and Ukrainian independence and sovereignty in the existing borders.

Refrain from the threat or the use of force against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.

Refrain from using economic pressure on Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine to influence their politics.

Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine if they ""should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used"".

Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.

Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments.""

In no way does this state the US or UK will ""defend Ukraine's territorial integrity"" or provide military assistance to Ukraine. Russia is the party in violation of this agreement.

That none of that matters because NATO is a defensive alliance, and it hasn't been attacked. 

**If** NATO did ever break it's own rules of existence and publicly stand behind an enforced NFZ then as of the very first confirmed enforceable event (shooting down the first Russian jet/heli) Russia have one choice to make - declare war on NATO (world war three that either ends in nuclear bombings or in the utter defeat of Putin's Russia) or accept they lose a slow, grinding fight in Ukraine as of that moment, and slowly turn into NK2.0. Putin, a man who is seemingly obsessed with some unification of the soviet people or some similar nonsense, won't do the latter when he's just been attacked.

>Essentially, he believes a No Fly Zone would show Putin the West is serious and a force to be reckoned with.

The US military was/is effectively the cornerstone upon which NATO relied upon for the bulk of its military abilities. To be clear, I'm not saying NATO nations didn't or don't contribute, but a key part of NATO planning has always been the assumption that the US military's logistical capabilities will be available if anything ever happened. The US Air Force maintains enough heavy lift cargo airplanes to establish a Berlin Airlift style operation with only days of notice.

With Trump in place saying things about the US withdrawing from NATO, suddenly everything was thrown into turmoil. It would break EVERY international norm that diplomacy is based on, but there was every reason to suspect that if NATO's Article 5 was triggered, Trump would refuse to answer it.

U.S., Allies Look at Sending Soviet-Designed Air-Defense Systems to Ukraine

WASHINGTON—The Pentagon is exploring ways to shore up Ukraine’s air defenses by facilitating the transfer of Soviet-designed antiaircraft equipment, according to U.S. and European officials.The U.S. is trying to determine which type of air-defense systems would work best, with Soviet-designed systems—ideally mobile ones—being the best option because they would require less training for the Ukrainians, a Pentagon official said.

They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago.The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.

A European diplomat said that Soviet-made systems like the S-300 would be easiest for the Ukrainians to integrate into their arsenal and employ quickly and effectively. The European diplomat suggested that the countries closest to Ukraine geographically that possess such systems could provide theirs to Kyiv on the understanding that other allies would replenish the countries’ stores with comparable systems.

“The Russians are changing their tactics, so the Ukrainians need to, too,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the House of Commons on Wednesday, calling Moscow’s airstrikes “indiscriminate and murderous.”

These shoulder-fired weapons, which are effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, are far less capable than the S-300.",False,1647026768.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i0a0p1o,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

To your point though, I think there is more nuance with destroying a nuke plant than the rest.  Are they intentionally destroying reactors to weaponize them, are they just trying to knock them out of service to cut power, or was it destroyed accidentally?  If the first, then that might warrant invading but that would probably be hard to conclusively prove and there are likely better ways to go about causing widespread ecological/radioactive problems.  For the others, it goes back to recklessness.  Also, it is possible to destroy a nuke plant without touching the reactors, although honestly that would be tough since you'd have to take out the control room and ancillary buildings while leaving the cooling systems in tact :P",False,1647023253.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i09n0pc,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,tbuihd,i09ozan,"Well it's important to keep in mind what the current strategy has the potential to accomplish.

Russia's economy is basically on hospice care and getting worse. Inside a couple weeks, they will have run out of most stored supplies that they can't replace in a timely fashion. Their currency is trash and once they start actually defaulting on debts over the next month it'll crash like never before. They won't be able to pay their own soldiers without using wheelbarrows of worthless cash.

In all likelihood they will either willingly withdraw (possibly post-coup) or will just completely collapse, which may result in civil war.

And none of that seriously exposes the rest of the world to the risk of nuclear war directly.

But the moment NATO intervenes militarily, that changes things. Suddenly there can be no delusions, not even to Putin, that Russia's conventional military is a threat. The Russian forces in and around Ukraine would be wiped off the map with near impunity. Even if it's only a no fly zone, NATO doctrine requires the destruction of ground based anti-air systems that can reach the relevant airspace.

At that point Russia's western border basically would lay completely exposed to attack. NATO could conceivably (but wouldn't) send non-stealth nuclear bombers across the border into Russian territory without any serious risk.

At that point Putin's responses fall into two broad categories. Surrender or attack. Even a gradual and staged withdrawal is just a slow pealing of the surrender band-aid.

And so attack is all that's left, and if his conventional forces are incapable of doing anything, that leaves one option. Nuclear.

So NATO's unwillingness to be more direct makes sense. Their current course of action WILL work, eventually. And there's effectively no risk of nuclear Armageddon for that route.",False,1647022077.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i09lkqx,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

------
>As American and UN soldiers were already deployed in the war on the South Korean side, it was virtually assured that Soviet forces could not engage in open and direct hostilities against the South without provoking conflicts with other UN countries. Instead, the Soviet Union was compelled to conceal its participation in the conflict (at least to the extent where Soviet involvement could still be plausibly denied by the Soviet government) so as to minimize the risk of escalating the ""Cold War"" into a ""Hot War"" with NATO and the United States and its allies elsewhere

-----
>In order to hide this direct Soviet intervention, precautions were taken to disguise their involvement, open knowledge of which would have been a major diplomatic embarrassment for the USSR.

>Soviet pilots wore Chinese uniforms when flying, whilst rules were prescribed to stop Soviet pilots flying near the coast or front lines (where they might be captured if shot down) and from speaking Russian on the aircraft radio. All aircraft flown carried Chinese or North Korean markings.[15] When not flying, for reasons of ethnicity, on the ground Soviet pilots 'played' the roles of Soviet commercial travelers rather than Chinese or North Korean soldiers.

Fair point. The vast majority of what I linked talks about the extends USSR went to to avoid open direct conflict with US. They didn't send ground troops and took great efforts to hide that they were soviet pilots. to the point that I wouldn't consider it a direct conflict. A direct conflict is open warfare which Soviets did not do in Korea.

If you didn't know someone in the middle east or knew the language it was tricky to understand what was going on. Hell I've been using Google translate a ton lately. Especially that live conversation translation. I've been following Ukraine since Crimea and my ability to figure stuff out has been insane compared to even 8 years ago. Tech has advanced and it allows regular civilians a view that is unmatched. I used to see the middle east videos from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and (1) couldn't always tell what was going on due to language and (2) when you did see a video, it often had the text in the video so I couldn't try to translate. They also had to downgrade a lot of videos to up link them from satellites out.

Geopolitically, this is different because you have two of the largest breadbaskets of Europe fighting. Also large oil producers. If you fuck with either, the world hurts. If you fuck with two simultaneously, then on day one commit war crimes and lie, it draws attention. If it costs the world a shitload of money, they'll definitely pay attention. And unfortunately when your economy isn't global or influential, it's easier to avoid a ton of spotlight and thus be less likely to get assistance.

They support democracy, except when people democratically elect people they don't like (south America in general), they support freedom, except when its inconvenient to support (slavery), they stand against genocide, except when its performed by people they either don't care about (Rwanda) or people they make money off of (Saudi Arabia and china). They support people's right to sovereignty, except when it inconvenience them (colonialism)

 >A military alliance is a formal agreement between nations  concerning national security. Nations in a military alliance agree to active participation and contribution to the defense of others in the alliance in the event of a crisis. In the event a nation is attacked, members of the alliance are often obligated to come to their defense regardless if attacked directly. In the aftermath of the Second World War military alliances usually behave less aggressively and act more as a deterrent.

They also have the same goals: the end of Western hegemony and a new world order comprised of great powers with regional spheres of influence, where the West is not the most important voice in world affairs, and in which the West cannot dictate or threaten what other countries do.

I do agree that the CCP is all about maintaining power. But what you have to understand is that for the CCP to maintain power, Western liberal democracy *must not triumph around the world*. Because if it did, then the CCP would be isolated - the only authoritarian regime in a world of liberal democracies. That's a very bad position for the CCP as the Chinese people will then wonder why their country is the only one that isn't a liberal democracy. For this reason, the CCP's goal is to ensure that liberal democracies do not grow too powerful. This applies double for the US and its allies, which actively promote liberal democracy around the world, including in China.

- A small ($47M) transfer occurred in 2018, but under the agreement Ukraine wasn’t allowed to actually have / use them, they had to sit in storage

- The significant sale (ie, the $400M one, nearly 10x bigger than the symbolic / unusable 2018 transfer) was withheld by Trump and used to try to blackmail Zelenskyy into smearing Trump’s political rival

Receipts: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/27/ukraine-us-arms-supply/

“Trump first approved the sale of $47 million worth of 210 Javelin missiles and 37 launchers to Ukraine in December 2017. Delivered in April the following year, they were not deployed to the front lines of the still-simmering separatist war. Under the terms of the sale, they were kept boxed in a military storage facility far from the front lines, where they were to serve symbolically as a “strategic deterrent” to Russia.

In the summer of 2019, Trump froze an additional $400 million in congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine, an action that later became a centerpiece in his first impeachment. Based in large part on a July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that year, in which Zelensky expressed interest in buying more Javelins, Trump deflected the request and instead asked Zelensky for the “favor” of digging up dirt against then Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter.”

> In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such."" These five acts were: killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group.

Putin has openly stated he does not believe Ukraine has a separate national identity to Russia, and that his objective is to unite the Ukrainian and Russian people as one.  That meets the test of ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national group as such"".

The acts that are being committed with that intent include at least three of the listed five: namely killing members of the group; causing them serious bodily or mental harm; and imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group.

So, whilst I too feel a bit uncomfortable with applying the label here, it does seem to me that what's taking place in Ukraine could meet the internationally accepted definition of genocide.",1647037448.0,1647037259.0,t3_tbuihd,t1_i0aq4ri,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Genocide is the intentional destruction of a people, usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group.

In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such"".
