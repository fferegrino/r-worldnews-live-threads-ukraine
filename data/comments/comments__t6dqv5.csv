""I spent a few hours watching Russian state media, the ones that are shown inside the country (Do not recommend). Here's what I learned:  


* ""How are our soldiers being welcomed in Ukraine"" asks the host of some military guy. ""We didn't expect this, we're welcomed as true liberators, with joyful tears and smiles, lots of greetings""  

* In another show, an expert says ""If god gave us a nuclear weapon, then we have to use it. How else are we gonna defend against NATO aggresion?""  

* Report from the warzone - Ukrainians are being called ""Nazbats"" - nazi battalions. Reporter is drawing schematics, showing that nazbats have no chance, they're surrounded and naziks (actual word) are not getting out. But they're (the nazis) aren't letting out peaceful citizens, there's guards next to schools, kindergartens and residential buildings ready to punish peaceful Ukrainian citizens for trying to leave. Nazbats are retreating, and pulling women and children in front of them as shields while doing so.  

* In a show hosted by Viktor Solovjov, Luhansk republic foreign relations advisor is horrified by Ukrainian brutality against their own people. Local officials, who just want to protect local citizens, immediately are branded as traitors. One mayor was murdered, the mob tore him apart, another was publicly lashed.  

* Russian general gives a report on Russian military heroism. Heroic senior sergeant Nimchenko tank destroyed 9 enemy armor units and killed 90 nationalists in 40 minutes. Another tank, commanded by senior lt. Starostin destroyed 8 BTR's and 100 nationalists while defending his position, not allowing the enemy to advance towards a bridge. During the battle he was attacked with American Javelins, got concussed, but continued to fight and destroyed to more tanks.  

* About inside enemies. Journalist is showing Echo Moskvy websites and says that Russia is doing the right thing by shutting down enemy propaganda. Talking about some ""war"", ""invasion"" while your soldiers are risking their lives protectint Ukrainian citizens is treason.  

* The world supports Russian politics, and is turning away from America. In Serbia, Montenegro, Venezuela people are going into the streets with Russian flags, meanwhile in the USA the gas prices are suddenly skyrocketing.  

* About patriotism in Achangelsk. People are massively refunding tickets to a Maksim Galkin concert, after he spoke out against the war. Interviewed citizens are furious, how is he an accomplished Russian/Ukrainian artist, how does he dare to speak like that when our men are defending our borders.  

* Archangelsk theater director is shown saying that the concert is canceled. Ovations and ""bravo"" shouts.  

* And the scariest thing, personally - video reports from schools.  

* Kids are having questions about what's happening in Ukraine and Donbas, they don't have a way to get information themselves, and online they constantly find fake info (Russian media says). That's why Russia started a national program - lectures ""My country"" and class meetings ""Historical truth"" where teachers are talking about events in Ukraine and Donetsk and Luhansk republics.  

* They're talking not only about peace, but also why the Kyiv regime is a threat to Russia, talking about Maidan events and Ukrainian brutalities. After a short speech by Putin, kids are invited to themselves answer why they think Russia is conducting a special operation. Kids are quickly raising hands.  

* ""Information was useful, because there's lots of misinformation on the internet"" - say  8th grader Olga Logvinova. This program has already been shown to over 1.5 million kids, and they all understand the situation perfectly.  

* Poll shows that over 90% of kids say that they now have a better understanding of the situation and that they understand that the final goal for Russia is Peace.  


And this is what they're showing on all TV channels, 24 hours per day. I'm going to the shower to was this mud off of me, but do you now understand why they'll never go out to protest in the Millions, and why Putins rating went up 11%?""",False,1646389394.0,t3_t6dqv5,t3_t6dqv5,,0,391,0,391,1,0,

c51014ebc84ac587e0f52d5010f13179,t6dqv5,hzaz3hp,"Here is a round-up of the main stories from the day so far:

A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said.

After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the fire was extinguished at 6.20am local time.

The power plant has reportedly now been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in ‚Äúfull 24/7 response mode‚Äù due to the ‚Äúserious situation‚Äù unfolding at Zaporizhzhia.
However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant‚Äôs reactors are ‚Äúprotected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down‚Äù.

Ukraine‚Äôs president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.‚Äù

Nato‚Äôs secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - the largest in Europe - highlight the ‚Äúrecklessness‚Äù of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs war.

Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said.

Russia‚Äôs communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations‚Äô websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‚Äòfalse information‚Äô, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine.

Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.

Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have ‚Äústalled‚Äù, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.

Vladimir Putin is ‚Äúat risk‚Äù of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday.

The Russian parliament has passed a law which makes it a criminal offence to spread ‚Äúfake‚Äù information about its armed forces.

The UN Human Rights Council has overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning the Russian invasion and setting up a commission to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Russia was left completely isolated, with only one other member state ‚Äì¬†Eritrea, voting against the resolution.

A commission of inquiry is the highest level of investigation the council can order ‚Äì there is one for Syria, now there will be one over Russia‚Äôs actions in Ukraine.

The outcome of the vote - 32 in favour, 2 against, and 13 abstentions - is a humiliation for Moscow.

China, Cuba, or¬†Venezuela¬†can usually be relied upon to back Russia - this time they abstained.

Russian advance on Mykolayiv has been halted, Zelenskyy adviser says

A Russian advance on the southern port city of Mykolayiv has been halted, an adviser to Ukraine‚Äôs president has said.

‚ÄúWe can feel cautious optimism about the future prospects of the enemy offensive ‚Äì I think that it will be stopped in other areas also,‚Äù Oleksiy Arestovych said in a televised briefing.

His remarks came after local authorities reported Russian troops had entered the ship-building hub on the Black Sea for the first time.

Governor Vitaliy Kim said fighting was under way in parts of the city. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not get nervous,‚Äù Kim said in a video statement shared online.

For those who don't know, in Soviet Union the army operated a certain way, in which you never served nearby your home; the USSR almost always sent everybody half a world away so as to avoid escaping from the army (especially as service was several years long and dedovshina was especially brutal). So it's very common to meet people in Caucasus or in one of the -stans, who say they served in the Baltics, and for our men to say they served back in Siberia, or one of the -stans etc. Very very common. 

Somebody noticed that in quite many of the captured/KIA photos where they show the identity documents, many of the captured/killed seem to have come to the front line from the far away areas - Caucasus, -stans, far East. 

Now, again, if you don't know Soviet history, but Soviets regarded some members more highly, others less highly. The most bullied, in it's most gentlest meaning, were those who were from states where people were considered ""blacks"" in Soviet Union. These are exactly the -stans, the North Caucasus etc. There was an internal hierarchy. 

The poster on social media commented that it seems the soldiers that have been sent over this time are exactly from those areas that in Soviet Union, the USSR considered ""less than"", expendable, not important.

**Ukraine: How might the war end? Five scenarios**
*By James Landale, 
Diplomatic correspondent*

`Published 16 hours ago`


Amid the fog of war, it can be hard to see the way forward. The news from the battlefield, the diplomatic noises off, the emotion of the grieving and displaced; all of this can be overwhelming. So let us step back for a moment and consider how the conflict in Ukraine might play out. What are some of the possible scenarios that politicians and military planners are examining? Few can predict the future with confidence, but here are some potential outcomes. Most are bleak.

**Short war**
>Under this scenario, Russia escalates its military operations. There are more indiscriminate artillery and rocket strikes across Ukraine. The Russian air force - which has played a low-key role so far - launches devastating airstrikes. Massive cyber-attacks sweep across Ukraine, targeting key national infrastructure. Energy supplies and communications networks are cut off. Thousands of civilians die. Despite brave resistance, Kyiv falls within days. The government is replaced with a pro-Moscow puppet regime. President Zelensky is either assassinated or flees, to western Ukraine or even overseas, to set up a government in exile. President Putin declares victory and withdraws some forces, leaving enough behind to maintain some control. Thousands of refugees continue to flee west. Ukraine joins Belarus as a client state of Moscow.

>This outcome is by no means impossible but would depend on several factors changing: Russian forces performing better, more of those forces being deployed, and Ukraine's extraordinary fighting spirit fading. Mr Putin might achieve regime change in Kyiv and the end of Ukraine's western integration. But any pro-Russian government would be illegitimate and vulnerable to insurgency. Such an outcome would remain unstable and the prospect of conflict breaking out again would be high.

**Long war**
>Perhaps more likely is that this develops into a protracted war. Maybe Russian forces get bogged down, hampered by low morale, poor logistics and inept leadership. Maybe it takes longer for Russian forces to secure cities like Kyiv whose defenders fight from street to street. A long siege ensues. The fighting has echoes of Russia's long and brutal struggle in the 1990s to seize and largely destroy Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.

>And even once Russian forces have achieved some presence in Ukraine's cities, perhaps they struggle to maintain control. Maybe Russia cannot provide enough troops to cover such a vast country. Ukraine's defensive forces transform into an effective insurgency, well-motivated and supported by local populations. The West continues to provide weapons and ammunition. And then, perhaps after many years, with maybe new leadership in Moscow, Russian forces eventually leave Ukraine, bowed and bloodied, just as their predecessors left Afghanistan in 1989 after a decade fighting Islamist insurgents.


**European war**

>Might it be possible this war could spill outside Ukraine's borders? President Putin could seek to regain more parts of Russia's former empire by sending troops into ex-Soviet republics like Moldova and Georgia, that are not part of Nato. Or there could just be miscalculation and escalation. Mr Putin could declare Western arms supplies to Ukrainian forces are an act of aggression that warrant retaliation. He could threaten to send troops into the Baltic states - which are members of Nato - such as Lithuania, to establish a land corridor with the Russian coastal exclave of Kaliningrad.

>This would be hugely dangerous and risk war with Nato. Under Article 5 of the military alliance's charter, an attack on one member is an attack on all. But Mr Putin might take the risk if he felt it was the only way of saving his leadership. If he was, perhaps, facing defeat in Ukraine, he might be tempted to escalate further. We now know the Russian leader is willing to break long-standing international norms. This same logic can be applied to the use of nuclear weapons. This week, Mr Putin put his nuclear forces on a higher level of alert. Most analysts doubt this means their use is likely or imminent. But it was a reminder that Russian doctrine allows for the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.

**Diplomatic solution**

>Might there, despite everything, still be a possible diplomatic solution?

>""The guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open,"" said UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres. Certainly dialogue continues. President Macron of France has spoken to President Putin on the phone. Diplomats say feelers are being stretched out to Moscow. And, surprisingly, Russian and Ukrainian officials have met for talks on the border with Belarus. They might not have made much progress. But, by agreeing to the talks, Putin seems to at least have accepted the possibility of a negotiated ceasefire. The key question is whether the West can offer what diplomats refer to as an ""off ramp"", an American term for an exit off a major highway. Diplomats say it is important the Russian leader knows what it would take for Western sanctions to lift so a face-saving deal is at least possible.

>**Consider this scenario.** The war goes badly for Russia. Sanctions begin to unsettle Moscow. Opposition grows as body bags return home. Mr Putin wonders if he has bitten off more than he can chew. He judges that continuing the war may be a greater threat to his leadership than the humiliation of ending it. China intervenes, putting pressure on Moscow to compromise, warning that it will not buy Russian oil and gas unless it de-escalates. So Mr Putin starts to look for a way out. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities see the continuing destruction of their country and conclude that political compromise might be better than such devastating loss of life. So diplomats engage and a deal is done. Ukraine, say, accepts Russian sovereignty over Crimea and parts of the Donbas. In turn, Putin accepts Ukrainian independence and its right to deepen ties with Europe. This may not seem likely. But it is not beyond the realms of plausibility that such a scenario could emerge from the wreckage of a bloody conflict.

**Putin ousted**

>And what of Vladimir Putin himself? When he launched his invasion, he declared: ""We are ready for any outcome.""

>But what if that outcome was him losing power? It might seem unthinkable. Yet the world has changed in recent days and such things are now thought about. Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at Kings College, London, wrote this week: ""It is now as likely that there will be regime change in Moscow as in Kyiv.""

>Why might he say this? Well, perhaps Mr Putin pursues a disastrous war. Thousands of Russian soldiers die. The economic sanctions bite. Mr Putin loses popular support. Perhaps there is the threat of popular revolution. He uses Russia's internal security forces to suppress that opposition. But this turns sour and enough members of Russia's military, political and economic elite turn against him. The West makes clear that if Putin goes and is replaced by a more moderate leader, then Russia will see the lifting of some sanctions and a restoration of normal diplomatic relations. There is a bloody palace coup and Putin is out. Again, this may not seem likely right now. But it may not be implausible if the people who have benefited from Mr Putin no longer believe he can defend their interests.

**Conclusion**

>These scenarios are not mutually exclusive - some of each could combine to produce different outcomes. But however this conflict plays out, the world has changed. It will not return to the status quo ante. Russia's relationship with the outside world will be different. European attitudes to security will be transformed. And the liberal, international rules-based order might just have rediscovered what it was for in the first place.

‚ÄúFrom this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there ‚Äì on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.

How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.‚Äú

1. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.

3. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

4. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.

> Soviet-era missiles were declared obsolete in 2014 and have become corroded in storage

> German plans to send thousands of anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine have been hit after it emerged some of them don‚Äôt work.

> The Soviet-made Strela missiles were part of communist-era East German stocks and have been in storage so long they are no longer operational.

> Germany reversed its longstanding ban on delivering weapons to conflict zones last week and pledged to send arms to Ukraine.

> The issue does not affect the first batch of German weapons supplies, which has already been delivered to Ukraine.

> A shipment of 1,000 anti-tank rockets and 500 fully operational US-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles was safely delivered this week.

> Berlin announced this week that it plans to follow it up with a delivery of 2,700 of the Strela missiles.

> But it has now emerged that 700 of the missiles are so badly damaged they are no longer operational.

> The German defence ministry was reportedly surprised by the government announcement, because the Strela missiles were declared obsolete and placed in storage in 2014. They are at least 35 years old and had been declared unsafe.

> The Ukrainian government reportedly specifically requested the missiles despite their age.

> But 700 are affected by tiny cracks which have led to corrosion and mean they cannot be used.

> Germany is expected to deliver the remaining 2,000 missiles despite the fact they are no longer considered safe to handle.

> A classified military document obtained by Spiegel magazine reads: ‚ÄúOwing to the obsolescence of the rocket motor, the Strela missile is no longer safe to handle, so it can no longer be fired.‚Äù

> The wooden boxes in which the missiles are stored are reportedly so mouldy that when they were last inspected in November troops had to wear protective equipment.

> The issue illustrates how badly depleted German weapons stocks have become following years of military underfunding.

> Olaf Scholz‚Äôs government has vowed to reverse that in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and last week announced a new ‚Ç¨100bn (¬£83bn) fund for defence spending.

> A defence ministry paper leaked to the German press called for ‚Ç¨20bn (¬£16.6bn) to replenish ammunition stocks alone.",False,1646397707.0,t3_t6dqv5,t3_t6dqv5,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Those things may be true, an almost 70 year old who probably didn't trust anyone to inject him with a vaccine and has other health issues if it's true *would* be concerned about Covid. And his face has changed appearing puffier like my Dad's did when he was on heavy steroids after finishing cancer treatment. His health may be declining  But I don't think it's *just* that.

But him giving the impression that he's lost the plot makes him seem more dangerous - a mentally ill man with so much power and has nothing left to lose is an incredibly dangerous man, couple that with ego, his intelligence, his wealth and the amount of people he has around him - he cannot be underestimated.

The world knows that NATO cannot do any more than they are already doing and it's devastating and really heartbreaking for Zelensky and his people.. But Putin only has to say the Nuclear word to get people panicking, he had the Trump Card, he doesn't ever want to use it. But of course, NATO has to cover all bases just in case.

This us just my opinion and how I see it and make sense of it. What we know about Putin is what Putin wants us to know.

I keep coming back to something he wrote in his book, I haven't read it, it was on a documentary, Frontline I think? When he was young he and his parents lived in a one room apartment and he was chased by a rat. He cornered the rat and it attacked (or jumped at him as he says) and he lives his life by that motto. Don't get me backed into a corner or I will jump. His Nuclear threat is so that he can't be backed into a corner.

I hope he finds a way to back out of the war while saving-face, because that's the only way he will stop.

I'm hoping, hoping, hoping and wishing so hard for the Ukranian's right now, they all have my heart.

The Russian officers involved made decisions based on their judgment that because there was nothing going between our countries it must be a false alarm. If that same accident happened today a different outcome might have occurred. The fact that the Russian early warning system does not give them comprehensive understanding of what is going on throughout the world when missiles are launched is extremely dangerous during periods like this.

Regarding Ukraine:

It seems situation is very bad and will only continue to deteriorate in the coming days.

It's really good that the West has put all those sanctions in place, and has started pouring aid (both humanitarian and in weapons) to Ukraine. But it's doubtful that this will prevent the fall of Ukraine.

The West (and here I mean NATO and EU) won't get involved in Ukraine because it would trigger WW3. Some like this and some don't, but personally I think it's a fact.

So what can the West do? Continue with the sanctions, continue with the humanitarian aid, and continue with the military aid as long as there are people able and willing to fight in Ukraine.

The sanctions must go on, not with the goal of hurting Russian people, that are mostly against this war, but with the goal of debilitating Putin and undermining his ability to wage war.

Regarding the West:

I hope this is really a wake up call, like Czechoslovakia was for France and UK in 1938. I just hope this wake up call doesn't come too late, like it did back in 1938. And I hope that this wake up call is not forgotten if Russia wins the war and then it seems to be peaceful with the rest of the world again.

EU has to understand that it needs a stronger army to defend its interests. EU also needs to understand that it cannot be so dependent in terms of industry and resources of countries like Russia or China. It can't be so dependent of USA either, in terms of economy and defense. It needs to stand for itself.

EU and NATO countries have to get ready to go to war if necessary. This means not only the countries getting ready in terms of equipment, but also people in these countries understanding that it's a distinct possibility that war will happen in the near future.",1646382696.0,1646381803.0,t3_t6dqv5,t3_t6dqv5,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

There was absolutely no chance of a nuclear meltdown or radiation release. Radiation levels have remained steady. People flipping out because of paranoia over nuclear power for a plant that is totally different in design from Chernobyl or Fukushima.

If it had been a fossil fuel plant it would received 1/100th the attention and we could have talked about far more alarming things that the Russians are doing.

It is not an RBMK reactor (like the one in Chernobyl) but a VVER. I don't know the exact details it is not my area of expertise, but last night I read about an expert (ex-Biden advisor) who said this is an VVER reactor. Much safer. And the only way disaster could happen is if they deliberately aim to do it, but that takes a really big number of steps to happen. The VVER has many failsafes and is built in a way to avoid disaster in most circumstances.

The only path to disaster is if the Russians were crazy enough to blow it up and cause harm to their own even. Which is unlikely. They only want it for strategic reasons I'd wager.

IMO, I feel like ceding Donbas and officially recognizing Crimea as a part of the Russian Federation is the only way forward because:

\- Ukraine will be able to exploit Russia's economic recovery period to push west, perhaps even join NATO. 

\- Crimeans seemed to have chosen Russia anyway.

If they can't formulate a compromise, how much more destruction and death are we going to see? Obviously, demilitarization is a definite no. Staying neutral is all well given their long term security will probably demand NATO membership (it should prevent Russia chipping off  more in future).

9e00ec65f65e77694758874bda3e238c,t6dqv5,hzb4c4a,"Both of these threads are absolutely fantastic from a true to life analysis of the Russian military as a whole. We‚Äôve seen Russia having massive logistical issues throughout this entire Ukrainian conflict. The Russians have historically had an issue when it comes to the logistical side of their military. There‚Äôs never enough, good enough, fast enough. This is just a reality of the state of the Russian military. The first poster is absolutely correct and it even goes beyond just the state of the vehicles off road capabilities and extends in large part as a good example of the state of the Russian military as a whole. During the heyday of the USSR, the Russian military was fierce, large, and modern. They had vast peer and near peer combat capabilities. Russian doctrine remained largely unchanged from the WW2 ‚Äúthrow enough bodies at a problem and it‚Äôs no longer a problem‚Äù mindset, but it didn‚Äôt matter because they had massive numbers of weapons systems (especially armor) that met or exceeded the capabilities of the systems they‚Äôd encounter in a war in Europe. 

As we know following the fall of the USSR, loss of the Baltic states, and formation of the Russian federation, Russia has encountered a myriad of problems with corruption, decay, and a struggling economy. Due to these issues we‚Äôve seen a Russian military that is unable to modernize or maintain their equipment, and a military that in large part isn‚Äôt able to afford the same level of training on that equipment as its western counterparts. This leads to inexperienced troops with equipment that is in often very poor condition. Those issues coupled with a force that is largely conscripted leads to a huge turnover of trained troops lost annually. The Russian special operations community does tend to be counted among the best, however, SOF isn‚Äôt going to win a war by itself, especially against an insurgent style resistance without support from the rest of the military as a whole. 

Doctrinally Russias military, again, hasn‚Äôt really altered their tactics from WW2 in any tangible sense. Russian forces for the most part aren‚Äôt geared to address a more modern conflict. What we are seeing here is 4th and 5th generation warfare. It‚Äôs a departure from what we think of traditionally when we think of war (think WW2). Warfare is no longer massive armies facing off in all out combat to capture and hold territory. What we see now is hybrid warfare that is largely focused on information warfare and influencing public opinion through propaganda and psychological operations. This is further exacerbated by the style of defense being mounted by Ukraine. Ukraine is for lack of a better term mounting a hybrid-insurgency operation that focuses on hit and run tactics and utilizing traditional military assets for support when possible. The West has been absolutely pouring modern weaponry into Ukraine since the previous administration in Ukraine was ousted and to a greater extent following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This has allowed the Ukrainians access to weaponry that was specifically developed in many instances to counter Russian armored capabilities. They‚Äôve utilized small ‚Äúhunter killer‚Äù teams very effectively. Again, as I mentioned earlier, the Russian military isn‚Äôt geared towards this type of conflict. There is a small fraction of Russian troops that have been fighting in Syria and are more familiar with an insurgent style opponent, but in large part the experience base isn‚Äôt there. 

Unfortunately Russia has a massive advantage when it comes to sheer numbers they can bring to bear. The question is how willing will they be to continue to allocate those troops and more importantly, are they able to support those forces economically and logistically. The Ukrainians are mounting an absolutely textbook defense against a larger conventional force. Regardless of the outcome they will make it very costly for the Russian forces to take the country, and an even more difficult time fighting the subsequent insurgency. 

TL;DR: The Russian military is nowhere near what it used to be, and they aren‚Äôt equipped or trained to fight this type of conflict. We will continue to see heavy Russian losses",False,1646396779.0,t3_t6dqv5,t1_hzazh9t,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

* He believed Russia would be able to quickly overwhelm and take control of Ukraine.
* He believed the rest of the world would not be able to react quickly (In large part because of all the discord Russia sowed, with things like getting trump elected and Brexit).
* He believed that even if sanctions were put in place they would be ""more of the same"" and he would still be able to make use of his war chest.
* The sanctions would be only from ""the west"" and china would support Russia.
* The sanctions wouldn¬¥t last long since Russia is a big player in many markets (e.g. energy, Grains) and would be a bigger one with Ukraine annexed. 

All of the above have been proven wrong to varying degrees, however it is easy to see how Putin could have believed them (e.g.: Germany was slow to act due to Nordstream, and Brazil refuses to condemn russia, in part because it is politically powerful agricultural sector is heavily dependent on Russia for fertilizer), and in that case the invasion makes a lot of sense. Add to that the fact no moral argument would dissuade him from doing this since Putin has no morals, and does not care about ethics.

- Executions of ''collaborators'' and civilians killed, mistaken as saboteurs.

- Civilians blocking and protesting military hardware moving through their streets, being pushed back with teargas.

- Reports of plans to begin public executions in occupied cities to create order.

- Reports of rapes.

- Deliveries of weaponry to a warzone by nations with laws on the books stopping this.

- Confiscation of private citizens/companies property both in Russia/Ukraine and in the West, without due process.

- Sanctions against a central bank of a nation, making unavailable their monetary reserves.

NASDAQ also canceled trading. The New York Stock Exchange Building was then evacuated as well as nearly all banks and financial institutions on Wall Street and in many cities across the country. The London Stock Exchange and other stock exchanges around the world were also closed down and evacuated in fear of follow-up terrorist attacks. The New York Stock Exchange remained closed until the following Monday. This was the third time in history that the NYSE experienced prolonged closure, the first time being in the early months of World War I and the second being March 1933 during the Great Depression. Trading on the United States bond market also ceased; the leading government bond trader, Cantor Fitzgerald, was based in the World Trade Center. The New York Mercantile Exchange was also closed for a week after the attacks.

Here's the thing: it wouldnt necessarily.

Russia and the US have been in multiple proxy wars before, with one or the other directly fighting while the other was supporting another country fighting. Neither side pulled the trigger on nukes then, even when losing, because they knew MAD applied. The same principles would apply even if both had troops in the game.

If things spiraled all the way up into a direct conventional war with russia over Ukraine or if Russia broadened the war into NATO allies, likely neither side would pull the trigger on nukes.

Here are some sources regarding his ties to Russian funding.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine

>China ‚Äì Chinese leader and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on 25 February, that China supported Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation.[41][42] President Putin told Paramount leader Xi that ""Russia is willing to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine.""[43] China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said that ""We believe that all countries should solve international disputes by peaceful means in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.""[44] The Chinese government refused to give a ""yes/no"" answer to whether the Russian military operation is an invasion on 24 February press release, but does compare it with the 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan, a neighbor of China. The spokesperson confirmed its praise on France and Germany's ""a lot of efforts through diplomatic mediation in order to ease the tension"" and accused the United States of agitating for war.[45] In a statement released on 25 February, China said that Ukraine's territory and sovereignty should be respected and urged talks between Ukraine and Russia as soon as possible.[46] Shortly after, PRC Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi stated that China has a clear position respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries, including Ukraine.[46][47] Various state media in Beijing quoted Scholz' description of the day of invasion as ""a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.""[48]


>India ‚Äì Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for an immediate cessation of violence in Ukraine in a phone call to Putin on 24 February. He also raised concern for the safe exit and return of 18,000 Indian students in Ukraine. The Indian government has refrained from taking a stand on the issue.[49] Earlier that day, the Ministry of External Affairs had announced that ""India is closely following the development of events in the region"". India is also considering setting up a mechanism to trade with Russia using rupees to avoid the effects of sanctions on trade between the two countries.[50] Russia provides about 70% of Indian arms and has had close relations since the Cold War. India was the only member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue not to ban Russian exports. However, India also needs U.S. assistance to counter China, which it regards as its biggest threat. An analyst from the Centre for Policy Research noted, ""India has never been caught in this kind of an either-or situation. It's the biggest diplomatic challenge since the Cold War."" The Ukrainian ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, told reporters in India that he is ""deeply dissatisfied"" with India's position.[51] India abstained from the United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Russian invasion.[52]",False,1646397587.0,t3_t6dqv5,t1_hzb3mgj,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

They consider themselves to be the epicenter of both Europe and Asia. They refer to Moscow as the third Rome. The true successor of Rome and Constantinople. Consequently, they also see the Russian orthodoxy has the one true Christian faith as well. That makes them the self appointed political and spiritual center of the Old World.

There's a reason why Putin, who has repeatedly admitted that he never truly bought into Soviet Style communism, still thinks that the dissolution of the USSR was the greatest tragedy for Russia; and that's because it stripped Russia of its prominence on the world stage.

The man truly believes in Russian exceptionalism. He believes Russia not being the predominant power is a tragedy, because Russia, *in his opinion*, is entitled to have that role. It's their birthright.

So it shouldn't be that surprising to see these events unfold. It's also what makes it so difficult to predict what comes next. How many hold this ideal in his country, and amongst his ranks? It's not like he's special in this regard.

We have no clue how far he is willing to go, and we also have no clue how fanatical his potential replacements could be either.

 >The Highway of Death (Arabic: ÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ™ ·π≠arƒ´q al-mawt) is a six-lane highway between Kuwait and Iraq, officially known as Highway 80.

 >The United Nations Security Council ""veto power"" is the power of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to veto any ""substantive"" resolution. However, a permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. This veto power does not apply to ""procedural"" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors.

 >Wooden language is language that uses vague, ambiguous, abstract or pompous words in order to divert attention from the salient issues. The French scholar Fran√ßoise Thom identified four characteristics of wooden language: abstraction and the avoidance of the concrete, tautologies, bad metaphors, and Manichaeism that divides the world into good and evil. The phrase is a literal translation of the French expression langue de bois which appears to have been coined by Georges Clemenceau in 1919, and became widely used during the 1970s and 1980s after being brought back into French from Russian via Polish.

 >The madman theory is a political theory commonly associated with US President Richard Nixon's foreign policy. Nixon and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think he was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response. Some international relations scholars have been skeptical of madman theory as a strategy for success in bargaining.

On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm. .

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

 >A loitering munition (also known as a suicide drone or kamikaze drone) is a weapon system category in which the munition loiters (waits passively) around the target area for some time and attacks only once a target is located. Loitering munitions enable faster reaction times against concealed or hidden targets that emerge for short periods without placing high-value platforms close to the target area, and also allow more selective targeting as the attack can easily be aborted. Loitering munitions fit in the niche between cruise missiles and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), sharing characteristics with both.

Americans got spoiled by Iraq and Afghanistan. We think wars are voluntary affairs that we can quit at any time and which happen truss kid miles away to someone else. Yes we can lose lives, but we lose professional volunteers and fight elsewhere and can quit if we want and no one in Dallas or Cincinnati or wherever is affected unless they knew one of the rare (relatively speaking) casualties.

But if a real war happens between US and Russia, it could be fought here. It coulr be one you can't just quit when you're done. It could be the case that we can choose to not rush to war, but we can't choose to not be at war once it starts.

Finnish defence forces is basically setup for one purpose only, to retaliate an invasion from the east.

If Russia has trouble in Ukraine, then invading us is even harder. Finland is a lot harder terrain. Soviet Union thought they were gonna march in and be in Helsinki very fast, but that never happened.

Fauci is essential to the stability and growth of our civilization. Without Fauci, frankly Humanity would be stuck banging rocks together like a bunch of Putin Supporting Fascists. I love Fauci

With ten votes in favour and five abstentions, the UN Security Council's intent was to have ""an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute ‚Äúcrimes against humanity‚Äù . . .
 
**[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_intervention_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina)** 
 
 >The NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a series of actions undertaken by NATO whose stated aim was to establish long-term peace during and after the Bosnian War. NATO's intervention began as largely political and symbolic, but gradually expanded to include large-scale air operations and the deployment of approximately 60,000 soldiers under Operation Joint Endeavor.

It's also EXTREMELY bad optics to try to actively destroy the plant. I know that the general rhetoric is that Putin is insane and he doesn't care about optics, but he clearly cares enough to put himself on TV and try to drum up some nationalistic pride.

If the Russians back home found out that their military actively tried to destroy a power plant regardless of justification, it would likely cause greater division. Chernobyl isn't out of the public consciousness, and I would be willing to put money on the fact they are just as scared of the word 'nuclear' as the west is.

Nukes? By that logic what is the point on existing though? Im just saying to you that responding harsh right now for Ukraine just because they have nukes is foolish and I guess I'm right because its the literal stance from every country in the world.

 >The water-water energetic reactor (WWER), or VVER (from Russian: –≤–æ–¥–æ-–≤–æ–¥—è–Ω–æ–π —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä; transliterates as vodo-vodyanoi enyergeticheskiy reaktor; water-water power reactor) is a series of pressurized water reactor designs originally developed in the Soviet Union, and now Russia, by OKB Gidropress. The idea of such a reactor was proposed at the Kurchatov Institute by Savely Moiseevich Feinberg. VVER were originally developed before the 1970s, and have been continually updated. As a result, the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation I reactors to modern generation III+ reactor designs.

The hypothetical situation which Putin talks about here is that someone is trying to ""annihilate Russia"" - not ""attacks Russia"" or ""if the Russian government changes"" - it *might* be possible that he takes it that way - but that's pure speculation.

""To strike Kharkiv and say that it was Russia. Ukraine is hitting its own and is lying to the West. But is it possible to deceive the people?"" it asks.""

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. Then-prime minister Vladimir Putin's handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months. The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September.

Secondly, because genocides happen elsewhere we should just let that one slide as well? Whats one more, right?

How? Because you havent addressed the core point of my post - what is really difference between Putin invading Ukraine or the baltics, since the rationale behind the decision to not intervene in Ukraine wouldnt just disappear.

So if you take that into account, are you really 100% confident that NATO would fight back? Again, Putin will have the threat of nuclear warfare regardless.

My thinking is France would form a European alliance, due to their nuclear arsenal, and UK and US would team up. Varying remaining members would choose one side or the other. Then nuclear arms race. I just don't think that NATO would choose nuclear war over nuclear proliferation.

That goes onto the second part of the equation in this, for me. What deters Putin from invading a member-state is the, ideally, high probability of article 5 being activated. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel its safe to say that NATO's desire to go to war against a nuclear power lies in its confidence such a war would not escalate to nuclear war. Maybe in addition to the war possibly being contained to a singular theater, much less influential than nuclear war though. If NATO members A) see Putin to no longer be rational and B) do not trust Russian military to overthrow Putin in a first-strike order, then their assessment of a first-strike risk has to change. In effect lowering the probability of NATO coming to the defense of certain members. Thus creating an opportunity for Putin to exploit NATO's perception of him and his country. Reportedly, Putin is already beginning to be seen as irrational. Maybe old age, maybe too much time in power, who knows. Also, if the military does not overthrow Putin in reaction to the crippling sanctions and the costly invasion of Ukraine, then the assessment of that happening down the line deteriorates too.

edit: Now this is in deep leftfield of a thought, but the only way I can see this invasion of Ukraine to be a somewhat rational decision by Putin is if there are significant intangible benefits.

And no this does not relate to my opinion on the invasion, it still remains unjustful Putin is a fucking dictator and Ukraine deserves all the support. But still one has to understand that both sides have strategies in regards to their PR.

And before you claim rising radiation levels, which I believehave been confirmed as not true aswell. Some of the sensoring system has been destroyed and in an area with a lot of gunfire, explosions etc. sensors are likely to pick up even the smallest change and give off false alarms, even tobacco contains radioactivity at small levels. It's like puffing a ciggarette into a pollution sensor and claiming a whole area is polluted.

A nuclear reactor can easily withstand that sort of artilerry and even rpgs will do nothing to it. Now if Russia started dropping ICBMs on it then we should start to worry. Also of some of the reactors were on maintenance and the building burning was literally just some adminitrative fallacy. I could go on and on.

Even after carefully reviewing the video with your interpretation in mind, I'm still having a hard time seeing it as sensational or clickbait. I'm really trying here, but objectively, I can't see it.


> throwing out that there is ""a 40 mile Russian armored convoy"" when they rush into the camera like its ""urgent"" new news

I don't see them _rush_ into the camera, nor is there any indication to me that the statement is intended as breaking or 'new news'. It's true he walks onto the scene, but it doesn't appear to be at a hurried or 'urgent' pace. For sake of argument, if they started the shot completely in frame and didn't walk on scene, would it no longer be sensational?

I'm also unclear about you (seemingly) arrived at a conclusion that the video is conveying urgency. I would agree there is a tone of _seriousness_ in how it starts, but this is quickly broken within the exact same first 10 seconds of the video when he cracks a joke at his upside-down photograph. The quick change in tone creates the humorous effect; without the initial serious tone, the humor would not have been there. Overall, I would describe the first 20 seconds as mostly jovial, particularly considering the subject matter, certainly not urgent.

It also later becomes clear to me that he is 'in costume' in the opening of the video and not dressed in military attire because he's some weirdo incel that does that unironically (which is totally what I initially thought, tbh). Regular viewers of this content (now an ""episode 3"" apparently) would have probably recognized that element immediately, knowing that he's trying to do a humorous bit. Still, even without that context, it's hard to spot _sensationalism_ or clickbait in the first 10 seconds. There is a statement of fact, no speculation, no exaggeration.

> clickbait the watcher into sticking around

I would also disagree that the creator is engaging in ""clickbait"" content, which as I understand usually pertains mostly to titles and thumbnails. But even the opening statements seem to appropriately stage the analysis that is presented in the following content, which appears to be mostly about the Russian positioning and movements of that convoy.

The title of this video (""_Russo-Ukraine War: What the West Doesn't Understand EP 3_"") doesn't seem to indicate that they are breaking 'new news'. In fact, it's pretty  easy to draw the conclusion that they're simply describing all the big things that happened since their 'Episode 2'. Nor does the title contain sensationalisms, nor does it particularly convey urgency to me. The thumbnail of this video does not contain sensationalisms or depictions not commensurate with the video content.

I‚Äôll give you a hint, the deal was brokered by US Senator Charlie Wilson. This is matter of the west not being willing to send their sons and daughters to die when arming Ukrainians could do the trick. Why would we escalate to a conflict that could end up with tens of thousands of our own being killed if arming Ukrainians is enough, especially considering that Ukraine is not a member of our defense pact?
