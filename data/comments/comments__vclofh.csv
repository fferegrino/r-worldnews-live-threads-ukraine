General Mark Milley, the Chief of Staff of the US Army, has offered an insight into American intelligence on the war in Ukraine.

As Western defence secretaries gathered to discuss the conflict, he said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's estimates of between 100 to 200 Ukrainian military casualties each day were ""in the ballpark of our actual assessments"".

However, he refused to give more details for security reasons.

He also said a significant proportion of Russia's armoured force has been lost - an estimated 20 to 30%.

Asked whether Ukraine's casualties are sustainable, he said: ""This is an existential threat. They're fighting for the very life of their country. So, your ability to endure suffering, to endure casualties is directly proportional to the object to be attained.""

Therefore if the goal is the survival of your country, he said, it will be sustained as long as you have the leadership and military means.

Day 112 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was again pretty quiet today, until recently. There were some reports of explosions around 10pm, but we didn’t hear them here. Then there were again explosions reported around midnight, but there were no confirmed missiles launched from Belgorod, that’s 2 days in a row now. 

Then about an hour ago, at 3am, people reported big explosion, not sure what it was, apparently there was a cloud of smoke from it, but we couldn’t hear, nor see it here either. At 3:30am there was yet another very loud explosion, we did hear that one, but we are not sure what was hit yet.

Funny thing is you know how Russians always say they don’t shell cities and don’t kill civilians? Well, there’s one very effective method to make them admit that they do indeed destroy our cities. All you have to do is say that their weapons, that they are so proud about, are in fact just old garbage, it’s that easy. 

It triggers them so much that they will go from defending their actions to defending their weapons in an instant. We see that behavior everywhere, from our ex-friends from Russia and from random Russians on social media, and in comments under YouTube videos. Many of our ex-friends don’t believe that their military is using Grads, because as they say themselves “Grads are old garbage, we don’t use them.” 

Then some random people in comments while defending their weapons literally say “didn’t you see how we destroyed Mariupol, how can you say our weapons are old garbage?” Wait, but didn’t Russia say that it’s actually Ukrainian Nazis that destroyed Mariupol, what do you mean Russians did it? 

Seriously, all you have to do is insult their weapons and they will spill all the truth, because they are so proud about their weapons, that they just can’t stand seeing them belittled, they will defend them even if it means admitting their war crimes. It’s hilarious how they will do anything to protect their weapons.",False,1655343735.0,t3_vclofh,t3_vclofh,,0,85,0,85,2,0,

Russia is looking at record oil revenues because even $80 is well over their historical average, but if you look at the trends leading into the war it’s clear that they would have had even a better year without the invasion if they were just selling at market prices without the discounts they are forced to apply now. The invasion effectively added ~$20 to the global price of oil but subtracted ~$15 from the price of Russian oil.

A couple of things I thought interesting:

>Let me also thank Slovakia, which announced a significant donation of Mi-series helicopters and of urgently needed rocket ammunition. And we also discussed important new artillery donations from many countries, including Canada and Poland and the Netherlands. 

>So on the -- on your question of the Donbas, but on the numbers, just real quick. I'm not sure where the number -- what you're referring to, but I've talked to General Zaluzhnyi, and we get lists. These are official requests from their Department of Defense. They asked for 10 battalions of artillery; 12 battalions of artillery were delivered. Again, I'd say 97,000 antitank systems. That's more anti-tank systems than tanks in the world. They asked for 200 tanks; they got 237 tanks. They asked for 100 infantry fighting vehicles; they got over 300. We've delivered, roughly speaking, 1,600 or so air defense systems and about 60,000 air defense rounds. This is -- when I say ""us"", I mean the international community. You're looking at 260 artillery tube systems. Either rocket or tube artillery have been already delivered. There's 383 committed, and like I said, almost half a million rounds of artillery.

>So you're looking at probably 300 or 400 artillery tubes, not rocket artillery but tubes, that'll be provided in total to the Ukrainians. And then on top of that will be the long-range rocket artillery that -- what you're seeing with the HIMARS is just the beginning.",False,1655328891.0,t3_vclofh,t3_vclofh,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

The pair discussed the situation in Ukraine, as the war with Russia continues on for a 112th day.

Mr Iohannis insisted that Ukraine should be granted candidate status for the European Union ""as soon as possible"".

After talks with Mr Macron, he said: ""In my opinion, the candidate status must be granted as soon as possible, it is a correct solution from a moral, economic and security perspective.""

For context: The EU Commission is shortly expected to decide whether or not to recommend that Ukraine be granted candidate status for membership.

It is set to debate the issue at a summit on 23 and 24 June - and the recommendation must be unanimously approved.

From CNN's Michael Conte

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that despite Russian forces outnumbering and outgunning the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, Russian consolidation of their control in eastern Ukraine was “not a done deal.” 

“There are no inevitabilities in war. War takes many, many turns. So I wouldn’t say it’s an inevitability,” said Milley, before granting that “the numbers clearly favor the Russians.”

Milley said that the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk “is probably three quarters taken or so by Russian forces,” but that “the Ukrainians are fighting them street by street, house by house.”

He also characterized the current phase of the war as a “very severe battle of attrition, almost World War I-like,” noting how Russian progress in the region has been “very slow, a very tough slog.”

“The Russians have run into a lot of problems. They’ve got command and control issues, logistics issues. They’ve got morale issues, leadership issues and a wide variety of other issues,” said Milley. “And the Russians have suffered tremendous amounts of casualties.”

People in the embattled city of Mariupol are fighting back against Russian occupation, according to Mariupol's mayoral adviser Petro Andryushchenko.

The city was bombarded by Russian forces for weeks and became the scene of Ukraine's worst humanitarian disaster before it eventually fell to Moscow last month.

But Mr Andryushchenko has written on Telegram that residents ""did not accept the occupation"" and are causing unrest.

Two tow trucks and three other large vehicles were set on fire last week in the car park of the Russian Emergencies Ministry, he said.

He also described the fatal stabbing of a Russian ministry employee as a crowd waited for humanitarian aid near the metro station.

From CNN's Betsy Klein.

US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Wednesday ahead of an announcement of $1 billion in security assistance and other humanitarian assistance for Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.  

“I reaffirmed my commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression,” Biden said in a statement. 

He continued: “I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas. We also discussed Secretary Austin’s efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional international support for the Ukrainian armed forces.”

The US will also provide $225 million in humanitarian assistance, which Biden said will go toward “supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items.”

What’s the rush?

A lot of the doomsayers seem to be talking like Ukraine is about to collapse. I don’t see that.

Russia has moved to using huge amounts of artillery as its main weapon, which is a very expensive exercise. 

Yes, Russia has lots of shells and artillery pieces. Russia has been shelling Severodonesk for a month now and Ukraine is still there. Even putting casualties aside, the cost of the ordinance and the wear on Russia’s equipment as they fire literally thousands of times is significant. 

Sure, Russia has huge stockpiles of shells and guns, but they aren’t limitless.

Russia has already scorched its best tanks and lost its elite fighting units. What happens when it’s artillery begins to falter?

That’s the beauty of sanctions. Russias ability to replenish its equipment stocks long term is severely diminished.

Despite Russian hopes, I don’t see Europe and the USA tiring of giving military aid to Ukraine. In fact, as countries like Germany, Poland and France ramp up their military industrial complexes more heavy weapons will flow. Time will also allow Ukrainians to become trained on ever more effective systems.

Now that Russia’s advances have ground down to a pace where they are at best ‘incremental’, it seems to me that time is Ukraine’s friend in this war.

Ukraine has made it clear what’s its goals are - retaking all of the Donbas and Crimea. There seems to be no need for a timeline.",False,1655329728.0,t3_vclofh,t3_vclofh,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

USSR Soviet Union 2.0 is not far away along with a new potential cold war and nuclear arms race with the West **IF** Russia take Ukraine and all the riches and manpower that come with it.

The message that we need to send is that evil will not be tolerated, and imperialistic land grabs and resource theft will be responded to. There are some appeasers in the West who want to allow Putin to do what he wants 'in case it escalates'. The escalation will be so much more severe if Putin is allowed to succeed.

The Ukranians see themselves as a sovereign nation and don't want to be subdjucated. The West need to grow a backbone and send all the heavy weaponry that Ukraine needs, including the longer range missiles. That the Ukranians want to fight is a godsend for the West who have been handed a massive opportunity to counter - take it and use it, stop your posturing and prattling you spineless fools.

We could easily have been in a situation where Ukraine surrendered and chose not fight - and right now Russia would be massively more powerful with it's eyes set on it's next target.

Whilst I'm on this rant - a quick word about some of our politicians in the West. Russian propaganda is powerful - they take it seriously and spend huge amounts of their State resources in order to influence the West.

Marine Le Pen (French far right) admitted recently they have borrowed a lot of money from Russia.

We already know this is true with Trump world looking for financing from Russia. Some of his former staff have said that he would have pulled the USA out of NATO (he doesn't need congressional approval to do it). Can you imagine? He saves some grace however for supporting the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 (Democrats & Republicans were united on this). Can you believe it? The Americans telling Europeans that their security would be undermined if it went ahead, oh boy how right they were.

Conservatives in the UK have received Russian money but thankfully it seems they have not been bought it, although Russian meddling with Brexit has been proven.

I don't know what's going with the Italian far right who were recently revealed to have been in Russia, and let's not even get into the German mess that is the Nord Stream 2 and the really shady involvement with Russia that pipline politicians have.

Don't underestimate the power that Russia wields by lending this money - it's both the carrot & stick. Not only is there the promise of further riches for these people, there's the threat that at any moment the loans can be recalled which will mean disaster for those that are borrowing it.

Russia 1.0 is showing it's hand with this invasion, can you imagine when it becomes Russia 2.0? The safest world is one in which Russia loses this war.",1655289618.0,1655288806.0,t3_vclofh,t3_vclofh,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany are deeply committed to supporting Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's unprovoked invasion.  Russia has shifted its focus to the Donbas region, where it is engaging in a systematic long-range rocket and artillery barrage against defensive Ukrainian military positions and civilian infrastructure alike. 

To help Ukraine defend its citizens and sovereign territory, the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have committed to provide Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) with Guided MLRS (GMLRS) rockets. Ukraine has specifically requested this capability, which will allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to engage the invading force with accurate fire at ranges of approximately 70 kilometers.  

The United States announced on June 1, 2022 that it would provide four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and GMLRS munitions.  On June 6, the United Kingdom announced it would donate three M270 MLRS launchers with GMLRS munitions. 

And today, at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, Belgium, Minister of Defense Christine Lambrecht announced that Germany would transfer three M270 Mittleres Artillerie Raketen System (MARS) launchers and GMLRS ammunition from Bundeswehr stocks. 

The transfer of these MLRS systems, and the associated training our three countries will provide to Ukrainian operators is crucial to Ukraine's self-defense. The necessary training has already begun on the U.S. HIMARS and UK M270 systems for their deployment in the coming weeks, and training on the German MARS launchers will begin very soon so the systems and their Ukrainian crews can be deployed urgently and without delay.",False,1655324260.0,t3_vclofh,t1_ichvaft,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Except that every time Ukraine bumps up the number of KIA and WIA they say they're having in the Donbass, we have to wonder if it's really that bad or if they're purposely exaggerating or some combination of both.

Here's the problem...

1. Ukraine has a lot of will to win.
2. Ukraine has a lot of men.
3. You can't win a war with sheer will power alone.
4. You can't win a war if you don't have men to send in.

[200-500 KIA + the WIA](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/15/ukraine-1000-casualties-day-donbas-arakhamia) is a terrible attrition rate to try and hold onto an area that isn't really valuable to the Russians to begin with, but is costing you your guys that would, ideally, be rotated out to help train the rest of the saps you mobilized that have no prior training or experience.

So, come time for the offensive, you're left with people who are all green. And some people who know what they're doing.

And even if they have the firepower, do they have the men they need to take back the Donbass? With the training needed? Maybe the South, sure. The Russians are losing ground there, albeit slowly.

A successful offensive is predicated on both:

1. Effective use of your firepower.
2. A ground force well equipped and trained.
3. Both coordinating together effectively to achieve goals.

If Ukraine's losing 200 guys a day that they can't replace, and 50,000 are in the hospital by the end of Summer, you're slowly losing that #2 requirement.",1655332697.0,1655332503.0,t3_vclofh,t1_iciahaw,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

A commercial drone while less accurate bombs still has better cameras and scouting capabilities + re-usable so they get way more bang for the buck.

>Top US general: Russian control of eastern Ukraine not ""an inevitability""

>Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that despite Russian forces outnumbering and outgunning the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, Russian consolidation of their control in eastern Ukraine was “not a done deal.” 

>“There are no inevitabilities in war. War takes many, many turns. So I wouldn’t say it’s an inevitability,” said Milley, before granting that “the numbers clearly favor the Russians.”
Milley said that the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk “is probably three quarters taken or so by Russian forces,” but that “the Ukrainians are fighting them street by street, house by house.”

>He also characterized the current phase of the war as a “very severe battle of attrition, almost World War I-like,” noting how Russian progress in the region has been “very slow, a very tough slog.”

>“The Russians have run into a lot of problems. They’ve got command and control issues, logistics issues. They’ve got morale issues, leadership issues and a wide variety of other issues,” said Milley. “And the Russians have suffered tremendous amounts of casualties.”",False,1655324695.0,t3_vclofh,t1_icht8uf,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Because Brent and WTI is the USA's price of oil. And Russia is somewhere else, and sanctioned from our economy.

You know that WTI is literally in Oklahoma, right? (Cushing, Oklahoma). When you order 100-barrels of WTI, it will be delivered in Cushing Oklahoma, period. This is completely useless to a Russian.

The _contracts_ of deliveries are bought / sold all across America, because there's so many people who go to Oklahoma to pick up oil that WTI contracts pretty much trade as if they're dollars. But never forget that each one of those ""tickets"" is literally barrels of oil that are moving into and out of Cushing, Oklahoma.

--------

EDIT: And Brent is the price of Europe's oil, delivered in various parts of Europe.

Brent and WTI track with each other because USA has good relations with Europe. But if USA and Europe go to war with each other, you can bet your ass that Brent / WTI will start to diverge from each other. The benefits of having friends means that our markets become interconnected and intertwined.

What you see from the daily news about Ukraine is just the normal ongoings of war. It's dynamic, with each side making gains, or trading small victories.

Russia, who still holds several advantages over the Ukrainians are making costly but slow progress towards their objectives. The Ukrainians for their part are inflicting significant losses upon the Russians for every meter of soil they take. At the same time the Ukrainians have been able to conduct small but successful counter attacks around Kharkiv and Kherson.   


The overall picture isn't good for Russia, because it shows that even when they concentrate the majority of their offensive power (at the expense of other fronts) they are not able to break through the Ukrainian lines and make deep encirclements of the Ukrainian positions. What this means is  that in order to achieve their ambitious political objectives in Ukraine, Russia will need to grind through the Ukrainian defenses, and that will be very costly, assuming it's even possible.   


But i do need to qualify this comment by saying that the situation for Ukraine is not that great either.  Right now the Ukrainians don't have the ability to take the initiative and start major counter attacks, the Ukrainian counter attacks so far have been small and short in duration, probably because Ukraine lacks forces with good enough armored mobility to exploit breakthroughs. And the difficulty for Ukraine is that the equipment that they need to take the fight to the Russians need to come from the west, and that takes time. It takes time for the west to approve the transfer of such equipment, and then it takes time to train the Ukrainians in using said equipment, and then even when they get all of that, the Ukrainians will still be somewhat limited because of the supply of ammo and spare parts that will have a long logistic tail before it even reaches Ukrainian soil. 

This war will take many more months still, and i think it's not far fetched to imagine this war lasting well into 2023. This will be a contest of wills, the Ukrainians have the advantage that they are fighting for their right to exist. The Russians had to basically lie to their own troops about why they went into Ukraine, so it is questionable how long will the common Russian grunt be willing fight in Ukraine. However the Russians are making  up by their lack of motivation with huge firepower, in both air and artillery. And Of course the Ukrainians depend heavily on western support for weapons and military equipment, and that support can slow down and even stop completely depending on the mood of their countries, and the result of elections.",False,1655341775.0,t3_vclofh,t1_icisobg,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

sounds like an ideal outcome to me.

Only if the Russian State remains intact, will Russia's nuclear arsenal be a threat to the west.

If the Russian State disintigrates; yes, there will be a few one-off threats which can hopefully be mitigated by other means; because we're talking about weak spawn-states of legacy Russia: NONE of which will also have the strategic assets of satellite intelligence, early warning radar, robust air defense, or the capability to maintain or manufacture more nuclear weapons - etc. (and yes; I'd expect the bulk of Russia's sub-fleet to remain intact, and loyal to one faction - probably whoever retains Moscow).  But without the consolidation of power Russia currently enjoys, those subs become far less able to threaten the west. Especially as time goes by and they're unable to maintain them, or the launch vehicles, or the development of ABM countermeasures.

I think it would be a massive fucking nightmare, yes. But FAR LESS of a nightmare than allowing the Russian State to continue as they are, or worse: set out to build their nuclear stockpile back up to 1985 levels (around 60k vs 6k now) - or even more. 

If even one of the spin-offs became a nuclear threat, they could be neutralized far easier than Russia can be today. And the spin-offs will be far more likely to be a threat to each other first as they jockey to establish regional dominance.",1655334300.0,1655333801.0,t3_vclofh,t1_ichz5j4,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

It is one of the major producers of nitrogen fertilizer, and is going to figure-in heavily, in future concern over the world food crisis. (I think this may also be where they had the recent fires and nitric acid leaks - during fighting last month). 

There's also some weird connections here that I'm not sure I understand how to interpret.  Since we're looking at how Former US President Trump fits into this Russian/Ukrainian conflict: The owner of this chemical plant is/was Ukrainian Oligarch Dmitri Firtash.

Firtash is also very well connected with the gas industry; and apparently was Russia's ""hit man"" in terms of regulating gas prices and supply-levels in Ukraine, which was used to manipulate politics (on behalf of Russia) - particularly in the 2007-2010 period during their financial crisis. (then in 2014; he was cut out of the Ukrainian natural gas market by the new government, in favor of state-owned Naftogaz).

He is known to have admitted that he had to ""get permission"" from Russian mob boss; Semion Mogelivich (who is listed on the FBI's top ten most-wanted), in order to make major business moves. He stated that this was necessary in Ukraine in the early 2000's - that there was a lot of mob influence at that time. 

You'd think that Firtash would want this asset (the chemical plant) preserved, not destroyed. 

He was also very pro-Russian (supported Yanukovych); he was indicted in Chicago in 2013 on money laundering and racketeering charges, and he was arrested in Austria in 2014.  He posted an all-cash bond of $170 million. 

So; when he posted bond, it was Shokin who signed the affidavit. Shokin was fired by Ukraine, on behalf of a request from US Vice President Joe Biden (and this was at the heart of the whole ""Hunter Biden's Laptop bullshit story).  Shokin also worked with Trump's TV-lawyer, Giuliani. Shokin is also an associate of Lev Parnas (another Ukrainian who ran afoul of US law - I think he's out on bail as well; he laundered $1 m in campaign contributions from Firtash to the Trump Campaign). These were the guys who set up the LLC ""Fraud Guaranteed"". The goal of which, was apparently to get the charges dropped against Firtash in the US. (which Bill Barr, apparently refused to do).

Firtash was also a business partner with Paul Manafort to redevelop the Drake Hotel in NYC.

He also owns seven television channels, and was an investor in Cambridge Analytica (and therefore, also involved in pro-Brexit propaganda). 

So these guys are all neck-deep into the pro-Russia/anti-Ukraine influence campaign in US politics.

I can't really say whether Russia or Ukraine would want to preserve or destroy this asset (the chemical plant).  Time will tell. Seems to me Russia would want to destroy it rather than let it fall into Ukrainian hands. 

But Abramovich owned Azovstal. He attempted to negotiate with Russia over this, and Russia apparently poisoned him during the negotiations? Then they bombed the crap out of the plant. His role as a mediator has shielded him from sanctions.  Another interesting coincidence: in February, BEFORE the invasion, Roman Abramovich pledged funding to the Yad Vashem (World Holocaust Remembrance Center).  In March: Russia bombed the Babi Yar holocaust memorial in Kyiv. 

So at the end of the day, at least THIS aspect of the war (oligarch-owned major assets in Ukraine) seems like a vile mafia shakedown, than anything else.",1655333178.0,1655332254.0,t3_vclofh,t1_ici5y5q,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Just because both sides start fighting each other directly doesn’t mean that it will ABSOLUTELY devolve into a full scale nuclear war.   

But let’s say it does.  At best you can say *hypothetically* it could mean more deaths, because regardless of the rhetoric Russia isn’t going to be keen on playing a card it only gets to play once.  It could mean absolutely the opposite of more deaths.  

Keep in mind that what we know now is that Mariupol is a tomb.  Even the estimates that state that the death toll is in the thousands admits that is likely grossly undercounting the dead.  How many tombs are too many?  49 million might be at risk of starvation due to hunger?   What about the deaths that are going to come because instability in regions affected by this leads to panic, then that panic leads to hoarding by people who are afraid that if they don’t, it won’t be there tomorrow when it’s needed.   The US lost its mind over toilet paper and it completely screwed up logistics for weeks after the issue was solved because of *perceived* scarcity.  Imagine what it looks like when it’s something critical, like food.  

And I’m not advocating for direct confrontation.  Everyone already knows where they stand on that.  But there will be millions that will absolutely be seriously, regardless of whether that includes death or just major financial loss, affected by Russia’s war.  That’s not even including the very real accurate count of what is happening in Ukraine with their citizens, whether financial or loss of life, and we are not going to hear about the costs until after this is over.  

It’s perfectly valid for your position to be zero confrontation.  It’s perfectly valid for someone to say the opposite.  But we aren’t going to know the full consequences of this invasion until we can look back on it with the advantage of hindsight.  

Yeah, nuclear war could mean more deaths.  But to say it would distracts from the very real possibility that the death count is going to ratchet up even without nuclear weapons being used.

>The assassination of Arsen Pavlov was part of a range of high-profile deaths within the ranks of Ukraine's separatists, starting with the assassination of Alexander Bednov, the leader of the Batman Battalion and Aleksey Mozgovoy, the leader of the Prizrak Brigade in May 2015. The death of Arsen Pavlov came within a month of the death of Yevgeny Zhilin, the founder of Oplot Battalion, which would later form into the Oplot Brigade.\[33\]\[34\]  
>  
>Ukrainian officials have stated that Arsen Pavlov was assassinated by Russia's special forces as part of a drive to purge early separatist leaders that took part in the original insurgency of 2014, who may be charismatic but are often unpredictable. Moreover, most of the separatist leaders assassinated headed their own units, which would often engage in infighting over territory or control of the black market, suspecting that the assassinations are part of a drive to form a more uniform chain of command. Another theory behind the assassination has been that there is a drive to get rid of the first generation of rebels who were implicated in war crimes, therefore giving the separatist forces a more acceptable public face. Indeed, Amnesty International has called for an investigation into Arsen Pavlov executing 15 unarmed Ukrainian prisoners. Moreover, Arsen Pavlov's alleged war crimes have been one of the sticking points of the implementations of the Minsk II agreement, with Ukrainian authorities stating that he would not be granted amnesty.\[35\]\[36\] Furthermore, Arsen Pavlov was not a Ukrainian citizen, being born and raised in Russia, and serving in the Russian military during the Chechen conflict. Thus, his involvement as the leader of a Ukrainian separatist movement was pointed to as an example of Russian interference in the conflict.

So the question is just how many layers of leadership Russia will shed until it's happy. The biggest leader of the DPR/LPR with Igor Girkin wasn't killed though.

As for Kherson, you couldn't have picked a worse example as it was evenly matched even between Russian and Ukrainian speakers, was a swing region during the Yanukovuych years and we saw that a majority of Russian speakers outside of Donbass firmly consider themselves Ukrainian.

There are obvious logistical problems with many weapons families (e.g. US MBT's).  And, for a few, there's the real danger of escalation (e.g. giving short range missile systems that are used to attack Russia would be seen by Russia as NATO attacking them, using a Ukrainian finger on the trigger; this would compel a response).  And for others, there's just limits on how quickly Ukraine can absorb them.

People make this argument in relation literally any confrontation. And it is not smart, it's idiotic.

The rule which has held true for the best part of 70 years, through armed confrontations, through the Verlin airlift, Soviet and American pilots shooting each other down over korea, bombings of embassies, poisonings of diplomats and innumerable proxy wars all over the globe is this: nations don't escalate to nuclear strikes unless they genuinely believe their existence is threatened, because they know doing so will immediately threaten their own existence. 

So the answer to your question is very simple. Russia does absolutely nothing to prevent western flagged ships leaving except issue a few idle threats. They do nothing. Thereis no fucking way they are going to  open fire on any Nato flagged vessel, since this would risk the single thing they are most afraid of- war with the a vastly superior military power.

It suits Russia's interests to play up the risk of nuclear escalation because they know they are conpletely powerless against NATO in a conventional sense. They aren't going to commit national suicide to stop someone exporting grain.",1655282569.0,1655282235.0,t3_vclofh,t1_icfjq0s,,4,5,0,5,0,0,

People never seem to realize that major events (like a nuclear attack) are the snowballing of a series of smaller events.

Which is why everything has become a little more tight lipped statehood wise about Ukraine.

Zelensky and his crew are going to holler for more weaponry everyday, just like they are told to do. Its on its way, if not there already, just playing rope a dope with these idiot Russians. 

Let them think they are winning. Id say let them get sloppy but they have never been anything but.

Ukraine, backed by the Nato players, will win this war. It just won't be broadcast on CNN the way Desert Storm was.

Russia will be a pariah state, which will lead to mass civil unrest, and eventually the fall of Putinism.

Generally speaking, in the example of the 4 compressor plant for the gas going to Germany, they will buy 6 of them.

This is so systemic and planned shutdowns can occur, and the unit that requires rebuilding is shipped away. These units are also monsters the size of houses. 

Those are sent to whoever provided them(Or they come up to do the work in a facility in Russia). They are then rebuilt abroad or domestically. 

Right now with the compressors, Siemens is refusing to return one of them after rebuild.

This isn't an issue per say with individual parts, although that's also a huge factor, the problem comes down to entire units experiencing known wear and requiring full rebuilds.

People don't understand how complicated those are, and the special equipment required as well as knowledge that is company specific.

People have this weird habit of assuming you can just show a part to a machinist or a unit and they can replicate it. Sure, in 2-3 years while massive retooling and effort while taking resources vastly away from other sources.

https://www.neuman-esser.de//en/compressors/portfolio/lng-compressors/

And much larger, and while some parts can be sourced locally, this isn't an issue with individual parts breaking. The entire system degrades, and in industrial use degrades quickly.

You can't just ""Fix it"" short or long term, or replace it. The amount of parts chains are insane, and would take a massive combined retooling effort of years to even get close to replacing that one unit. 

Now do that for every specialized unit that is used in oil and gas that comes from Siemens, Halliburton and others.

They may have some excess spares, maybe even a spare unit to swap. But the order or maintenance and rebuilds isn't measured in decades, but hours. 

While I do not know the specifics of the units in question, they may require mini shutdowns at 1,000 hours, 2,000, 3,500 and generally 8,000-10,000 hour rebuilds(Could be longer, depends on wear rates).",False,1655333335.0,t3_vclofh,t1_ici4ser,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

That's not what happened here.  Ukraine *publicly requested Switchblades before they were offered*.  It was near the top of the wish list, and a pretty good match for the early pace of the war.

Ukraine has been losing the ability to use existing artillery more quickly than we've been sending US/NATO artillery (though this may finally be reversing).  Why?

The US has fewer than 10 prototypes of the Switchblade 600.  The contract modification provides for further production of the 600, of which a portion will be sent to Ukraine.  Now you're just making shit up.

Yes.. for the US to buy our first 10 (beyond prototypes).  Some of which will go to Ukraine.

From your source:

""In support of Ukraine, the Switchblade 600 is being procured under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,” Defense Department spokesperson Jessica Maxwell said in a statement on May 10. “**The Department has no active contract for Switchblade 600s and has only procured a small number of prototypes for research and development purposes.**”
...

“The 600 is brand new and there are not many in our inventory,” Clark told The War Zone in a recent interview. “The SOF community has been using Switchblade because the Army has been dragging its feet. **Switchblades are just not made very quickly and that’s a problem they are trying to fix. It’s a capacity issue.**”


edit: in this case, the early May contract earmarks *all the production for Ukraine* and is roughly double Aerovironment's total awards from the US to date.

Can't believe I have to spell this out.

The point of a Brimstone is it's a swarming missile system. You can fire a *lot* of them at the same time and they all arrive at the same time.   

I said as much here:   

> fire off a swarm of more missiles than what their SAM systems can fire then enjoy the fireworks   

What Russia currently has on that island will have a problem of a lot of pop-up supersonic missiles arriving all at the same time. Time before engagement will be short which means they'll only be able to fire a limited number of missiles if any before the missiles hit.
