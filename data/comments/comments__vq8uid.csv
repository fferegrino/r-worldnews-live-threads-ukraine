Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 3 July 2022
 
- Russian-backed officials have said they will hold a referendum on Kherson Oblast joining the Russian Federation by autumn 2022. Russia is likely prioritising a pseudo-constitutional vote in an attempt to legitimise its control of the region.

- On 28 June 2022, Ihor Kolykhaiev, the elected mayor of Kherson city, was arrested, highly likely in an attempt to suppress opposition to the occupation. However, widespread armed and peaceful resistance continues across occupied areas.

- Kherson is the region which has been brought under the new Russian occupation most comprehensively since February. Finding a constitutional solution for the occupation is likely a priority policy objective for Russia. It will highly likely be prepared to rig voting to achieve an acceptable result.

Day 130 of my updates from Kharkiv.

They actually changed their missile strike schedule. This is just the worst, now they are firing their missiles at 3-4am. It was at 4am two days ago, then at both 3am and 4am yesterday and now today at 4am again. I hoped that it would be quiet as they didn‚Äôt fire missiles at 3am, but they just alternate between 3am and 4am.

The air raid alert was active since 8pm, for almost 8 hours straight, and at 4:02am they restarted it. And just as I heard the siren, the sound of the explosion followed literally 2 seconds after. They fired just 2 missiles today and both of them sounded pretty close to us too, but we don‚Äôt know what was hit yet. The missiles from yesterday hit some infrastructure facility.

About that explosions in Belgorod yesterday, Russian MOD said that we fired 3 missiles at them, they intercepted all of them, and somehow they still hit their target, which they claimed was just civilians. Right now there are 2 possibilities of what might have happened. First is that it was indeed us that fired those missiles, and they were shot down by Russian AA. Second is that it was Russians who fired their Iskanders at Kharkiv over Belgorod, and their AA shot one down because of miscommunication.

Even if those were our missiles, we obviously won‚Äôt take credit; our official response was basically ‚Äúno u.‚Äù In both cases it is evident that it was their AA that caused it to fall in the middle of the city, we have videos of a missile being shot down, and explosion happening on the ground a couple of seconds later, so whoever fired those missiles, they were not aimed at some random house as Russians claim. They also said that that one missile destroyed 26 apartment buildings and 46 houses, yeah, very believable.

What is sad is that, the people who died from that missile falling down on some houses were Ukrainian refugees from Kharkiv oblast, a family from Tsupivka, it was confirmed by our officials.

In 2014, Odesa became home to the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and thousands of military sailors from Crimea. Together, we survived the times of rebasing and creating conditions for the placement of military units, together we went through the creation of a training base and the transition to new military standards of the army. Later, Odesa became a base for SeaBreeze exercises, and warships of NATO countries are frequent guests of our city.

During these eight years, we witnessed the qualitative transformations that took place in the Ukrainian army. And today, when the so-called ""second army of the world"" is defeated on the battlefield, we are proud of the courage and professionalism of our military.
On the Day of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, special words of thanks to the military sailors who defend our coast and demonstrate high combat qualities, performing tasks in the most difficult areas of the defense of southern Ukraine.

Well known fact that CB is one of very few Russian institutions which is actually functional and not ran down by corruption. Led by 2 very intellectual women (Elvira Nabiullina and her assistant Ksenia Udaeva), CB competency is the primary reason why Russian economy still hasn't collapsed completely.

Both Elvira and Ksenia are clearly anti-war (you can notice how they went full ""mourning"" mode by only wearing black clothes and no make up since the war started).

[But many people rightly suggest](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/06/27/kryshka-groba-zakryta-i-zakolochena) that by ""saving"" Russian economy, they directly and indirectly contribute to Russian aggression in Ukraine, by saving budget they ensure that that money goes to Russian army.

At the same time, other say that they feel obligated to do what they do, because they don't want their regular fellow citizens to suffer from falling economy.

ARD is the public broadcaster that gets supported by a fee levied on households and I have to assume that like any interview of a high profile guest the questions are vetted by their advisors and agreed to in advance. Now I don't know how hard hitting ARD usually is when interviewing politicians but Schloz might not have wanted to focus on Ukraine and ARD might not have wanted to push it, who knows.

The point is that all this shows are what one broadcaster chose to ask and/or what Scholz agreed to be asked, it does not necessarily show what the most pressing issues are in the German publics mind are. In fact I can't see how the rise in energy and fuel prices and wondering what happens for heating when winter comes isn't front and center for a lot of Germans right now and that by definition is inextricably linked to the war in Ukraine. Whether they support further aid to Ukraine or not it still must be a pretty big issue in German society, at least for those that pay attention to political matters.

Edit: For instance polls repeatedly show most people in Western countries are pretty much done with thinking about covid and have moved on, the lack of coverage in the news cycle seems to show this is true as well, if stories still got clicks and views the media would still be running more of them. If this is also true in Germany why did they spend 5 minutes talking about covid?

Estimates range from about 54% to 71% of that age group is unfit for combat. Among that population Ukraine has somewhere around 600k-800k young men who are fighting fit.

Unless you count victory as them slogging the next few years to take the rest of Donetsk oblast and so complete the supposed ""liberation"" of the Donbass. Recent Russian gains seem impressive as a pincer comes up from Popasna and they take Severodonetsk and Lysychansk but zoom out on the map and you see how little ground they have gained in the east over the last two months of fighting. And they only managed those gains by putting most of their forces there which allowed Ukraine to take back a bunch of ground north of Kharkiv and some ground in the south around Kherson.

Unless Russia fully mobilize and drafts a bunch of extra men to send to Ukraine, something Putin is clearly reluctant to do, they do not have the manpower they need to take large parts of Ukraine quickly. They don't even seem to have the manpower to hold on to what they have and gain ground at the same time if the last two months are any indication.

I think making a Marshall plan for Ukraine is getting a little ahead of itself too but Severodonetsk and Lysychansk are the third and fourth largest cities Russia has managed to take in Ukraine after Kherson and Mariupol. And they took one of those in the initial invasion and the other one took 3 months of bloody fighting to pacify. At the rate they're going it might take them literally years to take the rest of Donetsk oblast let alone other areas of Ukraine. Ukraine might not be able to win in the sense it gets back all of its territory but if Russia winning means no more Ukraine at all it looks like they'll be reaching the Polish border sometime around 2030 but that requires a lot more commitment by Russia to win the war.

Even if Russia fully mobilized tomorrow those troops would be months away from combat if they want to give them any proper training, so short term at least their manpower shortages will continue. And Russia is already fielding tanks and firing long range missiles from the 1960's, with sanctions crippling some areas of their arms production can they produce the equipment needed for a years long war? And how will sanctions as they start to really bite over the next few months affect Russians views on continuing the war? Putin seems to know mass conscription will erode support, can he risk it when more people are jobless and already upset about that?

Ukraine's victory might not be assured, Russia might be able to overcome those issues, but those issues and the lack of quick Russian progress in the east are why so many foreign politicians seem assured that Ukraine will not lose. Even if they don't get back all their territory Russia doesn't seem likely to win either other than maybe taking some more of Donetsk oblast. If that's all Russia manages to do there will still be a Ukraine to rebuild.

Example: I have 100% of knowledge on something, and when I teach someone they retain about 50% of my knowledge until they either pick up the rest on their own or continue studying the subject. And so you put that same person out in the field to train someone else and that person picks up 50% of the field trainers knowledge which is already only a portion of my knowledge, leaving that person with a retention of about 25% of what I know as the original trainer of the person that trained their trainer, and it just dilutes more and more as the training process is passed on to yet another person. 

It's very evident in business as well, it's why there is always the new guy who everyone thinks is a dipshit dumbass, but in reality it's because he was trained by someone that was trained by someone that was trained by someone before them. All of that knowledge is diluted by those that have not had enough training, continued training or applicable experience and time to become an expert like their original trainer. This is the reason why there is always so much low level turnover unless a company or military commits to dedicated experts to train new people, and to continue training periodically to go along with applicable experience over time. I always had a dedicated trainer in my company, and never left it to the last person that was trained to teach the newbie, who eventually would have to train the other newbie and so on. 

I hope this makes sense. Easier said than typed.

From a birds-eye view, I haven't seen anything from Germany that makes me believe that the German elite is fully on board with the rest of the West in this war.

Most notably is:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Scholz blocking German weapons/arms deliveries to Ukraine multiple times.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Scholz simultaneously saying he's doing everything to help weapons arrive (i.e. lying about it).

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Nord Stream 2 development despite continuous warnings against it from allies. Unless you're blind, it's quite obvious that the deal between Russia and Germany was for Germany to sell Russian gas to the whole EU. Which is also why they fought so hard against classifying Nuclear Power as a green energy source (while literally all science claims it's necessary for the green transition, but I digress).

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Kaliningrad. Scholz urged free transit for Russian trains through Lithuania to Kaliningrad, despite the fact that less than a month ago, the Russians threatened the sovereignty of Lithuania. To top it off, Lithuania and Germany are supposed to be in the same defence treaty organisation. Hello!? The suggestion from Scholz is an outrage.

There are more things, but honestly, you get the idea of what I'm saying with those examples.

So let me bottom line it for you:

To me, this looks like there are great many benefits and opportunities for Germany, and only Germany, if this war ends quickly and without too many repercussions for Russia. This is a result of many years of hard work from the Russian elite, after all.

However, I will admit that Germany also has opportunities in the West.

But, the fact that Germany has a weak military forces them to pick a side - in my view. If they had had a strong military (e.g. the strongest in Europe), they would be able to go their own way.

This, in my opinion, makes it quite likely that Germany would try to pursue both allegiances at the same time... To the detriment of anything Russia sets its eyes upon.

It's not that strange, really. It's literally what the long-term strategic plans of Russia has been for well over a decade.‚Äù",False,1656863474.0,t3_vq8uid,t1_iepgqb8,,2,-5,0,-5,0,0,

Depends on whose counts you use, but yes, they have lost a lot. Ranging from simple trucks and cars to planes and tanks.

>How much more can they have?

Tens of thousands more. Russia had a habit carried over from the Soviets of stashing in warehouses all their old equipment, just in case they needed it. The idea being that in case of a serious war, they could call up millions of conscripts and arm them. The equipment might be laughably old, but it wouldn't matter because they had 10x more troops and tanks than their opponent.

So while the US's M60 tank has been relegated to museum pieces and use by 3rd world countries, the Russians can still pull out running T-62s. While a T-62 won't win a fair fight against a more modern tank, they can bring *a* tank to more battles.

Since this started in 2014 Ukraine has had around 400k active at different periods through 7 drafts where they brought in new and released those that had been there the longest. So when this started in the beginning of this year Ukraine announced around 150k signed up. So if those numbers are correct Ukraine had around 275k infantry and 50k border patrol.

Since then Ukraine has said at different points that their enlisted has grown. The highest number I heard was 700k and you can see the source [here.](https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-700-000-soldiers-fighting-123200688.html) There are other people reporting it and the quote came from Zelensky.

So if that is true then Ukraine has Russia outnumbered more than 2 to 1. Ukraine has also said that they plan to have 1 million enlisted by the end of the year if this continues.

If Nato went it, they would simply launch thousands of cruise missiles at every target, and take everything out in one swoop.  Then fly in there with their airforce of advanced fighters, not the crap  that Russia has and completely wipe them out, assuming the cruise missiles didn't do that.

The style of fighting Nato does is NOTHING like what Russia has equipment for or how Ukraine is fighting.
