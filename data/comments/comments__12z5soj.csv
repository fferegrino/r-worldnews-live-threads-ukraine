The prosecutor accused Semiel Vedel, the former officer, of describing Russia as a “murderer country” and saying that it had suffered significant losses in Ukraine.
>
>The prosecutor made the case that Vedel’s phone conversations were public — and thereby subject to a law that criminalizes spreading information about the war that runs counter to official statements made by the Russian Defense Ministry — because they were being monitored by a third party: an investigator.

Day 425-427 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 3 days were mostly quiet, there were no new missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv after the pervious strike from a couple of days ago, though sadly they still used S-300 missiles to hit Kupiansk yesterday. They aimed at a museum, killing 2 women and injuring around 10 more people that were inside and/or near the building. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, which is probably the exact reason why they chose to hit it, so that they won’t hit anything military related by mistake.

I almost forgot that 3 days ago was the 1-year anniversary since our apartment building was directly hit by a Grad missile. That was definitely one of the worst days of this war for us and our neighbors, pretty hard to believe that it has actually been that long, it feels like much less time has passed. It’s now also incomparably more peaceful here in the city, even counting the occasional missile strikes it almost feels like there’s no war at all when comparing the current situation to the first few months of the war with the constant shelling.

Also, there are some pretty funny, but also very concerning reports coming from people living in Izyum about crows/ravens that take mines and spread them in previously demined places. Not sure if there are any officially confirmed cases of it happening, but the “petal” anti-personnel mines only weigh 80 grams so a crow could probably carry and drop them in some random places. Crows bombarding our cities with AP mines is definitely not something I thought we would need to worry about.",False,1682545421.0,t3_12z5soj,t3_12z5soj,,0,171,0,171,0,0,

Then later:

then 2 hours ago:

&#x200B;

In Moscow, a mother reported her own daughter to police: Tatyana from Ochakovo-Matveevsky supports Putin’s “special operation”, and her daughter doesn’t.  
  
Tatyana, 59, decided to discuss Russia’s involvement in Ukraine with her daughter Irina, who already had heated arguments with other family members about international politics of Vladimir Putin.  
  
The attempt to resolve the conflict backfired. Tatyana and Irina got into such a quarrel that 3 days later the mother, holding a grudge, went to the police and filed an official report on her daughter.  
  
  
There is no information whether a case has been opened against the girl, but that’s not the point.  
  
The bottom line is that for the ""greatness of the state"", the mother denounced her own daughter.  
  
This case highlights the biggest misconceptions about the Russian society.  
  
1.Family values  
  
The mother is reporting her own child to police, for the “crime” that can see her daughter thrown into prison for up to 15–25 years: “discrediting Russia’s army” gets you up to 15 years, and “treason” might see you locked up for life.  
  
2. Kindness, soulfulness  
  
Knowing what will happen to a fellow human being, Russians are eagerly denouncing each other – including false reports on competitors or as a payback. FSB and police are flooded with reports about citizens speaking against the “special operation”.  
  
3. “All Russians support Putin”  
  
There are plenty of Russians who don’t. It’s dangerous to speak against the “special operation”, but people still do it, even now – 14 months after its start, in the oppressive political climate of 2023 Russia.  
  
A new leaked conversation between, allegedly, billionaire Roman Trotsenko (wallet of Igor Sechin's, who is an oil magnate, a close ally and ""de facto deputy"" of Vladimir Putin) and Nikolai Matushevsky (creator of popular art spaces in Moscow) is sending shock waves through Russian elites once again.  
  
  
The two men talk about the need to withdraw all funds from Russia by the end of 2023, or it will be too late: “People will be slaughtered in the streets of Moscow,” they grimly predict.  
  
“Everything is crushing in Russia,” they feel.  
  
The processes happening in Russia are about the civilizational divide. The civilization of freedom and unfreedom are fighting in an existential battle.  
  
The old generation is scared of freedom, because freedom means taking responsibility for one’s own choices and taking action.  
The young generation, which tasted the freedoms and seen the world, feels suffocated in the atmosphere of the tightening oppression.  
That’s one of the most disastrous aspects of Putin’s regime: all Russians suffer from PTSD as individuals and as a nation. They are psychologically deformed.  
  
Life of ordinary Russians was so hard, so full of traps, the dangers to each citizen were so real, that it brought out the worst in people.  
  
People's usual lives literally collapsed, their souls and hearts were smashed. They were easy to manipulate psychologically, it could be done by a snap of fingers.  
  
This largely explains the phenomenon of mass Stockholm syndrome among Russians.  
  
In Soviet times, people believed in the “bright future”, trying to overcome “bourgeoise backwardness”.  
  
In Putin’s times, they believe in “the bright past”, which can be brought back by locking the future into prison.  
  
  
The Russian society and Russian people of today aren’t the same people they were 2 years ago. Or a year ago. Or even 2 months ago. They are being broken weekly, daily, to deeper submission.  
  
But slaves don’t love their master. Loyalty based on fear and enforcement, loyalty purchased by money, is false loyalty.  
  
Russia isn’t North Korea. It will never be North Korea. Nor it can plunge into Stalin’s times.  
  
Hitler promised his people the Third Reich, a bunch of slaves and the prosperity of the German people.  
The Soviets promised sweet life under communism, when everything would be free.  
Putin’s propagandists can only promise Stalin’s repressions and electronic draft notices to sacrifice your life for Putin’s oligarchs.  
And this is why everyone in Russia is feeling that life as they knew it, is crashing. That’s why they are filled with anxiety and fear.  
  
That’s why they all, from the regular folk to high-ranking officials, want an end to this giant uncertainty, any end that brings back common sense and predictability. They are more ready for Russia’s defeat than they are ready for a victory, because “victory” brings more issues, expenses and deaths.  
  
The decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan, after 9 years, was due to the Red Army’s failure to suppress Afghan fighters, and the high cost in Russian lives and resources.  
  
It’s been 9 years since Putin attacked Ukraine in 2014. The cost in Russian lives and resources is mounting.  
  
The end result is predictable, and when it happens, everyone will say, “I knew it! It just couldn’t be any different.”",False,1682524550.0,t3_12z5soj,t3_12z5soj,,0,81,0,81,0,0,

Location is about the same that has garnered so much attraction from western submarine ops the last weeks.

AF is(was?) equipped with  2 mini-submarines capable of dives to 4km.

Yesterday she received a warm welcome home from 7 naval vessels after a long trip from Southern Ocean/Antactica(?).

I have not seen anyone follow her on AIS during the day, but the MO of swedish navy is more discreet than others.

Lets call this coincidence #103 in this part of the Baltics the last weeks. 

I am rephrasing this from wild guess to hunch: There is something lurking in the depths.

[...]

Akademik Fedorov actually was appreciated by an eight partner for her Baltic dance:

a Latvian patrol boat checked her out at about 14:00-16:00U, eyeball distances. In between North Gotland and Latvia.

Akademik Fedorov is stationary above the subsurface valleys that are the deeper parts of Baltics.

Her track shows her slowing down passing Bornholm yesterday, an action at least I would do when I do not want to be early to a destination. She got ~8hrs of darkness for? Something.

The maps the western analysts produce are *starting* to catch up with what the UA Bakhmut milbloggers draw up—showing, sadly, the very large gains the Russians have made. 

Ukraine remains only in a *portion* of just the western section of Bakhmut.  Basically, from Korsunskogo up to medical college (contested), over to the Pushkin Lanes (contested).
This still gives them many, many high-rises on Tchaikovsky going west.  And they still control the exit corridors.

Several of the bakhmut soldiers and milbloggers guys have gone silent [may be ordered to do so, might be operation, might be withdrawal, etc.].  Today, @myrosh_nykov announced he’d no longer give even general  locations, for operational security.  Others are defying advice and continuing to give specifics.  

Several mentioned that the Russians had bragged on a victory at Khromove that didn’t exist...

Overall, no good news.  But we know aid is coming.  Hopefully, soon. 



The tone of the channels of the guys serving in or reporting from bakhmut who posted today was more like this, from DeepStateUA:

> The situation in Bakhmut is extremely difficult. No changes on the route through Khromove. The information that the Russians have taken it is a fake. But *in* the city itself, the enemy has significant success along the entire line of contact, except for the [""airplane"" area.](https://goo.gl/maps/xsUZc6wc2yhDvz2j9)
According to preliminary data, the Russians have now reached the [intersection of Yuvileynaya and Tchaikovsky](https://goo.gl/maps/ForsBenFNZsUEg6c9). [that’s the road that turns into O0506—it also is in a high rise area and whoever has height is poised to keep it—this would be very bad, but it’s just preliminary...]

Later, got more ominous...

> The enemy is drawing up reserves and preparing artillery for the final assault on the western part of Bakhmut. 

> In Bakhmut, the last four [controlled areas] are not so great because of enemy artillery, and also because of the reduction of our control zone, this hell has grown exponentially. 

> The defenders—soldiers of the Armed Forces, Territorial Defense, Transport, Security Service, Border Guards, and others—are doing everything possible to ensure that the western part of the city holds out, as long as possible; but in the situation that has now developed, the main thing is to protect the lives of the personnel, who have already done everything that was in their power.  [mirrors words before severdonetsk; but could just be cliche phrasing]

The only real strategic surprise about Moscow's designs on the Baltic states is that it's taken this long. In 2013, if you had asked an international affairs pundit what Russia's biggest priority was, they would have said the Baltics, because they all assumed that Ukraine was already well-in-hand. After all, through electoral subversion and economic coercion, they'd gotten a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv, and helped build a Ukrainian oligarchy that was friendly to their interests. Public opinion was split on whether Ukraine's future lay in the east or the west, and Russia believed that status quo ultimately favored them.

And then Maidan caught everyone by surprise. It turned Ukraine into a red alert for that needed to be dealt with, while the Baltics were merely an opportunity they could put on the backburner.

He’s very, very well-known—even prior to war.

*Prior to war:*

- He’d been [called](https://znaj.ua/ru/dossier/664-roman-grishchenko-biografiya-dosye-i-kompromat)
 “the most educated politician in contemporary Ukraine.”  
- he has a degree from kyiv’s military institute 
- He has a PhD.  
- He was a high-profile attorney.  (Which is why he’s [delicate in his phrasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqg0MSvVGfc).) A [prosecutor](https://uk.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Грищенко_Роман_Сергійович), in civilian criminal for a period, and later military prosecutor.
- He established a humans rights organization.  
- And served as the Governor of the Sumy District.  Here’s [President Zelensky traveling to meet him back during covid.](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/derzhava-vidremontuye-zlitnu-smugu-sumskogo-aeroportu-prezid-63365)


*In the War*

- He formed, commands the [TRO](https://uk.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/127-ма_окрема_бригада_територіальної_оборони_%28Україна%29) from Kharkiv, the [127^th](http://127tro.kh.ua/en). And is a [Colonel.](https://uk.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Грищенко_Роман_Сергійович)
- He was *the* planner, commander, in the recapture of Kharkiv region.  [Here’s a profile on him, that operation](https://www.foxnews.com/world/kharkiv-won-civilians-turned-soldier-major-victory-ukraine-war-good-evil-top-brass). [Fox, ugh, I know. But still...]  
- Here’s [UA government showing the planning phase.](https://mva.gov.ua/en/news/micno-trimayut-oboronu-yuliya-laputina-u-harkovi-pospilkuvalasya-z-bijcyami-brigadi-teroboroni)
- He’s referred to, affectionately, as Dyadya Roma (“Uncle Roma”)—and it’s even embroidered on this uniform, visible in his videos.

Out of anyone who puts out videos, comments on Bakhmut, ***trust this guy***.  He’s been at Bakhmut for months, and knows what he’s talking about.

______

He’s got one of those names that can be translated like 12 ways.  (Роман Грищенко— G or H / I or Y / SH or SCH or SHCH)

But it’s just a different task, and had time. To see that they’re still uncoordinated, look at how their planes can’t work in ground coordination with ground forces, they’ve never gotten better there.

Very true. If you build a ton of lines of trenches and fill them with a bunch of poorly trained troops with assault rifles it's actually a pretty good defensive strategy. This is what happened during the early days of the war. All around the country Ukrainians grabbed guns and shovels and suddenly every town and city was a fortress and Russia couldn't move anywhere without encountering resistance which they were unprepared for. Attacking also requires extreme coordination and a lot of skill which many of the initial Russian forces lacked.

Now the situation has reversed itself. Russia has thrown tons of poorly trained troops into defensive lines with plenty of mines and other fortifications and Ukraine is going to go on the attack. We don't really know how this counter offensive will go but when Ukraine attacks they will need to do it with overwhelming force which is why they've been building up for so long. 

We really can't say what the counter offensive will look like but attacking is not easy and Russia will have some advantages going for them.

SECOND, the clip shows a few cars going in escort/caravan in central Moscow.

We also know from the defected FSO agent that any comms that need to be done can be done from any location.  He’d teleconference who he needs to.  And we also know from him that Putin employs a weird cloak and dagger measures—that Putin tries to fool even his own SBR/FSO [security detail], pretending he’s left his residence, a bunch of FSO pack up and leave, and Putin is all the while sitting in his home office faking that he’d just left.  To his own security!  So anytime something appears to be Putin, need to consider all of these things.

I recommend reading the [Depleted Uranium Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium) for a rough overview of the landscape on this area of study.

>In military conflicts involving DU munitions, the major concern is inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with their targets.[87] When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted uranium oxides in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds. The Institute of Nuclear Technology-Radiation Protection of Attiki, Greece, has noted that ""the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel"".[10] The use of DU in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment.[88][89][90][91][92][93]

>The U.S. Department of Defense claims that no human cancer of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium.[94] Militaries have long had risk-reduction procedures for their troops to follow,[95] and studies are in consistent agreement that veterans who used DU-enhanced munitions have not suffered, so far, from an increased risk of cancer (see the Gulf War and Balkans sections below). The effects of DU on civilian populations are, however, a topic of intense and ongoing controversy.

>As early as 1997, British Army doctors warned the Ministry of Defence that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions.[96] According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, ""Inhalation of insoluble uranium dioxide dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance—if any. ... Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer."" The report warns that ""All personnel ... should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk ... [the dust] has been shown to increase the risks of developing lung, lymph and brain cancers.""[96]

>In 2003, the Royal Society called, again, for urgent attention to be paid to the possible health and environmental impact of depleted uranium, and added its backing to the United Nations Environment Programme's call for a scientific assessment of sites struck with depleted uranium.[notes 2] In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed birth defect claims from a February 1991 Gulf War combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning.[97][98] A 2005 epidemiology review concluded: ""In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.""[12] Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, genetic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure.[6]

The War in Iraq in particular has been intensively studied for the effects of depleted uranium. It's difficult to study cancer-causing chemicals because you rarely can tell in each individual case what is causing the cancer every time, but the correlative evidence is disturbing:

>Since 2001, medical personnel working for the Iraqi state health service controlled by Saddam Hussein at the Basra hospital in southern Iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War. Iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of DU, an opinion that was echoed by several newspapers.[92][138][139][140] In 2004, Iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country.[141][142] In 2003, the Royal Society called for Western militaries to disclose where and how much DU they had used in Iraq so that rigorous, and hopefully conclusive, studies could be undertaken out in affected areas.[143] The International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons (ICBUW) likewise urged that an epidemiological study be made in the Basra region, as asked for by Iraqi doctors,[144] but no peer-reviewed study has yet been undertaken in Basra.

>A medical survey, ""Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005–2009"" published in July 2010, states that the ""...increases in cancer and birth defects...are alarmingly high"" and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6%. The group compares the dramatic increase, five years after wartime exposure in 2004, with the lymphoma that Italian peacekeepers[145] developed after the Balkan wars and the increased cancer risk in certain parts of Sweden because of the Chernobyl fallout. The origin and time of introduction of the carcinogenic agent causing the genetic stress the group will address in a separate report.[146] The report mentions depleted uranium as one ""potentially relevant exposure"" but makes no conclusions on the source.

>**Four studies investigating links between the use of depleted uranium by Coalition forces during the Second Battle of Fallujah were conducted in 2012, one of which described the people of Fallujah as having ""the highest rate of genetic damage in any population ever studied.""** In response to these studies, Ross Caputi, a former U.S. Marine who participated in the battle, wrote a Guardian article calling for the United States government to conduct its own study into the matter.[147]

Hard to tell how this could impact Ukrainian civilians and soldiers. It probably will cause any civilians in the area to be at heightened risks of cancers, as well as Ukrainian and Russian soldiers in the field. Any civilians that return to a bombed-out area from depleted uranium tank shells will also be at risk. If the US and other governments give Ukraine tens of thousands of DU shells, that is definitely going to have a serious health impact on the environment along with anyone trying to make a living in the aftermath of that environment.",1682534752.0,1682534143.0,t3_12z5soj,t1_jhtdfrj,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

Can't take the risk. They will conceal as much for as long as they can. How they will do this is unknown, but I imagine deception will play a part all the way around. I highly doubt there is anything on satellite or drone recon that makes the Chinese decide they will abandon Russia for Ukraine.

He will be replaced by a new version of himself, just as O'Reilly was. That person will continue to spew the lies that they don't believe for a fat pay check.

CNN, despite whatever bias, is still an actual news outlet. I really don't know much about Lemon recently as I haven't watched TV news for a long time. My recollection of him is quite milquetoast. If he was off the rails, ok, get rid of him. If he was being a sexpest, OK, get rid of him. Ultimately, it sounds like he was fired for... good reasons, whatever they were.  Which is why the comparison is bad. Carlson was fired specifically to *preserve the lie of his work*.  Shouting BUT THEY HAD A BAD GUY TOO is just an extremely dishonest way to present it.
