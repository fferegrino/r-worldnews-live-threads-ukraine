Part 1: Some Russian 'invented' a ground-breaking civilization-altering invention. The idea was so novel, so top secret:

> I'm a humanitarian. Sometimes I invent things and when I show them to the engineers they at first shit all over it, but once I describe how my item can be used their minds are blown!
>
> I've had three demos recently and showed secret thing on my phone. I know that the Ukrainians can beat us to a full production run if we don't keep this secret, so anyone that wants details please contact me privately.
>
>I'll put up all the money to help our boys in combat. I have many other ideas too! This one will reduce our casualties by 2/3rds, maybe even 4/5ths!

Part 2: The glorious inventor and humanist subcontracted all the work to a buddy. The buddy immediately invited a Russian news crew to his garage workshop. They shot a glowing propaganda report about Russian ingenuity. The top secret invention turned out to be a folding ballistic shield that can also serve as a sleeping pad! Because of course [folding ballistic shields](https://www.covered6.com/mts-shield/) have [never been invented](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/bullet-proof-folding-origami-shield/) by [anyone before](https://multithreatshield.com/), especially [not by Ukrainians](http://sputnik-gear.ua/sputnik-shop/product-category/sample-product/%d1%96%d0%b7%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%82-assguard/). 

The report described the entire manufacturing process too: 9 am cut 15mm of ballistic polyethylene into squares, 1 pm place inside a cloth pocket, 9 pm Gazmanov Concert. The report also included the pad being field-tested against the F-1 grenade. Two small fragments hit the pad and one penetrated all the way through. 50% success rate! 

Part 3: The original ""I have all the thoughts you do all the work"" inventor has a meltdown on social media:

> I am the original inventor of the kevlar folding shield! Got the money together and prepaid this bastard to manufacture. I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE UKRAINIANS CAN MASS PRODUCE THESE A LOT FASTER THAN WE CAN SO I ASKED THAT FUCKER TO KEEP THIS QUIET!!!
>
> And what did he do? This asshole went and spilled the beans on everything, on all my hard work!
>
> Ukrainians should kiss that moron right on his little ass.
>
> Idiot.
>
> I owed him 308K rubles but now I won't pay him anything!

And now Ukrainians will surely steal this groundbreaking invention and possibly cover the Patriot missile launcher with it!

Luckily, that idea fades a little for every passing day. Ukraine seems to be pretty damn good at rooting the fuckers out, Russia seems pretty damn good at not being something that people want to help, but it can’t be easy.



Soon, I think that consideration will be more or less gone entirely. Ukraine has done an amazing job at demonstrating trustworthiness up to now. But trust takes time. More time being trustworthy is more trust.

But they do have Storm Shadow from the UK and SCALP-EG missiles from France, two air-launched cruiser missiles with ranges far exceeding anything the US has given Ukraine.

They didn't drag Putin kicking and screaming to this decision. No one forced his hand or made him declare the war. Putin and his buddy Patrushev made erasing Ukraine their manifest destiny for years, and told the government and the people that it's in their best interests and they will support it.

Before the war, and notably in its first few weeks going by his waffling statements, he was perceived as a moderate in Putin's circle.  Hand on heart that's what everyone in the West thought, too.  And then people in his position get forcibly retired with ease, and there are definitely internal elements looking to stop the war and depose Putin which makes it look like this is him distancing himself from that idea as vocally and cartoonishly as possible.  His behavior is outlandish and out of character, but not unexpected.  It's like if Mike Pence suddenly started advocating for dissolving the senate; you'd suspect some self-preservationist instinct behind it.  For a closer example this is exactly how the surviving members of the Politburo had to act around Stalin right up until he died, who had consolidated power in the Central Committee against the Politburo.  

There's enough room at the Hague for everybody; doesn't mean this began as a collective decision and either way Putin's the most important piece.

>A fresh push by Britain and the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter planes has exposed the latest fault line among Western allies who have wrangled repeatedly over sending powerful weapons of war, once again pitting a reluctant United States against some of its closest European partners.

>Several European allies are prepared to give their F-16s to Ukraine. But the Biden administration, which must approve any transfers of the American-made planes, remains unconvinced that Ukraine needs the expensive jets, which are a staple of many modern military arsenals.

>**So deep is Washington’s skepticism that Kyiv’s pilots are currently not even allowed to train on the F-16s that are owned by European states**, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity to frankly discuss the sensitive diplomatic issue.

>In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the Biden administration was still reluctant to send Ukraine its own F-16s, in part because the plane’s multimillion-dollar price tag would absorb too much of an already-dwindling pot of war funding. Instead, the U.S. official said, the administration is more concerned with speeding other American weapons to Ukraine in time for a counteroffensive against Russia, and that in any case the jets would not reach the battlefield for months at least — presumably, long after that battle had begun.

>The U.S. official also spoke on condition of anonymity, as did four other senior Western officials in Washington and Europe who were interviewed for this story.

>Earlier this week, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the United Kingdom would begin training Ukrainian pilots, starting this summer, as part of a plan “with other countries on providing F-16 jets.” His announcement, wrapped in a new package of military aid, came during a visit to London by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

>**Without explicit American approvals, however, the training is likely to be limited to what the senior Ukrainian official described as merely technical language and tactical lessons that pilots would be taught, without ever touching an F-16.**

And I think you have the full appeasement bingo card. Good for obstructing everything from stinger missiles, tube artillery,  armored personnel carriers, NASAMS, Patriot,  MiGs, HIMARs, Abrams tanks, ATACMS and now F16s. 

It would be funny if this absolute bullshit wasn't  being used to defend an absurd go slow approach that is responsible for thousands of unnecessary ukrainian deaths this past year. The excuses get trotted out as though they're gospel, until the pressure to act gets overwhelming or another country steps up and provides the same kind of tech revealing the excuses to be nonsensical...the excuses then magically vanish until they are needed for whatever the next piece of equipment is that the appeasors want to obstruct.

Kyiv could have been protected by patriot and NASAMs from the start of the war, saving countless civilian lives. It wasn't, and instead .a bunch of people died who didn't have to die.

HIMARs could have been hitting the Russian shell depots in the Donbas since march last year. It wasn't, and the ukrainian army holding those lines took heavy casualties from artillery barrages until they finally got them.

The Kherson offensive could have been done in far safer western armor, with infantry being transported, medevaced and covered by Bradleys  It wasn't and instead the ukrainians advanced and fought and died in russian tin cans and pick-up trucks.

This coming offensive could have taken place under a sky patrolled by advanced western planes- its too late for that now. But the ukrainians will still go with what they have and face whatever russia throws af them. 

It sounds harsh but the truth is there are  thousands of ukrainian kids whose dads won't come home from this war because Sullivan is a coward and Biden is too old or too timid to tell him to stfu and do what's obviously the right thing to do.

Well, if my previous speculation is correct, Russia is less concerned about scoring hits and doing damage (and the things they hit don't really seem to do Russia much good, as many people have noted) and more concerned about running Ukraine out of air defense missiles.  Massive volleys of missiles means more get through, but also that Ukraine may use up fewer of their own missiles because they can only fire so much at a time.

It also may be that Russia *cannot* make big missile launches anymore because they have such limited stocks/capability now after using up so many of their missiles over the winter.

Western nations can certainly outproduce Russia in the long run, but IMO right now by far Russia's biggest worry is the Ukrainian counteroffensive.  Russia's main hope of stopping it may be using their largely undiminished air power, but it's still too dangerous for them because of Ukrainian AD.  So logically, if you can run Ukraine out of AD missiles ahead of time then you can launch your jets to attack the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Again, this is just speculation on my part based on the leak of Ukrainian AD missile stocks getting low, Russia increasing their missile attacks without seemingly much efffective purpose in their targets (apart from sometimes targeting Patriot systems), and the timing with the counteroffensive expected soon and Russia having limited options in stopping it.  The good news is that it doesn't seem like Ukraine is going to run out of AD ammo very soon.  But if the counteroffensive lasts through the summer and Russia keeps firing missiles as they can, then who knows what the Russian vs Ukrainian supply of missiles will be at that point?

In the event that there is a filibuster Ukraine aid would certainly have the 10 GOP votes to pass and McConnell also may not tolerate a filibuster.

The US House is the one I’m not quite so sure on. McCarthy is the leader and he backs Ukraine aid but the US House typically functions on the Hastert rule which is an informal rule where the speaker won’t bring anything up for a vote without a majority of the majority. That means Ukraine aid needs about 111 Republican congressmen to support it before it even comes up for a vote regardless of the fact basically all Dems are on board.

But in a nutshell, they are really expensive so you use cheaper weapons where possible. You conserve them for attacks on things you really want dead on short notice or that a different weapon wouldn't do for.

So an ideal target for a hypersonic weapon is a patriot. If you launch a huge swarm of cruise missiles the defenders might guess you are trying to overwhelm the patriot battery and move it without even trying to defend. But a hypersonic leaves no time for it to be moved and it was assumed would penetrate it's defences.

You get a kill on the patriot and then it allows you to use your cheaper weapons again as the patriot would no longer be there.  



With this logic it makes perfect sense that the Russians sent one on the first night assuming it would kill the patriot and 8 on the second when they realised it wasn't enough.

As far as ""real time"" goes - there are satellites that update very 10 to 15 minutes - heck, there's a live feed from the ISS.
