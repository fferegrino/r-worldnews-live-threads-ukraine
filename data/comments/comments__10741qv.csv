>These missions have likely been limited to flying over Russian territory, launching long range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine.

>Recent commercially available imagery shows five FELON parked at Akhtubinsk Air Base, which hosts the 929th Flight Test Centre. As this is the only known FELON base, these aircraft have likely been involved in operations against Ukraine.

>Russia is highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss of FELON over Ukraine.

They are using very small groups of 4-8 men, they don't wear any body armor including helmets to save on weight, instead each group carries heavy weapons such as [AGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGS-40_Balkan) automatic grenade launchers and machine guns and as much ammunition as they can carry.

They try to suppress the Ukrainian positions with heavy weapons fire and they dig in. Before digging in they mark their position with a white cloth, so that if they die their comrades know where the partially fortified position is and resume digging. They literally walk over their own dead.

Because they are using such small groups Ukrainian artillery has a hard time hitting them. If they manage to close the distance it also becomes very chaotic and difficult to tell friend from foe.

>Soledar. Situation at 21.00

>Soledar is in a threatening situation. The enemy has reached a position from which they can fire on the main supply route to Soledar. Russians cannot reach the road itself. It is not a complete encirclement, but normal supply along the road is impossible, it is critical for defense. But there are opportunities to improve the situation.

>We have significant forces concentrated in this area, there are troops, there are many people. There is equipment. The difficult situation is clear for everyone. We need actions that will correct this situation. We need not chaotic actions, but planned ones to realize our advantages step by step. The tactical situation is clear to our command, yesterday the commander of the JFO O.Syrsky was in Soledar.

>What is happening in Soledar itself? The temperature complicates the actions of the troops:  - 18, this must be taken into account, and it creates problems for both us and the enemy. At this temperature, combat capability is very dependent on proper supply.

>The 46th Airmobile Brigade is fighting tough defensive battles for every house. They are assisted by some other units - border guards, Special Forces, tankers. Close battles and skirmishes continue.  Russians have advanced in some areas today, but at the cost of very heavy losses.

>The 46th Airmobile Brigade is doing everything possible, maintaining combat capability in extremely difficult conditions. The paratroopers act exemplary, the fighters trust their commanders, and everyone is doing everything possible to destroy the enemy. Russian assault groups are being destroyed one after another in contact battles at close range, but they continue attacks and bring reserves into the battle.

>But the main threat from the Russians is the coverage from the flanks of the city. They will do everything possible to break through to the road in the rear of Soledar.  Fresh reserves from the airborne troops were sent to bypass Soledar, the Russian command attaches great political importance to the capture of Soledar.

>I remember how in the summer one 93rd Mechanized Brigade with the support of TRO battalions held the front from Soledar to Bakhmut for three months in a row. How important it would have been if the brigade and all battalion commanders of the 93rd had been awarded for their skillful actions at the highest level, and tried to organize command, reconnaissance, and use of troops as effectively as the 93rd did. They fought for every landing and inflicted losses on the Russians many times more than they suffered themselves. If you manage in this way, then there is every opportunity to correct the situation.  

>The units of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade and the 46th Airmobile Brigade are acting in the same effective way. Our army has both commanders and experience to effectively destroy Russians and win in the most difficult conditions.

1. The name Bakhmut is apparently theorised to derive from the Tartar turkic word for saltwater. And the salt mines there are historic and massive - I don't think Prigozyn was exaggerating when he said there's an underground city, because there has been extensive salt mining there for as long as the written word, and the region at one time supplied one eight of all salt in the ussr.

2. It also seems like the city has always been at the tectonic boundary between the Kremlin's military authority and free Ukraine. Wikipedia says that Tzar Peter ""allowed"" Bakhmut to be considered a real city in 1701, which he forcibly tried to people with the brave Cossacks in 1704. Immediately the Cossacks erupted into the [Bulavin Rebellion against Moscow.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulavin_Rebellion) Those Cossack ""hosts"" are the native and indigenous people of this region of Ukraine, but far too much of the English language history of the region is polluted with russian terminology.

3. The russians call it Artemivsk instead of Bakhmut, because they're spiteful pieces of shit. Artem was a dude who was a friend of Stalin back in the day, and so Stalin decided to loot from Ukraine the name of a city, and made everyone refer to Bakhmut as Artemivsk instead. What do you think the red terrorists did to Ukrainian ""nationalists"" who preferred the old name.

(VABS)  i think hes done an amazing job for ukraine, especially with the new tanks announcement, specifically trying to get germany to get it’s ass moving on LEOS explicitely and analysing whether leclercs are sustainable for ukraine.  

I wonder what changed recently between macron and zelensky to get this level of support now, as opposed to months ago. But obviously things have been going on behind the scenes. 

Many leaders were cery hesitent in the beginning, but overall Hes done an amazing job and is obviously frustrated with sholz on multiple issues, but is pushing support for ukraine to the next level by just announcing shit by themselves. 

Poland has been amazing this whole time as well. Dont even need to elaborate. 

I saw this from somewhere: the europeans are going “we want americans to send tanks first” america is going “no europe should go first” and ukraine is just “for fucks sake just send anything and everything now”

Is such a well-thought-out insight into the average Russian mind. Decennia of lies upon lies.

In hindsight it would have been better if Napoleon succeeded in conquering Russia. There is a reason why the Polish literally mention Napoleon in their national anthem. It tells you a lot about Russia under the Czars back then. Napoleon didn't even want to attack Russia at first, he wanted Alexander I as ally, against the British. But he had nothing of it. It might have revolutionised the Russian core thinking, take them on a different path had he succeeded.

Now I know what you are thinking, Napoleon isn't a total saint either, within that period. But at least he wasn't a nazi. He has done a lot of good things that have shaped future democracies in the west. Namely, reformed many constitutions, emancipated the jews, gave us the metric system, gave many countries a form of the Code Civil and Code Penal. A fundamental basis of many current lawbooks.

Other than the usual copium, I felt it might be worth posting this here as it seems Russia might be planning something.

Either they're planning to do something terrible and set in mind of people that any released footage must be fake... except this should be clear to anyone that you can't use old corpse to fake a false flag like that, they'd likely show trace of decomposition. The full MoD statement seem to imply that they'd use ""dead"" bodies since the start of the war. But I honestly doubt Russia would be able to do anything on that scale within days/weeks. 

I think it's more to set the idea that newly released footage are fake before Ukraine or any other new network releases unreleased footage. A couple of days/weeks ago, the NewYorkTimes released new footage from Bucha corroborating the events that occurred there. Soon enough, propaganda user started to write things like ""how strange that it's released now and not in april?"", ""it's convenient that they release now since the weather is alike"" (trying to imply it's faked)... ""These CCTV footage are assembled on purpose to make it look like that"" disregarding that you can't fit weeks of CCTV footage in a 6min video. And that's it's obviously assembled to expose an actual timeline of events.

So what they've done in the last weeks is damage control to paint new footage as fake. Now I think it's to prepare the ground for unreleased footage from Kharkiv oblast in Izyum or possibly things that were not yet released but were being investigated. It's easy for Russia to know what kind of event may get released publicly since they're the one doing it. So all they have to do is declare that any of their crime they've done that get released is fake.",False,1673280134.0,t3_10741qv,t3_10741qv,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Russia now feels obligated to capture them at any cost to maintain their military and political pride, even if the cost will far outweigh any benefits gained from holding them. 

The crux of the issue is the different aims and strategies of the Russian and Ukrainian armies. The Russians want to take Ukraine by any means necessary, and thus are willing to throw away an unsustainable number of troops and equipment even if there are better options available. Retreat is the very last option available and a shameful one, so Russia fights well past the point when they should have withdrawn. 

The Ukrainians want to liberate their territory with as few casualties as possible. Taking territory is important, but Ukraine does not want to spend lives needlessly. Thus, Ukraine likes setting up battles where Russia spends thousands of lives and millions of dollars in equipment to gain a small patch of ground. Ukraine withdraws when the cost of keeping an area outweighs its strategic usefulness. Then Ukraine turns around after they’ve sapped Russia’s strength and pummels them, taking back territory with less risk to their own men because the Russians are exhausted. Every time this cycle has played out, Russia’s gotten weaker.

In fact the war is mostly just artillery hammering back and forth and Russia has more artillery. 

When the fighting is from several kms away there isn’t as much advantage to being on the defensive Vs the offensive I reckon and sources seem to indicate that both sides are suffering very heavy losses. 

Last I saw Russia was still firing 2-3x more shells than Ukraine although perhaps Ukraine is more accurate but you can find reports of Ukranian artillery men complaining that they can’t effectively complete counter battery fire etc. due to lack of ammunition. 

Anyway the US has cited both sides over or near 100k casualties with Russia having more but I think post war you’ll find that it’s been incredibly bloody for both sides.

When Ukraine says Balhmut is difficult and they’ve brought in more troops that’s about as close as you’ll get to them advertising losses. Both nations stopped reporting on losses ~10 months ago.

In Soviet history textbooks even the term ""World War 2"" is rarely used, instead it's called the ""Great Patriotic War"" and all the war monuments bear the dates 1941-1945. Few people who are not history nerds even realise that it was the USSR along with Nazi Germany who started the war by invading Poland and will think you're insane if you mention the 1939 joint Soviet/Nazi military parade. Most people believe the war had only started in June 1941 when the USSR was invaded.

The USSR is pictured as the Europe's saviour from the Nazis: all the European countries were weak and could not mount any meaningful resistance to Hitler's army and surrendered in a matter of days. Only the heroic Soviet people through horrible sacrifice have been able to defeat the Nazis and liberate Europe. Nevermind that it was them who occupied half of Europe.

Allied assistance meant nothing. If you try and cite the astronomical lend-lease numbers, they'll just say ""we would have won without them.""

And thus the Soviet/Russian people have this holier-than-thou attitude, they are the victors, the saviours, they can do no wrong. The concept of them acting like the Nazis just does not compute.

The F-16 is the unsung backbone of the USAF and is the most diverse airframe when it comes to the variety of missions and munitions it can be tasked with. It does everything from SEAD to being used as a bomb truck, and it does it all fairly well. 

Current tactics show mostly ‘dumb’ or unguided bombs from either Ukraine or Russia so far as air to ground attacks go. The F-16 would bring that to laser guided, INS guided and/or stand off munitions at a minimum. Not to mention the ability to complete SEAD. The USAF stockpile of mk 82/84 munitions is through the roof, and kits to make them ‘smart’ munitions are a factor of times easier to produce than the munitions for the HIMARS.

For a variety a reasons though, this doesn’t seem too likely anytime soon for Ukraine. I’ve detailed it in posts before and I don’t want to go to into it; fielding even a 4th gen fighter is a MASSIVE undertaking for a country in a peacetime setting, yet alone in full scale conflict.

There's a few weapons they've kluged into working on their Migs, but only with hacks that don't really allow them to make the most out of the weapons.

For example, the anti-radar SEAD munitions they are currently using have three modes they can operate in. One mode where the aircraft sensors (more powerful than the missiles usually) can feed targeting information before launch (even update post-launch). A second mode where the missile can listen for radars and report when it has a solid fix on where to go so the pilot should go ahead and launch. The last mode is where you put in GPS coordinates for the missile to go to and then it attempts to see if there's any radars transmitting to run into, otherwise it self destructs.

Right now the only way to get those missiles working on Migs is to operate in the last mode. This doesn't work too well because without the NATO standard interface, they can't even program the coordinates in flight. They have to set the coordinates on tbe ground, fly to a launch point, fire, and hope the target is transmitting enough for the missile to detect and lock on.

This worked fine enough earlier when russia was just blazing away with emissions, but now they've adapted and keep radiating only for small periods of time before moving the system. It's a MASSIVE reduction in capability for russia to operate this way, which is why Ukraine has been able to operate aircraft directly on the front. But if they could use the full package, they could virtually destroy russia's entire capacity to engage in proper SAM defense because they can keep the F16s flying around with one of these on a pylon while doing other things, and the moment they get a whiff of radar, pop that missile off to make it go away.",False,1673268594.0,t3_10741qv,t1_j3l7rwo,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

We can show the photos and quotes from McConnell about Ukraine.  We can show the photos and quotes from McCarthy.  Below is a CNN article discussing how the republican caucus freaked out on him when he said that further aid would come with strings attached.

Republicans love the military industrial complex.  This is not news.  Ukraine funding is going to continue forever but McCarthy will use passing it to get something like border security.  The cold hard reality is that a lot of traditionally republican special interests (ie. corporations) are doing quite well due to this war and aren't going to be in a hurry to pull the rug out from Ukraine.

Left leaning media tries to paint the republican party as being run by its extremists just like right wing media does the same to the democrats.  Its not true.  Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert don't run the country.

I assume Russia will open the north front again during the spring and that Ukraine will slowly absorb the additional 500k Russian mobilized during the summer giving up several larger built up area in the process just like they did in Severodonetsk.

In Ukraine there was an opposition government and politicians, which meant people had something tangible to fight for - an alternative that already existed and could easily be put in place if they succeeded. The main problem in Russia is firstly that there is no one to fight for - no one who can take charge once the Kremlin falls. Risking your life for a government and leader who can realistically promise change is one thing, but risking your life for almost no hope of change, for no one in particular, is something else. That's only likely to happen when people really have no other choice (hunger, poverty, etc). 

The second main problem is that its impossible to organize anything. Just participating in dissident actions may not be punished that severely (although if you are a man, enjoy eating a shell in Bakhmut the next day). But those who organize protests are the ones who casually get 15 years in jail, and / or their family beaten to shit or disappearing. They watch all the protest and anti-Putin channels. Who do Russians trust to organize something? Who would you trust? So without the ability to organize action, you have to rely on spontaneous unrest, but for that you need a significant portion of the population to be very unhappy and ready to take the initiative. 

And there's the third main problem: far too many Russians just don't care, or if they care, they try to ignore it because facing the truth is way too painful. In Ukraine, it was clear from 2013 that at minimum half the country wanted to free themselves from Russian influence. With that level of support, spontaneous action was not only possible but inevitable. I'd say at best in Russia we are dealing with 10-15% of adults who are strongly against the war, and not everyone is a fighter. How many people are actually ready to act on their values? From what I can see, there were around 1 million participants in Ukraine's revolt. With an adult population of 33 million, and approx 50% being supportive of the action at the time, that's 1 person for every 16 supporters (or in other words, 6% of euromaidan supporters actually participated). If we take a generous 15% of Russias roughly 110 million adult population as being against the war, that's 16.5 million anti war Russians, and if 6% of them took action, that's less than a million, less even than Euromaidan. 

All that was very napkin maths so I invite someone with more time to do more thorough analysis if they like! But I think the general idea is there. 

In conclusion - do Russians have a moral obligation to fight the Kremlin? Yes, sure. Are they cowards or complicit for stating silent? I would lean towards yes. But is it as easy as it was for Ukrainians in 2013? I would argue no. It's certainly not the same circumstances. Again, of course I'm not saying that it was easy for Ukraine. Terrible things happened to euromaidan protestors and they were brave. But they had an opposition to fight for. They had hope. Russians have no one or no hope to fight for, and there is no way to create such hope - such opposition.

McCarthy was an idiot who started going after leftist that bugged him — like actors in Hollywood — rather then actual spies. His actions actually made all efforts to weed out the USSR's agents look like paranoia, thus helping the communists.

With MLK there was at least some sense, as there had been actual links between some African-American activists and the USSR as the ""fellow travelers"", but once it had turned out that he himself had no connections at all, instead of clearing him and stopping the observation, it devolved into gathering info about his sexual practices in order to smear him.

I would imagine that in some hypothetical doctrinal literature on information warfare operations written some time in the cold war and released for public circulation some time after the cold war one could probably find text explaining in detail why there would be value in pursuing such ""Public relations"" efforts given the enemy will hype up every shed and outhouse they capture anyway. 

Oldest trick in the book when fighting a stalled offensive war is to focus down to smaller and smaller detail level until you are seeing reports on specific houses and mines etc being fought over as that gives the impression something big is going on when in reality the trend is pointing towards something completely different and in some case such as now highlighting how the Russian forces are under reflexive control by the Ukrainians. 

Russia is waiting for their 500k mobilized to be brought up for slaughter and Ukraine is waiting for them. 

All of this Bakhmut/Soledar stuff is just Russia throwing 30k to 50k convicts in to a fight to keep everything active until the spring.",1673308931.0,1673308360.0,t3_10741qv,t1_j3ogpme,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

How many times can you slice a loaf of bread before it is a crumb instead of a slice?   The answer to that may be arbitrary.  

The Russian leadership sacrificed resources in Kharkiv and Kherson in order to gain ground in Bakhmut.  Then they did not get Bakhmut.  Maybe one day the Russian army will fly a flag in Bakhmut.

Russian military fortunes in winter of 2022/2023 have not been written yet.  If Russians have some radical improvement in fighting prowess that will be a new thing.  History could deam the second attempt on Bakhmut as more successful than the first.  We won't know for sure until spring.  Maybe both sides will suddenly move armies someplace else.

Cults exploit the same effect, but by locking you down in a community/environment of the cult's choosing.

That normalizer's gone in the digital age, and people self-select into communities rather than the other way around. That puts far less emphasis on the goals of finding common ground, which means facts aren't just less commonplace - they're less fashionable, far less so than directional signposts like ""we need to save the environment"" or ""the west is evil"" or any other political pole of choice.

In a self-selected social community, it's much easier for people to agree on a direction rather than a fact. Note: that doesn't mean the direction is wrong/flawed - this thread is such an example - it's just an example of how Enlightenment ideals have aged poorly.

If we care about elevating reason/fact above opinion Enlightenment-style, I don't know how - education probably helps, but honestly feels too weak to do the job, especially when teaching usually ends up on the bottom economic rung.

In that case, Czechoslovakia could have been accused of the initiation of a war and considered an aggressor. At that time we had some chance against Germans, because their army still was not fully equipped and prepared and we had better chance to resist because of border fortifications, but it could very probably have meant only prolonging the defense time, because (surrounded completely from the north, west and south by minimally ten times more numerous German forces) we were in the situation of practical encirclement, however the Czech army was prepared to defend and was relatively well armed.

They always seek to withdraw while inflicting maximum possible casualties to the attacker, but they are never withdrawing from a town because it's more important to kill Russians than it is to keep the territory. Withdrawing always comes with the downside that they now have to *assault* the town all over again to take it back, which means Ukrainians die in that assault.

No that is not how it actually works most of the time if done correctly as the Ukrainians are doing... 

You increase enemy concentration in areas away form your main line of effort and preferably in locations the enemy will have to leave once you push through in your actual area of interest.

No i am not talking about tactical level stuff within the city. I am talking about strategic and operational level stuff where you dont have to ""take back Bakhmut"" because you tricked the Russians in to reinforcing towards Bakhmut leaving Kreminna open for attack resulting in Russia having to pull out of Bakhmut and re-align their whole line of contact eastward...
