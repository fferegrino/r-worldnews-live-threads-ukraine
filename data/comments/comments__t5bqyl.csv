>  Russia is very strongly integrated into world trade. And already the largest operators refuse to send containers to Russia. But even if a miracle happens and Russia finds someone who is ready to send containers to Russia for three meters, the question is how to pay for it? Export earnings will decrease significantly, as all buyers will try to abandon Russian goods. We see that even non-sanctioned oil companies cannot find buyers for their oil. Gazprom, the main exporter of gas, is already under sanctions, that is, it is generally unclear how it will receive foreign exchange earnings.
> 
> The Russian Central Bank has accumulated a huge money-box, 650 billion dollars. Only more than half of these reserves have already been arrested, and what to do with gold is also not very clear. Few banks in the world will want to buy it from the Russian Central Bank, so as not to fall under sanctions or huge fines themselves.

> Many people think that Russia over the past years built a bunch of factories, only all these factories - automobile, aviation, household appliances, etc. actively use imported components. That is, in the coming months, we will face the shutdown of entire industries with all the ensuing consequences - a shortage of goods, mass unemployment, respectively, a fall in tax collection and, as a result, problems with the payment of salaries to state employees.

> 
> About agriculture. Are you aware that in Russia, the share of imported seeds is almost 40%? And for potatoes, the share of imported seeds is 90%? That is, of course, farmers will come up with something over time, but at least in the short term, we should expect a shortage of basic agricultural products and a sharp rise in prices. And that's not all either. Everyone who can leave the country will start to leave. Already actively felled. The government understands this, which is why they introduced a bunch of measures today to keep IT people. Only they won't work. Therefore, it is very likely that exit visas will soon be introduced for certain categories or completely will close the country.
> 
> The only plus from this story is that those who are nostalgic for the USSR will be able to feel all its delights in their own skin. And it will not be a relatively herbivorous USSR like Khrushchev-Brezhnev-Gorbachev, but a USSR headed by a crazy dictator.

Day 7 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today our city is continuing to be bombed, even more destruction is happening, people are starting to call Kharkiv the new Stalingrad, it’s being relentlessly destroyed. They are shelling living districts and center of the city, and they even destroyed part of one of our universities. These so called liberators are doing damage comparable to the one real fascists did to our city during WWII, and after this they actually think that anyone here would welcome them?

Again from talking with our relatives from Russia they don’t believe that we are being bombarded even when we literally show them videos of destruction, they are telling us “why do you believe these fakes?” Why? Because we literally live here and see it with our own eyes? The constant fear is almost unbearable, explosions are heard throughout the whole day, we fear for our lives every day and they are telling us to stop believing these “fakes”, what fakes, are you telling us that we are living in a movie or something?

And also apparently students here are being held hostage by nazis, as a student that was news to me. Seriously, all their news talk about is nazis, to the point that if you were to do a drinking game and take a shot every time they use any variation of the word nazi you would die from alcohol poisoning within an hour.

It’s so weird that at this point we are so used to the shelling that it doesn’t even bother us that much, we wake up to the sound of explosions as if they were an alarm clock. But now we are being bombed by missiles and aircrafts, which are way scarier than the shelling is, the sound they make is just insane.

The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it.

Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control.

Russia has claimed to have captured the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea. US intelligence and Ukrainian officials have provided a slightly different explanations of what would be the first large city that Russian forces have overtaken.

The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is also reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said.

More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said.

Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion and the Kremlin would not take his country with bombs and airstrikes.

Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign,
its first statement on casualties.

The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against.

A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire is on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected.

Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. This, after 39 countries have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the ICC.

Netflix also has another three series in the pipeline in Russia, including Anna K, based on Anna Karenina. The service launched in the country just over a year ago and is believed to have about 1 million subscribers.

Earlier this week, the company confirmed it would refuse to broadcast Russian state propaganda, in the face of a law that just came into effect. It requires streaming services with more than 100,000 daily users to carry 20 major Russian federal television channels, many of which broadcast Kremlin propaganda.

In the same statement, I indicated that active investigations by my Office would be significantly expedited if a State Party to the Rome Statute (the “Statute”) were to refer the situation to my Office, as provided in article 14 of the Statute...

I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced.

The decision is likely to result in the wholesale dumping of Russian shares by western investors.

Many have already pledged to sell out of Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but the process has been made more difficult because the Moscow stock exchange has been closed all week.

In a statement, MSCI said the decision followed consultation with institutional investors and will take effect from next Wednesday.

During the consultation, MSCI received feedback from a large number of global market participants, including asset owners, asset managers, broker dealers, and exchanges with an overwhelming majority confirming that the Russian equity market is currently uninvestable and that Russian securities should be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes.

Consultation participants highlighted several recent negative developments that led to a material deterioration in the accessibility of the Russian equity market to international institutional investors, to such an extent that it does not meet the Market Accessibility requirements for Emerging Markets classification as per the MSCI Market Classification Framework.”

MSCI said it would maintain a standalone index of the Russian market.

Just adding some context here: Burger King, along with McDonald’s and KFC, are all pretty big deals in Russia. You can find them even in smaller villages. 

They’re almost always better quality than their respective stores here in the US, too. 

Them cutting off business would cut off a popular/low cost food choice for a large amount of Russians.

9656106e7d5f5648a546a767c865b989,t5bqyl,hz49n2p,"How to Spot a Troll, and Why It Matters:

It is important to call out trolls here, both alt right and Russian/state actors, because they knowingly push conversations in directions that amplify fear, despair, and indecision. They seek to drive wedges between people and stoke division in order to make you - yes, you, the person reading this comment *right now* - stop thinking clearly and react out of those same negative emotions. Some of what this can accomplish includes creating the feeling that reality is ambiguous and unknowable (demonstrably untrue), that “both sides are as bad as each other” (a common Soviet-era propaganda tactic to soften criticisms of their crimes), and to make you suffer enough that you give up or tune out entirely. All of this achieves their goals of advancing their agenda of paralyzing their enemies(us), causing their suffering (which is both a means *and* an end), and leaving us more suggestible and prone to groupthink and excessive identification with “our side”.

Be careful that you know what you’re looking out for when it comes to identifying a troll. Here is a video series that really breaks down what they do (warning: it’s a sizable time commitment, but totally worth it): https://youtu.be/4xGawJIseNY

Here are some pointers:

A Russian shill will post according to Russian time zones. Generally speaking, they’ll make a provocative claim that they do not bother backing up. Their intention is to introduce ideas and arguments into the public discourse that stoke fear, raise doubts, and create a sense of general paralysis. Generally but not always, they’ll have noticeably weak English and leap for the low hanging fruit of ad hominem attacks quickly (see below).

In contrast, an alt right troll will likely be someone doing this for fun or to “own the libs”, and will have a largely cohesive account. This is a game to them; it’s how they prove their superiority over everyone else. It’s out of both malice and the belief that advancing the goals of white supremacy and hate are worthwhile(see the videos above for how regular malcontents are conditioned into true antisemites/fascists). They’ll employ explicitly bad faith logical fallacies such as:

The ad hominem, where they attack the person in question when they can’t dismantle their argument: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem

The straw man, where they recast the logic of the other person in question into something easier to dismiss and often not actually related to what they’re saying: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

A red herring, where they attempt to shift discourse away from important points to ones that are not and likely also divisive: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring

At the core, a troll seeks to create a sense of unreality by claiming objective reality can’t really be known, stoke division with bad faith arguments and identity politics, and to make refuting them exhausting for both the observer and individual countering them. They do not argue in good faith, and will consistently try to push the burden of proof onto the other person when they make outrageous claims.

Do not accuse someone of being a troll just for expressing an opinion if they are presenting a logical argument or overwhelmed by emotion. These people will engage if you try with them. Those that don’t are the ones you need to be concerned about.

When you think you have a troll, double check their post history. If similar divisive and/or bad faith comments are common, it’s time to name them explicitly. Do not argue beyond an initial refuting of their position. Do not get drawn into an argument where they hope to find a single thread they can pull at to dismantle you and your point. Mocking their logic similarly makes it seem like just another internet argument between two equally wrong people. Once you refute their initial logic, what I like to say is, “This is a troll. Name, shame, and move on. They want to draw you in to make disputing them exhausting for you and the people who see it.” This is based on successful disinformation tactics employed in Eastern Europe - it works.

Breath deep. We can choose to be a community that works together and supports Ukraine and each other. It is, quite literally, under attack, and will require effort and awareness on all of our parts to maintain and support. We are all emotional because we care.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

#• Putin contemplates invoking martial law - what does that mean?

Martial law essentially means the suspension of civil law and that the army or military bodies will enforce strict rules like for example curfew's or to prohibit big public gatherings of people.

Usually martial law is invoked to suppress people and prevent them from rising up and voicing their dissent with the current ruling party. 

In this instance it would likely mean that russian people wont be able to protest the war anymore without gettinf severely punished. [will be updated once we know more - rumor has it that it will be announced friday the 4th]

The thing is, Germany at least made it to Moscow and Stalingrad before their logistics broke down.

Russia is, if reports are true, having a big problem with logistics at a country they border, in the freaking border areas of said country. You would think that a nation that is built on their pride of having defeated the Nazis in WWII, would have mastered logistics.

Furthermore, how the fuck is it possible the USSR could drive to Berlin in 1945, but Russia is having logistical issues to Ukraine? It's insane. I don't know if this is becuase of how modern warfare operates. If it is true, then it likely points out that in the modern era invading a country with a modern decent army is extremely hard, which is a sigh of relief to many countries. I think China is watching this and getting shivers at the thought of invading Taiwan.

I suppose another possibility, is that the top post in the army, including logisticians, are filled with cronies of Putin who have no idea of what they are doing, rather than merit.

They will destroy as much of the country as is needed in order to force Ukraine into submission. Ukraine WILL fall. Russia WILL try to occupy it. They will spend years, and billions/trillions of dollars trying to keep it.

It's not hard to understand India's position:

1. India borders China and Pakistan and has been through 4 wars with Pakistan and 1 war with China. There are constant incursions into Indian territory on a monthly basis from both Pakistan and China.

2. For decades, the US favored Pakistan and armed them against India. During the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, the US threatened India with nukes.

3. India previously bought arms from the US, but the US refused to sell parts and ammunition for those weapons right in the middle of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, when India needed them most.

4. India was under US sanctions for years after developing nuclear weapons.

Like any other government, the Indian government has a responsibility to protect its citizens. Given US hostility towards India, it had no choice but to buy them from Russia. This has created a relationship of dependence, where India needs to maintain a non-enemy status with Russia in order to service and maintain those weapons.

That said, India realizes that an over-dependence on Russia is not good. Since the early 2000's, they have been building their own defense industry to reduce their dependence on Russia. They have also diversified into buying arms from France, Israel, and other countries. But all of these things take time, for a country as huge as India.

While it's unfortunate that India was forced to abstain from the vote, keep in mind that:

1. The Indian PM has twice called Putin, asking him to withdraw his forces from Ukraine immediately.

2. India has sent medicines and other humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, despite Russian pressure.

3. Most recently, India's State Bank sanctioned Russia by refusing to accept transactions from Russian banks.

The liberal international order is a very very recent phenomenon that is in no way our default nature nor it is guaranteed to continue.  This order was only here in large part due to the unmatched US military might for the last 70 years.  However, as China is rapidly building up its military, and eventually challenge the US, along with other authoritarian actors such as Russia, North Korea, and Iran getting more assertive around the globe, we cannot take anything for granted.

But we may be taking it for granted: Freedom House reported in 2021 that “The global decline in democracy has accelerated” https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-global-decline-democracy-has-accelerated

Freedom is not free. To preserve our values that we hold dear, we must be willing to sacrifice for it.  Democracy and freedom must win in the 21st century; otherwise, what befell on the Ukraine people will happen to our children.

Some may say I am biased, because the US has committed some atrocities, but the difference is that the US political system is transparent and there is an independent justice system.  Most people are not afraid of US and can openly talk shit about it because they know they will not face retribution.  And no one will be suddenly surprised by a war waged by the US, because it will be preceded by months of debate.

I dont know how else to interpret the comment that ""We are keeping the door open to a a diplomatic path forward, but doubt the Kremlin wants that"" and then parking dozens of F15's on tarmac in Japan, and Bidens warning to Russia, sure feels like a change in language at the very least. 

Not trying to be alarmist, but again, if this goes south for Ukraine, I don't think the US and NATO will be able to stay out of it. It could be a bluff, designed to deter Putin further but awfully high stakes. 

Also, as more economic punishments and big fuck you's from the rest of the world get lobbed their way, at what point does the situation at home get untenable for Russians. Will they overthrow him? It really is starting to feel like the only way out that does not involve more escalation and risk of spill over. I mean parking jets in an open display of force is not exactly subtle.

As this conflict has had me worried regarding global security, and after considering the fact that the deposition of Putin would be a means to an end for the war, I took the time to do some research on the politically/militarily influential people in Russia. Apparently, the country is a neo-nazi, ultranationalist coven full of corruption. Most of the neo-nazi ideology in Russia comes from a strong anti-western sentiment regarding liberal democracy. They don't even try to hide their views, many are proudly and openly displaying nazi insignia, nor are they outlawed.

Given the fact that a deposition of Putin would come from within and would leave a massive power vacuum in Russia, those opportunistic enough would want to be the ones to take control of the country, potentially leading to a faction/civil war ala Sengoku Jidai, and with aforementioned Nazis being amongst the opportunists,  could someone retain realistic optimism regarding the future of Russia as a proper democratic country at best, or at worst, the containment of Russo-nationalistic driven expansionism equipped with the world's biggest nuclear arsenal? People like Aleksandr Dugin and the despicable things he has written wield influence in the military, and presumably the public since he's generally approved in Russia.

For the record, although I suppose it matters little since this is Reddit, I am a Greek living in Greece strongly and vocally opposed to the pro-Putin and blind russophilia and propagandistic views that unfortunately have found their way to parts of our society.",1646261702.0,1646260674.0,t3_t5bqyl,t3_t5bqyl,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Putin's grip on his government and the world's discipline to maintain sanctions.

If say Putin offers to withdraw, but demands to keep Crimea, Donbas, and those other two regions in Ukraine, will the world still be united in maintaining sanctions. We know things are going to be even more expensive as a result of these sanctions. Will a country like Germany be prepared to maintain sanctions when the sanctions are also hurting them as well? Or would they try to nudge Ukraine to accept this deal since it means no more deaths and Ukrainians could return home.

I hate to say, but we're all thinking about Ukraine when we are currently at the height of emotional investment. But people get exhausted (dare I say even bored). Will people around the world be as invested (e.g. doomscrolling) in the Ukrainian conflict in 6 months? I don't know.

For two, it's as if so few people have learned from 2016, including many generally well-respected pundits and even actual experts (but hey, they didn't get it right the first time either). Sure, Russia may have started a very stupid war and gotten themselves sanctioned to the bottom depths of Hell, but the US was also a far less authoritarian, much more free-thinking, and less dementedly monocharist, nation than Putin's Russia ever was and will be. Well... at the time, at least. Shit's obviously deteriorated in the US since.

Россияне, мы обращаемся к вам от лица жителей стран всего мира, чтобы донести о том, что ваши официальные СМИ скомпроментированы и подвергаются строгой цензуре.  
  
Пожалуйста, мы умоляем вас, поймите что не украинцы начали эту войну.  
  
Ваш президент отправил войска захватить и оккупировать Украину.  
  
Они ежедневно совершают военные преступления, проводя обстрелы и убийства мирных жителей.  
  
Целые семьи включая детей умирают каждый день.  
  
Мы не провоцировали эту войну. Ваши солдаты были отправлены насмерть неподготовленными и дезинформироваными, думая что едут на учения.  
  
Тысячи молодых людей страдают и умирают бесцельно. Никто кроме Путина и вашего правительства не хочет этой войны. Они жертвуют тысячами жизней ваших солдат ради своих целей.  
  
Фото и видео доказательства их преступлений видит весь мир. Ищите достоверные источники информации, используйте такие сайты как Reddit и другие европейские медиа. Используйте VPN чтобы обойти блокировки и увидеть правду. Правду, которую ваше правительство от вас скрывает.

Not really, no. There are three reasons I guess.

Ukraine was against NATO in 2014, even after the maidan revolution. NATO wasn't an issue until **after** Russia declared war, and annexed Crimea. So Putin can honestly just shut his fucking mouth in regards to ""nato expansion"", its only a 'problem' because he caused it himself by being aggressive.

Another reason is that there were discovered oil fields near crimea in the southern Ukrainian sea (which could compete with Russia, I guess).

This seems a little unlikely though as it would require actual strategic thinking and a well organized assault.

2) More immediately it will allow the Russians to press on towards Mykolaiv and ultimately Odessa. I expect Mykolaiv to fall within the next week, I don't expect Odessa to fall at all, it's just too big and well defended.

It's a given fact that Kherson will be used as a supply source (looted) for food and fuel for the entire southern front, as it is the largest city captured thus far. Time will tell if these supplies will be effectively distributed to further the Russian campaign or wasted / squandered like they were in Belarus. I also think that Kherson and frankly any other occupied city is going to be really hot to keep, so it's an ongoing sap on manpower and equipment.

For Crimea, it was that it was “never Ukrainian and given to Ukraine during the Soviet era - so therefore Ukraine never had right for it and should’ve given it back when they got independence”.

For Donbas and Luhansk it was all about creating a frozen conflict so Ukraine wouldn’t have options for EU or NATO. Plus the land corridor to Crimea.

For Kyiv - Putin supposedly loves Kyiv because it is in his mind the birthplace of Russian state (the Grand Russia) and he can never ever allow Kyiv to become anything else but Russian. Also, in his mind he is the new Peter the Great, except he is creating a new Grand Russia of Russia-Belarus-Ukraine, in which Ukrainians will happily live under one mother Russia. 

For why Ukrainians need to be bombed at - Ukraine actually does have a unit in azov that has neo-Nazis in it, so they conveniently use it as an excuse to accuse the government and what not to be neo-Nazis. They also claim that Ukrainians abuse Russian citizens, forbid Russian language and culture, and are carrying out a genocide against those living in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Sadly, the a big part of the left has been infected with russian propaganda, and they are regurgitating the ""nazi"" agenda since the beginning of the invasion.
They believe that the existence of the Azov batalion is enough justification for the invasion. Also they take the false flag bombing as a fact.

Serious answer:

The Geneva convention specifies that in order to receive the benefits of Prisoner of War status, you must fulfill four requirements. One of those requirements is that you must be conducting yourself in a manner that is in line with the rules of war. Shelling civilians is not in line with the rules of war. Soldiers shelling civilians do not have prisoner of war status and thus are not protected by summary judgment.

Ukraine is under martial law. Therefore summary judgment is allowed under some conditions.

Serious answer:

The Geneva convention specifies that in order to receive the benefits of Prisoner of War status, you must fulfill four requirements. One of those requirements is that you must be conducting yourself in a manner that is in line with the rules of war. Shelling civilians is not in line with the rules of war.

Ukraine is under martial law. Therefore summary judgement is allowed under some conditions.

War is a complex thing.  In past global conflicts, there tends to be a snowball effect that plays out slowly over time.  It is generally pretty difficult ti say precisely when a big war starts.

For ww3… there would be a series of escalations on the part of the potential belligerents.  This process is very much happening, but it could end tomorrow if Russia calls a cease fire.  The only global power at war in ukraine right now is Russia.  The point of no return is when another major power gets directly involved on the other side of the conflict.

But… no major power really has a good incentive to do that.  At least not if they are being remotely rational.  Whatever suffering the Ukrainians feel, it does not compare to nuclear war, so the west will push the line really far, but will not declare war outright.  Russia is being heavily pressured and is more likely to start something, but they are just as fucked in that situation as the rest of us.  And with ukraine kicking their ass right now, expanding the war would only worsen their position.

That’s why the question of whether Putin is being “rational” is such an important question.  As long as he is, the war probably won’t expand beyond ukraine.  If he isn’t, it very well could.

I wish I had a more comforting thing ti say than *shrug* but this is the biggest war in Europe in nearly 80 years.  So nobody knows what will happen really.",False,1646268936.0,t3_t5bqyl,t1_hz4etdr,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

as opposed to figuratively stupid? 

Ukraine took up arms because it decided to on its own, not because they were egged on by the rest of the world. Probably because Ukrainians would rather die than live as the slaves of some russian dictator. 

The thing is that Ukrainians are fighting and dying for their country now and they will continue to fight and die for it if Putin wins this war and manages to install his fake government. The same as all of Europe did during World War 2 against the Germans.

I am curious to know how exactly this is a stupid thing to do. What should they do in your learned opinion?

These discrepancies are intentional. Whenever you evaluate these releases about enemy casualties, you need to very carefully read and weigh every single word in the sentences and consider why that specific vocabulary word was chosen and why the clauses have been arranged in that specific order, and how the meaning of the sentence can be changed if you remove the word and just focus on the actual facts cited.

Then, even when you remove all implied context from the claim, you need to consider (1) does the writer have a motivation to exaggerate or lie about this fact? (2) Have they provided independent corroboration, like photos or video? (3) Have they been reliable or dishonest in the past? (4) If they *wanted* to exaggerate or lie about this fact, how hard would it be to do it without getting proven wrong?

Generally speaking, military press releases from parties that are fighting in a war are not going to be especially accurate about things like numbers because (1) they have a motivation to exaggerate, (2) they generally don't supply picture or video proof, often for security reasons but also often because they can't provide it even if they wanted to, (3) they aren't always reliable, and (4) they know that what they are saying can't be proven wrong.

==============================================================  
Россияне, мы обращаемся к вам от лица жителей стран всего мира, чтобы донести о том, что ваши официальные СМИ скомпроментированы и подвергаются строгой цензуре.  
  
Пожалуйста, мы умоляем вас, поймите что не украинцы начали эту войну.  
  
Ваш президент отправил войска захватить и оккупировать Украину.  
  
Они ежедневно совершают военные преступления, проводя обстрелы и убийства мирных жителей.  
  
Целые семьи включая детей умирают каждый день.  
  
Мы не провоцировали эту войну. Ваши солдаты были отправлены насмерть неподготовленными и дезинформироваными, думая что едут на учения.  
  
Тысячи молодых людей страдают и умирают бесцельно. Никто кроме Путина и вашего правительства не хочет этой войны. Они жертвуют тысячами жизней ваших солдат ради своих целей.  
  
Фото и видео доказательства их преступлений видит весь мир. Ищите достоверные источники информации, используйте такие сайты как Reddit и другие европейские медиа. Используйте VPN чтобы обойти блокировки и увидеть правду. Правду, которую ваше правительство от вас скрывает.  
  
Все мы хотим только мира. Выступите против дикататора. Вы ещё можете помочь закончить эту войну.  
==============================================================  
Translation:   
Citizens of Russia, we implore you from countries all around the world to understand that your media has been compromised and censored.  
  
Please, we beg you, understand that Ukraine did not start the war with your country.  
  
Your president ordered your troops to invade and occupy Ukraine.  
  
He has been committing war crimes daily. Bombing and executing innocent civilians.

In late February 2000, the Russian military attempted to surround and destroy a large Chechen separatist force (including many foreign fighters) withdrawing from the Chechen capital Grozny to Shatoy and Vedeno in the southern mountains of Chechnya following the 1999–2000 siege and capture of Grozny and the rebel main force's breakout from the city earlier that month.

World War II was a total war for most nations. Since WWII, most wars have been limited wars, meaning that (as the name suggests) the nations involved intentionally limit what they will commit to the war. 

The reason, of course, is nuclear weapons; any nation that has them and does not use them in pursuing a war is by definition limiting its options. Most countries have further limited their commitment to warfare, largely to avoid escalations that could put nuclear options on the table.

In a total war, literally everything is on the table. Targeting of civilians, use of chemical and biological agents, 'false flag' movements, assassination, intentionally targeting humanitarian workers, torture, genocide, martial law, and nuclear weapons are all considered legitimate means during a total war. Additionally, the total commitment of your industrial and agricultural capacity to support your war effort is a necessarily feature before you can call something a total war.

For Ukraine, this is fast approaching a total war, but Russia isn't close to a total war - yet. They have certainly escalated in that direction, but certain things are still off the table for them.",False,1646269018.0,t3_t5bqyl,t1_hz4eooa,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >In economics, hyperinflation is very high and typically accelerating inflation. It quickly erodes the real value of the local currency, as the prices of all goods increase. This causes people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies, such as the US dollar. When measured in stable foreign currencies, prices typically remain stable.

 >The Wolfsangel (German pronunciation: [ˈvɔlfsˌʔaŋəl]) is a German heraldic charge inspired by historic wolf traps, consisting of two metal parts and a connecting chain. The top part of the trap, which resembled a crescent moon with a ring inside, was fastened between branches of a tree in the forest while the bottom part, on which meat scraps were hung, was a hook meant to be swallowed by a wolf. The simplified design based on the iron ""wolf-hook"" was often heavily stylized to no longer resemble a baited hook hung from a tree or an entire wolf trap.

The thinking behind the bombing campaign wasnt as punishment for the population and never was seen as such on a strategic level. The key objective was to destroy industrial capacity (and in this it arguably failed, production output in Germany was at its highest in 1944, well into the time when bombers had free reign in the skies).

In the beginning the allies tried a very modern approach with precision strikes against key targets. Except the bombers at the time were in no way able to execute them with a satisfying degree of success from the altitudes they had to operate at. So they took to carpet bombing. Now this worked better. So they took to simply bombing entire cities to make the workers at the factories homeless and thats why you see the pictures of utterly demolished cities in Germany after ww2. 

With current weapons technology doing the same thing as in ww2 would be utterly wasteful and unneccessary.

I don't think he's convinced he's losing.  He's definitely not losing militarily.  The only reason Russia's forces haven't leveled Ukraine is that he doesn't want to.  He wants the resources and as much of the infrastructure left intact as possible.  Supply convoys and aging tanks are there because their numbers intimidate.  A wing of bombers could absolutely eradicate anything Ukraine has left.  And if it comes down to defeat vs. a pyrrhic victory, you can bet Putin will take the pyrrhic victory.

So the only way left for him to lose is economically.  But like it or not, Russia is not completely cut off.  They still have strong trade with the Western world in gas and oil, which are a huge part of the Russian economy.  The Ruble is in freefall but Putin's not dumb enough to keep his wealth in Rubles.  He'll have it in Euros and Dollars.  And he'll find ways of getting that money in and out of Russia.  He also has the ability to trade with China.  And now rumors are starting that he might impose martial law and seize the funds of the Russian citizens to continue to fund his war.  

Sure, his country might be falling into poverty and his popularity may be plummeting but he doesn't care.  He doesn't need to win an election or appeal to the ""common man"".  He just has to keep the Oligarchs convinced that staying the course will lead to a stronger Russia.  And even if he can't do that, they're still afraid of him.  It's not a guarantee that one would be brave enough to take him out.

""Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.

To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:

(a) Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;""

If you are asking if there will be an insurgency in the style of Afagnastan that's a very complicated question. The world has never seen an insurgency like that in a ""rich"" country. Obviously, many of the factors that made Afghanistan so difficult don't exist in Ukraine. 

The closest example would be Northern Ireland, although even that certainly lacked the intensity of Afghanistan during the Soviet or American occupations. The answer is no one really knows. But, it would be unprecedented. 

That's also a different question as to if Russia will succeed in the short term, and still, a different question of will Russia will succeed in the long term. 

We don't know their political aims much further securing water for the Crimea, their asperation in the Donbas and keeping Ukraine as a sort of buffer state.

If their political aims are limited to that, then sure they could succeed. If their aims are to make Ukraine into a federal state with power split among the east and west, maybe. If their aims are to incorporate Ukraine into greater Russia that's infinitely more difficult to accomplish.

That is not the same thing as Russia winning though. Defeating, even destroying a nation's army and/or government doesn't mean you have won. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't it really depends on what 'winning' is for you and what the population does. 

Germany in WWII surrendered, and that really did end the war in europe. There wasn't a serious resistance/partisan movement in the allied occupied zones. They installed a new regime and it was accepted by the population. They won. 

Could this happen in Ukraine? That is where I have my doubts. The beating the army, even having parts of it surrender, yes I think that is very likely. It's what comes after where I have my doubts. 

This is also what makes me have doubts about Ukraine retaking Crimea and the separatist regions.

Combatants who would otherwise be privileged but have breached the laws and customs of war (e.g., feigning surrender or injury or killing enemy combatants who have surrendered). The loss of privileges in that case only occurs upon conviction, i.e. after a competent court has determined the unlawfulness of the conduct in a fair trial.

However, under martial law, a military tribunal does also qualify as a competent court. 

So after being convicted (either by civilian or military authority in case martial law is in effect), execution would be permissable if allowed by the current law of the detaining power.
