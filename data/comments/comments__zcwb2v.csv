Some examples:

> ""I think Putin will win this war because the Russian armed forces are modern, well-equipped. (...) The Ukrainian armed forces have obsolete equipment, are in an insanely bad position. (...) Providing military aid now will not bring anything more up to date for the ongoing conflict. (...) From a military point of view, the matter is over. And my assessment is that it will only be for a few days and no more."" 

February 2022

> ""I would guess it's only a matter of days or a few hours before this thing is done militarily.""

February 2022

> ""The Russians are currently attacking out of Crimea towards Odessa. I think the city will also be taken shortly.""

March 2022

> ""I honestly don't see this Ukrainian offensive. Some minor terrain gains near Kiev do not constitute a counteroffensive.""

March 2022

Day 284-285 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday it was mostly quiet, but they were shelling Kupiansk as usual, hitting civilian infrastructure and residential buildings, which sadly killed 1 civilian. Today wasn't nearly as quiet as yesterday, and the expected ""massive"" missile strike finally happened.

That missile strike really didn't live up to the hype that it created, only 70 missiles is far from the 150-200 missiles that we were expecting all this time. Even better that over 60 of those 70 missiles were shot down and it really shows, as when comparing the previous missile strikes there are basically no problems with electricity today. Only in Odesa there was some non-negligible damage to our energy infrastructure that might take a couple of days to fix. Pretty much every other city is relatively fine, all it did is that now the emergency blackouts are back, but that's it.

There's a really good chance that the missile strike wasn't nearly as bad as predicted because of our attack on their air bases in the morning. We already saw photos of at least one bomber being damaged, and considering that the number of Tu-95s used today was lower than expected, means that there's also a good chance of at least some of them being damaged/destroyed, even Russians themselves reported 2 Tu-95s being damaged and it could be more than that. 

Seeing their air bases far behind the frontline get hit is just great, it also shows them that we could hit Moscow if we wanted to. Apparently those were old repurposed Soviet drones as well, not even the new ones that we are developing right now, which shows just how bad their air defense really is. The new drones are supposed to be finished before this year ends, so that will be really good, hopefully we can produce a lot of them.

If Ukraine actually had them it would not even be a lie.  Ukraine removing the nuclear weapons is what makes it possible for Ukraine to defend itself.  There is no way Ukraine could have lasted this long with no support from USA or UK.  

Fact is the nukes are basically useless.  If Zelinsky had fired one the results would be horrific. Where are you suggesting he would have shot it?  He could turn his own country into a nuclear wasteland.  Or he could commit mass murder of civilians in Russia.  Then Russian nukes would have turned Ukraine into a nuclear wasteland anyway.  It is not *just* widespread death, nuclear effects cause people to die horribly.  

I think we can give Ukrainians the benefit of the doubt and assume they would have just shot Zelinsky instead of following the order to fire nuclear missiles.  Shooting the head of state would have significantly increased the confusion and chaos at the war start.

second the author in a nutshell blames telegram for the fact that the two werent using the end to end encrypted channels, and spins up wild theories how russian forces COULD HAVE tracked the messages metadata, and COULD HAVE gotten device access, all with zero facts to base it on.

and then he spins up wilds theories on how the russians ""could have"" gotten access to telegram servers by bribes, getting an insider into telegram, or because of the founders ""sense of patriotism""? what the fuck is this guy talking about?

One of the things that lead to the fall of the Soviet Union was the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  Why did so many men die there only to have the Soviet puppet gov't fall to the Mujahideen (who subsequently were left to weak to form an effective gov't, and were overthrown by the Taliban, but that is another story)?  Especially after Soviet propaganda had said things were going so well there for so long.

This was the second ""big lie"" Soviet propaganda was caught with in three years (Chernobyl happened in 1986), which lead to Soviet citizens questioning things publicly for the first time since the October revolution.  

Putin's regime knows this.  If they give up on Bahkmut then maybe the people at home will start to question what's really going on in Ukraine.  And if that happens, and with access to the Internet, they may have their see what is really going on.  And if that happens they'll find out that Czar Putin is not the infallible and benevolent Prince the Russian propaganda machine have said he is.

I did not mean that offensives will stop because of winter. Sure humvees and stuff can move in the snow, not just tracked vehicles, that is true.
However trucks can’t follow them offroad like they could in dry summer conditions. 

True things might speed up compared to mud season, but i also wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t. 

My original post was more of a reminder to people who might not be aware of how much of a strain winter can put on a force. Even if said force is very used to and prepared to the conditions. It’s not like ukraine is as cold or snowy as Siberia or even Finland, so they get a bit of a break there. 

Also yes of course none of this will come as a surprise to either side, and Ukraine has had hundreds of thousands of troops fighting in winters since 2014. Russians relying on conscripts don’t have that advantage in experence.

Add that to a falling GDP due to the world divesting itself from fossil fuels over the next decade, and the lasting effects of mobilization and emigration and  it is clear that aside from the nuclear stuff Russia will be so poor it won't be a threat for decades to come.

There is also the international arms market which basically 'leaks' modern tech all the time. For example the USA intends to sell Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia a country where you can bribe your way through anything. Yet they are not giving them to Ukraine. That currently secret AI developed recognition system will probably be in every camera door bell in a couple of decades.

 >Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his flight that ended with a landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987. A teenage amateur pilot, he flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, being tracked several times by Soviet Air Defence Forces and civilian air traffic controllers, as well as Soviet Air Force interceptor aircraft. The Soviet fighters did not receive permission to shoot him down, and his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft several times. He landed on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the Soviet Union.

I think about these things from the former ""east bloc"" where there the same ""reset"" of post-socialism has ended very differently.

My feeling is that Hannah Arendt had the best but most uncomfortable answer for how these things come to be. There is banality to this brand of mass evil, and that means it can happen anywhere under the right circumstances. With Nazism and Communism, it was a bit easier to understand in that there was an ideology that masked the immorality with a promised future. Your answer is the best I've seen in terms of the ""social glue"" but it still puzzles me a little what  ordinary Russians are offered. Putin himself seems so underwhelming. We should not be so smug, because it always feels like it is around the corner with leaders like Babis, Duda or Orban  (who we would have put in the same bucket this time last year). With MAGA, Le Pen, Farage.... nobody is really immune.

If it will spot a piece if terrain that gives similar signal as programmed, it checks with it's inertial navigation system and if it's ""close enough"" it decided it's the entry point for it's path (usually a shore point).

 >Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his flight that ended with a landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987. A teenage amateur pilot, he flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, being tracked several times by Soviet Air Defence Forces and civilian air traffic controllers, as well as Soviet Air Force interceptor aircraft. The Soviet fighters did not receive permission to shoot him down, and his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft several times. He landed on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the Soviet Union.

The majority of Russian warheads are 50kt(Cruise), 100kt(MIRV), or 1mt(unitary). They have around 780 warheads(not missiles) in their strategic(read: missiles that can go 6000km+) platforms. Most of them are ground based(about 75%) and the rest are sub based. Almost every Russian MIRV warhead is sub based.

In terms of applying those megatons to targets the Russian system requires perfect launch timing and coordination. Their ability to prepare missiles for launch limits them heavily to GLBM strategies. If any part of their launch gets exposed before the majority of those missiles are in the air the flight time for western missiles is fast enough to get inside the launch window and kill the ground based silos. As Russia has very few protected cruise missile launch systems these warheads are not a major concern in a global exchange scenario.

Additionally the inherent inaccuracy of Russian nuclear weapons means you need more per target to reliably ""kill"" it. A miss of 500-1000m can actually prevent significant destruction for many cities. The lack of MIRV options also significantly limits the amount of megatons that can be applied for its task of destroying military bases and cities. I wont go into the long physics here but topography plays a huge roll in how effective nuclear bombs are.

The TLDR of the subject is the maximum amount of death Russia could cause with their nuclear arsenals is likely to be less than 1 billion and most likely to be less than 300m when considering realistic scenarios.

There would be no such recognition of this morality if the world were Russia-centric (or China-centric, or Iran-centric, etc.).

You are not taking one thing into account. Corruption. Apparently someone misplaced a lot of airframe parts and Russia is no longer able to make Kh-55, Kh-65, Kh-35 or Kh-555. If they move their cruise missile nukes to Kh-102s it will free up around 700-800 airframes of Kh-55, including awesome engines R95-300. The problem is - to upgrade them to Kh-555 they would have to literally cut them up (kits are riveted and the bodies are so fragile that there is no guarantee that removing the rivets and putting them back together will survive the flight. They tried to weld them, but with unknown rate of success). So best case scenario they would have 1500 Kh-555 frames, but no warheads and electronics for them. Also no external fuel tanks. I would say that route is pretty dangerous, but we have to count on Mr. P. that he will try everything.

 That leaves us with Kh-101. From Ukrainian intelligence we know they are making 15 of them per month. My digging came to up to 20 per month, but much less in 2014-2018. So they would have around 1600 airframes for Kh-101/102. However the rate they are making the engines for them is atrocious. Last year they made just 150 of them. But technically they can use engines from denuclearized Kh-55s. They have to leave strategic reserve for nukes, so 800. It means the best case scenario till beginning of the war they had 800 working Kh-101s. 

Ukrainians counted 400+ launched (I think it was 457) excluding today. Kh-101 is pretty easy to differentiate from the base Kh-55 family, so we can believe them. During the war Russia could make 120 of them. As we don't have today's tally yet, so best case scenario till yesterday they had 520 of them left. Kh-555 wasn't reported for some time now, so the effort to convert the old airframes failed or they are still working on it. Oh, and considering that from 40 missiles en route to Kiyv only 10 reached the air defense envelope, there is a chance those 30 were Kh-55s. Even Kh-101 is not that bad. And that would explain launching in two waves separated by minutes.

Now Putin could decide one day that actually 800 missiles are good enough as a reserve and they can launch 2 additional waves on Ukraine with these 200 missiles. And maybe after that Putin thinks that 500 is still ok, so they can fire another 300 missiles at Ukraine.

But maybe it's not 500 but instead it's 5000. We simply don't know. The fact that they use Iranian drones and maybe even soon Iranian balistic missiles doesn't tell us what how big the reserve was in the first place, just that they reached their own limit which again we also don't know.

I'm not the one that said ""I'm not sure what you're getting at.""

I never said that your argument didn't make sense, I said it was using incorrect information. 

>The climates in these regions are still not comparable to Ukraine. Even when the temperatures can reach similar lows, they are significantly drier.

I can agree with it's possible that the *humidity* could be a factor, but that's not what you said in your first comment where you explicitly said ""cold weather"" and ""warmer"" which means *temperature* which is different than *humidity*.",False,1670259008.0,t3_zcwb2v,t1_iz0ojqi,,2,1,0,1,0,0,
