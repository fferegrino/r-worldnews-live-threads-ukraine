Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 9 July 2022
 
- Russia is moving reserve forces from across the country and assembling them near Ukraine for future offensive operations. A large proportion of the new infantry units are probably deploying with MT-LB armoured vehicles taken from long-term storage as their primary transport. While MT-LBs have previously been in service in support roles on both sides, Russia has long considered them unsuitable for most front-line infantry transport roles. It was originally designed in the 1950s as a tractor to pull artillery, has very limited armour, and only mounts a machine gun for protection.

- In contrast, most of Russia's first echelon assault units were equipped with BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles in February, featuring armour up to 33mm thick and mounting a powerful 30mm autocannon and an anti-tank missile launcher. Despite President Putin's claim on 07 July 2022 that the Russian military has 'not even started' its efforts in Ukraine, many of its reinforcements are ad hoc groupings, deploying with obsolete or inappropriate equipment.

3/3 Meanwhile, 🇨🇳 hasn`t condemned 🇷🇺 aggression and has been reassuring Moscow about the strength of their relationship. As 🇷🇺 isolation becomes increasingly suffocating, Beijing is unlikely to be shy about using Russia’s dependency on 🇨🇳 to try to dictate 🇷🇺 policies.

Day 136 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The day started with a missile strike right in the middle of the city, at 10am they fired a missile at some residential buildings, completely destroying 2 of them. Six people got injured, some were trapped under the rubble, but miraculously nobody died. Again no military targets in sight, they are just destroying civilian infrastructure for no reason.

Then at midnight air alert started and we got information about missiles being launched from Belgorod, but nothing reached the city in the end. Sometimes we wonder if Russians are baiting us into thinking that they fired their missiles just to make us worry, because they know that Ukrainians read their channels. After that, at 3:30am, they fired their missiles again, this time 2 of them did manage to get through, and caused a fire in the city. It is unknown what was hit yet. 

At the same time the rate at which Russian ammo depots are blowing up is just crazy, there were at least 3 confirmed ones today, and in the past 4-5 hours something like 3-5 more hits were reported. Though the funniest one is definitely Chornobaivka, they have already been hit there 26 times, and for some reason they still continue to use it as an ammo and vehicle depot. What are they even thinking? Is it “They hit our base in that location 25 times already, surely it won’t happen again, so just place more ammo and vehicles there, nothing bad will happen to it.”?",False,1657421487.0,t3_vut2tf,t3_vut2tf,,0,63,0,63,2,0,

Algeria is another country that got onboard the Russian bus. Algeria seems to be in a tougher spot. Tensions over Western Sahara have recently risen, with Russian prodding I suspect, and Algeria has pulled further away from Morocco and Spain. And don’t even say the word ‘France’ over there, that bad blood runs very deep.




Algeria is a decent-sized gas exporter, they have pipelines that run to Spain across the Strait of Gibraltar, and another set across to Italy via Sicily. Being Russias ‘friend’, however, has left Algerian capacity lagging behind, lest they start competing too effectively with Russian supplies to Europe.



The only country that I can think of that could peel Algeria away from Russian influence is Italy. I’m not going to pretend to understand Italian politics, and I’m skeptical of anyone claiming that they do, but I do know that they are a founding member of NATO, and that they have a better reputation in North Africa than any of the other countries on that side of the Mediterranean.



I think that an Italian led diplomatic offensive in to Algeria has the potential of really putting an end to Russian gas extortion. Not in the short-term, but faster than many might think. The pipelines already exist. The gap to Central Europe is actually entirely within Italy, there is no connection from South Italy to North Italy. Fill that gap, add capacity in Algeria, and gas could be flowing towards Germany in a few years. Even just putting a plan like that in to motion would have an impact, I would think.

She warned residents they could be used as human shields by the Russians and staying in the occupied districts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions is dangerous.

👉 On Friday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**

👉 The US announced another $400 million of military aid to Ukraine including 4 new HIMARS systems.  There was some confusion as one of the major Twitter aggregators misread a Financial Times (A reputable paywalled source) article and [mistakenly concluded](https://twitter.com/ItsArtoir/status/1545508456786010112) Ukraine was also going to be supplied with 300km range missiles for the system.  You will see this mistaken claim echoing around the twitterverse for a while as the misattributed Financial Times citation lends it credibility and the paywall makes it hard to prove/disprove.

👉 The US briefing had the following interesting points...

* The $400 million in aid does include 1,000 ""excalibur-like"" rounds of ammunition.  These are extra long range, super high-precision artillery shells that can turn ordinary artillery into a sniper rifle.

* The NASAMS anti-aircraft systems are still a few months out from delivery, so the recent improvement in Ukrainian anti-air (15% success then vs. 80% now) is likely coming from previously announced SHORAD Aspide missiles from Spain.

* The US is not currently, or planning to train Ukraine Troops to fly F-16s.

* Ukraine currently has 8 US HIMARS operating in the country with the US to provide 4 more.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has no clear war objectives and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: a draw that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

He provided quite good operational reasons why this might not be the case. Much like daily reporting. 

What he missed out was strategy, moral hazard and grudges. 

1. NATO is in this for the game. If they *lose* this NATO might nearly as well disband. They won’t. 

2. Even without NATO (let’s say the US elects a Russia friendly republican) and France and Germany get cold feet. Estonia, Lithuania & Poland at the least will continue to provide support. 

3. No Russian will be safe to walk on Ukrainian territory for 100 years. Bucha saw to that. 

4. Russia has no friends. China and India merely use commodity basics to their advantage but their isn’t even a strong market alignment 

5. The US cannot allow Russia to succeed because it will embolden China re Taiwan 

6. This is essentially the cheapest and most interesting war for the US to defeat their eternal adversary without American body bags. Alas this comes at a cost to Ukrainian souls but from a realpolitik POV the US is like a cat toying with a mouse. It can destroy (by proxy) at any time but it’s more educational to drain Russia, see all it weaknesses and strengths and take them down when they’ve learnt enough. 

7. Manpower - Russia needs to mobilise to get some kind of parity. It can’t with a dramatic risk to Putin and the over throw of the regime 

8. Nukes is a busted flush. Too many in the corridors of power don’t want their families to die. There is a risk but it is very low. 

9. Advanced weaponry. Russia is fighting WWI/II tactics. It’s levelled plenty and it’s disgusting. Those days are over with the supply and training on precise NATO weapons hitting behind their front lines and at their supply lines. 

10. Suing for peace with Russia keeping Donbas doesn’t work as it just means they’ll push again in 5 or ten years. Appeasement didn’t work with Crimea, it won’t work with Donbas 

11. Civilians- Ukraine has been trying to minimise civilian casualties. The territory they will be looking to take back are dead cities. They won’t be restrained by worrying about hitting civilians as they are mostly gone and the remaining are mostly sympathisers. 

If anyone can tell me why I’m wrong pls let me know. I want Ukraine to win and thrive and Russia to lose any capacity to do this again. 

Tactically and operationally Russia has made some gains. Strategically none that can be maintained. Their *only* hope was taking Kviv at the start and installing a puppet government. After they failed at that they were fucked.

Not only is Ukraine at risk, but so too is NATO, and the National Security of the US.


Just imagine what happens if Trump (or any other Republican) is able to openly collude with Russia to drop sanctions again. They might openly disparage and try to destroy NATO again. They will certainly stop providing aid to Ukraine. In the best case, they will bully other NATO countries to stop providing aid too. In the worst case, they will provide aid directly to Russia to win instead.

Edit: this is in reference to [earlier question](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/vut2tf/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/ifg1vyw/).  She’s obviously kicked up a hornets nest here

While US described him as “ U.S. official who has met Yermak, speaking about the Ukrainian's efforts to deal with Russia, described him as ""misguided, mistaken, and overly impressed with his own ability to navigate these political currents,” although Ukrainian expert said “Zelenskiy's trust in Yermak was ""so strong"" that it can effectively ""neutralize"" the impact of Western doubts and slumping ratings.”  Press notes last year that “Yermak has often been accused by critics and political opponents as being too cozy with Moscow, and close observers of Ukrainian politics who spoke to RFE/RL--including former Ukrainian and U.S. officials and analysts, business leaders, and civil-society members--say he has played a major role in slowing the pace of Zelenskiy's reform agenda over the past year.  There are other related criticisms as well, including that Yermak jealously guards access to the 43-year-old Zelenskiy, allegedly preventing the novice president from receiving the full spectrum of views from both inside and outside government.” (https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-yermak-zelenskiy-west/31307362.html). 

The European Council on Foreign Relations described Yermak as [pro-Russia](https://ecfr.eu/article/war-of-unreality-why-russia-is-threatening-to-escalate-the-ukraine-conflict/).  

And his [Wagner debacle](https://euromaidanpress.com/2021/11/26/zelenskyy-tells-about-planned-coup-attempt-denies-postponing-wagner-operation-blames-journalists-takeaways-from-5-hour-press-marathon/)
 prompted [calls for his termination](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3358080-zelensky-its-inexpedient-to-dismiss-yermak.html).

He represented Ukraine in the direct negotiations with Russia—and Poland had called it “a [trap for Ukraine.”](https://warsawinstitute.org/kozak-yermak-plan-donbas-trap-ukraine/)
While it has been reported (by CNN, on tv) that Yermak advised Zelensky that Russia would not invade, based upon his ongoing negotiations with Kozak—so being less than prepared based on Yermak’s advice is a fair accusation.

He’s known to have plenty of backroom-style deals and allowing corruption—from meeting Giuliani in Spain with his anti-Biden pro-Ukrainian narrative and then agreeing to have Zelensky say [mendacious script Giuliani requested in order to obtain military aid](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ukraine-clearinghouse-2019-10-31-timothy-morrison-deposition-transcript-excerpts.pdf), to [meeting with Russian lobbyists](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2019/11/14/7231975/?_x_tr_sl=uk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), to [involvement with his brother’s selling](https://hrwf.eu/ukraine-fight-against-corruption-a-suspicious-silence-and-inaction-of-the-prosecutor-general/) of government [positions](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/nabu-opens-two-cases-against-yermak-brothers-alleged-graft.html), then the [silence](https://hrwf.eu/ukraine-fight-against-corruption-a-suspicious-silence-and-inaction-of-the-prosecutor-general/) and eventual [termination of relevant prosecutors](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-yermak-zelenskiy-west/31307362.html).

German industry is very concerned about the possibility that Russia will cut off its gas supply completely. According to the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), this could cause a severe recession for Europe's largest economy.

On Monday, the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, will be temporarily closed due to annual maintenance. Russia had previously cut gas supplies through the pipeline by 60 percent due to technical problems. Critics reject the Russian argument of technical problems and believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on the West for supporting Ukraine.

Maintenance

It is now feared that Moscow will completely stop supplying gas to Germany after the maintenance. According to DIHK president Peter Adrian, a complete Russian supply freeze could lead to an economic contraction of 10 percent or more in the winter period.

Many companies will have to stop operations if there is no more gas, Adrian said. According to him, new terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will not be ready in time to compensate for the loss of Russian gas.

“Unfortunately, we have to take into account a scenario that when maintenance stops on July 21, gas will no longer flow through Nord Stream 1. That would be a disaster,"" said Adrian.",1657376756.0,1657376374.0,t3_vut2tf,t3_vut2tf,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

Russia is a physically large and fairly resource rich country. It could survive, on some level, entirely without trade if they must. What is hurting them right now is that they don't have the full spectrum of industries that they could, and it will take a long time for them to build those back up. Assuming that a closed economy is the way they choose to go. In the meantime, things like electronics will be in ever shorter supply.

As for their economy, they are a country with a mind blowingly wide gap between the poor and rich. That gap is also a physical thing. Moscow or St Petersburg look like reasonable European cities. But the further east you go, the poorer and poorer things get. So their ""economy"" numbers are a few modern cities backed by millions of people living on subsistence levels, and those people won't notice the lack of X-Boxes they could never afford anyway.

Add in that Russia inherited the Soviet Union's habit of stockpiling old equipment, ""just in case"", so they can keep a war going on ever more obsolete equipment.

* The Ukrainian people

It was able to pivot this strength to very quickly generate military power.

Both Australia and Russia are similarly rich on the world stage, but both of us are rich from digging up stuff and selling it.

When you can make easy money, the motivation to develop massive industry isn’t there.

You might think it would be - surely Russia and Australia could make even MORE money by digging stuff up and turning it into cars and stuff and then transporting it, but that’s not how human nature works.

Consequently, both Russia and Australia has some industry, but not huge amounts.

Not like America, Europe and China does, where size and internal competition are huge drivers for industrial growth.

> NATO is in this for the game. If they lose this NATO might nearly as well disband. They won’t.           

True, but only if NATO loses due to *political* reasons. If NATO countries cannot agree on a strategy and remain cohesive during this war, then NATO might as well disband because the alliance is useless. You can’t have a military alliances where some members want to fight(or support the fight) and some want to make peace and offer concessions.         

>Even without NATO (let’s say the US elects a Russia friendly republican) and France and Germany get cold feet. Estonia, Lithuania & Poland at the least will continue to provide support.         

A) Don’t forget Great Britain. And B) US National security strategy is hard to change, it’s like trying to turn an aircraft carrier. It’ll take a while and will be difficult, with all sorts of political headaches for anyone who tries to do so. I don’t see it happening. I would also like to point out that Trump administration started providing weapons to Ukraine as soon as he took office, something that Obama administration refused to do. So it’s not so black and white as Republicans help Russia, Democrats help Ukraine.       

>No Russian will be safe to walk on Ukrainian territory for 100 years. Bucha saw to that.

Good point. Any partisan resistance would be fierce.         

>Russia has no friends. China and India merely use commodity basics to their advantage but their isn’t even a strong market alignment.       

To add to that Russia apparently pissed off China significantly. Russia has always considered Kazakhstan to be within its sphere of influence, but over the last few years China has been inching their way there and it turned into a good-natured competition for influence. Recent comments by Kazakhstan’s president and subsequent response from Russia can only mean that Russia lost Kazakhstan and it now has the full backing of China. Either it’s China being opportunistic or it’s payback for some spite.          

>The US cannot allow Russia to succeed because it will embolden China re Taiwan.    

Touché 

>This is essentially the cheapest and most interesting war for the US to defeat their eternal adversary without American body bags. Alas this comes at a cost to Ukrainian souls but from a realpolitik POV the US is like a cat toying with a mouse. It can destroy (by proxy) at any time but it’s more educational to drain Russia, see all it weaknesses and strengths and take them down when they’ve learnt enough.          

See? I’ve been trying to explain this to these realpolitik sons-of-bitches, but all they want to talk about is “great power games, Ukraine must surrender because it’s in Russia’s sphere of influence”.          

>Manpower - Russia needs to mobilise to get some kind of parity. It can’t with a dramatic risk to Putin and the over throw of the regime.            

Even IF Russia mobilizes, they can’t train, equip, organize and supply the necessary troops. It would literally be easier at that point to just overthrow Putin than to win the war with Ukraine.          

>Nukes is a busted flush. Too many in the corridors of power don’t want their families to die. There is a risk but it is very low.         

The Soviet system had 8 steps for decision to launch nuclear weapons- from the leader down to base commander and the guy who sits in the bunker and presses the button. There’s a lot more people than just the corridors of power that need to be convinced of sacrificing themselves and their families for the sake of Putin’s ego.        

>Advanced weaponry. Russia is fighting WWI/II tactics. It’s levelled plenty and it’s disgusting. Those days are over with the supply and training on precise NATO weapons hitting behind their front lines and at their supply lines.          

Nothing to add. 

>Suing for peace with Russia keeping Donbas doesn’t work as it just means they’ll push again in 5 or ten years. Appeasement didn’t work with Crimea, it won’t work with Donbas

True. And moreover, the Ukrainian people will not allow it.           

>Civilians- Ukraine has been trying to minimise civilian casualties. The territory they will be looking to take back are dead cities. They won’t be restrained by worrying about hitting civilians as they are mostly gone and the remaining are mostly sympathisers.          

What’s more certain is that Ukrainian army will most likely go around and cut off cities rather than storming them head on. But what I suspect will happen is that once Russian forces are significantly depleted and forced into a defensive posture any major breakthrough the Russians front lines will cause a route like Russian retreat from Kyiv. Practically all of the Russian troops are on the front with very little rear defense. The front is about 5-10 miles deep. If you break through that and establish a secure spearhead, there’s nothing stoping you from heading all the way to the Russian border. If there is a breakthrough, the remaining Russian troops will be at a risk of being cut off, so they will retreat RAPIDLY, and the morale is so low that no commander will be able to stop that retreat.",False,1657393210.0,t3_vut2tf,t1_ifhy04f,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

But getting the stamps was a whole thing.

Then, I recieved an email with a code and an hour window to buy 1 (one) sheet (that's when I saw my mistake)...well, we all got the same hour to buy them, so the site got ddos'ed, or the reddit hug, and my hour window lapsed watching the spinning circle of ""thinking""...was sad...then I got another email a week-ish later to try again (yay!)...worked so totally smoothly that I have to commend all the hard work behind the scenes on that one!!


Anyways, as the weeks went by there wasn't a day that I didn't excitedly check the mail hoping that the stamps had come today!! Seriously, I started to think I might have been catfished by a Russian faux site or something...then, the day came...I finally got a yellow envelope with Ukrainian script all over it and, seriously, I was so excited!! 


I don't know is anyone here knows what I'm talking about or went thought something similar and talking about it fells like a ""1st world problem"" compared to the really serious nature of this war of aggression that every Ukrainian has to deal with every day...it feels trite even mentioning such a thing but I also just want to share my feeling that no matter how small of a thing this may seem, it is so important to me, and that 10 years from now, when everyone barely remembers how bad the Russians got their ass kicked there will be one guy in California who walks into his house every day, looks at those stamps and thinks to himself, ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself!

>True, but only if NATO loses due to political reasons. If NATO countries cannot agree on a strategy and remain cohesive during this war, then NATO might as well disband because the alliance is useless. You can’t have a military alliances where some members want to fight(or support the fight) and some want to make peace and offer concessions. 

This is a much bigger issue for the EU, and not really a NATO problem. NATO revolves entirely around Article 5, it will be around right up until it's tested, and its response then will determine its worth as an alliance. The EU, on the other hand, has enough friction between ideas (eg oil sanctions) that it runs the risk of countries breaking away and acting unilaterally. For example, every time Hungary holds up the rest of the EU, there's a chance that an alternative alliance will reform without Hungary (informally, like the rest of the EU countries unite to press ahead with sanctions). The EU has been surprisingly strong in its response, and equally disappointing with its bottlenecks. It's up to the EU now whether they want to be a Geopolitical power (economically), or if they want to be a half-assed UN that can't achieve anything with constant vetoes.

>True. And moreover, the Ukrainian people will not allow it. 

100%. Ukraine is a long way off being desperate enough to try for peace, which has already failed once (Minsk). On top of this, each side is only really interested in discussing peace when seriously losing, which means the other side is clearly winning, which means they're (the winning side) not interested in peace at that time. Even in a stalemate, Ukraine has the incentive to keep fighting rather than cede territory, so don't expect them to try for peace unless Russia breaks their lines in a big way. And if Russia breaks first, Ukraine isn't going to be interested in peace talks other than ""Russian military, go fuck yourself"" and ""get out of our country"".

>What’s more certain is that Ukrainian army will most likely go around and cut off cities rather than storming them head on. But what I suspect will happen is that once Russian forces are significantly depleted and forced into a defensive posture any major breakthrough the Russians front lines will cause a route like Russian retreat from Kyiv.

I agree. We're not really going to see ""Ukraine advances into cities"" so much as Ukraine positioning itself well enough to take a city, followed by a big retreat Kyiv-style. Ukraine may take some cities like Kherson and Izium conventionally, potentially even Melitopol, but as soon as the current frontline becomes indefensible expect Russia to fall back to an even tighter group of key strategic objectives (most likely the land bridge to Crimea, among others they think they can hold). From there I'm sure we'll see more focus on attacks from inside Russia's border (as in, Russia launching attacks from inside their border) to repel further Ukrainian gains.

I'm not sure how Ukraine will go if Russia falls back to the land bridge (with support from across the borders), but I don't think the current frontline is particularly defensible for Russia. Taking out ammo and disrupting logistics is exactly the counter Ukraine needs to respond to artillery crawling, which appears to be the one significant advantage Russia still holds. Once Ukraine has a clear artillery advantage (which will be via range and logistics), we'll start to see Ukraine advancing like Russia has been. Maybe even quicker and more successfully depending on equipment supplies (eg armoured vehicles, more heavy weapons etc).

>To add to that Russia apparently pissed off China significantly

Russia has pissed off a lot of countries, Kazakhstan is just one country publicly acting out. There's also unrest in a number of countries that Russia has propped up dictators in, plus the frozen conflicts in the invaded countries. Once Russia really shows weakness, I expect countries to start reclaiming their territories, and populations to start rebelling against their despots. I also expect CSTO to fracture long before NATO does. And I expect more aggression in Syria. There's a lot more that's been going on geopolitically than most people are aware of, and a lot of it is propped up by Russia's military. A lot of it will crumble once Russia's military is clearly pushed back (I mean actually pushed, not just the Kyiv-retreat and shifting invasion goals and strategy).

Expect something akin to chaos in a number of countries (eastern Europe) once Ukraine pushes back Russia's frontline through sheer strength. Even now the rumblings are there. I've had to change multiple plans to travel to eastern countries because of all the disruptions/rumblings kicking off already.

And as to whether Zelensky knows, I tried to include that—that’s one of western intelligence’s issue—they say that he isolates zelensky so others can’t access him to inform him. 

Multiple allegations of hers do have merit, just from open sources.  But several seem to be out of left field.  Like the delaying of purchase of weapons, and the allegations of Kherson and Azovstal. 

Ukrainian media has been alarmed by Yermak for years—initially because thought he was incompetent; later thought he was meddling in foreign affairs where had no business; then multiple allegations (with evidence) of corruption exploded, but the prosecutors were fired and no one replaced (this has incidentally been one of nato’s issues); then deluge of criticism for his handling of Russia (he’s also the envoy meant to establish peace) and he’s openly said he believed from this no invasion and advised as such.  Well Intelligence finds it alarming that Zelensky weighed so heavily on him, bc he was obviously wrong.  She thinks that there is a nefarious element to him having the military ill-prepared.  

I do not think her basis is simply “Yermak is half Russian, he’s therefore pro-Russia.”  I think she’s been briefed for a long time (some of these are several years ago) and there’s a reason she’s saying this.  There’s something up with Kherson—I’m not saying she’s correct.  But Kherson has been discussed relentlessly in Ukrainian press—no one knows why southern bridges were not blown up.  He’s just fired Laguta and the mayor is next when released—but they both also asked this, too.

Americans asked Poland to transfer their planes to Ukraine. Poland refused, but said that they'd be happy to give the planes to Americans, which will then be transferred to Ukraine from an American base. Americans refused. That's really not going all in.

I'm not even going to talk about Germany and how much of a fuck up they made when this war broke out. 

Are NATO countries doing a lot? Sure. Could they do a lot more? Of course they could. Fact is that America couldn't ask for a better opportunity to kick Russian ass, which they've wanted to do for so long. Defence and weapons companies couldn't ask for a better opportunity to prove their weapons work, and get some good stats, research and experience. Are the Russians likely to lose this war? I think they are - but at a cost of Ukrainian lives. The whole thing could be ended far faster, but there are a few things that prevent it:

* In Russia, this needs to be seen as a Ukrainian victory. They are already pushing a narrative that they are fighting against the whole of the West there (some, like Chechens, actually say they are fighting American troops on tv!)
* The longer this goes on, the more Russia is strangled economically, which is veeeeeeeeerrryyyy beneficial for the United States.

This is more like a secondary benefit. The real reasons things are being slow-walked are:

1. Prevent Russia getting its hands on NATO weaponry because Ukraine overextended itself with unfamiliar weapons (hypothetically). This happened in Syria (weapons to the enemies)

2. Prevent big escalations that create a wider conflict (incremental upgrades and shipments to discourage a severe Russian response and escalation. Boiling the frog, per se)

3. There are no defensive pacts with Ukraine, so it's not smart for us to take over their war for them. That's how this becomes Russia vs the West, with China as a wildcard, and becomes super messy like Syria

4. Creating another aggressive enemy that we have to deal with later. If we turn Ukraine into a military superpower, what's to stop them marching on Moscow and triggering nukes? Invading Belarus? Becoming a dominant power in Europe? They're allies now, but so was Russia once upon a time (albeit, begrudgingly). Remember, before the Euromaidan revolution Ukraine was a Russian puppet, and this is a very young independent democratic country forming (despite being officially independent for decades). It still has a lot of corruption and there are still pro-Russian citizens (a lot less now I bet)

The US isn't performing a live dissection of Russia to slowly analyse them at the cost of Ukrainian lives. The increase in intelligence, testing and weapons performances are additional benefits that come from taking a strategic and measured approach, that has more to do with Geopolitics than deliberately drawing out the conflict. The West would benefit far more (militarily) by knocking Russia back to the stone age in a month, which would make even China tremble, and capturing all their gear for further analysis.

False again. The fastest growing economies are in Asia. LNG was in a supply-demand gap because of those new markets even before February.

A small general purpose cargo ship can carry 20-40,000 tons, assuming volume isn't an issue. There have only been \~50,000 GMLRS missiles produced in history, at six missiles per pod, and a pod weighs roughly 1.5 tons, so a total of 50,000 / 6 \* 1.5 = 12,500 tons of weight for all of the GMLRS missiles in the world. So a single small general purpose cargo ship can carry the entire worlds supply of GMLRS in a single trip (assuming weight is the limiting factor and not volume or stowage requirements, which likely are the primary limiting factor, but, we could use a couple of ships, or a bigger ship)

Getting the missiles across Poland and Ukraine are the difficult parts, but..

A single person eats very roughly 1.8 kg of food a day. Ukraine has 44 million people. So Ukraine is moving 44,000,000 \* 1.8 / 1000 = 79,200 tons of food every day in order to feed its population. Ukraine produces \~45 million tons of wheat a year which it has to move over land to port facilities, sure moving grain is not the same as moving steel framed missile pods, but this is just an example of the sheer scale that we are looking at when we talk freight and bulk transport.

I think the biggest issue as far as logistics is concerned is in the final 50km or so to the front line, everywhere else is likely connected to well maintained roads and intact bridges and rail heads. I'm no logistics person, but I think having 10-20 pairs of launchers that have dedicated supply trucks that draw directly from lets say 5-10 distribution points which are 50 km behind the front lines may end up being easier to organize than say, delivering 82mm mortar rounds to every company mortar team 1000m from the front line along a 600km long front.

Though to be honest I'm just using numbers found from wiki, I'm can't claim to know what is easy or hard, but, I find it hard to believe that the US would build 1000 M270s with two pods and build 500 M142 HiMARS with one pod if it didn't think these numbers made sense.

Germany has \~100 M270s in storage, Romania has 54 M142s, Poland wants 160 of a HiMARS variant. The US believes that in order to project strength globally it operates many more of both systems.

I just don't understand that we can both claim that 10-20 pods worth of launchers is more than enough for a war in Ukraine, when every country that operates them generally wants 50-100 missile pods worth of launchers for their own needs.

The Marines are a light army, but they think they need and can operate 50 HiMARS.

So my argument is basically this: an electric radiator cant really be ""bad"" at its job since its so simple. Electricity goes in and heat comes out. If it consumes 500 Watts of power it will produce 500 watts of heat. All that power will heat the room. (Disregarding the losses in the wiring of the house, which will probably heat up the insulation in the walls ever so slightly) The trick is to have enough power to run the radiators and to make sure the heat is created in the best spot and/or spread out in a good way. The heat from a radiator rises to the ceiling quickly for example so a ceiling fan is an excellent complement. If either of those factors are missing you will have poor heating performance. But then it isn't exactly fair to blame the radiator. A 500 Watt industrial  grade heater creates the same heat as a cheap 500 Watt consumer grade heater.
