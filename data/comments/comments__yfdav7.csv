Day 247 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was very quiet here yet again, no missile strikes and no drones. We did have a couple of air raid alerts, but at this point it’s nothing out of ordinary. Compared to the first couple of months of this war, when we were getting shelled 50-100 times *per day,* a couple of air raid alerts is something you don’t even notice most of the time. 

We also now have the schedule for the rolling blackouts that will start next week. There will be 12 time slots, from 8am to 9pm, in which a part of the city will have its electricity turned off for 3 hours at a time. Where I live we won’t have electricity from 8am to 11am, which is not too bad, for comparison in Kyiv they get blackouts that last over 6 hours.

Russians are also openly saying that we will continue to have problems with electricity unless we surrender. They think that they can force us to negotiate by making civilians suffer, which means that they still don’t understand who they are fighting against. We don’t care about not having electricity as long as Russia is defeated and thrown out of our country, but Russians think that only our government wants to continue this war, which is completely false. Over 90% of regular civilians support continuing the war until victory and with every missile that hits our cities that support only grows stronger, not weaker.

Seems to be a whole lot of disseminating over whether or not these companies consider chocolate bars ""essential food"", worth noting is that none of these companies seem to have even updated their PR statements since March with regards to suspending ""non-essential operations"", ""new investments"", marketing, etc. In the case of Nestle it does seem that they've suspended the sale of KitKat bars (in particular), but bottom line is that they're still operating plants and payrolls there. I'm sure more research is warranted as to how much of this is just brand washing while minimizing the financial hit they take. You see a lot of statements like this one from Ferrero:

The mobilization started on 21 september. That's about 37 days from now.

82,000 people got mobilized in 37 days. That's roughly 2000 people per day.

Ukraine kills about 300-500 soldiers per day. So let say 400. So in that 37 days, 14800 people got sent back in coffin and 44400 people got wounded

So around 59k people are simply not able to fight in those 37 days. In other words, a number close to 72% of the number of people deployed aren't going to fight anymore. So Russia's army is only increasing by 28% of what they're deploying. In other words, they're almost just replacing people by other people and the army numbers are barely increasing. 

So by deploying 300k the Russian army at the front is going to increase by around 84k people only. And that's if things don't get worse.. Which they will.",False,1666998714.0,t3_yfdav7,t3_yfdav7,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

https://www.pircenter.org/media/content/files/12/13943175580.pdf

Point is this: the parties all agreed to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine. The only party in breach of this is Russia … but the memorandum doesn’t contain any enforcement mechanism, and doesn’t require the *other* parties to do anything whatsoever if (say) Russia breaches these obligations. 

The only requirement for the parties is where a nation nukes Ukraine. And in that case, all the parties are required to do is seek UNSC action - which is all very well, but of course Russia holds a veto! 

In short, the Budapest Memorandum is not good security for giving up nukes, not even on its face. The other signatories can argue that they have met the letter of the Memo even if they never lift a finger to help Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.

Hardly just the US and UK, but the basic answer is that our security is clearly at stake in the Ukraine conflict.

Despite the preposterous comments below, the Budapest Memorandum guaranteed Ukraine security in exchange for de-nuclearization. All signing countries are in violation of that agreement until Ukraine's security is re-established. 

It has been a mistake on many levels to pretend that memorandum has not bearing in this conflict. Those countries that border this conflict are clearly worried that other agreements, such as membership in NATO, would similarly be downplayed if Russia turns on them in the future.

As for other fronts, Ukraine would probably look to trying to get an offensive going in the Zaporozhye oblast towards Melitopol and the coast. That way cutting the Russian forces in half in the South. Which would be an especially big issue for the forces in Crimea and Kherson area, due to the damage the bridge took.

Together with the idea that if you try and corner a wild dog it'll make weird moves and probably attack you, but even a wild dog can be slowly calmed and tamed with food and love.

Both of these things are usually true, so it's not a bad worldview to have, and leads to good things like worker rights, prisons that aim for rehabilitation rather than punishment, etc.

However, it also helps feed the narrative (which, lets be fair, Russia is helping to spread) that putin is a cornered dog, that NATO/EU is slowly approaching russian land, and that the way to solve this situation is to find a solution that is mutually beneficial for everyone, that comes to a compromise that each of Ukraine, Russia, the West, and the people in the Donbas and Crimea can live with. It's tempting to hope that even in this situation, compromising with Putin and figuring out a way to work together could lead to a lasting peace, saving thousands of ukrainian and russian lives, and for Russia to recognize it's mistakes. 

Of course, we've clearly seen by now that this is just a pipe dream, and that Russia is an abuser that's genociding ukraine, and they  will keep going until they are stopped. I'm therefore also happy to see that *most* of these calls for naive compromises have been stopped. 

However, i will never fault people personally for having the hope that a peaceful solution is possible, or for looking for a way out of this terrible mess. It's just such a terrible shame that we've gone far and far beyond that being a viable or reasonable solution. 

Even so, part of me can't help but feel like if we had just acted better during the '90s, had done some marshall-plan like stuff while pushing strongly and supporting fair elections and democracy and rule of law, we wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

The Rhino looks a bit more refined and doesn't it make more sense to have it in the front for IED's. Does it really work for IR ATGM's?

But as for Oryx, they joined in on the cope cage fun even though the very basis of the cope cages makes sense against smaller drone dropped munitions or older RPG's. People just framed it like Russia was trying to desperately counter the NLAW's / Javelins top-down blasts with them which obviously didn't work. But who knows, maybe they actually did do them for that purpose. It's hard to know but the idea isn't as alien as people make it out to be. I think it's just more fun to think that way.

There's more issues with the cope cages such as them messing with the tank radios or making it hard to evacuate the tanks quickly but that's a different story.

Like if you wanna find funny cages it's also something USA's been the [front runner with and that](https://www.armyrecognition.com/images/stories/north_america/united_states/wheeled_armoured/rg33_category_II_wire_cage/RG33_MRAP_category_II_wire_cage_armour_mine_protected_armoured_vehicle_United_States_US_army_640.jpg) to my knowledge has proven itself to work.",False,1666954906.0,t3_yfdav7,t1_iu3rav2,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Source of the first sentence is from April 6, source of the second sentence is from April 11. Also misleading considering the government announced this in March. [[Source](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/weltwirtschaft/habeck-energie-russland-ukraine-krieg-103.html)]

> In April, despite the agreement between Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Scholz was yet to take the decision on sending tanks to Ukraine.[157]

Source is a Daily Express article. The alleged ""agreement"" is only mentioned in passing once, then the article just quotes Twitter users, which says a lot about its quality. I don't remember this being news in Germany at the time and Google also brings up nothing. The only thing I could find was Habeck openly rejecting tank deliveries.

Actually those numbers are much closer to the reality than Shoigu's (8k mobilized sent to the right bank in Kherson, another 8k to the left one, full AC moved to Svatove region - those 80k would have to multiply to be in all those spots at the same time). Also the response from Ukraine (another mobilization wave) would suggest the same. They wouldn't call for mobilization just to counter some reinforcements that wouldn't even match the opening numbers.

Also there is an interesting article that talks about logistics:
> The defense minister reported to Putin that the task set by the president to draft 300,000 people into the army had been completed. Eighty-two thousand of the mobilized men were sent to the combat zone, 218,000 of them were sent to training ranges.

> According to our sources from the Defense Ministry, as of October 28th 692,843 people have been mobilized in all regions of Russia. Of these 340,000 have been sent to the zone of military actions or to the border territories.


> The rest mobilized people are waiting to be sent because the Defense Ministry has encountered an unsolvable so far problem with the lack of transport capacities. There is a shortage of airplanes, trains, buses and trucks designed to transport people. This has already led to the fact that the mobilized from Siberia, the Urals, and the Urals are stuck at intermediate collection points and live for weeks in field or near-field conditions or sit behind the fences of military units.

> Mobilization has been temporarily halted, but not because of Shoigu's reports or Putin's public statements, but because the Defense Ministry has switched to sorting out the cork from the mobilized and to working with the demobilized conscripts and with the fall conscripts.

>""Those conscripts who are finishing their service now in the units are being transferred to contract service. Not all of them, of course, but the most violent ones who categorically refuse and are not afraid of threats of criminal cases or a free ticket, it is easier to let them go. But such people are few, no more than 20-25%. The rest sign contracts quietly. There are those, who appeal to the military prosecutor's office and courts and while they are waiting for decisions - sit in their units. More than a half of them will be forced to sign contracts by their commanders and comrades-in-arms. The rest will go home. Plus, preparations for the draft are underway. They must draft 120,000 people. There are instructions to limit the draft to a month from November 1 to December 1, and not to delay it until the New Year,"" says a source at the Main Mobilization and Organization Administration of the Main Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.

>According to other sources from the General Staff and the Defense Ministry, the commanders of the units where conscripts serve are instructed to send as many soldiers as possible to contract service.

>""A social competition has begun, as is our custom. Whoever provides the biggest number of contract servicemen, gets a nickel from the authorities. The methods are standard: gather the personnel, press on ""are you men here or where"", then tell them about the money and prospects and about their absence in case of refusal. If you do not agree or have doubts, you can scare them with criminal charges, desertion and public disgrace. It worked back in the Afghan war, it works today,"" says the officer of the Defense Ministry.

>By November 10-15 the Defense Ministry expects to send the mobilized military men, who are stuck in their units, to the combat zone. By November 20, they expect to send to the war the conscripts who signed contracts and were drafted in 2021. On November 25, the ""completed"" partial mobilization will be continued.

>""We need to recruit as many more as have already been recruited by the end of January. Catch up with the figure to 1.3 million. Shoigu wants to over-fulfill and give 1.4 million soldiers. This time we will recruit in batches, so that there would not be a logistical jam again. In winter, the mobilized would freeze to death in such conditions, as it was now. Half of them already have sniffles, coughs, pneumonia, and prostatitis,"" says a GOMU officer.

>There is no decree on the end of partial mobilization and in the near future, according to our information, it is not planned. That is why all the words of regional and federal officials about the end of mobilization are mere words.

Stopping them is a lot easier than organizing and sending them. The average person can walk, what, 20 miles a day non-stop on a paved path? Less through grass or mud and trees. So you already have to drop off 100,000 people to within, say 15 miles of where you want them to be. That means trucks and gathering points and refueling and food and water and shelter. All of which need roads to support. That kind of concentration at just about the range of howitzers means tens of thousands dead before they even start heading your way.

Though if we're taking a manpower rush seriously - the issue isn't can you stop 100,000 people. It's can you stop 5,000 personnel carriers. And not just can you stop 5,000 armored personnel carriers, but how many vehicles per hour can the roads or other paths leading to you throughput, and can you stop *that* number per hour?",1666972402.0,1666971324.0,t3_yfdav7,t1_iu4rebx,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

b7e7f05dadc6e5b4034e45cc72754535,yfdav7,iu5xskv,"Friedman's predictions on China are as follows;

China has historically not had great internal political stability. This goes all the way back to the Warring States period. There's lots of reasons for this, but generally speaking the main reason (as with all of Friedman's analysis) is geography. Most of the population is concentrated in the eastern third of the country where the rain falls, the rice grows, and navigable rivers flow. Also split along a north-south cultural and linguistic divide based on the flows the Yellow and Yanghtzee rivers, which created many distinct pockets of peoples. Around this core region are further-flung sparser areas in their borderlands - i.e. the southern jungles (Vietnam), southwestern Himalayan Plateau (Tibet), northwestern deserts (Xinjiang), northern steppes (Inner Mongolia), and northeastern ranges (Manchuria).

Those are the areas from which invasions have come, so when the Han China core has strong internal unity, they tend to expand outwards to control them for defensive purposes. When they have weak internal unity, they tend to lose control over them. 

And then, there is the long eastern coastline, which in more modern times has brought other threats like European and Japanese imperial powers (see the Opium Wars).

So China has three key imperatives;

* Maintain internal unity
* Control the border regions
* Protect the coast from foreign influence

&#x200B;

How do they enact them? Usually, by insularity, and disengagement. When you have secure borders and are far away from other powers, you can pay external concerns little mind. But the tradeoff is poverty. While they have an abundance of interesting resources, China has 1/3rd of the arable land per capita compared to other countries. It's a structural weakness that has meant prosperity can only come with external trade. First via the Silk Road, and later by sea with the West. 

But when this happens, China becomes more fragmented. The more intense the trade, the greater the political power and wealth of the merchant coastal city class grows, while the poorer central and peripheral provinces stagnate. Whole cities fall under the control of foreign commercial, and then political influence as Beijing loses control. The rich/poor divide causes social strife that threatens unity.

This was the situation at the turn of the 20th century. In 1927 Mao tried to instigate a communist uprising in the wealthy cities, but *failed* due to the strength of the foreign commercial interests and their Chinese partners. He took his supporters on the Long March to the interior, and found more fertile ground among the peasants disaffected by the massive class and wealth inequality, leading to civil war.

Having prevailed, Mao expelled foreign commercial interests, and initiated widespread reprisals against the wealthy and westernized. He liquidated the whole socioeconomic class. He succeeded in recentralizing power in Beijing, reasserting Chinese internal unity, and went on successful expeditions to control the border regions (e.g. Tibet). But again - the tradeoff was decades of poverty and failed attempts to jumpstart the economy. But he preferred unity and poverty to political chaos and prosperity.

But once Mao was gone, Deng Xiaoping and the Chinese Communist Party found ways to jump through intellectual hoops to reverse course. Maybe it was okay to become a wealthy merchant, or get a western-style education in medicine or engineering after all. Deng took a big gamble - that they could open up for business as an export economy again, and use imported technology and a newly-trained workforce to permanently transition from agriculture to industry with ample internal demand.  To do that, they'd have to spread around the resultant prosperity enough to prevent class resentment, disunity, and uprising. Or, failing that, use the state security apparatus to enforce unity at gunpoint. That would allow them to improve living standards without succumbing to foreign influence or disunity.

This worked for many years, but only as long as the international economy remained strong, increasing demand for cheap Chinese exports. A new class of noveau riche exploded in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzen, and other cities, while the wealth of the interior middle class grew enough to have happy lives so long as they caused no trouble and stayed out of politics. That's the social contract for the vast majority of their people. It's easy to ignore political corruption, mismanagement, and massive wealth inequality both locally and nationally when times are good. But starting in 2008 that began to change.

Deng's gamble left China vulnerable to economic forces beyond its control. Xi's China is increasingly forced to rely on the stick (repression, militarism), rather than the carrot (social programs, jobs, infrastructure, subsidization). The hits keep coming - global recession, lockdowns, real estate crises, supply chain realignments, economic conflict with the US (whose navy has the ability to cut off all of China's seaborne trade, should it ever come to blows). The population gets restive. Small scale riots on local issues (party corruption, economic mismanagement, consumer protections, etc) are a lot more common than outside observers might otherwise believe of a police state. In this context China's aggressive moves towards Xinjiang and Hong Kong are signs of weakness and unease among the CCP, not ascendancy. You don't violently assert your control and oust your potential rivals when everyone thinks things are going great.

They have been running a high-wire balancing act for a while. They may yet keep it going. But growth has slowed considerably. Their most recent GDP growth forecast has them at 3.2% per year. That's not that far off from the typical US or European rates. Their real income capita is still 1/4th that of the US. The majority of the provinces have average disposable incomes less than the equivalent of $250/month. At that rate, leaders will not be able to continue to deliver increasingly living standards to the 900m people who live in the interior and rural provinces.

Under this analysis, and a separate analysis of their military posture in the South and East China Seas, Friedman concludes that China won't win the pacing challenge over the next century.",1666992588.0,1666987697.0,t3_yfdav7,t1_iu5kpl4,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

>Dear Twitter Advertisers

>I wanted to reach out personally to share my motivation in acquiring Twitter. There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising. Most of it has been wrong.

>The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence. There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.

>In the relentless pursuit of clicks, much of traditional media has fueled and catered to those polarized extremes, as they believe that is what brings in the money, but, in doing so, the opportunity for dialogue is lost.

>That is why I bought Twitter. I didn't do it because it would be easy. I didn't do it to make more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love. And I do so with humility, recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal, despite our best efforts, is a very real possibility.


>That said, Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.

>I also very much believe that advertising, when done right, can delight, entertain and inform you; it can show you a service or product or medical treatment that you never knew existed, but is right for you. For this to be true, it is essential to show Twitter users advertising that is as relevant as possible to their needs. Low relevancy ads are spam, but highly relevant ads are actually content!

>Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise. To everyone who has partnered with us, I thank you. Let us build something extraordinary together.

Just to emphasize, for those who don't want to read the whole thing:

In our anarchic world, which lacks anything like a world sovereign power (and no, the UNSC clearly does not count as one), security guarantees from countries that (1) have military power, and (2) are known for actually upholding their guarantees, are the best you can reasonably do. 

NATO article 5, for example, basically states that an attack on any NATO member is to be considered as an attack on all of them, after which they each individually and collectively can take measures including the use of armed force. 

That these types of guarantees can work is demonstrated by the fact Russia has, at least so far, avoided attacking NATO members. 

In short, in return for handing over nukes, Ukraine ought to have gotten such a guarantee - if not Nato membership, then guarantees from the actual signatories along the lines of articles 5 and 6 of the NATO treaty.

To step back a bit, that's precisely the point. Unacceptable disaster scenarios are put into security guarantees in order to deter countries from deliberately stepping on said land mine.

Lol no no no, I'd argue it's a lack of foresight on your end. I've explained one of my reasons, being that outlining our response would make them prepared and us complacent. But also why would western countries commit to protect Ukraine in perpetuity like this? We don't even have that sort of commitment to NATO countries, their protection only lasts as long as they stay in NATO.

You're basically saying we should put ourselves in a position where decades in the future we risk our credibility by not standing up for this agreement. Nobody knows what the future holds, who knows if we even have any interest in protecting Ukraine 3 decades from the time this is signed? It could make absolutely no sense to risk nuclear war on their behalf and then all of a sudden we are people that can't be trusted. Plus if Russia invades we always have the option to do exactly as we're doing right now and supporting Ukraine. It makes no sense to handcuff yourself like this for nothing.

> To step back a bit, that's precisely the point. Unacceptable disaster scenarios are put into security guarantees in order to deter countries from deliberately stepping on said land mine.

That's the point for countries we stand with. We will risk nuclear war on your behalf... if you join us. We could offer better protection than anything in the agreement by letting them join NATO, but we weren't ready to take that risk on a country in their position.

I completely understand from Ukraine's POV why military intervention would be a good thing in this agreement... but from our POV in the west, we got everything we wanted out of that agreement, non-proliferation was supposed to be a good thing at the time and getting any agreement from Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty was a good thing. Especially when the USSR just collapsed and we're supposed to be working with this new Russian country to normalize relations. If we wanted to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty was protected militarily we could have made a defensive alliance outside of this agreement or pushed for their entry into NATO. Adding a binding agreement for military intervention likely leading to nuclear war into something that has no end date, for a country who's future is undetermined just seems foolish to me.",False,1667000830.0,t3_yfdav7,t1_iu6ivo9,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

f2692a45d5f64628bb00a965ddc10f72,yfdav7,iu56had,"Quite easily. Look at WWI. That's what happens when you try to attack fortified armies equipped with modern weapons without some form of mobile armor to spearhead your attack.

To spare you the effort: Modern weapons give an OVERWHELMING advantage to the defender. WWI was the first conflict to feature the widespread deployment of machine guns, and their use meant that massed infantry charges were pretty much useless. A handful of men with machine guns could hold off a force much larger. 

To use your hypothetical 100,000 strong force of naked men:

We'll need to make a few assumptions to model this. I am not an experienced machine gunner, so some of my assumptions will likely differ from the real world, but I believe they are close enough to demonstrate how pointless large numbers are in military conflicts.

We'll give the defenders M2 heavy machine guns and assume that all are stocked with enough ammo to never run out against your army. The M2 can fire 575 rounds per minute, though a more realistic rate that avoids damaging the gun is probably about 300 rounds per minute. Most of those shots will miss, so we'll assume a 10% accuracy rate. So one machine gun emplacement (probably 2-3 people for maximum efficiency) has an effective kill rate of 30 per minute. If your defenders are more accurate with their shots, that will obviously increase your kill rate.

At a good run, your naked men will take about 10 minutes to cross the effective range of your machine guns. So each emplacement you have can kill 300 men before the army reaches your machine guns. With under 400 machine guns, then, your defenders can kill every single person in the naked army before they can cross the kill space, no matter how wide the column of charging naked men is.

And that's ignoring all the other modern weapons, such as assault rifles, land mines, artillery, air strikes, sniper rifles, tanks, grenades, mortars, assault vehicles, HIMARS and the like.

Dealing with raw numbers is easy for modern militaries. Numbers only become a problem when the two sides are armed comparably.",False,1666976632.0,t3_yfdav7,t1_iu4sfbr,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

fba89124399b9d86380de9afe5c80fc9,yfdav7,iu7gzrd,"Russia (more Putin than the sate) still believes that they can win the war via conventional warfare. These are:

1. Demoralization campaign using continuous bombing (similar to Syria)
2. Fortification in strategic positions. Pulling back to positions that they can attempt to ""bleed"" Ukrainian forces over weeks or months 
3. While in the Fortification position shift supply lines to China, Iran and several African allies ( Directly stated yesterday)
4. Attack from the North while Ukraine is stretched in the East and South (New pact between Belarus and Russia)
5. Use risk of WWIII to deter NATO from acting directly ( E,g recent statements about Satellites  being targets)

Or in more simple terms Putin still has hope that he can win 

However I commented a while back why this isn't even remotely a possibility now . The longer he stays on this path the greater the risk of the destabilization of his government. At which point he will be put in a position where his only way out  (personally) is escalation. 

Maybe in 2 to 3 months we may be in this position as he may have exhausted what methods of attack they have left. 

As for the USSR and Russia there is a massive difference in their nuclear doctrine. The USSR's was based on MAD and that no one would win. While under Putin (the past 12 years to be exact) there has been a move towards the idea that you can actually win a nuclear war. This via 2 scenarios:

1. Massive 1st strike using hyper-sonic missiles
2. ""Mad-man"" theory your way to concessions. E.g Will NATO be willing MAD or just agree to terms if they know Putin is a madman 

On another note I feel that a huge problem on our side is the idea that "" We too would win a war with Russia"". Using conventional weapons its not even a question but in a nuclear war no one would win. I believe it is also this thinking that has pushed us past the Cuban Missile crisis (Biden, NATO heads and more all say so). We are possibly at the greatest risk of nuclear war in human history yet the public discourse seems to be "" we would win"" 

To an extent I feel this has also lead to Russia's new doctrine failing  ( Repeated warnings by Putin) which ironically pushes him more into Mad-Man theory and thus increase the risk of him using the nuke 

I can go on about how China would overwhelmingly benefit from a limited nuclear war between Russia and NATO or how Iran (reason for the drones) wants this to distract the US from the Middle East etc....

So in short Russia will use the nuke when they have no options left. Currently they still have several
