> 
> Putin's war threatens the recovery of the world economy, undermines the stability of global supply chains and will have a serious impact on the most fragile countries, G7 leaders acknowledge and promise to support the most vulnerable.
> 
> In particular, it concerns the prevention of the global food crisis, as President Putin's war increases pressure on global food security in the short term. The sanctions imposed on Russia, politicians say, take into account the need to avoid affecting world trade in agricultural products.
> 
> The G7 countries will consistently use all instruments and funding mechanisms to ensure food security and make the agricultural sector resilient to climate and environmental goals. They ""will strive to ensure a stable supply of food in Ukraine and support the ongoing efforts of Ukrainian production.""
> 
> G7 leaders will work with relevant international bodies, such as the World Food Program (WFP), and, in parallel with multilateral development banks and international financial institutions, increase their joint contribution to support countries facing acute food security challenges.
> 
> G7 leaders also promise to take further steps to reduce their dependence on Russian energy, ensure a secure alternative and a stable supply, and closely coordinate efforts in the event of possible supply disruptions. They will actively support countries that also want to gradually break free from dependence on Russian imports of gas, oil and coal.
> 
> ""We will work with them and all partners to ensure a stable and stable global energy supply,"" the G7 leaders said. They also emphasize that this crisis strengthens their determination to achieve climate goals by accelerating their dependence on fossil fuels and switching to clean energy.
> 
> The G7 summit took place on 24 March in Brussels at the initiative of Germany, which chairs the Group.

2/6 And she really did fight. She has worked for the ACF for many years, and later she was a volunteer in our every project. She helped me set up my first YouTube streams.   
3/6 I remember how we laughed with her when she bought me a pirate eyepatch in a theater props store so that I would go on air wearing it - the day before, I got splashed in my face with a toxic liquid, and the doctors said that the studio light would be harmful to my injured eye   
4/6 In the recent times, she worked in the remaining independent media in Russia. Oksana died after coming under shelling in Kyiv. The thieves and bandits from the Kremlin, who she fought against, killed her, just like they've killed many others in this criminal war.   
5/6 We - Russians, Ukrainians, the whole world - must do everything to defeat Putin - a monster that spreads death and chaos, killing tens of thousands and destroying cities in Europe for the sake of personal power and personal enrichment.   
6/6 My condolences to the family and friends of Oksana Baulina.

“We are going on the counterattack. We are moving forward,” Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, told Ukrainian television.

CNN reported earlier that Ukrainian forces appeared to have retaken territory around the small settlement of Lukianovka about 55 kilometers (about 34 miles) east of the capital. Social media geolocated by CNN depicted the aftermath of heavy battles there.

To the immediate northwest of Kyiv, the mayor of Irpin told CNN that 80% of the town was controlled by the Ukrainian army, but added it was still coming under sustained fire from Russian Grad rockets.

“Very serious battles took place near Baryshivka [to the east], Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin [all to the northwest]. We managed to recapture quite a lot,” Denysenko said.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60856533

“Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia, saying it would be ""against Hungary's interests"".

Orban rejected Zelensky's demands at the European Council ""because they are contrary to the interests of Hungary"", Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said in a statement.

""Hungary wants to stay out of this war, so it will not allow the transfer of arms and weapons to Ukraine,"" Kovacs said.

Orban says that the ethnic-Hungarian minority in the west of Ukraine would be threatened if Hungary sent weapons to Kyiv.

Hungary, an EU and Nato member, has refused to send military aid to Kyiv, or let it cross its territory. However, it has allowed more than half a million Ukrainian refugees to enter its territory.

Orban, a nationalist, has cultivated close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent years.

Zelensky used an address to EU leaders on Thursday to call on Orban to approve expanding sanctions, let weapons through to Ukraine, and cut off business ties with Russia.

> 
> KHARKIV, Ukraine — In the northern outskirts of Kharkiv, the sound of artillery shelling never stops. The city is just 25 miles from the Russian border, but Ukrainian forces have thus far been able to prevent the advance of Russian ground troops. In retaliation, the Russians have spent the past weeks using artillery to bombard the city’s defenders and civilians. The residents of the most-targeted areas remain either trapped in their apartments, many without electricity and hot water, or have been sheltering in the city’s subway stations for weeks. A tour of Kharkiv last week made clear the city could be next to suffer a mass humanitarian crisis in a war that has already cost thousands of lives and displaced millions.
> 
> “Why are you staying? Isn’t it dangerous?” I ask.
> 
> “I wish to leave,” he tells me. “I have been here for 18 days without electricity, the water in the pipes in my flat got frozen. I just do not know how to get out of here. I called some people. I wish to get to the train station.”
> 
> His name is Leonid Andriyovych, he is 72 and a grandfather. Even in these circumstances he is neatly dressed in suit trousers and clean shoes. He speaks in a soft voice. A journalist traveling with us suggests that we help the man right away. We tell him to get his documents. We need to get out of this dangerous area in a hurry, so he has to run upstairs to the ninth floor of the building he lives in to get his papers. The constant shelling continues.
> 
> The elderly of Kharkiv suffer the most. Many, like Andriyovych, are stuck in their flats under heavy bombardment, the electricity in the suburban areas of town mostly doesn’t work; they are the least mobile and often have neither a place to go, nor the ability to easily get around the country.
> 
> On our way to the train station, Andriyovych asks, “Is Kharkiv still standing?” He’s been stuck inside his apartment building cowering in terror and is surprised to see parts of the city still function as we drive from the outskirts through an industrial part of town filled with warehouses, factories, and supermarkets. From time to time we see lines of people — mainly to the post offices, ATMs, or pharmacies. “I thought the whole city was like my area — burned, empty,” he says with some hope, “but here there are lines to the shops, people walking …”
> 
> We ask the local volunteers to bring Andriyovych to the train station and to give him some hot food. The Ukrainian railroad has made all traveling free, and added trains to evacuate civilians. The station in Kharkiv — and every rail station all over the country — serves as a shelter offering warm food, relative safety, and a place to ​​charge your phone. Andriyovych says he’s going to stay with his sister in western Ukraine.
> 
> “We used to have a nice life here,” Andriyovych tells me as we say goodbye. “We didn’t have much trouble, things worked. I believe the war will be over soon. Don’t you think so too? It shouldn’t be like this, the world should find a solution. It can’t be otherwise.”
> 
> I nod. I didn’t want to disappoint him.

So no, having a Russian-speaking diaspora in your country is not going to make Russia attack you. Russia will attack you because it wants to and then will make up any excuse, no matter how dumb. So if you see a comment repeating the dumb idea that ""Russians should be kicked out and banned from other countries, because otherwise Russia will attack these countries"", just know that this comment is written by a Kremlin bot, working overtime to try and scare Russians from leaving and prevent brain drain. Report them.

EDIT: Right, completely forgot about Ukraine supposedly planning to use trained pigeons to spread a bioweapon, coded to affect only certain ethnicities. It was too stupid, so I forgot.",1648194775.0,1648194100.0,t3_tndjsu,t3_tndjsu,,0,80,0,80,0,0,

> 
> By Sabrina Escobar
> 
> Updated March 25, 2022 10:27 am ET / Original March 25, 2022 10:14 am ET
> 
> Tiffany & Co. will no longer purchase new Russian-mined diamonds, the company said, joining Signet Jewelers and Brilliant Earth in cutting ties with Russian-related businesses in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
> 
> “Tiffany has paused the sourcing of all rough diamonds from Russia, as well as serialized diamonds of Russian origin regardless of where they are cut and polished,” a Tiffany spokesperson said in a statement.
> 
> The company, owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (ticker: LVMHF), also has instructed suppliers to stop buying Russian rough stones on Tiffany’s behalf and to separate Russian and non-Russian melee, or small diamonds weighing less than one-fifth of a carat, the spokesperson added.
> 
> Tiffany’s ban applies to diamonds mined in Russia as of March 21. The company didn’t specify whether Russian diamonds would still be sold at stores, or whether the company could still purchase diamonds mined before the war that were in the process of being cut or polished.
> 
> The diamond industry has faced some criticism for its silence over whether major players would continue to do business with Russian companies. Indeed, it would appear as if the U.S. government took matters into its own hands, when the Biden administration said it was moving to ban Russian diamond imports a few weeks after announcing sanctions on Russian miner Alrosa, which accounts for 90% of Russian diamonds. Tiffany said its ban was compliant with President Joe Biden’s executive order.
> 
> The situation places the diamond industry in a particularly tricky situation. Alrosa accounts for 28% of global mined diamonds, and a complete boycott could hike already-rising prices further. Diamonds — especially small ones — are also notoriously difficult to trace, making it difficult for jewelers to fully ensure the origins of the diamonds they are purchasing.

Top Russian general claims military efforts now centered on eastern part of Ukraine
From CNN's Nathan Hodge in Lviv
A top Russian general gave some of the most detailed public remarks to date on Russia's military strategy in Ukraine, claiming on Friday that the ""first stage"" of Russia's military plan is now complete, with their primary focus now centered on eastern Ukraine.

""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,"" Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said in a Friday briefing. ""The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""
Rudskoy's remarks come as Russia's advances appear to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion.

""The public and individual experts are wondering what we are doing in the area of ​​the blockaded Ukrainian cities,"" Rudskoy said. ""These actions are carried out with the aim of causing such damage to military infrastructure, equipment, personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the results of which allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas, but also will not allow them to do this until the Russian army completely liberates the territories of the DPR and LNR.""

Rudskoy was referring to the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, separatist territories in eastern Ukraine that Russia recognized on the eve of its invasion.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the goal of what Russian officials refer to euphemistically as the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is the complete demilitarization of the country. Putin has said the war is going according to plan, but Russian forces have incurred serious losses: Rudskoy said in the same briefing that 1,351 military personnel had been killed in Ukraine and 3,825 had been wounded. US, NATO and Ukrainian officials estimate the Russian casualty count is much higher.

""Initially, we did not plan to storm them in order to prevent destruction and minimize losses among personnel and civilians,"" Rudskoy said. ""And although we do not exclude such a possibility, however, as individual groupings complete the tasks set, and they are successfully solved, our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas.""

It is unclear if Rudskoy's statement implies a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military, or just represents a change in public messaging.

The Russian military has claimed it is not targeting civilians or residential areas, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

The failures could be caused by anything, from inability to launch to failing to explode on impact.  
  
The reported rate, which has not been verified elsewhere, could explain Russia's struggle to maintain momentum in the month-long invasion.  
  
According to the US, Russia has launched at least 1,100 missiles since the war began. They have not said how many hit their targets and whether they successfully detonated.

Re: The new shift in goals from the Russian MoD

Given Russia's propensity to throw thousands of troops to their death, it may have actually intended its attacks from Belarus to take Kyiv and its attacks from Crimea (and the sea) to take odessa as a means to force the Ukrainian Army to deploy their troops across the theater in a way that made it easier to take Donbas and secure a land bridge to Crimea.

IMO this is a back-pedal - I actually believe they *really* intended to take Kyiv and Annex everything East of the Dnipre River, but can't because of the incompetence Russian military and they ended up showed thier ass and got stood-up on both the southern and Northern offensives.

> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday took aim at the sanctions the United States and other countries have imposed on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, saying he believes that the West has declared ""total war"" on Russia.

[…]

>Lavrov also said that he believes the West has a goal ""to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole,"" according to the AP. He then warned that Russia does have allies.

Notably, Lavrov seems to be wording what he says to set up an eventual pretext for Russia to accuse the West of escalating and declaring *actual* “total war”.

If so, Russia might then finally take partial or full responsibility on Russian state media for the extreme destruction seen in photos and videos, but by blaming NATO into pushing them to that point, perhaps by using the excuse that NATO’s collective power in Ukraine was “so great” that they managed to slaughter thousands of Russian soldiers and genocide ethnic Russians in just a matter of weeks, and that they were using entire cities in central and eastern Ukraine as de facto military bases and civilians as human shields.

Also, this is admittedly a massive reach but if the above theory is correct, depending on how premeditated this plan was, the Kremlin might’ve been deliberately misleading the West into believing their army really was a paper tiger after all, without caring that they were sending thousands of their own—who they also misled—through the meat grinder. 

Though, far more likely is that their own army is really just that shitty. In any case, they certainly made the enormous mistake in believing that UAF’s own army wasn’t that strong prior to invading Ukraine.",1648226959.0,1648225164.0,t3_tndjsu,t3_tndjsu,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

Thursday, March 24, 2022 07:47 PM 
By Peter Martin

(Bloomberg) --Biden administration officials are worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin may lash out dangerously as Russian troops find themselves bogged down in Ukraine and Western sanctions begin to bite.

The internal assessment of senior officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, is that Putin’s tendency when boxed in is to escalate rather than back down. Their view is that the Russian leader’s choices could include the blanket bombing of Ukrainian cities or the use of chemical weapons -- or even tactical nuclear weapons. 

One of the hardest challenges facing the U.S. and its European allies is trying to anticipate the next move of someone they see as behaving in an increasingly erratic manner and who they fear could become even more dangerous amid signs Russia’s military campaign has not gone according to plan. The failure to quickly overwhelm Ukraine’s military raises the risk of what Western intelligence agencies are calling “vertical escalation.”


WATCH: President Joe Biden says Russia should be removed from the G-20.
As President Joe Biden put it bluntly Monday: “His back is against the wall” and “the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.”

NATO leaders on Thursday pledged to step up their defenses against the threat of chemical and nuclear weapon attacks. In the lead-up to an emergency meeting in Brussels, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Biden issued increasingly urgent public warnings, citing Russian disinformation as an indicator of what Putin may be planning. 

At a news conference, the U.S. leader was pressed on what the evidence he had of a possible attack. “I’m not going to give you intelligence data, No. 1,” Biden said.“No. 2, we would respond, we would respond if he uses it. But the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.” 

Administration officials are analyzing how Putin got into the fix he’s in.

source: NYT

WASHINGTON — Russian forces no longer have full control of Kherson, the first major Ukrainian city that President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces managed to capture as part of his invasion, a senior Pentagon official said on Friday.

Ukrainian forces are now fighting fiercely in Kherson and pushing back Russian gains there, again making the strategically important port city “contested territory,” the official told reporters during a briefing.

That contradicts a statement released on Friday by Maj. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, the chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the Russian military’s General Staff, who claimed that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

**Ukrainians in Kherson and Ukrainian officials also questioned the Pentagon’s assessment, saying that the city appeared to remain firmly in Russian hands, though Ukrainian forces are fighting across the broader Kherson region.**

Any Ukrainian success in taking back Kherson would be a huge blow to Mr. Putin’s war effort, making it harder for Russia to follow through on any plans to seize control of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and the southern port of Odessa, defense officials said.

Tries to join the KGB (behind a desk?) and immediately starts working for corrupt interests in St Petersburg as a yes man and is that kid who no one liked before but hey he’s basically doing our taxes so we’ll let him stick around. Is propped up by the FSB and Yeltsin after they kill thousands of people for their new Putin puppet to get in power. He wins the presidency, completely out of place with no truly worthy credentials and tries to act tough on crime in the media but he’s really just an idiot fumbling around for acceptance. Then he starts loving the attention and becomes good at the propaganda. He gets so souped up on his own juice, that he expects it at the big boy table but world leaders don’t really consider him one of “them” he’s just someone they must deal with. So here’s grown up Putin with a nuclear arsenal, billions, and a tight control on state media and all for what? He’s a general thug, a thief who would’ve never been thought of without the initial help of the elites. Perhaps he realizes just out of place he is, and he adopts a cold exterior for cover or maybe he just grows cold-either way I see the teenager still who thought he was all that and is realizing his Catch If You Can scheme is crumbling (slowly). Someone who will hold tightly to power just to feel validated bc it gave his otherwise irrelevant life more meaning than it ever did. And instead of using it as a way to be truly great, he fumbles. The whole world watches on and his hidden embarrassment gets greater and his anger at himself (or maybe others he’s disillusioned himself to blame) grows. So what does he do next? He’s not so much the all powerful Thanos as he is the evil Peter Parker.

.
.
.
2/ Russia does not possess the military capability to take large Ukrainian cities, let alone occupy a substantive part of Ukraine   

.
.
.
2.2 Example: remember the 40 mile convoy north of Kyiv that freaked everyone out? Where is it now?   

.
.
.
2.3 A more recent example: Supply ships in occupied Berdyansk came under attack yesterday. One destroyed, others damaged.   

.
.
.
3/ Russia HAS the military capability to maintain continuous shelling and bombardment of civilians and military in Ukraine. It has the will to do it brutally, indiscriminately, murdering thousands and displacing millions   

.
.
.
4/ Ukraine can effectively resist Russian ground forces attacks, disrupt Russian supply chains, mount counter offensives, and operate in the rear of the enemy   

.
.
.
5/ Ukraine does not have military capability to effectively defend against bombardments. The West is unwilling to provide such capability.   

.
.
.
6/ Ukraine morale is high; the leadership is strong; people are united. Ukraine will continue to resist   

.
.
.
7/ In light of the Ukrainian determination to resist, and the international sanctions, Russia appears to double down   

.
.
.
8/ Thus, it now becomes a test of will, a war of attrition. Who has more endurance? Ukraine or Russia?   

.
.
.
9/ Putin has demonstrated his willingness to pay any price to challenge the West and to achieve his objectives.
 The West knows it and is cautious in dealing with him   

.
.
.
10/ Ukraine has also demonstrated its endurance time and again. This is less understood in the West and Russia. And this is why both Russia and the West are repeatedly surprised by the events in Ukraine   

.
.
.
10.2 Example: Orange Revolution in 2014. It went on for months until the Supreme Court was politically pressured to support the people.   

.
.
.
10.3. Example: the Revolution of Dignity in 2013-2014, when more than 100 protesters were shot by the government, the protesters stayed and fought in freezing temperatures an overwhelming state force, and eventually President Yanukovich, who had material support from RU, fled.   

.
.
.
10.4 Example: the Russian invasion in the East of Ukraine in 2014. Many military commanders and govt officials defected. Ukrainians formed volunteer battalions and engaged and stopped the RU military. The West was not united in its support and many bought RU civil war narrative   

.
.
.
11/ In RU Putin and his inner circle are truly committed to winning this war. The military, outside of top ranks, and the public are not.   

.
.
.
12/ The West takes the treat of Putin is now much more seriously than before. However, no one, except several strategic partners of Ukraine, are truly committed to winning this war in Ukraine and now. People will be willing to have Ukraine fall and continue to fight PU elsewhere   

.
.
.
13/ What does it mean for the war? The most efficient end game is for RU to implode because of internal conflicts between RU political elites (committed to war), military and public (who pay the cost). Unfortunately, this is not going to happen fast; months or years are needed   

.
.
.
14/ Another scenario is collapse of Ukraine. I personally do not believe it is feasible. Even if RU uses tactical nukes, Ukraine will continue to fight.   

.
.
.

15/ A scenario in between is some kind of peace agreement a la Minsk II. It did not work in the past. It won’t work now. An agreement like that would only give a pause of several years for everyone to regroup. After that, the new conflict will simply be even more brutal   

.
.
.
16/ It will take time for the world to accept reality : a protracted war in Ukraine that must be won. The world is likely to come through eventually, with more meaningful support. But many lives will be lost. This is the horrible price for UA for Western wishful thinking.

**Moscow Patriarch Kirill: War has a metaphysical significance against gay parade**

*His explanation, which is aligned with anti-West rethoric to justify war, goes like this:*

*“For eight years there have been attempts to destroy what exists in the Donbass. And in the Donbass there is rejection, a fundamental rejection of the so-called values ​​that are offered today by those who claim world power. Today there is such a test for the loyalty of this government, a kind of pass to that “happy” world, the world of excess consumption, the world of visible “freedom”.* 

*Do you know what this test is? The test is very simple and at the same time terrible – this is a gay parade. The demands on many to hold a gay parade are a test of loyalty to that very powerful world; and we know that if people or countries reject these demands, then they do not enter into that world, they become strangers to it.”*

Over the years since, NATO would come up with different reasons why those countries weren't ready. One stupid reason they settled on was that Ukraine especially wasn't up to NATO military standards.


Don't just take it from me, here's a very reputable journalist recounting his discussion with Stoltenberg:


> One thing that struck me reporting on Z over the last year was how galling this “argument” sounds to Ukrainian ears when one considers the mighty Montenegro army met NATO’s magical standard. When I put this to Stoltenberg a few months ago he could barely hold a straight face.

They're going to ship the Ukrainian population to Russia and ship Russians into Ukraine so they can lay claim to it.

2/ Russia does not possess the military capability to take large Ukrainian cities, let alone occupy a substantive part of Ukraine   
2.2 Example: remember the 40 mile convoy north of Kyiv that freaked everyone out? Where is it now?   
2.3 A more recent example: Supply ships in occupied Berdyansk came under attack yesterday. One destroyed, others damaged.   
3/ Russia HAS the military capability to maintain continuous shelling and bombardment of civilians and military in Ukraine. It has the will to do it brutally, indiscriminately, murdering thousands and displacing millions   
4/ Ukraine can effectively resist Russian ground forces attacks, disrupt Russian supply chains, mount counter offensives, and operate in the rear of the enemy   
5/ Ukraine does not have military capability to effectively defend against bombardments. The West is unwilling to provide such capability.   
6/ Ukraine morale is high; the leadership is strong; people are united. Ukraine will continue to resist   
7/ In light of the Ukrainian determination to resist, and the international sanctions, Russia appears to double down   
8/ Thus, it now becomes a test of will, a war of attrition. Who has more endurance? Ukraine or Russia?   
9/ Putin has demonstrated his willingness to pay any price to challenge the West and to achieve his objectives. The West knows it and is cautious in dealing with him   
10/ Ukraine has also demonstrated its endurance time and again. This is less understood in the West and Russia. And this is why both Russia and the West are repeatedly surprised by the events in Ukraine   
10.2 Example: Orange Revolution in 2014. It went on for months until the Supreme Court was politically pressured to support the people.   
10.3. Example: the Revolution of Dignity in 2013-2014, when more than 100 protesters were shot by the government, the protesters stayed and fought in freezing temperatures an overwhelming state force, and eventually President Yanukovich, who had material support from RU, fled.   
10.4 Example: the Russian invasion in the East of Ukraine in 2014. Many military commanders and govt officials defected. Ukrainians formed volunteer battalions and engaged and stopped the RU military. The West was not united in its support and many bought RU civil war narrative   
11/ In RU Putin and his inner circle are truly committed to winning this war. The military, outside of top ranks, and the public are not.   
12/ The West takes the treat of Putin is now much more seriously than before. However, no one, except several strategic partners of Ukraine, are truly committed to winning this war in Ukraine and now. People will be willing to have Ukraine fall and continue to fight PU elsewhere   
13/ What does it mean for the war? The most efficient end game is for RU to implode because of internal conflicts between RU political elites (committed to war), military and public (who pay the cost). Unfortunately, this is not going to happen fast; months or years are needed   
14/ Another scenario is collapse of Ukraine. I personally do not believe it is feasible. Even if RU uses tactical nukes, Ukraine will continue to fight.   
15/ A scenario in between is some kind of peace agreement a la Minsk II. It did not work in the past. It won’t work now. An agreement like that would only give a pause of several years for everyone to regroup. After that, the new conflict will simply be even more brutal   
16/ It will take time for the world to accept reality : a protracted war in Ukraine that must be won. The world is likely to come through eventually, with more meaningful support. But many lives will be lost. This is the horrible price for UA for Western wishful thinking.

We keep hearing about progress in pushing Russians away from Kyiv while simultaneously hearing about people starving in Mariupol. 

I know that Ukraine has limited forces at this time and only has so much that they can use in an offensive manner. It seems the city is far more need of relief than Kyiv. Do the Russians simply have too much firepower there? Too much open terrain that would make an attempt doomed to failure? Maybe one of those cold hard choices that have to be made in war where northern objectives just hold more value towards victory?

""Mr. Bush, entering his last NATO summit meeting as president, was described by the official as wanting to “lay down a marker” for his legacy and not wanting to “lose faith” with the Ukrainian and Georgian peoples and the other former Soviet republics.   
As Mr. Bush did more often early in his presidency, he expressed his views candidly despite warnings from allies that he was complicating efforts to find diplomatic solutions.  
Normally, summit meetings like this are prescripted, but Mr. Bush’s comments added some extra interest while annoying Germany and France, which had said they would block the invitation to Ukraine and Georgia.At the dinner on Wednesday, the German and French position was supported by Italy, Hungary and the Benelux countries, a senior German official said.   
Mr. Bush was said to have accepted that his position was not going to prevail, and officials were asked to find some construction overnight that would encourage Ukraine and Georgia without asking them to enter a membership plan now.""",1648217847.0,1648217779.0,t3_tndjsu,t3_tndjsu,,0,-14,0,-14,0,0,

Zelensky must know that he won't get enough NATO weaponry to dislodge entrenched positions; the current counter-offensives are working on unfortified positions (in a limited fashion).

Right now, both sides are playing hardball. Zelensky wants to keep all the territory. Russia wants Donbas and Crimea and neutrality. I think there's hope in the future that russia will withdraw from territory in exchange for sanctions going away but that's not going to happen while Putin is alive. If there is no movement in negotiations, the status quo will continue with a split Ukraine; Russia holding out outside of major cities while keeping Donbas and Crimea.

There's currently a window of time now before those positions are hardened that Zelensky should push for a deal, giving up crimea and perhaps donbas (negotiable, I think Putin only cares about Crimea), pledging neutrality in return for withdrawal. If not, Ukraine is de facto giving up currently lost territory in return for closer ties with the EU, and east ukraine will become a frozen conflict.",False,1648227800.0,t3_tndjsu,t3_tndjsu,,0,-13,0,-13,0,0,

Small unit tactics - no combined arms - Aircraft performing dumb bombing runs. 

Tanks utilised in small groups with no infantry support. 

Unsecured radio communications.

Pushing supplies forward rather than the more modern requesting resupply.

Infantry seemingly having *severe* weapon pull problems. (not firing and relying on their armour to do the work)

Untrained / undertrained soldiers who're poorly motivated.

Badly maintained equipment

No modern equipment

Non-existant NCO core meaning that the private soldier is relying on orders from an officer and will not take the initiative.

Focusing on taking population centres rather than destroying Ukrainian ability to fight.

A complete lack of modern command and control. Generals are basically *with* their troops which isn't how things are done today.

>> 
>> 25 March 2022 - 01:11
>> 
>> Free people of our free country!
>> 
>> It's already night, but we're working. The country must move towards peace, move forward.
>> 
>> With each day of our defense, we are bringing the peace we need so much closer. We are bringing victory closer. Because in this war it is simply impossible for us not to win. And it will be so. And we can't stop even for a minute. Because every minute is about our destiny, about our future. About whether we live or not.
>> 
>> The 30th day. It's been a month! If Russia had known it would face that, I’m sure they would have definitely been afraid to come here.
>> 
>> During this month, we’ve withstood all the main directions of Russian strikes. The world has applied destructive sanctions. And we are reaching an agreement on new ones.
>> 
>> Today I have delivered some important speeches. To the participants of the NATO summit, the G7 summit, to the summit of the leaders of the European Union. To the Swedish Parliament. All this is for the sake of support for our state. We need it for our protection.
>> 
>> I spoke with the President of Lithuania, Mr. Nausėda, Prime Minister of Israel Bennett and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. All this is for Russia to understand one thing: it is necessary to seek peace. Russia also needs to seek peace.
>> 
>> I informed the President of Egypt about the current situation.
>> 
>> And today I signed some very important decrees.
>> 
>> On awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to seven servicemen of the National Guard, to five of them, unfortunately, posthumously.
>> 
>> Also on state awards to 240 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 119 servicemen of the Armed Forces.
>> 
>> On state awards to 14 heads of local communities, local authorities.
>> 
>> On state awards to 31 medical workers.
>> 
>> And on awarding the honorary title ""The Hero City of Ukraine"" to four more cities: Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka, Mykolaiv.
>> 
>> You know, after signing these decrees, I felt that it would really be worthwhile to award and confer the title of hero to millions and millions of our people. To you, to all Ukrainians who are doing everything they can for the sake of victory. For peace. In a place where they are.
>> 
>> And I am grateful to each and every one of you. To each and everyone for this month of great struggle. And, of course, to our Armed Forces, of course, the National Guard, our border guards, doctors, rescuers, territorial defense, reconnaissance officers, special services and many, many people, representatives of other professions who save our lives. Who protects our free Ukraine.
>> 
>> **Glory to all our heroes!**
>> 
>> **Glory to all our people!**
>> 
>> **Glory to us all!**
>> 
>> **Glory to Ukraine!**

> Date 25.03.2022

> Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Friday that the country is planning to almost completely end Russian energy imports by the end of the year.
> 
> Habeck, a member of the Green Party, said the plan meant that a considerable amount of progress would be made in a short space of time, as the West is rushing to wean itself off Russian energy amidst the invasion of Ukraine. Before the war began and the subsequent heavy sanctions targeting Russia, Germany received 50% of its coal, 55% of its gas, and 35% of its oil from Moscow.
> 
> ""By the middle of the year, Russian oil imports to Germany are expected to be halved. By the end of the year, we aim to be almost independent,"" a document published by the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said. The plan also calls for coal deliveries from Russia to end by the autumn.
> 
> Habeck confirmed that current contracts with Russian companies to import energy will not be renewed. He also acknowledged that Germany would only be able to wean itself off Russian gas deliveries by mid-2024.

As a person who spends way too much time in here, that happens all day long. 

Things are going to get more sour in every way, especially as Ukraine is being drip-fed munitions but not exactly being given enough and the appropriate equipment to actually expel the invaders - merely to hold them off for now. There are already some signs here in some Ukranian-language interviews and some signs in public speeches. This is going to breed resentment. 

Ultimately, the foundation for a negotiated settlement is compromise. Unless you think the situation for Ukraine will be so advantageous that they don't need to compromise - which I'd love to see - then they will be required to give up some things at the negotiating table. To be honest, the sheer utter indignity of having to sit down with representatives from the facist Russian opponents is too much to stomach, but it may be required.

Now that Germany and the like have had time to source alternatives, and the pressure from Poland as well as others mounts, I wouldn't be surprised to see a much harder line from either NATO or the US in tandem with the Baltics.

As a result of this everybody in the Russian leadership has been stealing from the state, encouraged to do so from the example at the very top.

Leaders who have tried to expose or even end the corruption have been murdered, jailed, or just forced to shut up and retire.  

This has led to what we now see:

* Officers who bought their way into position instead of earning it.
* Insufficient training and gear for the soldiers
* Poorly maintained vehicles
* No centralized command and control to organize maneuvers
* Weapons that have a greater than a 50% failure rate

> 
> 
> Prokhorov's capital was largely formed from the sale of assets in recent years - in this way he was able to avoid the losses that Russia's largest businessmen suffer from the imposition of sanctions: $ 9 billion was brought to him by the Renaissance Capital bank, another $ 1.4 billion - the sale of a stake in the company "" RUSAL. Prokhorov began selling his assets in the Russian Federation in 2016. He also became famous for his alleged participation in organizing parties of the Russian elite in the resort of Courchevel in the French Alps, for which he was accused of pimping. The charges were later dropped.
> 
> It is not clear whether Prokhorov will remain in Israel or whether the purpose of his visit is different. The source of ""Details"" reports that at the airport the businessman expressed his intention to repatriate. Perhaps he will be able to prove for this that his maternal grandmother, Anna Isaakovna Belkina, was Jewish.

I'll probably end up repeating this previous comment again and again: 

Ukraine should not accept any territory loss, and Crimea and the rest of their occupied territories should, as it has from the very start of these negotiations, continue to be a demand for the negotiations.

If that doesn't happen China gets the impression from the annexation being allowed that ""well we can invade Taiwan, and as long as we win, we'll lose nothing even if the world is pissed for a while"".

Not a single sanction should be removed until all territory is returned to Ukraine.

Russians making claims about how much control they are in and how that's going to last forever is not a truth but an arrogant claim on the level of Putin saying he would take the country in two days.

Mariopol is in a place where Russians can continue to shell it from a distance, making it intensely difficult to survive there or defend or retake the territory. Russia has the power to destroy infrastructure and civilians but not hold or rebuild the city. 

Without offensive capacity and air superiority, Ukraine is watching its infrastructure and civilians get destroyed. This is why Zelenskyy is demanding help. They're fighting a defensive war and they need offense and cover to retake territory safe from shelling.

This is why 'boots on the ground' and 'no fly zone' are still needed and wanted by Zelenskyy. This is the limitation of conducting a fully defensive war.

> **The Ukrainian Army Has More Tanks Now Than When The War Began—Because It Keeps Capturing Them From Russia**
> 
> Mar 24, 2022, 08:00am EDT
> 
> David Axe Forbes Staff
> 
> Ukraine has lost at least 74 tanks—destroyed or captured—since Russia widened its war on the country starting the night of Feb. 23.
> But Ukraine has captured at least 117 Russian tanks, according to open-source-intelligence analysts who scrutinize photos and videos on social media.
> 
> In other words, the Ukrainian army might actually have more tanks now than a month ago—all without building a single brand-new tank or pulling some older vehicle out of storage.
> 
> The Russians meanwhile have captured at least 37 Ukrainian tanks—a sum inadequate to compensate for the roughly 274 tanks it is believed to have lost to all causes.
> 
> The disparity in captured tanks speaks to Russia’s lack of preparation for a high-intensity war against a determined foe. But it also speaks to the advantages any defender possesses over any attacker.
> 
> Russia must project forces into Ukraine scores or hundreds of miles, extending poorly-protected supply lines and risking front-line units running out of ammunition and fuel. Many of those tanks the Ukrainians have seized were just sitting there, out of gas, their crews having fled.
> 
> The Ukrainian army meanwhile enjoys the advantage of “interior lines.” That is, its forces fight close to major cities and their bases. The Ukrainians’ supply lines are contained inside their own defensive perimeter rather than strung out along unguarded highways.
> 
> The Kremlin realistically can’t kill its way to victory. Not as long as Ukraine, population 44 million, possesses reserves of human capital—and as long as the Ukrainians remain united in the defense of their homeland.
> 
> It’s telling that, at the same time Russia was begging Syria for a thousand mercenaries last week, Ukraine was mobilizing reserve echelons numbering 150,000 fresh troops.
> 
> Those reservists probably aren’t hurting for equipment. Many of them will fall in on some ex-Russian T-72, scrubbed clean of any evidence of its old crew and sporting freshly painted Ukrainian insignia.

Right now: Russia is fighting a NATO supplied Ukraine and failing to make significant gains using current strategies.

Consequence: Russia desires a way to break the stalemate.

Russian hypothesis: The deployment of weapons to which Ukraine has no defense would break this stalemate. NBC meets this requirement. Given the fire situation of the Russian assault, it's quite an attractive option in the face of not just a failure to advance but total military defeat, unthinkable for Russia. In their doctrine, the use of at least chemical weapons makes sense right now, and escalating further through the range of NBC weapons has strategic value, e.g. a tactical nuclear weapon could be used against a Ukrainian military target with great effect.

NATO counter: Ukraine now has practical supplies that would mitigate the worst effects of NBC, so using it no longer is a pathway to clear breaking of the stalemate. That's missile defense, and also survival gear for troops on the ground. Oh, also, using NBC means Russia fighting NATO itself.

NATO officials are studying a range of scenarios concerning Russia’s possible use of chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction, alliance officials said. 

A “false flag” event could involve a staged “accident” at a chemical plant given the significant amounts of ammonia, chlorine and nitrates in Ukraine that are used in its agricultural industry. Under that theory, Russia would blame Ukraine for creating a deadly hazard and respond by deploying more destructive weapons.

Another scenario considers Russia using a chemical weapon that could involve a highly toxic agent delivered across a wide area, the officials said. Such attacks, however, would allow immediate attribution to Russia, and it’s unclear whether Putin would want to avoid that, they added.

Still, a senior defense official told reporters this week that the U.S. has seen no evidence of Russian preparations for an imminent chemical or biological attack. Russian officials have repeatedly denied any intention to use such weapons, and the Kremlin says the military operation is going according to plan. 

The worry though is that there is no public sign so far that Putin is seeking any kind of off-ramp. On the contrary, this week’s demand that “unfriendly” countries pay for Russian gas in rubles, not foreign currency, was read by some observers as a veiled threat.

Just two days after Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine, he put Russian nuclear forces on a “special regime of combat duty,” following a warning that any nation that interfered with the invasion would suffer “consequences that you have never experienced in your history.”

QuickTake: How Russia Has Revived Fears of Nuclear War in Europe

Four weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Putin faces pressures on the battlefield and with the Russian economy, which is under an unprecedented barrage of Western sanctions. Russia’s military has so far failed to encircle Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv and is increasingly digging in for defensive positions, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday.

NATO estimates indicate that at least 7,000 Russian troops have died and that the actual death toll could be as high as 15,000. 

Despite concerns over Putin’s potential next moves, U.S. officials say they are confident in a strong and united allied response if he does choose to escalate. It would, for example, force countries such as Germany to back sanctions on Russia’s energy exports, a move that Berlin and others have so far resisted.

Overall, U.S. officials remain pessimistic about continuing talks between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting that Ukrainian concessions still fall short of a settlement Putin could spin as a victory at home and abroad. And from the start, Putin has made clear that he sees Ukraine as an existential issue, part of what he increasingly describes as an inevitable conflict between a resurgent Russia and a weakening West.

As concern builds about the possibility that Putin may escalate, officials have also begun to consider an alternative: that he reassesses his war aims in the light of his unexpected setbacks, according to two officials familiar with the matter.

Instead of achieving regime change in Kyiv or a full occupation of Ukraine, Putin may focus on reinforcing the Russian presence in the eastern Donbas and Luhansk regions and insisting on his initial demand that the country disavow its past ambitions to join NATO.",False,1648195573.0,t3_tndjsu,t1_i21gt6y,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

It is still possible (not that I want to discuss the plans of a madman) that the entire north/western corridors to Kyiv were a strategic diversion and loaded down with tactical liabilities (not ""the best troops""). In this way, a huge amount of forces are held back in defense of Kyiv, a city that might be impossible to take in any case.

Those forces are unable to be released to go down and relieve/cutoff the large southern forces that have cut Ukraine off from the world's oceans. Unable to export grain en masse, destroying the global harvest...

Problem is a tank is 50-70 tons and has 3-4 guys in it plus ammunition and fuel. You don't need much to incapacitate it after penetrating the armor. A boat on the other hand is a few hundred or a few thousand tons, and manned by dozens or hundreds of men.

Anyhow, a purpose built anti-ship missile has a much larger warhead and attacks differently. The Exocet missile, for example, carries a 364lb warhead, and will dive into the ship, detonating after it actually penetrates the ship.

> 
> By Bill Chappell
> 
> United Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s longtime political party, has opened an office in the outskirts of the contested city of Mariupol, Ukraine, the city council said on Friday.
> 
> The office at the Metro shopping center is being used to disseminate party newspapers and other materials, along with cellphone SIM cards for a company that operates in Ukrainian territory under Russian control, the council said, citing information from local residents.
> 
> United Russia is by far the most dominant political party in Russia’s government. But an academic in Moscow told NPR last year that the party has become deeply unpopular, leaving it to rely even more on intimidation and election trickery to maintain its position than it has in the past.
> 
> United Russia was founded from existing political blocks in 2001. Among its first leaders was Sergei Shoigu — who now serves as Russia’s minister of defense, leading the war in Ukraine.

There is some common ground. Ukraine seems willing at least to adopt the temporary pretence that they're not going to join NATO, for instance, or host foreign military forces. Russia seems to be backing away from the insanity of demanding that Ukraine no longer have armed forces at all.

The problem is that Russia is continuing to make insane demands, like ceding all of Crimea and the Donbass region and stating that they were always a part of Russia. Ukraine continues to say they're not going to do that, and to point out that the Russians violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which infuriates the Russians.

There is, however, something to hope for:

> But a Russian source briefed on the talks said the proposed settlement, if agreed, could give both sides a credible way to declare victory in the war.

> “Every side needs a win,” the person said. “He [Putin] needs to be able to sell it to the people. Putin can say that we wanted to stop Ukraine joining Nato and putting foreign bases and missiles in its territory. If they do that, he can say, ‘I got it.’”

And now you and I are preparing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Finally.
Here I ask you - do not be late. Please. Because during this month you have compared these worlds, and you see everything. You saw who is worth what. And you saw that Ukraine should be in the EU in the near future.
At least you have everything for that. And we have this chance.
Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France - Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us. The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us. Germany... A little later. Portugal - well, almost… Croatia stands for us. Sweden - yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland - I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta - I believe we will succeed. Denmark - I believe we will succeed.
Luxembourg - we understand each other. Cyprus - I really believe you are with us.
Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we’ll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it. Ireland - well, almost.
Hungary... I want to stop here and be honest. Once and for all.
You have to decide for yourself who you are with. You are a sovereign state. I’ve been to Budapest. I adore your city. I have been many times - very beautiful, very hospitable city. And people, too. You have had tragic moments in your life. I visited your waterfront. I saw this memorial… Shoes on the Danube Bank. About mass killings. I was there with my family.
Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in Mariupol?
Please, if you can, go to your waterfront.
Look at those shoes. And you will see how mass killings can happen again in today's world. And that's what Russia is doing today. The same shoes. In Mariupol, there are the same people. Adults and children. Grandparents. And there are thousands of them. And these thousands are gone.
And you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not?
And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not? 
There is no time to hesitate. It's time to decide already.
We believe in you. We need your support. We believe in your people.

This [interview with a Russian-specializing Finnish ex-intelligence agent](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?) has specific information on this subject (re Finland, NATO, the process of joining thereof).

The entire video is worth watching, but [this link (20:57)(closed captioning available)](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?t=1257s) discusses the status of Finland vis-a-vis NATO.

Paraphrasing:

* In [public discourse (the 'tactical truth')](http://world-information.org/trd/68) Russia considers Finland as officially neutral^[a]
* In private discourse (operational plans), Russia **already** considers Finland as part of NATO.

* In public discourse, Finland considers Finland as independent of NATO and Finland as opposed in principle to Russia since joining the EU in 1995.
* In private discourse, Finland considers itself part of NATO and probably (*wink*) has a **'special relationship' with NATO**^[b] with some security guarantees already in place.

Right after the linked time, he goes on to tell a story about he was indoctrinated in school to reinforce the idea that Finland always stay neutral and he could not publicly state his preference to join NATO but since his retirement he professes this fact.

He also says that in its current state because Russia **already views Finland as a NATO member operationally**, Finland has already assumed nearly **all** the disadvantages of being a NATO member without any of the benefits. So he argues that they should finish (no pun intended) joining the alliance.

[This video (a 1 hour lecture with slides, but worth every bit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw) was my first introduction to this guy Martii Kari which delves into the core cultural differences which are important in understanding the Russian perspective and their system of operating. (closed captioning available)

I also just noticed [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBopkxqR3p8) published today from the same guy.

**tl;dr** Finland is already some percentage of the way to joining NATO through a secret process to avoid exactly the situation Ukraine and Georgia find themselves in: wanting to join but being attacked, in part, to prevent it.

If Russia is claiming 11.5% loss for Ukraine, and 30k casualties, that is tacit acknowledgement that their own losses are higher, even if this wasn't a blatant lie.

Of course, Ukrainian losses are likely to be substantially lower than this in reality but it begs the question, if their losses were this high why is Russia performing so poorly? An army like theirs fighting an opponent they claim has essentially no anti air or aircraft, where's the use of air support? An adversary with 20% AA and 25% of aircraft, when their numbers are much smaller than yours, you should have total control of the skies which clearly isn't happening.

No, they cut it off from a canal within Ukraine. Why should they supply water to annexed territory controlled by an invader? It was one of the first targets during the war.

I say 'was', of course, because despite the success of that group as an irregular unit against the first Russian invasion of 2014, Biletsky was removed before they were absorbed in to the Ukraine National Guard.

He is a racist idiot, but he hasn't been involved with the Azov Battalion for the better part of a decade. So I'm a little confused as to how he personally makes the entire unit Nazis.

> However, their corresponding political party, the National Corps, created a coalition with three other right wing nazi adjacent political groups and all of them together didn't get more than 2 percent of the vote (doing the math based on voter turnout, 4-5 thousand people, literally just Azov and their families) and they got no Rada seats.

> Why did Russia send troops to Ukraine?       

>First, Ukraine is politically corrupt, partisan, economically depressed and ethnically divided. In the past eight years, government forces and Nazis have killed 14,000 people in eastern Ukraine and Russia. After 2014, Ukraine has made a series of irrational foreign policies, hated Russia, started to produce weapons of mass destruction and sought to join NATO. Second, NATO's five eastward expansion has compressed Russia's strategic space and has led Russia to a dead end. Third, the United States is the initiator of the tragedy. The United States has provided $2.7 billion in militarization assistance to Ukraine. The constant quarrels between fake islands has intensified the contradiction between South Ukraine and Ukraine. The United States provoked Russia and launched a war, dragged Russia to a low level, controlled Europe and reaped profits. Fourth, Russia's diplomatic efforts are exhausted, and Putin strikes hard so not to prolong the conflict with Russia.

By giving Ukraine these anti-tank weapons along with Western intelligence they have allowed a creative and brave force to resist much longer than the otherwise would have been able to while exposing the deep problems in Russian military doctrine and command systems.

The downside is these weapons probably will never be enough to mount wide offensives, or to limit the impact of high altitude bombing and long range missiles. So while Russia bleeds, so will Ukraine, especially the civilians and cities and if this does turn into a months long or even years long conflict and Moscow, who does not care what forces they lose, has more blood to give.

This could turn into resentment by Ukraine forces is they were never given enough support to win, just to stay in the fight and keep dying so that NATO didn't have to get directly involved and do any of the dying.

Maybe this is wrong, but it seems the longer the fight goes on the more opportunity Russia has to turn one city after another into Mariupul given enough time, despite their ineptitude.

In terms of resources and preventing Ukrainian development of those gas/oil fields from breaking Russia's near-monopoly on energy to large parts of Europe, those are the only pieces on the board that matter long term.

Leaving those areas in Russian hands just gives them time to develop those areas themselves, and rebuild for a few years for the next annexation attempt.

Many of the replies are falling into that same trap. I'd say three years minimum of significant conflicts. Securing the amount of territory would be difficult and slow. The sparsely populated areas will be refuges for guerrilla forces and partisans. Even with very fast movement, for a military, securing flake and supply lines over those distances may require more than a summer or two. While the Russian troops have no morale in Ukraine when it comes to defending their own homeland they would fight with some ferocity. They would be closer to their logistics and supply centers and likely more effective.

The victory could be written on the wall in a matter of months but actually forcing the government to capitulate (or being dissolved by force) would be ongoing.

Be wary of anyone who believes it would be quick and easy. They are thinking the same way the planners of WW1 and WW2 did. Now if the fight is justified then it's justified but nobody should expect it to be easy and we shouldn't go into it and lose domestic support when it drags into month 6 and everyone starts to bunker down for the winter.

But it’s a very complex topic regarding Chinese nationals’ views of events when they live in the West. I believe it’s much more complex than “if they assimilate to Western views they are good and free, if they aren’t they are brainwashed”.

I am a Chinese person living in the West myself and I find my views closer to Western views. However, I do not agree with what’s being reported on Western media fully — they are biased, like every media is. An example that comes to mind was when Wuhan got locked down NYT had a news piece highlighting the human rights concerns — then weeks later such language disappeared when Italy started doing the same. Western news tend to be critical of China and even if they aren’t, much of the audience will take the news as criticism. Or that the Western media gleefully ignoring the anti-Mainland sentiment/harassment during the HK protests — I was there a few days before the protests myself and I certainly felt unwelcome when I spoke to my friend in mandarin. It was a complex movement and such complexity was lost in news reports.

The reality is, while Chinese media is full of bullshit, sometimes they have roots in reality. While the myriad Western sources are usually rooted in reality, they often view it through a specific lens. I make my own views and decisions through my own experiences and using the information I have. 

But that didn’t stop *strangers*, who upon hearing where I am from, asking if I support *Free HK/Tibet/Uighurs/Taiwan* when they absolutely had zero rights to. Or that I have to explain myself every time I deviate from the Western mainstream thought. Just because someone lives in say, Ohio, doesn’t mean he has to think a certain way, unless you believe your thought system is just superior to theirs because of “freedom”. It feels incredibly frustrating and condescending. If you want to change your friends’ minds, talk to them in detail and convince them, instead of isolating them because they didn’t think the way you do.

Back to the war, maybe NATO does have a responsibility: if it wasn’t ready to admit Ukraine and protect it, then it should have never given empty promises. If it wants to fulfil the promises given to Ukraine, it better give Ukraine more aid to end this stupid war early.

Not true at all. POWs have right no matter what side. 

>A vast amount of the Ukrainian force is irregular militia. They're not going to have any real knowledge of the minute limitations and requirements of Geneva, and even less inclination to care.

Militias are combatants and must adhere to the rules of war like regular troops. That's why they still wear arm bands and display they're militia. If not then they'd be partisans and then they actually wouldn't have any rights, Russia could kill them on site and it would technically be legal in the eyes of the international courts because they were a non uniformed combatant (partisan). It adds an extra element of unfairness and chaos to an already unfair and chaotic situation when you blend in civilians with militia which leads to more infalted casualites on each side, thats why militia are marked with arm bands. Anyone you see holding a weapon without proper identification is not protected under the POW laws uniformed soldiers are.

d9f8e6a757b9f39217c8ab0c53065385,tndjsu,i224lsj,"Okay, I've been meaning to address this talking point for a while;

Russia has about 1,600 actively deployed warheads.  The rest are in warehouses.  So;

1) Let's stop talking about 6000 (just like let's stop talking about 5500 on the American side).  The VAST majority of warheads are stored in facilities that would be targeted in an all out exchange and destroyed before they can be moved to an active role.

2) Of those active deployed warheads, roughly 16% are allocated to their strategic bomber fleet.  Those warheads will never see targets in a nuclear exchange.  Remove them from your calculation. (Natural Resources Defense Council, Archive of Nuclear Data and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Nuclear Notebook)

3) Of what is left \~45% are SLBM, and the remained are ICBM.  Let's call it 50/50 just for the sake of '5% ain't going to matter here'.  ( Natural Resources Defense Council, Archive of Nuclear Data and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Nuclear Notebook)

Still a lot of warheads left of course, but the calculous starts to change a little bit.  

I bring this up because I am tired of seeing the 6,000 number thrown around.  The reality is Russia has about \~1,300 or so warheads on semi realistic delivery platforms (their bombers are not and should not be considered capable of delivering that ordinance, they lack speed and stealth and would be gone from the sky nearly instantly).

I will leave it to an exercise for the reader to asses what they think the likelihood is of successful launch of all the nuclear (SLBM) and land based (ICBM) fleet is.  Based on the fact that much less complex weapons are exhibiting a failure rate in the war of \~60%, coupled with the fact that Russia is estimated to have spent 4.5B on maintenance of the fleet in 2016 (up from 1.4B in 2010!!) ([https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/how-much-does-russia-spend-nuclear-weapons](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/how-much-does-russia-spend-nuclear-weapons)).  Compare that to America which has spent about 10x the high number to maintain a slightly smaller number of warheads.  Add to the Russian spending the rampant corrupting that has been seen with their conventional force as well.

Finally you have to add the human element.  Will everyone who is supposed to actually launch, launch.  Most studies estimate up to half of the missiles on either side may not get lit.

Once you have a true idea of what might be used you can start looking at deterrents and counter measures.  Again none of this is to say a nuclear war would be good.  Just that we should be realistic.",False,1648212594.0,t3_tndjsu,t1_i2217nq,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

I doubt any of the weapons in storage are functional... there's too much corruption skimming off money.  They've clearly shorted their own military, they must have shorted missiles in storage no one expects to ever use.

Moreover, they've likely shorted the active missiles as well.  I'd be surprised if half the active missiles are operational.

At the earliest they knew the DNC was hacked in late 2015.

Obama could have *easily* killed the Trump presidency in June or July of 2016. The entire intelligence apparatus (some 17 agencies) was prepared to certify that Russia had infiltrated American voter rolls in nearly every state, had hacked and phished into both campaigns but selectively released only information damaging to the DNC or Hillary; and a whole host of other details - **and also that the operation was ordered by Putin personally, specifically to help Trump, specifically to hurt Hillary**.

The United States was 100% sure of all of that in early July 2016. They said nothing, until October 7th, 2016. In a short statement, signed by only the DIA and DHS heads, and leaving out the fact we knew it was Putin.

30 minutes later on that same day - October 7th - the Access Hollywood 'grab by the pussy' tape was released. 30 minute after that, John Podestas emails started getting released on Wikileaks.

There was no attempt to get ahead, or tell the truth beforehand. And yet there was no follow up. No clarification of the threat afterwards. No attempt to combat the information warfare being conducted by Putin.

**The Trump Presidency** was Obama's biggest mistake.

> The Russian reserve has over two million former conscripts and contract servicemen on paper, but few are actively trained or prepared for war. Historically, only 10 percent of reservists receive refresher training after completing their initial term of service. Russia lacks the administrative and financial capacity to train reservists on an ongoing basis. According to a 2019 RAND analysis, Russia only had 4,000 to 5,000 troops in what would be considered an active reserve in the Western sense, meaning soldiers attending regular monthly and annual training. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has repeatedly stated that the Russian Armed Forces hoped to have 80,000-100,000 active reserve members.

> [...]

> Russia is likely rapidly exhausting the manpower it can readily use to generate additional effective combat power even as its forces lose combat effectiveness in Ukraine amid high losses. Russian efforts to mobilize more manpower can bring more people into Russian combat units, but those people are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated to generate large amounts of new combat power.

> Mobilization efforts are likely to start producing diminishing returns as Russia moves through the categories of fully-trained and recently-released reservists into categories of people further removed from their initial military experiences and/or those who will undergo hasty training before deployment to the front lines. Individual replacements for battlefield losses are unlikely to have the same training as their predecessors, and new units or those reinforced by these augmentees will not have undergone unit-level training prior to employment.

>In late June 1950, it became apparent that the Soviet action had backfired when the issue of North Korea’s invasion of South Korea was brought before the Security Council. By June 27, the Security Council voted to invoke military action by the United Nations for the first time in the organization’s history.

 >The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that enabled those two powers to partition Poland between them. The pact was signed in Moscow on 23 August 1939 by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and was officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Unofficially, it has also been referred to as the Hitler–Stalin Pact, Nazi–Soviet Pact or Nazi–Soviet Alliance (although it was not a formal alliance).

It is possible for the politics, views and behaviours of even such a small tight-knit social unit to be quite divided and different.    Now imagine a government, which is a sprawling bureaucracy with many compartments and divisions, yet each with access to the resources of a nation.  Billions or even tens of billions of dollars at their disposal.  Quite powerful. 

One branch of government can be quite competent in its administration, while the other branch less so.  And usually the competency of government capacity lies well below the ministerial level - because this is the entire purpose of bureaucracy, to shield the nation from the shifts and whims of whoever is the current ""leader"", because nations need stability on a timescale of decades (or the financial system breaks down) whereas the views and positions of leaders change on a timescale of years (and sometimes months!). 

Now... install a corrupt leadership on top of a highly functioning bureaucracy.  What happens?

The bureaucracy will protect itself from below by continuing to execute its long-term mission.  Quietly.  And it will protect itself from above by creating fiction that keeps the corruption from meddling in its competency.  

If the corruption is significant, the fiction becomes significant, and the corruption begins to steep in the fiction.  Including fictions that cover up the corruption.   So you have armies that exist on paper, whose competence becomes more strongly reported... which needs further papering over (and hollowing out).   But you can still have extremely competent people running things at the lower levels on very long-term missions.  And the convenient truths will be told, while the inconvenient truths will be papered over.   This is the product of *corruption at the top*, with *competency below*. 

This is what we are observing right now in Russia. The reason Putin so vastly miscalculated this ""invasion"" is because he and his cabinet were being fed a mix of fiction and fact and cannot tell the two apart. This was not an invasion initiated by the competent parts of the government, it was an invasion initiated by the top.

Real life is often unpredictable and I can’t really guess at what the Kremlin is thinking right now but **if** the theory in my first comment here was correct and I wasn’t just making incorrect assumptions, maybe two possibilities out of a few:

Far more realistic scenario first- Putin really believed that they’d be welcomed with full arms so he just sent in his conscripts and police force, while overestimating Russia’s army, and the Kremlin had to bullshit their own way into Plan B on the fly and at some point came up with the idea of framing the West and NATO. They’re desperately hoping they can gaslight their own population into believing anything they say along the way, and hoping the West will do something to give the Kremlin ammo to do so. 

Wild scenario- Putin and a very few of his own most trusted men had been planning this for years and Putin wanted to take Ukraine, the Baltics, etc. but understood that the West would be watching closely and that they had spies in Russia, and he didn’t want them to catch on too early and be ready for everything they had planned; *although,* he really **did** underestimate UAF’s own military strength and the extent of the West’s sanctions. If this is the case, literally only he and a very few of his own most trusted men were in on the real plan, and they were deliberately giving everyone else false intelligence—including Lavrov, the Russian media, their own army, and anyone else who could possibly be a mole—and making the extremely immoral choice of intentionally sending in mostly undertrained soldiers on wrong orders as well as outdated military hardware, for the pretense of being “incompetent” (this is one of the oldest tricks in the book because it is often very effective). But when Lavrov or someone else finally announces that the West is declaring total war “for real”, Putin will order all of his actual trained men into Eastern Europe and bring in the big guns, to the West’s horror as they realize they really were wrong after all in thinking Russia’s army was just a paper tiger. **If**—and this is a huge, huge if—this is the case, Putin might have something in mind to explain away earlier “misstatements” for the Kremlin’s propaganda.

Not morally, unless we're back to calling Stalin's USSR one of the allies - then yes. Putin is a sociopathic totalitarian running the Joseph Stalin playbook.

I'm responding to the anti-historical idea that you can't give up territory for peace, especially if in the process you gain non-territorial concessions or benefits like, say, the ability to join NATO, the EU etc. 

Also, modern governments ""almost never concede territories"" - are you sure? Let's go over some of territorial concessions since WWII:

Georgia conceded territory to Russia.

Numerous countries were created from territorial concessions from existing countries, including Eritrea, East Timor and South Sudan. Paupa New Guinea just conceded territory that will form a new nation.

A significant amount of territory has changed hands in Africa in the 20th and 21st century.

As recently as 2015, India and Bangladesh redrew their borders to eliminate enclaves and exclaves.

Serbia has had to concede Montenegro to the EU and even Kosovo has de facto independence. 

I think Wikipedia has a list of the hundreds of territorial changes agreed to by modern governments, big and small. 

While WWII is a popular source for analogy and understanding, that's only because its the only major conflict most people are familiar with. In truth, there are a lot more apt conflicts for drawing comparisons here.

The most apt is the pre-WWII Winter War between the USSR and Finland, which followed the exact same playbook Putin is using here, and was waged for the exact same stupid reasons. The result was that both sides could claim they won. Finland conceded some eastern territory to the Soviets, but miraculously maintained their independence.",False,1648221793.0,t3_tndjsu,t1_i22lzcz,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

0c7463127cd9891696c02f6a75d912de,tndjsu,i229ijg,"So the first thing I will say is I disagree with your assessment about the explosions. Here is why. You don’t need explosives to conduct this type of sabotage. Bolt cutters and Molotov cocktails will do fine. Additionally an explosion draws attention, it makes light (fire) and noise. It’s easy to figure out where the problem originated. To disable railroads, you don’t need that unless you’re targeting tracks. Which are surprisingly hard to disable (will tack a link to a US Army video on the subject at the end). 

Most of what sound like was disabled in the info graphic is what in North American parlance we would call CTC or Centralized Train Control. When multiple trains move across a railroad there needs to be a system in place to govern those movements so trains don’t collide. These systems vary in complexity from token systems where there is a token, and only a train crew physically in possession of the token can occupy a section of track (this was common in Britain, and may still be, using rings or batons). 

Then you move up to Timetable and Trainorder systems. Where train crews use a predetermined timetable to move trains across the system, and any non timetabled trains, called extras, move with specific instructions given to them by the person controlling train movements (in the US called a dispatcher). These instructions will not contain information on timetabled trains, as crews are expected to know their timetables and plan for those trains accordingly. The instructions really govern meets between extras and any work they need to do (pickup and set out cars at industries for example) that these trains need to do. 

So far the two systems we have discussed have what are called blocks, but not line side signals. A block is a segment of track that a train can be given permission to occupy, they can be anywhere from under mile in length to dozens of miles, but in the US they’re usually give or take 3 miles or less. Line side signals are the illuminated lights next to the track that give train crews instructions on how to proceed and while they give red, yellow, and green indications, they don’t mean exactly the same thing as the ones you see on the highway. I’ll get to those later.

Moving up the hierarchy we now have ABS or absolute block signals. This is basically Timetable and Trainorder operation with line side signals. These signals are what are called absolute signals. If they’re red you will stop, you will not be allowed to pass them. You cannot be given permission to pass them. They’re indication is controlled by a central dispatcher who basically gives trains a route to follow. 

CTC or Centralized Train Control is what I think we’re dealing with especially on high traffic double track lines. Basically the dispatcher has complete control of all signals and switches from their central location. They look at a large display that shows all the tracks they control laid out in straight lines. Lights indicate routings and occupancy. This is an image from ATCS monitor of a Conrail line in Ohio. ATCS monitor is a software that lets anyone monitor train movements where the ATCS radio protocols are used to control CTC.

https://conrailphotos.thecrhs.org/sites/default/files/archive_photo/images/24421.jpg

White lines are track. Red lines are track occupied by a train, green lines are routes that the dispatcher has given to trains. The red dots next to the track are signals. On the CTC panel, these will show as red or green, but in actuality could show dozens of different indications depending on the scenario. Basically they show if a train has permission to pass the signal or not. They don’t worry about relaying complex speed and routing indications like diverging approach diverging to the dispatcher, train crews need that information, the dispatcher can see what’s going to happen on his screen, they only needs a binary output. One feature of CTC is that if a train encounters an unexpected stop signal, the dispatcher can “talk” the train past the signal. Literally they give the train verbal permission past the signal, at restricting speed. 

Ok so what is sounds like happened in Belarus is they knocked out the communications and signaling lines that allows the dispatcher to communicate with the line side signal systems and to get occupancy indication on the various blocks. Now a dispatcher is not completely screwed in this scenario, but it does make his life a lot harder. Basically he can grab a large sheet of paper and track his train movements on that. But it’s pretty complicated and gets more so with more trains. Furthermore without the line side signals and occupancy circuits, the dispatcher can’t tell if the track is occupied or even intact. So trains must operate at reduced speed (called restricting speed in the US) again that speed is based on the distance your train needs to stop. If you’re operating a train and you can see 1000 feet down the tracks, your maximum speed is one that allows you to stop your train in 500 feet, with a hard maximum of 15 mph (again US Standard). 

Blowing up signal cabinets doesn’t really make sense, they’re sheet metal boxes designed to keep electronics dry. They’re usually only padlocked shut. Bolt cutters gets you inside, and a Molotov does a lot more damage because the maintainer sent out to fix the signals will have to test everything in the cabinet and track down specific faults, a smoking crater where there used to be a signal cabinet is a lot easier to diagnose. 

The Russians tend to run Communications and signaling cables underground. So the signal cabinets are the only place you can easily access them.  

So I hope that gives you some background and an explanation of the info graphic. I’ll gladly try to answer specific questions you might have.

The two communities were asked whether they approved of the fifth revision of the United Nations proposal for reuniting the island, which had been divided since 1974. While it was approved by 65% of Turkish Cypriots, it was rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots. Turnout for the referendum was high at 89% among Greek Cypriots and 87% among Turkish Cypriots, which was taken as indicative of great interest in the issue on the part of the electorates.

No matter what, the Biden Admin won’t go to war directly with Russia, at most they’ll push for sanctions that Zelensky can use as a bargaining chip since he could probably offer to ask that sanctions be partially repealed if Russia gives Ukraine better terms. 

People being extremely upset and angry at Russia and fans or Ukraine do not make war more likely or peace more difficult. The outcome of their fervor is already what we’re getting—indirect support for Ukraine, willingness to take refugees, etc. 

On the other hand, people trying to turn the west against Zelensky or say America is also bad and the world is a horrible place so why blame Putin for simply being part of it are trying to break resolve and make people forget how one-sided this war is. Then, they hope, the public will get mad about inflation or gas prices (which are only minimally related to Ukraine and mostly about COVID supply chain shortages) and Western governments will get anxious and make concessions to enable Putin. 

Populations also often become selfish in an influx of refugees, and making it seem like Ukrainians are not so innocent might make Europe/the U.S. set limits on refugees. (It probably won’t work but that’s another possible goal.) Meaning Ukraine now has more starving people, is more desperate, and has to make bigger concessions to Russia.

I'll have to revise my theory that the explosion sounds have to do with the rail system.  I'll have to go back to being infuriated that I can't figure out what they are, but knowing that they're being lied about.  Could have some connection to a parallel operation of some kind, but at this point I'm getting too speculative. 

I'm also gonna have to try and dig a little bit deeper, maybe using waybackmachine, to see if the passenger rail from Minsk to Brest has slowed down since January.  The fact that everything slows down, that gives me a great OSINT tool. 

A few things stuck out to me though.  

Are we sure Belarus has ATCS?  For pretty much everything else tech wise they're basically still behind the iron curtain. And if they did not have a modernish computerized system, would that change anything? Although, now that I think about it, the Cyber Partisans have been hacking it since the beginning, so that at least implies a networked computer system. 

Also, you said something like ""not being able to tell if the track is occupied or intact.""  It never occurred to me, but there are sensors that monitor this stuff right?  How easy would it be for someone who knows what they're doing to intentionally spoof those signals, and what would they have to do? Like to make it seem like the rail line was occupied and/or damaged.  

My profile on this BYPOL/Cyber Partisans group shows me that they really really want to stop Russian forces from moving through the country, but they even more don't want to be seen as terroristic or hurting the average populace. So they're doing things like damaging relays instead of straight up taking out the rail lines or blocking them. 

Another thing I'm reading between the lines of, which is unconfirmed but informed speculation, is that a large contingent of the rail workers in Belarus are a part of or sympathize with BYPOL and communicate through Telegram. At least, their Telegram is huge, and they claim to have a ton of public service workers, and their hacking of the rail lines for more than a year at this point seems to back up an inside connection. They also seem to have the insider knowledge to know exactly how to hit these things and also have a map of where all of the relays are. 

So if the dispatcher is a partisan, would they be able to plausibly deniable wise block or significantly slow Russian rail traffic?  Like ""passenger traffic gets priority"" kind of stuff? 

Thanks again for answering my questions, sorry, I'm going full journalist mode. If I do end up getting my article shipped, I can cite you as an expert if you want, although it looks like I'll have to rewrite a large part of it.  And, frankly, if I end up implicating like, a specific dispatcher, I probably don't want to publish it.",False,1648217063.0,t3_tndjsu,t1_i229ijg,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
282a7aa428dd8444b756c691c5f152a0,tndjsu,i218z0b,"Tanks will likely have similar problems to the MIGs. They're relatively costly and it isn't exactly subtle to sneak them in. If this fight has taught us anything it's that the era of tanks may well be coming to an end anyways.  A single stash of captured Javelins could potentially take out whatever tanks could likely be spared (and at what cost?). Tanks *need* infantry support to ensure they don't get hit by other infantry, and even then it seems to be getting dicier as portable fire-and-forget ATGM range increases. 
  
Medium-ranged missiles make sense, but it may be tricky to get the launchers that go with, into Ukraine.    
   
Multi-mission drones make sense, but I'm not sure how many NATO has to spare.  Personally I think the drone option makes the most sense and although I'm no tactician, I would like to see NATO countries ramp up production and distribution of these.   
   
I would not be entirely surprised if Ukraine had already secretly sent out some servicemen to be trained for advanced SAMs, but it's a numbers problem as well.  For this to be an effective strategy, Ukraine needs multiple capable crews in case the ones who do know get taken out.    
   
There's a lot we won't know until after this war is over, but many of these options, though reasonable, are not necessarily just questions of pushing a button and making it so.

How easy would it be for someone who knows what they're doing to intentionally spoof those signals, and what would they have to do? Like to make it seem like the rail line was occupied and/or damaged. 

If that system is in anyway connected to the servers they already hacked, moving parallel in the system would be very reasonable. Especially if it wasn't a hacktivist, which tend to hack and organically find things, but rather someone with cohesive goals, like a revolutionary or state-sponsored actor. As a hacker, one of the first things you tend to look at is when you can raise false flags and more importantly, when you can hide red flags or bury them in your false flags. I'd imagine in western countries it might be more common. As you said, for Belarus, who knows if it's Soviet or not.

0c7463127cd9891696c02f6a75d912de,tndjsu,i22lr47,"I would highly doubt Belarus uses ATCS. ATCS is a communication tool to use radios to connect Railway infrastructure as oppose to direct wired connections which in can be very expensive to maintain, especially in remote areas. Belarusian and Russian railways aren’t tasked with being profitable like their American counterparts so cutting Communications and Signaling (C&S) costs is an unlikely objective especially when wired connections can offer reliability benefits. ATCS isn’t all that common in the US, the modern digital display is just a lot easier to visualize than the older analog CTC displays from the 1930s that seem to be more represented in the Google Image search. 

This is the CTC display at Thorn Tower in Thorndale, PA on Amtrak’s Keystone Line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg. It’s a lot harder to interpret visually than the ATCS view.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_traffic_control#/media/File%3AThorn_Desk_Facing_Northwest_2.jpg

The sensor in the track is incredibly simple, there is a low current in the rails, positive in one, negative the other. The train’s axles complete the circuit. This triggers signals, grade crossing flashers and gates for highways, and provides occupancy detection.

Edit: If a rail is broken at any location, the voltage doesn’t travel end to end along the rail, that circuit is broken, and usually this will automatically override a signal and drop it to a stop indication.

I doubt there is much hacking of the control systems. In parts of the US, analog systems that could be nearing a century in age are still being used, because they are pretty simple and bulletproof (figuratively speaking) and generally easier to troubleshoot. Having said that, the US is implementing an anticollision system called Positive Train Control (PTC), that may require components to be upgraded to modern specs.

The relay cabinets aren’t hard to find. They’ll be next to the signals which are every few miles. Walk in the forest at night along the tracks, you’ll see the signals well off shining in the darkness, unless they are approach lit (they only light up when there are trains in adjoining blocks). Even if they are approach lit, walk along the tracks, you’ll find them. I don’t ever recall seeing approach lit signals in Russia, but they could use them. This was common as it extended the life of the incandescent bulbs in the signals, which require a maintainer to replace when they burn out.

A dispatcher could slow traffic yes, but it would be noticeable to his superiors if they were paying event the most remote attention to their railroad, which they should be doing. They usually work in the same location as the dispatchers as well (again, at least in the US [usually]).

I don’t know about being cited as a source. I work in transportation yes, but railroads are more a hobby. I’m confident what I said is correct for North American railroads, and I suspect the Russians copied many of our best practices as the US was the world leader in railroads until about 1960. Then we stagnated a bit. Still there are only a handful of countries where railroads are dominated by freight traffic. Russia and the US are among that handful, and the US/Canada remain the leaders in that field, so I would expect some emulation.",1648220362.0,1648220182.0,t3_tndjsu,t1_i22e6ho,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

CTC consolidates train routing decisions that were previously carried out by local signal operators or the train crews themselves. The system consists of a centralized train dispatcher's office that controls railroad interlockings and traffic flows in portions of the rail system designated as CTC territory. One hallmark of CTC is a control panel with a graphical depiction of the railroad.

And that can only be countered by… nationalism. Not educating people to critically process information, just make them patriots, apparently.


Bezmenov’s little speech isn’t useful as a primer because it is primarily ideologically motivated.
