⚠️ Important: 

Article 3, of the ""Treaty of Friendship"" between Russia and the separatist republics states that the parties will 

""...closely cooperate with each other to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity""

""... The parties will immediately consult, whenever in the opinion of one of them there may be a threat of attack against it.""

""... These consultations will determine the nature of the response required to eliminate the threat.""

I don't expect it will take too long for Article 3 to be used by the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist republics, if it hasn't been already.

If bullets do start flying, it'll be a massive gut punch, but hopefully also complete hell for the Russian troops. Anybody who is in their armed forces and enlisted post-2014 knew exactly what they were signing up for. They deserve whatever wrath Ukraine can muster.

Also, from firsthand experience living in the Baltics, I saw the impact caused by the fall of the Soviet Union and the deaths of so many young Russian men during WW2. It's a generational ripple caused by broken men and broken families. The alcoholism, coldness, and other ""Russian"" stereotypes were directly caused by these catastrophes.

So if Russia decides to start exchanging blows with Ukraine, they may very well have a second round of social decay on their hands. How many young men will come home in body bags? How many families will be broken? Putin is doing irreparable damage to the fabric of a society desperately trying to find normalcy.

dea1ac93b00d603cdeb28743262ffb92,szoahq,hy5agsa,"Some thoughts from an ISS astronaut on the very complicated east/west space impacts of a larger conflict: 

""....Hearing these things spoken out loud makes it crystal clear that these are not the behaviors of a nation you would want to partner with in space (or on Earth, for that matter). Case in point, China has been denied the privilege of joining the space station partnership precisely because of their bad behavior on Earth. 

However, Russia is already an ISS partner - and that complicates matters. Frankly, they have been a valuable partner in space. They helped sustain the ISS when the U.S. suffered the tragic loss of the space shuttle Columbia and had no way to send crew or cargo to the orbiting outpost. And they continued to provide our only ride to space in the years after the shuttle was retired, until SpaceX recently gave us the capability to once again send astronauts to the ISS...


...A clean break with Russia would not be possible because the ISS is dependent on Russian elements for its control, and we would have to build a new control module to continue operating the ISS without that Russian support. This is a contingency that has been quietly discussed in recent years, but was never moved forward.

Which brings us back to the elephant in the room: What is the ""point of no return"" for Russia vis à vis the ISS partnership. Is it invading Ukraine, just a little bit? Is it a full-scale invasion, with Russian boots in Kiev? Is it something else?

This question was never even on the horizon until Putin decided to try to return Russia to the glory days of the 20th century. Sadly, this point of no return for our space partnership is now in sight.

Let us hope that he changes course before it's too late.""

TASS article on the LPR/DPR request for military aid (in a telling sign the article included official photographs of the actual documents) ;

MOSCOW, February 23. /TASS/. The heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a request to assist in repelling aggression by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in order to avoid civilian casualties and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the Donbass. This was reported to journalists by the press secretary of the head of the Russian state Dmitry Peskov.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin received letters of appeal from the head of the Lugansk People's Republic Leonid Pasechnik and the head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin,"" he said. ""The heads of these republics, on their own behalf and on behalf of their peoples, once again express their gratitude to the President of Russia for the recognition of their states.""

According to Peskov, ""the heads of the two republics in connection with the current situation, as well as in order to prevent casualties among civilians and a humanitarian catastrophe on the basis of articles 3 and 4 of the treaties on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the Russian Federation and the republics, ask the President of Russia to assist in repelling the aggression of the armed forces and formations of Ukraine.""

Pushilin and Pasechnik in an appeal to Putin pointed to the aggravation of the situation in the Donbass and threats from Kiev.

""The appeals emphasize that at present, due to the aggravation of the situation and threats from Kiev, citizens of the republics are forced to leave their homes, their evacuation to Russia continues. In the context of the ongoing military aggression by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the republics, there is a destruction of civil and industrial infrastructure, schools, hospitals, kindergartens and the most terrible thing is the death of civilians, including children,"" Peskov quoted the text of the letters.

The Ukrainian authorities are building up their military presence on the contact line in the Donbass and are guided by force to resolve the conflict, according to the appeals of the heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

It's easy for an undisciplined army to collapse while retreating and then for a retreat to turn into a rout. I imagine that given Russian battle doctrine and troop positions that the Russians are going to attack with a large scale pincer movement. I'm assuming that the vast majority of the Ukrainian military is in the East and at risk of being cut off and surrounded. They'll need those troops and all that equipment to manage and extricate themselves and to fight another day. Ideally for the Ukrainians they will be able to hold the pincers back for a while before engaging in a well planned and executed fighting retreat westward. Digging in and fighting back to inflict casualties on the Russians but moving on before the Russians can fully bring all their combined arms might to bear. Basically you want to make the Russians pay in blood for every yard they take. 

A good retreat is just about the most difficult thing for an army to accomplish so we'll see if the Ukrainians are up for it. If they can pull that off then Russia is in for an unpleasant war. If Russia can break through quickly and roll up the Ukrainian flanks or surround them then Putin will be able to point to an early victory which will bolster his position and demoralize the Ukrainians. Then it will come down to what kind of insurgency the Ukrainians are willing and capable of organizing. Though Russia will almost assuredly win conventionally in the early stages the price they have to pay will have a big say in who ultimately ends up winning strategically. We should have a better idea of the lay of the land in a few days or a week. 

I'm a bit worried by the fact that the Ukrainians have waited so long to start even the first steps of mobilizing. Ideally they should have all their forces already in position and arrayed out with pre-prepared positions for defense in depth. The Russians are likely counting on there being a thin front line where by concentrating their superiority in artillery and matériel they can establish a breakthrough and destroy Ukrainian organization. I find it unlikely that the Ukrainians will be able to have all those reservists they just called up at all organized by the time the Russians invade. By waiting until the last minute it's possible Ukraine has doomed themselves in the early stages of the war.

India's neutrality has always been annoying to the West, which is one of the reasons the West actually sided with Pakistan against India during the Cold War. But it makes perfect sense for India to balance its bets. After all, it was the British that colonized and oppressed India for centuries, not the Russians. While India's perception of the West isn't nearly as bad as Korea's perception of Japan - to use an analogy - it's still got wounds from the days of Western colonialism.

By contrast, Russia has been much more consistent in being a partner of sorts to India.",1645643077.0,1645643039.0,t3_szoahq,t3_szoahq,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

1) One key concern is with Ukraine joining NATO. Some of the Russians that I have found discussing the conflict believe that by doing so gives the US access to the Russian border, thereby threatening the National security of Russia.

2) Another main concern with Ukraine is their allowance and acceptance of neo-nazism influence. I repeatedly saw nazism brought up in many threads. One Russian citizen claimed that this has led to schools in Ukraine forbidding the teaching of Russian. Many of the Russians view Putin’s actions as coming to the aid of their people, hence the “peacekeeping” basis claim.

3) In one poll (no citation for the poll was given) 68.4% of Russians support Putin’s decision. 15.6% mostly support, 3.9% mostly do not support, 7.9% do not support, and 4.2% are undecided. No clue as the accuracy or legitimacy of these statistics.

4) The santions placed yesterday will have little to no effect on Russia. Many agreed that it would only serve to strengthen nationalism and approval of Putin’s actions. They seemed to view Russia as mainly self-sufficient, with the ability to acquire any potentially required assistance from China.

It is interesting to see the differences in perspectives as a westerner. I truly hope that this conflict does not amplify, but it is hard to remain that optimistic with all of the intel coming from nations across the world.",False,1645647334.0,t3_szoahq,t3_szoahq,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

It’s been reported that Russia is not exporting ammonium nitrate until after Q1, this is used by American farms to grow corn. Corn is not only used in some form in most everything (corn syrup, animal feed) but is also required to make ethanol - a primary component of gas. Combine this with China hoarding over half of the world’s grain supply. Do we really believe that Russia will release that ammonia nitrate in April? Do we have a backup plan on where to source that from? Has Putin been playing the long game for the timing of this invasion knowing that sanctions would come and our planting season is just around the corner. 

Combine this with China and their hoarding of over half of the world’s grain supply- those two will have us by the balls in no time.

But it seems like in this situation, the whole lead-up to the invasion (which, to me, seems almost inevitable) has just been so slow and deliberate. Every day there’s a few new preparations. Today it’s field hospitals and power, yesterday it was some more false flags, the say before it was peacekeeping troops… and so on.

I'm sure the West would've been annoyed but annexing Donbass is actually not even as bad as them annexing Crimea (which is also a majority-Russian region).

I think the Donbass could've even achieved independence or a Russia merger democratically under different circumstances. Don't forget that the Ukraine doesn't exactly have a great government either.

The issue is that Putin seems to be using a very popular opinion (that the Donbass is a part of Russia) to segue into the full scale invasion of Ukraine.

He's not going to be able to make Russia a superpower again just by taking Ukraine alone, or raising the level of power Russia has compared to others, but he might be able to do so by degrading the power of others. Ukraine isn't his goal here, it's just his next move. He's not done disrupting things socially in the west after 2016 and 2020, that was just a trial run.

Condensed answer is that Putin/Russia likely has kompromat on them.  During the 2014 election cycle, both the DNC and RNC got hacked, but only info from the DNC was ever publicly leaked.

On top of that, Donnie-bot had a tendency to get friendly with Putin, and because Donnie's basically holds away over the majority of their voting base at the time (and still do), they feel they can't step out of line without either a). Having said kompromat leaked or b). Pissing off the Donnie demographic.

In short- they've been digging this hole for years and are in too deep that they can't afford to reverse course.

That, plus during the Trump years, a lot of the GOP realized just how much bullshit they could get away with, so their emulating the whole authoritarian bent because it appeals to them.  So it's that, too.  Add to that decades of brainwashing by sources like Fox and OANN, and you have a large subset of the U.S. populace that quite literally are for or against *anything* at all solely because some talking head on the t.v. told them it's the latest thing they're supposed to be outraged about.",False,1645649507.0,t3_szoahq,t1_hy5bfr4,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

My bet is that he's using all of these threats and the actions taken so far to try and push Ukraine to agree to Minsk2, which *would* give Russia influence in greater Ukrainian foreign policy and therefore likely keep the out of NATO.

2. Ukraine does have a small nationalist/neo-nazi faction. You do sometimes see their emblem on Ukraine soldiers uniforms (Azov Battalion) The neonazi party and support is also very small and has zero influence on the government.

B) It also obviously has very little to do with the question of Russia's invasion, given both Putin's outright hyper-nationalistic rationale that he himself declared, and the fact that neo-Nazis and far-righters are also very much intertwined with Russia, their current politics, their military, and their goals.",False,1645648755.0,t3_szoahq,t1_hy56zmh,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Sustained, prolonged sanctions. Cutting Russia off from SWIFT, the global electronic financial transaction system. Permanently kill Nordstream 2. Prohibiting Russian state banks from doing business with any Western institution. Identify every cabinet minister, every member of the Duma, every high-ranking intelligence and security service officer, and the top Russian oligarchs and seize every dollar, franc, pound, and ruble of theirs that is in a Western country.

Put large numbers of NATO Troops in every Eastern and Southeastern European NATO ally, as those countries have requested.  

Increase the supply of military supplies to Ukraine. Contribute financially to Ukrainian stability (maybe even using some of those seized assets.)

- Russia takes Ukraine, the world is mad but it’s just Ukraine so not worth a world war(chance: in my opinion 50:50 at this point)

- Russia decides to take more but needs backup(chance: low) 

- Russia successfully talks China and the Middle East countries into siding with them in a big push against the western world(chance: abysmally low)

- WW3

Otherwise, without China and Middle Eastern countries backing them no situation really ends up in WW3, if Russia for some reason pushes hard into NATO solo it’ll be wiped out in a matter of days, as a nuclear superpower Russia doesn’t have the luxury of acting stupid and the world ignoring them like smaller countries.

Entirely impossible to know. Anyone who acts like they know is full of it.

Everyone world-wide is posturing like they're going to do everything they can to stop Russia but most likely it will take Russia attacking a NATO ally for a real WW3.

Adam Curtiss's 2016 doc *Hypernormalisation* goes into it more, but Vladislav Surkov was the first Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration. He was considered the main ideologist of the Kremlin during Putin's initial ascent to power.

Lifted from their [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov):

>BBC documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis credits Surkov's blend of theater and politics with keeping Putin, and Putin's chosen successors, in power since 2000.

What's even *more fun* is that a group of Ukrainian hackers [leaked Surkov's correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surkov_leaks)with Putin, among others, back in **2016!**

>The emails illustrate **Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine** and the **coordination** of affairs **with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine**.\[89\] The document release included a document sent by Denis Pushilin, **former Chairman of the People's Council of the Donetsk People's Republic**, listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to  6 June 2014.\[87\] It also included a **22-page outline of ""a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev.""**\[90\]

Every last bit of their game is projection. Hacking, leaks, email servers. You name it, you'll find an analog. I mean, it isn't like the previous POTUS got impeached for conditioning defensive armaments to Ukraine over a wild goose chase to find a laptop that didn't exist or anything. /s",False,1645646424.0,t3_szoahq,t1_hy51m1d,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

8fabfe15e451337b8af4e0f12aecb5d3,szoahq,hy5ar27,"Putin is almost 70 and has to start planning for the future and crafting his legacy. In his presidency, essentially every post-Soviet state that hasn't joined NATO has been brought back under Moscow's thumb - Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Belarus, and most of Central Asia. Furthermore, each of these states functions as buffers to put distance between Russia's borders and potential enemies. Besides the Baltic states and Ukraine, Russia only borders its puppets or friendly-enough regimes. The only post-Soviet/non-Nato country to not be brought to heel is Ukraine. Not only have they not been brought under Moscow's control, but in the last eight years, they have actively pushed to integrate with Europe and Nato rather than Russia. 

Putin views this as a threat from a military/strategic perspective and as a threat to his regime's very existence. 

From a military/strategic perspective, Russia's historic military strategy has been one of active defense, taking advantage of the effects of attrition on the enemy and enabled by the incredible distance between its productive regions and the front lines. ""Never invade Russia in the winter"" is a common trope. Ukraine is surrounded on two sides by Russia. From within Ukraine, one can much more easily reach the Russian heartland than from a starting position hundreds of kilometers west in Poland. Keep in mind that the Kremlin views Nato to be an aggressive alliance (purely ludicrous but this is their calculus). This means a NATO-member Ukraine would thus position potential invaders across a huge chunk of Russia's border and within much closer striking distance to their industrial heartland. Furthermore, Crimea - Russia's most important naval base - is currently only accessible via bridge, sea, or air. This is another strategic risk for them, especially if Ukraine joins NATO, and thus another reason in favor of aggression towards Ukraine (in order to secure a land bridge to Crimea).

As for regime existence, a prosperous, democratic, western-aligned Ukraine is a major threat. The histories and cultures of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus are deeply intertwined. Putin's regime wouldn't be able to justify its own existence and behavior to its people in a world where westernized-Ukraine survives and thrives whilst Russia continues to stagnate. My opinion is that this is the real reason underlying Putin's aggression. 

As for why now? 

I think he's sensed an opportunity on the world stage and simply taken it while it's lasted. If you look at his entire reign, there hasn't really been a better time on the world stage or internally than now. In no particular order - pandemic, a new leader in Germany, Macron up for reelection, Brexit, Boris Johnson, and no-clear leader like Merkel in Europe, America's retreat from the world and its simultaneous shift of strategic focus to China,  America's polarization and unrest at home, high commodity prices, and an increasing share of European gas supply coming from Russia. This has given him a disunited, distracted opposition with conflicting objectives. 

His military has had twenty years of operations in Syria, Chechnya, Georgia, Donbas, and elsewhere. This has taken the corrupt, ineffective institution he inherited in the early 2000s and turned it into an unquestionable first-rate military. It is more capable today than at any point in his time in office.

Their economy has spent eight years learning to live with sanctions and the central bank has 2+ years worth of foreign reserves with which they can prop up the value of the Rouble. Sanctions and economic warfare are one of the West's strongest tools and something his government has obviously been exploring ways to mitigate.

And I have no clue if Fox has such coverage but CNN is international and just has the resources.  Anyone seeing other news outlets I would love to hear what they're doing.  Sea landing at Mariupol and Odessa.  18 or more missle salvos in Kyiv mostly directed at airports.  They're doing the standard... knock out air defense capability and go after command and control.

The geography of Russia sucks. Most of their population is in Western Russia around the Volga River Basin and they have faced not one, not two, but three existential threats in the form of invasion from the West. (Napoleon, Kaiser, Hitler) 

Russia has attempted to ""solve"" this security dilemma by pushing their border/sphere of influence as far to the West as they can over the years, especially to the point where they can dominate the Polish funnel (a term for the terrain that dominates Poland and has long been suitable/useful for invading Armies in both directions.)

The MoD released footage of a vehicle-mounted crematorium with room to “evaporate” one human body at a time, which has been seen trailing Russian forces and is expected to follow any troops into Ukraine.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, suggested the use of such a system may be a way for the Kremlin to cover up any future combat losses, fearing a repeat of the criticism at home when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.

Mr Wallace said if Russian forces instigate conflict in Ukraine “we expect to see some of the things they've done previously”.

“Previously they've deployed mobile crematoriums to follow troops around the battlefield, which in anyone's book is chilling.

""If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was mobile crematorium, I'd be deeply, deeply worried.

""It’s a very chilling side effect of how the Russians view their forces and for those of you who served, and being a soldier, knowing that trundling behind you is a way to evaporate you if you are killed in battle probably says everything you need to know about the Russian regime.""

In the footage released by the MoD, Cyrillic text overlaid on the video says the equipment, which was created specifically for the destruction of hazardous biological waste, comes from a St Petersburg company called Tourmaline. The company’s website says it is ‘The Russian Incinerator Company’.

Attempts by The Telegraph to contact the company went unanswered.

Kremlin cover-up

At the time local and international media outlets, human rights groups and local activists reported Russian soldiers were being buried in unmarked graves in a bid to hide the fact they were operating inside Ukraine.

Protest groups, many formed by mothers of missing and dead soldiers, sprang up across Russia, notably in Moscow, rejecting attempts by the authorities to blame deaths on individuals who had wandered across the border.

One group, the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee, blamed Vladimir Putin for violating international law and said Russian military commanders forced soldiers to fight illegally in Ukraine “while mothers receive coffins with their sons, anonymously,” according to the Washington Post.",False,1645648589.0,t3_szoahq,t1_hy56l6e,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows.  If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?""  Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/01/us-military-aid-to-ukraine-a-silver-bullet.html

I wish it were.  But Ukraine's military has real problems with corruption, and has largely failed to modernize, even over the last seven years of US intervention (since 2014).  Corruption in the procurement process, where decision-makers prefer those companies providing kickbacks to the procurement officers (even though the materials are subpar).  Decades of this have left the Ukrainian armed forces behind the curve.

I wager that is part of the reason why Biden is not willing to deploy US troops to Ukraine. 

The US is offering direct transfers of arms, but only those things we're willing to see captured. 

>Since 2014, the United States has provided over $2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, following the Russian annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbass. U.S. assistance to Ukraine has included the provision of trainers, selected defensive systems (such as counter-mortar radars), and more recently, Javelin anti-tank missiles. 

We haven't been sending the large, complex systems that they really need to defend themselves against a large-scale, combined arms assault.  Why?  Because training Ukrainians to operate these systems takes a long time.  We're worried that the weapons systems would fall into the wrong hands, that they would be captured or stolen via espionage... and these cutting edge techs aren't something we want adversaries to have.

Russia has agents in every major city in Ukraine that would rile up the population to beg for the surrender of any defenders. 

>Russia isn't going to use nukes.

>Seriously stop watching Hollywood. If Russia uses nukes they get nuked back.

>Both the Soviets and the US understood that if a war did break out between them neither side would ever dare to use nuclear weapons.

If the US enters the war, the threat of nuclear war goes up drastically. Thats not Hollywood, that's fact. Even if it doesn't go nuclear, there is little support in the US for entering any conflict right now, let alone potentially the largest one since WW2. We have our own issues that Putin can easily use to distract much of our population and foment unrest over the possibility of a major war... especially if oil and inflation keeps steadily rising without any relief for regular working class and middle class Americans.",False,1645650128.0,t3_szoahq,t1_hy5dhrr,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
