Putin isn't quite the sole-decider we seem to think he is, and as with any political court, there are rivaling factions with their own interests around him.

Edit: Pertinent synopsis–

>The way Russia is governed is often misunderstood. One misconception is that Putin deals with everything himself and that nothing gets decided without him. Another is that Putin’s supposedly omnipotent friends simply run the show in his name. A third line of conventional wisdom maintains that the chieftains of the security services, the so-called siloviki, are in total control of things. None of these explanations is close to reality. There are ample reasons for outsiders to get confused. Part of the problem is the wide discrepancy between the official administrative structure and informal political connections.

Above this price, NA production becomes much more profitable and sustainable, which drastically diminishes OPEC+'s ability to control the market. 

Back in 2014, OPEC+ moved to flood the market to undercut the NA producers - they wanted to cut them off at the knees before they could establish sufficient scale to become a recurring threat no matter the price. [link](www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/business/energy-environment/opec-russia-saudi-arabia-oil-coronavirus.html) Thousands of US and Canadian producers went bust (way over leveraged). OPEC+ *succeeded* in killing NA before it became major player , at great opportunity cost to the member countries as they were flooding the market far beyond the optimal point of demand pricing. 

I cannot possibly imagine MBS and the Saudis will allow North America to once again potentially gain a foothold and establish as a major oil player.  It's the end for them - the US has already moved towards EVs, reducing projected consumption. If the US becomes self sufficient because huge NA o&g cash generation at $300/bbl allowed the shale producers to become profitable by building scale (that they now have the cash to build) , there's no more need for the Saudis at all. 

IMO, I predict the Saudis will step in to keep the price in the low 100s , but that's total speculation.

Russia has documented losses of several hundred vehicles destroyed not just disabled or captured. There will be more not documented.

If they've lost 1000 vehicles and the average number of fatalities in each is 5-10 that gives you already a sizeable chunk of the number we've seen. It's also very difficult with a totally burned out, nothing left wreck to work out how many occupants it had, they are turned to ash. Evidence is that Russian APCs are frequently travelling with more soldiers inside than they are officially rated for.

So you kill a BTR and think that's 7 dead but actually it's 12.

Just give the migs quietly and take US planes in return. Not a fan of how Poland has handled this.

Russian Ambassador

1. Russian Ambassador asks that the UN Council focuses on the ""humanitarian side"" not on the political side, as he's aware of ""differing opinions"".
2. He notes that the Russia is banishing free speech by banning Russian newsmedia.
3. According to the Russian Ambassador, ""Ukrainian Neonazis and Radicals are bombing Ukrainian Civilians, not Russians."" But humanitarian corridors are not an issue for Russia. Russia was prepared to provide assistance for those evacuating - Russia heard from an intercepted radio sequence that ""Ukrainian Radicals"" wanted to shot those who wanted to leave in the legs. People trying to leave were shot by Ukrainian Nazis. They have evidence to that effect. *\*\*Comment: Ok, where is this evidence? No idea, was never mentioned in the speech... so no evidence?* 🤷\*.\*\*\*
4. According to the Russian Ambassador, Ukraine put a ""firing site""? in the maternity ward of some hospital.
5. The issue of humanitarian assistance is politized. Some people didn't want to be evacuated, they were safe in their houses. In some cities, the population there can live peacefully since the Russia are providing humanitarian aid.
6. Ukraine is using foreigners as human shields - Russia working with foreign agencies to help them.
7. Russian Ambassador complains that antirocket launcher is used from residential areas. He states that using civilians as human shields is immoral. He claims that, in Odessa, it has been observed that weaponry has been placed in sites of cultural heritage --> violation of Code XX?
8. The showcasing of prisoners on social media is against human rights, article XX.
9. If you (the UN council) doesn't acknowledge this, you will encourage Ukrainian Neonazis and Radicals.

While Western sanctions include exemptions for the energy trade, executing such transactions without running afoul of some other restriction in the process is a tricky, time-consuming business.

UN Council, 7/3/22

**Representative of Ukraine - Summary - all mistakes are mine - his opinion, not mine.**

We're 12 days from the invasion, an act that brought us on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. I would like to thank all the countries that have accepted refugees.

In Sachsenhausen, in Germany, in 1939, a building was built. The gas chamber was added in 1943. The Nazis named it Station Z - Z is the letter that Russian military is putting on their military departing for Ukraine.

Some interpret Z as Russian for Victory, as Russian for West. I would insist that it's Z for animals, or rather beast in English.

Russia continues to ignore international norms. Russia continues to ignore humanitarian corridors and doesn't provide international organisations access. They open fire on those leaving the areas - e.g. blowing up trains to prevent evacuations by trains, fired on a bus.

As the minister of X said ""Russia have again prevented the evacuation of refuges from \*lists them all\*. They prevent the evacuation and delivery of humanitarian aid and food.""

Today, the hearings in the genocide case at the ICJ have began. We have appealed to the Court to ask Russia fully stop the bloodshed today. We condemn Russia's unwillingness to implement the UN's resolution which condemns Russia's actions. Russia must stop violating the ceasefire regimes designed to allow civilians to escape. We are prepared to uphold it. Russia should also not force Ukrainian civilians to escape to Russia or to Belarus, to be used as hostages or human shields. It's hypocritical when then European borders are wide open.

Ukraine calls on the European member states to enforce Russia to have a ceasefire so that Ukrainians can escape.

Another appalling example has taken place - according to available information, Russia has now undermined arrangements for humanitarian corridors. Despite a road through XX already agreed, Russia has now sent us a list of roads to Russia and Belarus only. I call on Russia to reverse this decision and allow the Ukrainians to escape to Europe.

Other parts, its a humanitarian disaster. These Ukrainians have not access to water, food, electricity. ...

Ukraine has been one of the guarantors of food so far. This has been challenged, and will have global consequences.

55% of sunflower oil comes from Ukraine.60% of Ukrainian flour comes through sea harbours.

Protecting Ukraine also protects the world from hunger.

Ukraine is also facing a health crisis. We are speaking of 1000 of Russian bodies decomposing in Ukrainian fields. We are calling on the ICC to set up a database to determine the identity of the Russian occupiers and help bring them back to Russia.

1000 children have been deprived of their education. Maternity wards has been moved to basements. Food supplies are running low. The airport of ? has been destroyed - this airport was supposed to be a hub to receive humanitarian aid.

Lists the number of kids that were wounded. Through the ongoing shelling, this number might be greater.

Ukraine regrets that Citizens from China, India, Parkistan and others are in Ukraine. We are in contact with their governments and we are doing everything possible to help them get back to their countries. We have never done anything to hinder them. The only roadblock is the armed aggression of Russia, which is preventing the safe escape of Ukrainians and foreigners.

Despite enemy attacks, all our systems are attacked. All pensions have been paid. The government has prepared an assistance programm for those who have lost their job. We will provide food, fuel and service. We will address the most pressing needs of people.

The people in Ukraine require actions to save their lives. The fragility of this situation reaches beyond Ukraine, into Europe. **Before I conclude, one of my colleagues said that the UN security council looks like group therapy - everyone here is trying to bring one member back to sanity. ...**

**Meetings are difficult when you listen to the delirium coming from this particular member.**

**Particularly ""funny"" was this tweet today - Ambassador holds up a tweet by Lavrov. ""We \[Russia\] are having a military operation in Ukraine to prevent a war in Ukraine.""**

**I would like to point out that in London, in case of a mental health crisis, you can dial 111 NHS. Thank you.""**

**The Russian Representative is asking for the floor.**  
**His rebuttal:** 

""The Ukraine Ambassador said that ""Z"" stands for animals. We have our opinions on who the animals are - the Ukrainian military who have been terrorizing those in Donbass. We are accused of breaking up the humanitarian corridors, but it's the Ukrainians who are doing this. Ukrainians are holding them hostage, as human shield.They were bombarding their citizens - this is all available. ...

According to telegramm, the Russian party says once again that at 8 o'clock tomorrow, to carry out a ceasefire to allow citizens to escape. This proposals doesn't have any demands on the citizens being sent to Russia. It will be the choice of the people where they would like to be evacuated.

I would like to know: How is the Ukrainian Ambassador so familiar with the professionals who deal with Mental Health? Thank you.""

>can you people explain to me why its wrong to criticize the racist treatment of African students fleeing Ukraine. are you telling me the reporting is false and this isn't happening? US news agencies are reporting this. I'm not getting this information from RT.

This was a comment which has since been deleted. My response is below. 

So, my view is as follows. This issue has already been discussed a great deal over the previous 12 days. Given that it seems (at most) to be a few isolated incidences this appears a little disproportionate given the other stuff going on (largely the bombing, fighting and civilian casualties which, in contrast,  are not isolated incidents). 

You also should appreciate that stuff like this is propagated by russian or other bad actors. The reason being that it triggers (quite rightly) most normal thinking western individuals. Bad actors use this to deflect from other issues which they may prefer to try to brush under the carpet. Some well intentioned individuals start to concur or spread the talking point around and then suddenly it's being parroted by credible sources. The Russians term those people 'useful idiots' (no joke, look it up).

I think that people are not taking to your comments because it's already been discussed at length. The incidents have been shown to be minor, concrete evidence of systemic racism has not been identified as of yet and the issue as a talking point may have been furthered by russian bad actors to distract. Whilst I'm sure your intentions are good, perhaps it's worth considering whether you may have been inadvertently swept up in something. 

That's my stance. I caveat this on the basis that if racism can be shown to be a systemic  issue at borders then I am happy to change my view. That's because racism is unacceptable wherever it occurs. However I cannot simply allow the discussion to be sidetracked where the issue is isolated and/or has been amplified for cynical reasons. 

Everything I have seen suggests this may have just been an attempt to dissuade other, more damaging, discussion.",1646684786.0,1646684022.0,t3_t8x1og,t3_t8x1og,,0,60,0,60,0,0,

a710dcfad41a65ee13cde5468f92dd0d,t8x1og,hzrfofl,"#Russia threatens Nord Stream 1 supplies 

(Bloomberg) --Russia threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as part of its response to sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine, a move that could heighten the turmoil in energy markets and drive consumer prices even higher.
Russia has the right to take actions that “mirror” the penalties imposed on the Russian economy, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak -- who’s also in charge of energy affairs -- said in a televised speech late Monday. He said no decision to shut off Nord Stream 1 has yet been taken, and the pipeline is currently operating “at its full capacity.” 

The comments come after a day of wild swings on European gas markets, with prices at one point surging by almost 80% amid fear of disruption to supplies from Russia. 

Europe’s reliance on Russian energy has been a key factor in efforts by the continent’s leaders to agree on how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. Last month, Berlin shelved the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, and European Union officials say they’re working on a plan that could cut the bloc’s import needs from Russia by almost 80% this year.

But many EU politicians remain wary of immediate action, one reason why Germany has pushed back against proposals for a ban on oil imports. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday that Russian oil and gas are of “essential importance” to the European economy. Roughly 40% of EU gas imports and one quarter of its oil come from Russia. 

Novak said that Russia has other options for selling its oil if the U.S. and EU ban Russian imports, and he warned that any such move could have “catastrophic consequences for the world market” with prices surging to $300 a barrel or more.",False,1646691639.0,t3_t8x1og,t3_t8x1og,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

9656106e7d5f5648a546a767c865b989,t8x1og,hzr22gh,"How to Spot a Troll, and Why It Matters:

It is important to call out trolls here, both alt right and Russian/state actors, because they knowingly push conversations in directions that amplify fear, despair, and indecision. They seek to drive wedges between people and stoke division in order to make you - yes, you, the person reading this comment right now - stop thinking clearly and react out of those same negative emotions. Some of what this can accomplish includes creating the feeling that reality is ambiguous and unknowable (demonstrably untrue), that “both sides are as bad as each other” (a common Soviet-era propaganda tactic to soften criticisms of their crimes), and to make you suffer enough that you give up or tune out entirely. All of this achieves their goals of advancing their agenda of paralyzing their enemies(us), causing their suffering (which is both a means and an end), and leaving us more suggestible and prone to groupthink and excessive identification with “our side”.

Be careful that you know what you’re looking out for when it comes to identifying a troll. Here is a video series that really breaks down what they do (warning: it’s a sizable time commitment, but totally worth it): https://youtu.be/4xGawJIseNY

Here are some pointers:

A Russian shill will post according to Russian time zones. Generally speaking, they’ll make a provocative claim that they do not bother backing up. Their intention is to introduce ideas and arguments into the public discourse that stoke fear, raise doubts, and create a sense of general paralysis. Generally but not always, they’ll have noticeably weak English and leap for the low hanging fruit of ad hominem attacks quickly (see below).

In contrast, an alt right troll will likely be someone doing this for fun or to “own the libs”, and will have a largely cohesive account. This is a game to them; it’s how they prove their superiority over everyone else. It’s out of both malice and the belief that advancing the goals of white supremacy and hate are worthwhile(see the videos above for how regular malcontents are conditioned into true antisemites/fascists). They’ll employ explicitly bad faith logical fallacies such as:

The ad hominem, where they attack the person in question when they can’t dismantle their argument: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem

The straw man, where they recast the logic of the other person in question into something easier to dismiss and often not actually related to what they’re saying: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

A red herring, where they attempt to shift discourse away from important points to ones that are not and likely also divisive: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring

There are two that I’ve seen become more common recently that deserve mention. The first is what I’d call the “Just Asking Questions!” approach. It is identical to Cartman’s antics in the Smurf episode of South Park: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Smurfs . A leading question is posed in such a way that it strongly suggests a certain answer that somehow contradicts what is going on, or is irrelevant to the live thread a la the red herring above. It can be anything from, “How do you think this would be different with Trump as President?” to, “Why do you Americans hate Russians so much?” to, “What are you guys eating for dinner?” to even, “How can we know this is really happening?”

The last question is the initial step of what I term the escape into solipsism. First, the troll poses a question of the “Just Asking Questions!” style that directly contradicts something easily proven, like Russia shelling civilians. “How do we know it was the Russians? Maybe Ukraine was doing it to pin it on them!!” Engaging with this line of rhetoric is especially dangerous, as without a strong background in logic you’ll be shut down: after all, we can’t be completely sure given we didn’t experience it directly. However, the truth of the matter is that we have multiple credible sources of information, including live footage *of a family being slaughtered as their dog screams in terror*. Given that many of those outlets have a very high rating for factual reporting (look up the source here: https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ ), we can conclude with confidence that they are in fact sharing the truth. Further, those outlets would show their bias in the wording of headlines and the articles themselves, not outright lies. Something as simple as, “Russians are shelling civilians,” lacks the subtlety necessary for such linguistic nonsense.

At the core, a troll seeks to create a sense of unreality by claiming objective reality can’t really be known, stoke division with bad faith arguments and identity politics, and to make refuting them exhausting for both the observer and individual countering them. They do not argue in good faith, and will consistently try to push the burden of proof onto the other person when they make outrageous claims.

Do not accuse someone of being a troll just for expressing an opinion if they are presenting a logical argument or overwhelmed by emotion. These people will engage if you try with them. Those that don’t are the ones you need to be concerned about.

When you think you have a troll, double check their post history. If similar divisive and/or bad faith comments are common, it’s time to name them explicitly. Do not argue beyond an initial refuting of their position. Do not get drawn into an argument where they hope to find a single thread they can pull at to dismantle you and your point. Mocking their logic similarly makes it seem like just another internet argument between two equally wrong people. Once you refute their initial logic, what I like to say is, “This is a troll. Name, shame, and move on. They want to draw you in to make disputing them exhausting for you and the people who see it.” This is based on successful disinformation tactics employed in Eastern Europe - it works.

Breath deep. We can choose to be a community that works together and supports Ukraine and each other. It is, quite literally, under attack, and will require effort and awareness on all of our parts to maintain and support. We are all emotional because we care.

Don’t let the people stoking outrage and hate blind you to what matters here.

Russian Invasion Revives World War II Memories for Ukraine

Zelensky uses Soviet-era terms to extol bravery as Ukraine faces an assault unlike any in Europe since the 1940s

> “The war that Russia conducts here is not a 21st century war but very much a 20th century one,” said Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov, who writes in Russian. “Tanks, bombardments, the destruction of cities. The style of war is the same as in World War II, and so it is logical that people have begun to use the same terms. Today, the Russians are the fascists, and we are the ones defending our homeland.”
> 
> Casualties, so far at least, aren’t comparable to the horrors of the 1940s, when Nazi conquests were followed by the Holocaust. But President Volodymyr Zelensky, a Jewish grandson of a Soviet World War II veteran, has already resurrected the old Soviet practice of bestowing the title of hero-city on towns and cities that ferociously resisted foreign invaders. This weekend he gave the title to Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Volnovakha and Hostomel, whose mayor was executed by the Russians.

Interesting thing about the Soviet-Finnish War(Winter War) is that some historians believe the USSR intended to conquer all of Finland, to set up a puppet regime. 

The Soviets suffered extremely heavy casualties in the span of 103 days, around 350,000 dead,missing or wounded soldiers. Finland suffered around 70,000 casualties.


Anyway long story short, they signed a peace treaty in Moscow, resulting in Finland giving up 9% of its territory. Finland also lost 30% of its economic assets relative to pre-war conditions. Twelve percent of Finland's population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes.




As for the current war, Zelenskyy is going into negotiations and refusing to acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory. Eventually though, he'll have to acknowledge it.  Same thing with the so-called ""independence"" of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Personally I wish there was another realistic way out of this conflict, but sometimes a golden bridge is needed for an enemy to retreat across. Putin gets a win for domestic audiences, and Zelenskyy prevents a longer drawn out war.

[Why Sanctions Too Often Fail
](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-sanctions-too-often-fail)

> Sanctions generate meaningful change only about forty per cent of the time. Years of sanctions failed in North Korea, Venezuela, and Iraq. Cuba has faced layers of U.S. trade and arms embargoes since 1960. The Communist regime is still in power. The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, faced multiple sanctions for his brutal repression after the Arab Spring uprising, in 2011, turned into a civil war. Hundreds of thousands have died, yet Assad is still firmly entrenched in Damascus. Sanctions are often sagas. Success in South Africa took three decades. The Iran model, which the U.S. has invoked for Russia, has had gyrating effects. Sanctions also produce heartbreak. The agony is the differential in timing. A gun, shell, or bomb can kill in seconds. Sanctions take a comparative eon in the scheme of war or a humanitarian crisis. “They rarely work,” Benn Steil, of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “But, when they do work, they tend to take a very long time.”
> 
> The main flaws are usually the exemptions, known as carve-outs, that provide financial lifelines. Humanitarian goods—food, medical equipment, education materials—are generally exempt. But enforcement of sanctions on everything else is up to individual nations, which can amend or bend the rules for their own economic needs. In 1966, the U.N. for the first time issued sanctions that sought regime change after Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, declared independence from Britain to preserve white-minority rule. The Security Council imposed an economic embargo on Rhodesia, but only on ninety per cent of the country’s exports. For years, the U.S. Congress approved an additional carve-out that allowed the import of Rhodesian chromium, a key component in American jet engines, cars, and stainless steel. (Rhodesia was then one of three major world suppliers; the Soviet Union was another.) It took more than a decade—of civil war and sanctions—for the Rhodesian regime to cede power to a democratically elected government. Along the way, some twenty thousand died.
> 
> Russia benefits from a similar carve-out—for now. Western sanctions allow it to keep selling energy, the largest source of Moscow’s revenues. Last year, Russia earned a hundred and nineteen billion dollars from oil-and-gas sales—when the price averaged only sixty-nine dollars a barrel. This month, prices soared to a hundred and fifteen dollars a barrel. Even if the West, under mounting pressure, does opt to sanction Russian energy resources, it could backfire—creating an oil crisis in the West and driving up prices globally, while Russia simply switches to other buyers. (Many countries, notably China, have not cut off trade with Russia.)
> 
> South Africa, during the era of racial apartheid, was widely considered a rare sanctions success story, Steil told me. In 1962, a resolution by the U.N. General Assembly called on member states to sever all diplomatic, military, and economic ties. Yet carve-outs in subsequent international sanctions again diluted their effect. International sanctions excluded “strategic materials,” as well as coal, diamonds, and some forms of gold, which South Africa produced in abundance. As a result, sanctions had minimal impact on the daily life of ruling whites. Over time, South Africa became more self-sufficient. Facing an embargo on energy imports, it developed a world-class system to make oil from coal. Once dependent on arms imports, it ramped up production and became a net exporter. And, for all the pressure and cut-offs, South Africa was still able to develop its first nuclear device in 1982, and by 1989 it had six bombs. The white government finally released Nelson Mandela in 1990. Amid tectonic global political shifts, apartheid ended—three decades after the first sanctions.

So Russia isn't about to change its ways. We're in for the long haul here. It's important to be realistic about how slowly this can progress.",1646689951.0,1646689734.0,t3_t8x1og,t3_t8x1og,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

Russians are making advances in the East, but I think the Ukrainians are trading space for time in the East, while they crush the Kyiv invasion, since sustaining a fight in the East is easier for Russian than the Ukraine due to the need to supply across Ukraine.

I think the strategy is Ukraine is defending three cities to the death. Kyiv, Odessa, and Lviv. Kyiv is the centerpiece now, given it was the target of the main thrust out of Belarus and it is so close to the border.  If Russia is truly preparing a big push for this week to take Kyiv, I think that is a recipe for horrendous losses against prepared defenses. After that, the Russians will be on the back foot and it would be a perfect time for a Stalingrad style counteroffensive that traps the invaders and forces a mass surrender.

Lviv is key because it must be the center point for Ukraines defense in the war, since it’s much closer to the EU border and isn’t under threat from ground forces. All the supplies are probably running through Lviv and that will be the backup government location in case Kyiv falls (which I think is extremely unlikely) at this point.

By the summer, all off the new troops (returning Ukrainians, drafted Ukrainians in the West, and the Foreign Legion) will be integrated into the military and ready to fully participate. It is possible that this Army will outnumber the Russians as well as being fresh, better equipped, better trained, and motivated. This is a recipe for complete defeat for the Russians.

The worst part is that Kharkiv and Mariupol will take the brunt of the war, and there isn’t much Ukraine can do about it now. They need time to build up a reserve for a counteroffensive in the summer when the land drys out and mobile warfare will be possible.

This is a big problem for most of the west. A lack of honesty about Russia's motivations and the very real problems the country has to instead paint a simple picture of a brutal man waging a brutal war. 

In simplest terms, Russia is dying. The longer Putin waited to take military action the weaker Russia becomes. 

What do I mean when I say Russia is dying? Population Demographics. 

Russia's population is dying and not being replaced. Too many old, not enough young, and the young they do have are griped by generational poverty, substance abuse and other issues indicative of a society that has rotted out almost completely leaving the people who live there without any hope. 

To resolve this issue, Putin wants to acquire new territory and therefore new citizenry for Russia in places that have more productive value and a less stagnant population.. People who actually had a chance to make something for themselves and their country without it all being taken away by a Kleptocratic Oligarchy that came to be in Russia after the fall of the USSR. 

In no way am I condoning anything Putin is doing. But people need to at least have an idea of what his motivations are. 

Part of this is a long time coming. The western world did not do enough to try and fold Russia into the international order after the fall of the USSR. There would've been resistance from Russia for sure, but it would've been so much better if we had actually *tried* to help them establish a proper government instead of just leaving the people to fend for themselves while high ranking insiders swept up everything they could in the power vacuum in 1991.",False,1646693133.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzrh2bh,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

 >The International Brigades (Spanish: Brigadas Internacionales) were military units set up by the Communist International to assist the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. The organization existed for two years, from 1936 until 1938. It is estimated that during the entire war, between 40,000 and 59,000 members served in the International Brigades, including 15,000 who died in combat.

But I'd say: Bomb ALL the locomotives. 

Locomotives are in limited supply, and when they're all broken, they have to scramble to replace them, and they have to keep them maintained.  This will cause more havoc than simply sabotaging track, which is easily replaced and repaired.

Bombing junctions (like at the entrance to a switching yard) may be more complicated to fix, and can also have big side-effects as far as jamming up switching and routing of cars for many multiple deliveries.

I also posted elsewhere that there are probably vulnerable sections of track - where track transits very steep grades (think: along steep river gorges), if you can cause a landslide that takes out a section of track, it can often require a MAJOR engineering undertaking to replace that section of track, and it may not even be feasible to route around it.

That doesn't mean that the disparity in support is caused by racism. 

Several factors: In other conflicts, the leaders of those nations were not courageous, democratic and charming. Zelenskyy himself has caused this phenomena by making clear that aid is welcomed, appreciated and will reach the populace. There's high faith that he cares and he personally is staking his life on this conflict.

In other conflicts - imagine Syria here or Rwanda or any other nation that might appear to be white people not caring about people of color - there was no path to direct assistance that was effective. Aid organizations themselves would set ratings that informed people that donation meant that the Syrian or Rwandan borders were not allowing in aid. Anything sent was likely to be seized and used to kill people rather than help them. The paths to genuine humanitarian aid were blocked.

The answer is more complicated than ""lol Americanz r dum dum""

News in the U.S. is a business, it is focused on the next big story and the war is almost two weeks old now, it no longer has the immediate  pull that it did when Russia first invaded. They want to report news that people want to know about. So, news outlets continue their coverage of the fighting on page 2 while focusing on reporting new stories that are more relevant to the day to day lives of the average American citizen.

Some people aren’t as understanding and are already complaining. For other people, this will literally make them unable to go to work and have enough left to buy food.

&#x200B;

Gas prices are a hot topic on a local and national scale and allow the elite to frame the war as being about something its not for domestic consideration.  Talking about the price of gas draws bigger ratings than a war we don't have a direct stake in, other than said gas prices.  If it was American troops kicking ass, it would be all over the TV for both the propaganda hit (USA #1) but also easy local interest (this soldier is from this town and here are the locals celebrating his ass kicking)

&#x200B;

So long and short that is why you will hear more about gas prices on your local (USA) television news.

Last shop has not been active on Instagram for a bit, which given the invasion and the reports coming out of Ukraine is a bit worrying for me, ngl, but there's enough on their Instagram to suggest they're genuinely a small business owner from Ukraine.

We're approaching the time frame that, if intelligence leaks are to be believed, Russia expected to have this whole thing wrapped up - meaning the government in Kyiv deposed, the Ukrainian military laying down their arms, and Southern Ukraine conquered and joined with the Donbass.

They have not accomplished any one of their goals, have experienced heavy personnel and equipment losses, and have yet to occupy any of Ukraine's largest cities, including the critical cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the South.

Even US intelligence was announcing not long ago that they expected the capital to fall within a few days of the main invasion force taking up residence in Chernobyl. That has not happened either.

But Ukraine remains outnumbered and outgunned. Russia has had logistical difficulties that have made the ""outgunned"" part not very operative at the moment, but eventually they will sort them out. Ukraine's strategy here is to delay, delay, delay and impose costs on Russia. Russia can't keep this up forever. Their currency is crashing, their stock market is frozen, they've become radioactive to western (incl. Japan and South Korea) international business. If domestic support flags, and the people become too restive, the campaign will collapse.

This is why the Russians have adjusted their tactics to more aggressive bombing of cities - to try to force the issue of a rapid political settlement or otherwise break Ukrainian resistance.

And the Russians are still advancing on multiple fronts, even though they are mostly situated on road networks and appear overextended leading to logistical issues.

All that said, we mustn't write Russia off.

Mariupol is completely surrounded and Odessa is taking a beating.

Given Putin's stance on the world stage, as well as his geographic location in relation to unfriendly forces, his offensive ability is significantly less than his total operational strength. Based on what's been published by news sources, he can probably stand to lose roughly 25% of his current equipment and nearly 60% of his current enlisted personnel before Russia begins to fall in to a state of military vulnerability. The reason for the difference in manpower vs equipment is simple... He can conscript more people from the population very quickly. However, his ability to replinish equipment and munitions is effectively non-existent as long as he remains cut off to the vast majority of the world. China COULD assist them in this arena, but likely wouldn't even consider it unless there is a direct invasion of Russia itself. Given enough time, Russia will be unable to continue this invasion of Ukraine due to equipment loss.

The best estimates right now are between 7,000-10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed.  Casualties are usually 3x that number in war, so the Russians have lost 28,000-40,000 soldiers from the fight in Ukraine.

Only planes that the operator wants you to see. When shit gets real, they'll turn off their transponders and you won't see them on Flightradar anymore.

Military aircraft close to a combat area with their transponder turned on are mostly a show of force. It shouts ""Look at us, we're here and not hiding it"".

> but is there anything like flighttracker for submarines?

There are sites to track ship movements, but submarines won't ever register on those. Their entire purpose is to remain hidden as long as possible. Not just from tracking websites, but also from other forms of detection.

1. Russia is a global super power and it invaded a sovereign European nation. This represents a huge threat to Europe and to America who has long viewed Russia as an existential threat.

2. Russia is a nuclear power - the largest in the world. Lots of people are really concerned that nuclear weapons could be used as this escalates. 

3. Russia has a lot of economic power and is tied up into the economies and trade of many countries. Conflict in Russia and Ukraine impacts the global economy far more than Yemen and Syria. 

This doesn't mean that what's happening in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, and other middle eastern nations isn't also massively problematic from a humanitarian perspective.

The subtitle recommends its ""usability in case of cold war, hot war and lukewarm war"" (Utilisables en cas de guerre froide, chaude ou tiède). The ten ""commandments"" of propaganda which Anne Morelli elaborates in this work are, above all, an analytical framework for pedagogical purposes and for media analysis.

I imagine that after this debacle europe will work to become less dependent on a single source of energy even if they can't immediately cut off russia. there are alot of things that can effect the impact of cutting out russian oil... there isn't an easy answer on what will happen given all the moving parts.
Some things to keep in mind. Estimates that say gas could reach 10 dollars a gallon could in theory happen but it would only be short term. Oil fields are developed based on the cost of getting to that oil. My company had tons of fields simply labeled by what the expected cost was. For example a shale rig may be 60 dollars a barrel. A undersea field may be 90 dollars a barrel. A field in Saudi Arabia may be 30 dollars a barrel. Lets say russia is at 33 dollars a barrel on average cost.  If they suddenly remove their supply it doesn't mean there is a permanent loss. It means that other fields suddenly become viable. This does increase costs but it won't be terrible in the long run I believe. On the flip side this has the chance of creating more of a u.s. market. 10 years ago when oil prices were higher the u.s. domestic oil drilling was much bigger but countries like russia intentionaly increase production, reduced costs in the attempt to remove higher cost oil producers from the market and increase their market share.

The problem with europe is that they don't have the infrastructure to easily switch to something other than russian gas. You need ports that can take oil. You need an increase in tankers to transport oil. Etc.",1646687146.0,1646686950.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzqzqsy,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Yep, and honestly he's getting a fantastic deal here. He didn't have those regions to begin with, and short of getting into a shooting war over it with over Russia, he wasn't going to the them either.

And sure, giving up Crimea means giving up access to oil & gas resources. But on the other hand, again - realistically speaking - had Russia not invaded Ukraine, when were they going to get those? Not in the next ten years for sure. And after that, how much are oil and gas going to be worth anyway? In the meantime, by agreeing to these terms, he can save thousands of lives and a shit ton infrastructure damage. He's basically assured the ascension to EU citizenship anyway, and he *knows* he has to give Putin *something* to save face. If Putin is signalling he's happy to take *that which he already had* fuck me that is a really good deal.

Only point of contention might be what the Russians mean with ""neutrality"". As long as that doesn't preclude EU membership, that ought to be fine.

Metallist-Samara JSC had not produced new engines for a decade when it was given a contract in 2011 to overhaul 26 of the existing engines, by two years later, only four were finished.[20] Ownership and financial concerns hinder the prospects of a new production line; the firm insists it needs a minimum of 20 engines ordered per year but the government is only prepared to pay for 4–6 engines per year.[20][21] A further improved engine has been bench tested and may enter production in 2016 or later.[17]",False,1646684348.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzqvbg6,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

This might have been the case if the West didn't freeze all of their foreign reserves. They have a bunch of gold but no one is going to risk violating sanctions for that and the Russians want their funds in rubles to work around future sanctions. They're forcing corporations to sell off their foreign currencies into the ruble to stave off the bleeding and the ruble is about to free fall in a way that makes its current drop seem like a nice day sledding. 

>The lower classes have already been struggling so it's not going to do much to them.

Except the sanctions are going to affect food imports so the people who can afford it the least are going to have to pay more for the food they can get and there's word of rationing already happening in the country.

They don't have much of a middle class.

Russian efforts to mobilize more manpower can bring more people into Russian combat units, but those people are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated to generate large amounts of new combat power.

Mobilization efforts are likely to start producing diminishing returns as Russia moves through the categories of fully-trained and recently-released reservists into categories of people further removed from their initial military experiences and/or those who will undergo hasty training before deployment to the front lines. Individual replacements for battlefield losses are unlikely to have the same training as their predecessors, and new units or those reinforced by these augmentees will not have undergone unit-level training prior to employment. More units and reservist replacements will likely appear in Ukraine, therefore, but the net effect on Russia’s actual combat capability will likely be small and diminishing.

A declaration of martial law and general mobilization would not overcome the structural challenges of Russia’s hybrid cadre-and-reserves and contract-soldier system. Creating cohesive fighting units cannot be accomplished overnight. Replacing individual combat casualties in Ukraine with recalled reservists who have gone years without military training is unlikely to dramatically increase Russian combat power.

 >The Kuril Islands dispute, known as the Northern Territories dispute in Japan, is a territorial dispute between Japan and the Russian Federation over the ownership of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. The Kuril Islands are a chain of islands that stretch between the Japanese island of Hokkaido at their southern end and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula at their northern end. The islands separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean. The four disputed islands, like other islands in the Kuril chain that are not in dispute, were annexed by the Soviet Union following the Kuril Islands landing operation at the end of World War II.

Unfortunately there seems to be no quick solution to this problem. I think Putin is done for after this, but that doesn't mean things definitely get better. It seems just as reasonable to think that if Putin is deposed it could be - or even is likely to be - by another hard-liner who justifies the move on the basis that Putin is old and tired and no longer capable of achieving Russia's geopolitical agenda, rather than because that agenda is wrong.

But ultimately, yes, we should keep imposing sactions.

It is intended to replace the R-36M ICBM (SS-18 'Satan') in Russia's arsenal. The Sarmat is one of the six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 1 March 2018. The RS-28 Sarmat is expected to make its first test flight in 2022, and enter service later in the year.

Huh? Keystone is up, has been up, and fully functional for years. You may be thinking of the Keystone XL, which is what the political rhetoric gets hyped over. It’s literally just a shortcut for the current pipeline and not a new transport pipeline. The oil from the tar sands of Canada are already and continue to get to the refineries of the gulf coast.

The amount of ignorance, not calling people stupid, but rather amount of people not very informed on the subject, gets very frustrating.

First, the Keystone XL pipeline was first proposed in 2008, before the big surge in domestic production. It was meant to expand the flow from Alberta to Steele City, Neb., but the full route from Alberta to the Gulf Coast has been completed. The issue was not whether oil from Alberta should come into the United States at all but how much. Even without XL, some of what isn’t transported by the existing pipeline is shipped by rail — undercutting the argument from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) about what’s being excluded from the marketplace.  
  
Second, imports of crude oil from Canada have doubled since the beginning of 2008 — even without the expanded pipeline. Imports of crude oil and other products have increased by 80 percent.  
  
Third, not all of the oil flowing into the United States was going to be refined and sold here. Much of the oil from Alberta was intended to go to the Gulf Coast, where there’s a lot of refining capacity. But part of the plan was also to then ship refined oil out of the country through the Gulf of Mexico. (About two-thirds of refined products on the Gulf Coast are exported.) In 2017, the Trump State Department stated that approving Keystone XL would have only a “minimal” effect on the price of refined petroleum products — meaning primarily gasoline — since gas prices are largely driven by “global market factors.”  
  
Fourth, what is extracted in Alberta is tar-sands oil, a particularly heavy oil product. That is not what’s being imported from Russia, so it’s not a one-to-one replacement.  
  
Fifth, there are significant environmental concerns about that particular type of oil. Environmentalists opposed the expansion because tar-sands oil is more carbon-intensive to refine and because it meant building new infrastructure that would facilitate the eventual combustion of the oil. Obama’s initial rejection of the pipeline centered on environmental concerns. When Trump approved it, his plan was quickly halted by the courts, which criticized the administration for ignoring the effects on climate change. It’s not simply a question of “build and get more oil”; it’s also a question of “build and get more oil and exacerbate global warming.”",False,1646686739.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzr1raa,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

There is a magnificent technology called ""The Railroad"" that connects the oilfields in Canada to America. The intended purpose of Keystone XL was to make it cheaper to get Canadian oil to America, but the $40-50 premium rail transit adds still wouldn't put oil at $200 a barrel.

As soon as the economics allow, the oil sands will extract again. But the issue here is not really US supply, since the US only buys 3% of its oil from Russia. The issue is more with Europe's needs. Ideally OPEC will increase their supply before there's a major competitive threat from the North American shale fields. Now of course, to sell North American oil in Europe we'd need to..ship it in tankers across the ocean. 

>doesn't seem like shipping oil in tankers across the ocean is more carbon friendly than a pipe

Well you can look up the realz instead of depending on your feelz. The most vocal concerns were not about the relative emissions from tankers vs a pipeline but about the fact that tanker spills are generally rare and containable today but the Keystone pipeline was [going to cross a fault line and run through the largest wetland in Nebraska and over the Ogalla Aquifer, one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Environmental_concerns) If the XL ruptured in one of those areas it would be an ecological disaster unlike any in the history of North America. There were of course also more general concerns about incentivizing burning more fossil fuels over pushing towards renewable energy, partly because tar sands oil extraction produces more pollution than more traditional extraction approaches. But the concerns about a spill causing a major ecological disaster, and the generally sketchy and dismissive way the oil industry tried to ram the pipeline past those concerns, were probably the bigger driving force towards clamoring for its cancellation.

I also know nothing about pipelines, but it takes maybe two minutes to see how the political banter about this fucking pipeline is not some magic wand right now—or was it ever going to be. Working with other countries who have the oil infrastructure capabilities is the right path in the short term, which I believe is being worked on as we speak.

The US uses like 20 million barrels of oil per day. If the Keystone XL was completed *and* people's land were taken/sold after all of the lawsuits, it would only add like half a million barrels a day. I won't even touch the environmental concern and liability it would pose.

> If completed, the Keystone XL would have added 510,000 barrels (81,000 m3) per day increasing the total capacity up to 1.1 million barrels (170,000 m3) per day.[29]

I'm no math expert, but 0.5 out of 20 is like 2%. And that's assuming nothing gets exported outside of the US.

Also.

> On June 9, 2021, the Keystone XL project was abandoned by its developer.[22][23] At the time of the project's cancellation, approximately 8% of the pipeline had been constructed.[99]

Correct me if I'm wrong, but 8% less than a year ago does not sound like much would have been ready for a project that spans the entire US.

This isn't like running a long straight pipe and plugging it in. We're also up against capitalism and it's diamond-hard bias towards profit over humanitarian needs.

Another more local example for regular russians working in these businesses - anyone employed at a factory making foreign cars is now out of a job because the plants for Ford, GM, nissan, and others are shutting down production.  The same loss of jobs will be seen in high end retail stores that are no longer willing to conduct business in russia.

The biggest reason companies will refuse to do business in russia though is the fact that decreed that all foreign debts owed by russia can be paid in rubles to a russian bank account which means that companies are being paid a fraction of what they owe AND have no easy means to even get that money out of russia.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Why are you here? Are you here to make sure everyone know they can Google stuff themselves. Are you trying to take some of the load off of the thread, and redirect people to Google? Perhaps to make it easier on the mods in here I am sure.

Or is your life so boring and uneventful that you are so annoyed with it so you go out and argue with people on Reddit for asking a simple question.

I’ve never defaulted on anything. I know what default it, but I’ve never gone through it and I god honest did not know that a country like Russia could default. I didn’t know if default meant something else entirely to a country, I knew it was bad. I knew that a country probably doesn’t want to default.

So when I saw the news that Morgan Stanley predicted russia could default by April, I thought to ask to pick the brains of some of the brilliant minds that we have following along on the thread.

Yes, I could have googled it, and my search inquiries are full of random stuff like that. Normally I would have googled it, but I happened to be in the middle of something at that moment so thought I’d ask because maybe I could get the answer before I could do a Google search.

If I got no replies, Google would have certainly been my next move. I promise you, I would have googled it.

I almost regret not waiting and going straight to Google myself so that I would not have had to disappoint you today. But from the bottom of my heart……

Ryan, I truly apologize for asking this question on the Reddit comments instead of googling it myself.

Further Ryan, I am so sorry that this upset you so much that you felt the need to put me in my place, me, an ignorant person who had the audacity to ask a question on Reddit.

Ryan, it won’t happen again. I am sorry that this upset you so much and because of you I have learned my lesson. A valuable life lesson, and that is, don’t ask any questions on Reddit that you could easily Google yourself.

I am so glad you were here at that moment, any sooner or any later and you would have missed me. This was fate, you just happened to be at the right place at the right time. And I thank the Reddit gods for that.

What do you think the odds are that we faced? The odds of me writing a comment and you seeing it?

OH! There I go again, I suppose that is also something I could Google myself, I’m sure the data is there to be discovered and analyzed.

I think they can actually put the logistics and hardware in place to be combat effective, but I think that killer instinct, controlled aggression, initiative (meaning, actual trust from leadership) and tactical awareness that democratic militaries are able to cultivate in their troops might not quite be there for the average Chinese baggie.

Most of our effectiveness as individual fighting soldiers appears to be the result of trust and downwards delegation - in authoritarian regimes, this is impossible, because they *inherently* do not trust educated (i.e. ideologically influenceable) junior officers and personnel to make their own decisions in support of the bigger picture. Low trust societies and militaries are inherently less effective and self-sabotaging in organised warfare. Often because, as seen in this war, the bosses hide the bigger picture from the lads on the ground.

I've heard the Chinese commit huge amounts of their training time to ideological training, so whatever percentage of training time they're wasting on that, is a percentage given to us in terms of combat effectiveness.

This could also of course be deliberate Chinese counter-intelligence, but seeing the crassness of their foreign ministry's English statements, I highly doubt it's that sophisticated. I think they might take a good hard look at their ground forces and their organisation after watching the Russians fall on their bayonets in the mud and implement some reforms, but they're probably going to do this quietly in all honesty.

That, and I think they're realising that you MUST keep your air force flying and trained, because otherwise your massive air force just sits at base waiting for crews, pilots and armaments and not on sorties.

Another guess I have, is that despite corruption definitely being a part of the Chinese government and defence sector, it is likely nowhere near as bad as the Russians are here. They probably just actually skim off the top, rather than wholesale state capture like in Russia or South Africa (man, Jacob Zuma/Putin was a whole team of international grift expertise).",False,1646695152.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzranyh,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Victory Day is a holiday that commemorates the surrender of The Greater German Reich in 1945. It was first inaugurated in the 15 republics of the Soviet Union, following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender late in the evening on 8 May 1945 (after midnight, thus on 9 May Moscow Time). The Soviet government announced the victory early on 9 May after the signing ceremony in Berlin. Although the official inauguration occurred in 1945, the holiday became a non-labor day only in 1965, and only in certain Soviet republics.

Not much really, in the past few days it's been kind of a stand still, admittedly with some minor exceptions in the south. They've been unable to penetrate most strategically held heavily fortified positions, including ones right next to their own border and troop staging areas. Ukraine's even started making some pushes and counter offensives e.g. out of Kharkiv. Remember, the further the Russians extend into Ukraine, the more vulnerable they become, and the more susceptible supply lines become. Especially if they don't leave enough manpower behind to control previously claimed territory, which honestly they've been largely neglecting, and they don't have the numbers for it regardless in a country as large as Ukraine.

Recall that offence is significantly more costly than defence and almost inevitably comes with heavy losses.

\> Let's see where things are 2 months from now.

Russia is on a timer in some sense here. If you look at the way this invasion has been executed, it's fairly obvious they wanted a quick shock and awe campaign culminating in the decapitation of the government in Kiev. This would have likely circumvented some of the heavier sanctions and been much less costly for Moscow. As it stands, this has clearly failed. We are now looking at a prolonged conflict that could indeed extend for months, and in the best of worlds, from a Russian perspective, transition into an insurgency.

Their economy is completely and irrevocably fucked as it is, what will it look like if this extends for years on end, with a highly motivated population of some 40 mil that absolutely HATE their guts? Even if they do eventually proceed to raise Ukraine to the ground with massive losses, I am not sure in which possible sense of the word this would constitute a ""win"".

\> What about Ukraine? It is being destroyed day by day.

While Ukraine is being shelled to bits by unguided munitions, indiscriminate shelling, MLRS and so forth, and it IS an absolute atrocity, this does not necessarily equate or translate to military progress. Ukrainian forces have been falling back and regrouping as cities become overrun, and engaged in more of guerilla warfare type operations with ambushes, small but highly mobile detachments, etc.",False,1646683337.0,t3_t8x1og,t1_hzqrv0z,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

I'm with you in that it's unlikely to go nuclear as in trade of ICBMs (assuming that's what you mean), seems a crazy escalation and pointless. I'm using NATO as shorthand mostly for US/UK/France/Germany's govts rather than naming them every time.

I can conceivably see the use of a tactical nuke on Kyiv, say, to shorten the invasion if the offensive continues to bog down/sufficient equipment was being lost in terms of tanks/aircraft as an alternative to slinking away with tails between legs. On one hand, use of maybe a nerve agent would increase pressure and leave room for further escalation - but equally may be enough to bring in a no fly zone, reducing the likelihood of a successful tactical nuclear strike if it were deemed necessary by the Russians. So a tactical nuke may be preferable and I'd lean on the side of that not triggering MAD.

My point about the distinction between boots on the ground and enforcing a NFZ was more to say, at the point where a no fly zone were to be enforced, in practice the NATO aircraft would either need to withdraw (and it's pointless) or engage (at which point it's war between NATO and Russia so you might as well have boots on the ground).

That’s for oil companies to decide, and they do so based on the cost of a barrel of oil and demand. When demand is low, and prices low, it doesn’t make financial sense to spend money extracting at high costs. It makes more sense to buy cheap oil and let someone else bear the extraction costs. 

Covid caused low prices and low demand, oil extractors cut back significantly and many went out of business because of low prices. And it takes a long time to ramp back up, oil companies are ramping up as fast as they can. 

Oil companies don’t care about your price of gas being low, that’s not how they make money. They are here to serve them and their investors, not bitchy US gas customers.

Reduced from its current level, but the US is not a major purchaser of Russian oil. Depending on who you ask (the white house or the oil industry industry guy I heard on news radio Friday) it's either 3% or just short of 9% of supply. The US actually already committed its intent to stop importing Russian oil today, regardless of what Europe does. Europe relies on Russian oil a *lot* more than the USA does, so moving Canadian oil into the USA for $50/barrel cheaper than we can right now wouldn't do much to change the geopolitical calculus on Russia besides maybe incentivize OPEC to act sooner than they would otherwise. 

As far as pollution, I thought I outlined that pretty well. We aren't going to stop using oil overnight, but there is a bigger cost incentive to renewables than there would be if it was $50/barrel cheaper to bring Canadian oil to the USA, and tar sand extraction and processing causes *more* emissions than traditional approaches. And more important than that, the axis of the environmental debate was not soley emissions.

Yes I hve no empathy while I’m over here wondering why people can’t think of anyone but themselves and how it will only hurt them.

You got worked up and took something I said and made it personal. I highly doubt anyone is going to be homeless over gas prices (which is what we are talking about btw).

I drive a 2010 POS car so I don’t hve a car payment so I can have more money to give my kids a nice house and take them on vacations. I took out a shit ton of student loans so I could go to college. I chose not to have kids until I was able to afford to in a way I wanted to. We budget so we can live off one salary and spend the other. My dad lives in a trailer park. My little sister has to have her phone turned off almost every month so she can make rent. My older sister has so much debt she had to declare bankruptcy to keep her house. So sure, I don’t personally experience financial hardship in this moment in my life but just because I don’t doesn’t mean I don’t understand it.

*Should* we? Absolutely not. *Are* we? At the moment, yes. 

I agree that everything you've said *should be* the case. But I also think that we (NATO) should be directly intervening in Ukraine. And that makes me ask the same question you are, almost: Should we let him hold Ukraine hostage and not Poland?
