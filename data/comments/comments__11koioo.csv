Currently, the defender's body is located in the temporarily occupied territory.

Protesters have taken themselves inside parliament, the President has said she will Veto the law (she is on the Protesters side), riot police are now doing mass arrests, and police are using massive amounts of tear gas and water cannons to clear protesters.

For those who are not in on what is going on; The Pro-Russian ruling party is trying to hammer through a foreign actors law unexpectedly and fast. This, if allowed to become law will be used to supress any organisation or individual that is Pro-Europe. Protesters are certain this comes directly from Moscow)

• Parliament passed the Russian-inspired foreign agents bill on the first hearing.

• Police dispersed thousands of protesters opposing the bill using rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons.

• Molotov cocktails were used against the riot police.

Apparently the reading in of the law (which has to be done multiple times by the look of it), was pushed up to today, unexpected by protesters who were preparing for it Thursday.

Wagner's attacks on Bakmut already culminated once, causing the Russian MoD to commit some of its elite airborne troops to the fight. Wagner may culminate again before taking the city, forcing the Russians to either abandon the effort or throw in additional high-quality troops.

 The opportunity to damage the Wagner Group’s elite elements, along with other elite units if they are committed, in a defensive urban warfare setting where the attrition gradient strongly favors Ukraine is an attractive one.

Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin apparently fears that his forces are being expended in exactly this way.

The severe degradation or destruction of the elite Wagner fighting force would have positive ramifications beyond the battlefield.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 March 2023  


* The Ukrainian defence of Bakhmut continues to degrade forces on both sides. Over the weekend, Ukrainian forces likely stabilised their defensive perimeter following previous Russian advances into the north of the town.  

* A Russian strike destroyed a bridge over the only paved supply road into Bakhmut still under Ukrainian control around 02 March. Muddy conditions are likely hampering Ukrainian resupply efforts as they increasingly resort to using unpaved tracks.  

* Public disagreements between the Wagner Group and Russian Ministry of Defence over the allocation of munitions highlights the difficulty in sustaining the high levels of personnel and ammunition required to advance with their current tactics.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused the US and Ukraine of being behind the drone attack in late February.

His accusation comes despite the attack being claimed by Belarusian anti-government activists, who said they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft near the Belarusian capital Minsk.

Earlier today, the Belarusian news agency Belta reported that Minsk had detained what it called a ""terrorist"" and more than 20 accomplices working with Kyiv and Washington intelligence services over the attempted sabotage (see our 11.24am post).

But Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, has denied the country had any involvement, stating this afternoon: ""It is clear that this is another attempt to create an artificial threat from Ukraine for the sake of justifying [Belarusian] support for Russia's aggression.""

At the beginning of Russia’s invasion, I noted the RU Army was violating every one of the 9 principles of war. 

Now in Bakhmut - w/ a lack of coordination between Prigoyzhin, Shoigu, Gerasimov & Putin - it appears they are especially violating one: Unity of command.

Unity of command describes a unity of effort & unity of purpose that occur when all - govt, people, soldiers, commanders, units - understand what they are trying to achieve & how to do it.                                   Clausewitz called this the Master Principle of War'.

Soldiers thrown into a fight where there is no “unity of purpose” suffer the most when this occurs. 

The opponent - in this case, Ukraine - rejoices, as a lack of unity of command creates enemy dysfunction & countless offensive opportunities.

Taking Bakhmut is necessary but not sufficient for further Russian advances in Donetsk Oblast, and Russian forces have already taken such heavy losses fighting for the city that their attack will very likely culminate after they have secured it—if not before.

This is the remaining 10 of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it had pledged.

""Four [tanks] are already in Ukraine, another 10 will go to Ukraine this week,"" Mr Błaszczak said.

Poland also promised in January to send 60 additional tanks to Ukraine.

Upwards of 300 tanks have been promised to Ukraine from Western allies in total.

Ukraine had urged global powers to provide the vehicles for months, before turning its attention to F-16 jets.

The Russians posted the photos everywhere—I recall bc it was the first time I’d seen the white uniform.  Their remains were returned in February.  They are to be awarded as heroes, and laid to rest with other soldiers.

# 4 Heroes—who worked like a little sabotage-PMC, sabotaging behind enemy lines, and responsible for countless “cottons” and “accidents” in Russia:

> *In Kyiv, on March 7, at 11:30 a.m., the Mykhailivsky Cathedral will say goodbye to the fighters of the sabotage group from the ‘Brotherhood’ battalion, who died on Christmas night in Bryansk region. The bodies of Nepipov, Svatoshi, Tarasia and Apollo were returned to Ukraine on February 22. . . and examined.  Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the petition for awarding the title of ‘Hero of Ukraine’ to the fallen soldiers, which received more than 25,000 votes—he instructed Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to ""comprehensively work out the raised issue.""*

> On December 26, a video with the bodies of the fallen was released by the Russian FSB. They were not ‘production shots’ or propaganda—was indeed the last journey for the combat mission of the group of Yuri (""Saints"") Horovets. **But before that, there had been many other missions, both in occupied Zaporizhzhia, and in the Chernobyl zone, and on the territory of Russia.**

> The *Brotherhood* battalion is a volunteer formation that is **not formally part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Therefore, they can carry out sabotage work—both in the occupied territories and in Russia**. At the same time, our Western partners cannot abandon the Armed Forces [for breaking agreements], for operating outside the borders of Ukraine. 

> **Among the completed successful missions: the capture and liquidation of representatives of the special services and the military, the destruction of weapons warehouses and oil depots, sabotage at airfields and railways, etc. Much of this work is attributed to local guerrillas. But the same explosives for the partisans are delivered by Ukrainian saboteurs**, we was told. Sometimes the result of the work of the battalion's subversive and reconnaissance groups are reports of **planes or rotorcraft that have suddenly ""fallen"" [crashed] on Russian territory**.

> Where information about the location and routes of movement of objects comes from, who supplies the battalion with weapons and explosives, who sets the task [defines the mission]—of course, remains a mystery. [Obviously, it’s the GUR.] But the equipped and armed ""brothers"" are fine [armed]. Thus, on the last mission, the ""Svatoshi"" group, according to the FSB, was armed with SIG Sauer assault rifles and carried four explosive devices with a TNT equivalent of 40 kilograms. At the same time, until recently, they did not even receive a salary, they fought like real Cossacks—at their own expense.

> Where and how many exits the ""Saints"" group made, what was done—currently remains a mystery, as do most episodes of the activities of the *Brotherhood* military personnel. But, they say, they ""raised"" **more than one ""cotton"" in the Kurch region, Bryansk region, and Belgorod region.** Perhaps one day it will be possible to tell about it.

> Those [ammunition shortage] restrictions have Ukrainian combat units struggling to stem the advances of the Wagner group, the private military company that has been leading the Russian offensive to take Bakhmut. Wagner has bolstered its numbers with thousands of **convicts, but its core professionals have proved able fighters**, several Ukrainian commanders who fought them said.

> “We realized they were a worthy adversary,” Major Pantsyrny said. “They have pretty good combat experience; they have motivated personnel.” His battalion was sent to storm Wagner positions at the village of Kodema, south of Bakhmut.

*How Wagner previously made advances:*

> “The enemy would send 20 guys into attack six to seven times a day,” said Oleksandr, a company commander who took part in the assault. “Imagine: Twenty guys come, we kill them. In five minutes, 20 more guys come, we kill them. In an hour, 20 more. They don’t care about men.”

The terrible secret behind all that is, it's a purely mathematical decision. The outcome a war of attrition is decided by the function of each army's strength over time. There are relatively simple equations which output graphs even a Russian general can understand. 

The only variable are the numbers that are plugged into these equations: rate of attrition, friendly and enemy losses per unit of time, and how fast these can be replaced. This can further be broken down into infantry, tanks, vehicles, and so on. 

We hear echoes of these all the time: Russia will run out of X by month Y, Ukraine is losing men at Bakhmut at a ratio of A:B, and so on and so forth. 

It's obvious that all these different actors are plugging in different numbers into these equations, and they're getting wildly different results. The most wildly different are of course between Russia and Ukraine. 

Russia isn't just blindly violent and obsessed. They likely do have charts that show that Russia will win, and we can be certain that they're almost complete bullshit. They don't even count their own dead, so we can be sure they greatly underestimate their own attrition. They also wildly overestimate Ukrainian losses. When they claim more HIMARS launchers destroyed in a month than Ukraine has ever received, that's not just for Solovyov. Gerasimov and the rest of Stavka likely managed to massage the numbers to where it shows that Russia will out-attrition Ukraine eventually. The expectation that NATO supplies to Ukraine will eventually dwindle must be a cornerstone of their projections.

Ukraine on the other hand has their own projections, likely a lot more realism-based. It's terrible PR to announce it publicly but behind the scenes they know what their acceptable losses are. They're watching daily reports like a hawk. That is why they're still in Bakhmut. Their graphs show that eventually they'll out-attrition the Russians, that cold hard math is on their side, and that keeping the Bakhmut meatgriner going is the fastest way to victory. 

Everyone else, well, they're working with their own estimates. It's clear that some NATO analysts apply a strong enough modifier to each side's estimates to where their graphs show something else.

According to the investigation, the secret operation at sea was carried out by a team of six people. It is said to have involved five men and one woman. According to the report, the group consisted of a captain, two divers, two diving assistants and a female doctor, who are said to have transported the explosives to the crime scenes and placed them there. The nationality of the perpetrators is apparently unclear. The assassins used professionally forged passports, which are said to have been used, among other things, to rent the boat.

I'm sure this has been rehashed over and over but for my own sake of walking myself through it and challenging my own understanding:

To answer that, one must ask: 

- What do fighter jets provide that Ukraine currently lacks? 
 - If it's range of attacks, then why not provide ATACMS and other extended-range artillery?

Facts:

- [Currently Ukrainian airspace is generally secure and both sides have a largely grounded air-force because both sides are absolutely loaded with anti-air.](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/03/in-ukraine-fight-integrated-air-defense-has-made-many-aircraft-worthless-us-air-force-general/). 

- [It will take minimum 6 months to train *experienced* Ukrainian mig pilots on the F-16.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-pilots-would-need-six-months-f-16-combat-training-2023-01-27/)

The best argument I've seen so far has said, paraphrasing, ""You need the weapons for the war of tomorrow, not just for today."" Which leads to: Under what circumstance would that be? Train them, yes, but don't waste the budget you have now when what Ukraine needs now are arguably more: (1) Ground-based Air-Defense, (2) Assault vehicles (tanks, IFVs, etc.), and (3) Extended-range ground-based artillery. 

In a world with infinite resources and zero domestic opposition, yes sure, give them everything and the kitchen sink. In reality, we cannot put the cart before the horse. Train the pilots and have them *ready*; prep the logistics, but why give them fighter jets that are at a significant risk to being downed. After all, we see how low Ukraine's helicopters must fly. What sort of optics would it be if Ukraine started losing NATO-provided F-16's from S-300s? Specifically, *how* do F-16s advance the goals of Ukraine both now and in the near-future that can't be provided with another more cost-effective weapons package?

Zelenskyy's most valuable tool in his arsenal is to advocate on the world stage on behalf of Ukraine for more resources. I can't blame him whatsoever, but until the war is over it will never be enough and he will be advocating for more X as soon as he gets the last thing (e.g., tanks). In spite of being battle-hardened Zelenskyy et. al., doesn't have the strategic military experience that US and NATO commanders have in seeing the big picture.",False,1678209358.0,t3_11koioo,t3_11koioo,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Julia Ioffe said that Putin didn't go to Gorbachev's state funeral. That's how much he despised Gorbachev for allowing the Soviet Union to collapse and all those former parts to become independent. Putin truly *hates* it.  

Also, don't forget that to Putin the Cold War never ended. In his ultra paranoid KGB mind Putin is still fighting against America and the CIA. He sees democracy as a weapon used by America and the CIA to topple dictators like himself.  

Part of the reason for attempting to seize back control of the former parts of the Soviet Union is to force democracy as far away from the Kremlin as possible by using them as buffers. He cannot allow the Russian public to see that democracy actually works or they may start asking for it too. That's one of the main reasons he freaked out in 2014 when there were protestors in Ukraine calling for change. That's why snipers were ordered by Russia to fire on the protestors and why he's trying to take back what he sees as rightfully his property.  

He is attempting to delegitimise the Ukrainians right to freedom and democracy. He doesn't believe they have those rights.  

When Putin said that Ukraine wasn't a real country, and something along the lines of it being like a woman to be taken, he really meant it. To us that's a sick and twisted way of thinking, but he does think might makes right.

And even with a good summer for Russia, it can’t see a successful amphibious assault occurring across the Dnipro river anytime soon.

If the battle for Bakhmut, an engagment on a scale not seen before in this war, is being fought because Ukraine needed something to expend Wagner's forces.

Would it be practical *right this minute*?  Not so much.

First, not only would you need to have the planes and the pilots, you need to have all the support equipment in place, mechanics trained, an adequate storehouse of parts and maintenance supplies, and a set of airfields ready and able to handle the planes (the latter due to the constant airfield shuffling the Ukrainians have been doing with their current planes to insure they're not targeted by cruise and ballistic missiles).  You'd also have to have the air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions to actually carry out operations, especially if you're going to fight at the optimum levels afforded by having Western vs. Russian aircraft.

Second, you'd need to have integrations with numerous systems that the rest of the armed forces are using.   Air traffic control, communications with the rest of the air force and ground forces, Identification Friend or Foe systems to ensure they're not shot down by friendly fire, targeting systems to allow ground units to target opposing forces - those need to be up and going to ensure the planes can operate with minimal issues.

And then are the Western-style operational upgrades and changes that will need to have in place to maximize the potential of the equipment.  In short - there is a LOT of things that need to work and change in order for this to run seamlessly.    And that's not including the fact that there would still be a numerical advantage for the Russians, since a predominant number of their Air Force assets they have available are optimized for the air superiority and air dominance role.

Can the F-16s or other options work without having these all up and running?  Probably could, at least for awhile.   But the more shortcuts they take means that the risks to operational effectiveness, success and durability are going to be greatly increased.  And when you're trying to do the logistical equivalent of moving an entire Amazon warehouse into something the size of a studio apartment with 20 guys and a flat-panel van, you're going to have to prioritize and determine what would be the best choice to aid Ukraine.

It's a 'will do', but given what other things the Ukrainians need like artillery shells and ground equipment for defense and offense, it's going to take a back seat to 'must do'.

The translator was live/speaking in real-time, and because of that, some of the content of what he says gets lost.  Live-translation inevitably loses some of the content—even the best of the best translators, who tend to work for the State Dept/Ministry of Foreign Affairs (go on loan for president’s offices) will say this, which is why they want to sit in on meetings/briefings ahead of time, so can be prepared to both deliver nuance and also not lose any subtle content.  

*Edit: The full interview will air tomorrow night.  It’s possible that it gets re-dubbed.  Occasionally, the network will request a transcript of the original, and have a translater work with it over a day or two to better capture what was said.  However, if the translator was provided by Zelensky’s office, this would be rude and won’t do it.*

Second, he gave two reasons—(a) that Bakhmut gives access and thus will cause a chain reaction; and (b) also that if Bakhmut is taken, it will be a recruitment tool in Russia.  The first one is valid, the second is not.

Regarding whether should downplay significance so that when eventually taken, can minimize importance—he can’t.  Way, way, way too many men have died there.  Just today, (after the nordstream news subsided) all the Ukrainian newssite changed their headline story to be something along the lines of “Da Vinci died today in Bakhmut”—a famous Hero of Ukraine.  Zelensky has let it go on for so long, he can’t downplay its significance now.  

In an [interview I posted a two days ago,](https://glavcom-ua.translate.goog/country/incidents/eksnardep-jurij-sirotjuk-u-bakhmuti-zhodnoji-paniki-912518.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui) the soldier there explained that in some sectors of Bakhmut, the death ratio is 1:1.  While others it is 7:1 [open fields]. I think the 1:1 was zabakhmutia neighborhood, where they’ve withdrawn from.  Bc guys kept saying how it’s inadequate protection, there’s no tall buildings so it’s street fighting.  There was about a month of that—how can justify that? 

So I’m saying, he just can’t embrace that perspective.

However, he could’ve justified with the whole “exhausting the enemy” narrative.  In fact, the NYT gave a good justification in explaining how Wagner’s depletion there hurts them...lemme track down the quotes...

> The [Ukrainian] commander [in Bakhmut], who uses the code name Duke, said Wagner used untrained prisoners in the first line of attack and then, **after one or two hours, as the Ukrainian troops were tiring, sent special forces** into the fray, attacking from the flanks. “**It was very good tactics**,” Duke said.

> But Ukraine has been able to use Bakhmut as a kill box to grind down the vast numbers of newly mobilized Russian soldiers who were introduced to the battlefield late last year, he said. Even Wagner’s forces are said to have been worn down since the summer.

> “We broke their backbone; **we killed all their military staff**,” Major Pantsyrny said.

08724e05e8f3220de73952edafb476e8,11koioo,jb8g5cd,"The idea is that Bakhmut is easier to defend than the cities and towns behind it. The Ukrainian side has hills to its back that aren't easy for advancing Russian forces to climb, and a river to its front that is another good natural barricade. Beyond that river a dam was blown and the floodwaters have made a bog where the ice cold mud can get a few meters deep. The attacking Russians have to run/wade through that mess, while getting gunned down by Ukrainian soldiers who have cover from buildings and walls. Russian is advancing, but at a terrible, terrible price of life, and only through suicidal wave attacks. So the Ukrainian military leaders have decided that even if they are losing a lot of their soldiers, the Russians are taking between *three to seven* times more loses, and that is worth the price. The defenders of Bakhmut are dying, but their deaths are buying Ukraine two things: time to organize and strike other parts of the front, and massive casualties for the Russians. 

Politically this is beneficial to Ukraine as well. Russia state media swore it would capture Bakhmut, made a big deal about the importance of that location and how great a victory it would represent to take it, and now...they haven't. Every day that goes on makes Russia look weaker and people start to question their leadership harder. And there's dissension in the ranks - the Wagner mercenaries are becoming more and more suspicious of Moscow for ordering them into the grinder, and are publicly questioning their orders. And questioning orders can lead to disobeying orders, which would rob Moscow of one of their remaining squads of well-trained troops. 

As far as a retreat, even an organized one, from Bakhmut goes, it could prove more costly than staying. Pulling back leaves your soldiers exposed and forced to leave their current cover, bolsters the morale of the opposing forces, and there's no guarantee that there will be a better defensive point further back in Ukrainian territory. Leaving a proven holdfast might expose the Ukrainian line too much and allow Russia to surge into the gap, and thus a retreat is potentially costlier in terms of lives lost than holding a difficult position. 

Such choices are the most difficult in war, as nobody truly knows the outcome until after the battle. It might be a mistake to hold Bakhmut, or it might be a mistake to leave it. Right now, it seems like the best possible option is to funnel the Russians into those killing fields, and try to outlast their suicidal wave attacks until they break.",False,1678166280.0,t3_11koioo,t1_jb8dtn3,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

Every fight is broken down into pluses and minuses, you do the math and decide which is better. As Long as they can hold, while inflicting more losses on the enemy and ensure the ability to supply the forces it is a benefit to frustrate the enemy and deny them a win. Assuming at some point they do pull back it will be described as a ""massive breakthrough, lines collapsing!"" win for russia, the more it costs them, the more time bought the better for Ukraine.

Counterattack against salient is also a serious problem to take into account. When units breakthrough, they need to be rotated - that's assuming the line of defense didn't just run away in front of them. They are low on ammo, have WIA/ KIA, and suffered damage to equipment. If you counter-attack them before they get reinforcements, they will have to retreat under heavy fire, slowed down by their wounded soldiers. Without good communication, they might retreat right into their reinforcements, causing confusion, even friendly fire. If they get wiped out or are forced to retreat away from reinforcements, their support might be ambushed on the march trying to secure position that has already been overrun. Those are pretty generic statements to consider, nothing mentioned here is a ""top secret"" information. Just keep that in mind, when drawing dicks on the map and making statements like: "" woah, this is getting bad - the virtual penis is getting larger"".

The reason I bring this up is because you always have to be careful of a journalist looking for a story that finds a nugget of truth, they talked about Bakhmut, and turns that into them pleading with their misguided Ukranian allies holding onto something they should have realized was foolish to long ago. That's how the media tried to spin it but it's very unlikely that anything approaching that tone would have been used in an actual meeting of allies.

This is controversial.  Definitely two sides and those two sides are vocal.  

For example Chris Kyle in the book *American Sniper*.   The US military spent $ millions training SEAL teams ($ millions per soldier).  Then commanders said they were withholding them because SEALs were too expensive to lose.  The counter argument is that the SEALs are much less likely to die and further having the sniper coverage reduced the likelihood of new recruits dying.   The policy shifted later in the Iraq war.  That switch is a significant part of how Kyle ended up setting sniper records.   

We see it from historians of WWII.  They criticize Hitler for losing his most elite airborne troops.  Then they were not available to conduct airborne operations at the late stages of the war.  It sounds rational. But Hitler's error could simply be the invasion of the Soviet Union itself.
