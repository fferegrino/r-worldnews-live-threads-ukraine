>Russia’s security services are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives to prevent overseas travel, as paranoia over leaks and defections spreads through President Vladimir Putin’s regime.  
With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still raging, security officers have tightened travel requirements within the state sector, demanding the surrender of travel documents from some prominent figures and former officials, said several people familiar with the matter.  
The increased pressure reflects deep suspicion in the Kremlin and FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, about the loyalty of Russia’s civilian elite, many of whom privately oppose the war in Ukraine and are chafing over its impact on their lifestyles.  
>  
>Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, confirmed Russia had tightened the restrictions on foreign travel for some who work in “sensitive” areas. “There are stricter rules for this. In some places they are formalised and in some places they depend on a specific decision . . . about specific employees,” he told the Financial Times. “Since the start of the special military operation, more attention has been paid to this issue.”

    - DNR has sent him back to prison to finish his term, later pardoned/freed by RU-installed Governor.

    - The Russian papers are rather unimpressed w him, as there public quotes about killing and stealing for the glory of Russia (they think it sullies their pristine reputation).


- The Russians are shocked by the innocent-looking blonde who’s the target of an intense search, ‘who doesn’t look at all like a terrorist’

    - multiple photos, videos of the girl.  

    - she apparently said they wouldn’t let her gift him the figurine, jokes that security thinks there’s a bomb inside.

    - she tries to seat herself at back, he insists she sit nearby at front, she says she’s shy (he was being flirty) and he opens box, lets everyone see figurine, which she said was him, and no one thought looked like him.

   - she was recognized—her name she gave, Nastya (short for Anastasia) wasn’t correct, people recognized her quickly.

   - she lives in Pushkin (short train ride south of St Pete).  Her mother and stepfather have been detained.

    - she and her husband were arrested last year for war/passive protests outside of Gostiny Dvor. 

    - her husband is no longer in Russia.

    - she has no other visible ties to “terrorism,” except that she has some sort of like? once? of a Russian lawyer who defends civil rights? now on foreign agents list [sorry, I didn’t understand this part].

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,12a8uh2,jevj1zf,"The NYT wrote a somewhat optimistic piece about the counteroffensive.  [*Ukrainska Pravda* summarize it](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/04/4/7396305/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui).

*With Western weapons and newly created assault units, Ukraine is ready for a decisive spring counteroffensive, but the severe test will be to recover losses and maintain the motivation of the war-weary troops.*

The counteroffensive will be a test, with Europe judging UA’s ability to regroup:

> The new Ukrainian counteroffensive will test the Ukrainian army's ability to rearm and rebuild battalions while maintaining the motivation and maneuverability that gave it the upper hand in three previous counteroffensives, the NYT writes.

> ""Ukraine's success in the battles on the southeastern plains would demonstrate the decline of the military power of the Russian Federation to the world, reduce the concerns that the war has entered a ‘swamp,’ and, most likely, would encourage Ukraine's allies to further arm and finance Kyiv,"" the article notes.

NYT claims the upcoming counteroffensive will be a very serious challenge for Ukraine:

> ""Ukrainian officers will have to organize attacks by artillery, infantry and armored vehicles that will break through Russian trenches, tank traps and minefields. In the south, Russian units are building defensive positions after being pushed out of the Kherson region back in November. Modern Western tanks—which have better survivability and firepower—will be crucial for the elimination of these positions,"" the publication emphasizes.

Evelyn Farkas thinks Ukraine is underestimated:

> Ukraine is capable of inflicting losses on the Russian army that could have far-reaching geopolitical consequences if it receives weapons and prepares troops in time.

> ""Ukraine can make the Russian Federation a weakened military force in Eastern Europe with little leverage in negotiations to end the war.""

> . . . people ""imagine only what they see now,"" but a lot can change with the arrival of new Western weapons and tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are being trained in Ukraine and Europe.

NYT temper optimism:

> the success of the armed forces is hardly guaranteed, as allies are in no rush to send weapons and soldiers have to settle for crash courses in assault tactics.

> Weapons and equipment for breaching trench lines and crossing minefields appear in Ukraine, but it remains unclear whether there are sufficient quantities.

> Initially, the Ukrainian counteroffensive may well depend on overcoming extensive minefields. To do this, Ukraine will rely on demining machines that have been in its arsenal since Soviet times, some of which were captured from the Russians. In addition, Ukraine now also receives demining equipment from the West.

> The NYT notes that demining can be done manually, with soldiers ""feeling"" the ground and keeping a close eye on trip-wire mines while walking in front of assault units, or with specialized demining equipment. [(yeah, that’s how Norway killed off hundreds of Germans after the war...)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Norway#German_prisoners_of_war)

Expectation: Ukraine will go south: 

> where the terrain varies from vast fields to cities and villages.

> ""A strike of about 80 km across the steppe—from the current front line to the occupied city of Melitopol—will divide the territory held by the Russian Federation into two zones, cut supply lines and put Ukrainian artillery within range of Russian bases in Crimea."" 

A concern:

> At the same time, the publication writes—the morale of Ukrainian fighters, which for most of the war was better than that of the enemy—""becomes an increasing problem.""

> In dozens of recent interviews with the NYT, soldiers stationed at Bakhmut or on short breaks from street fighting expressed horror at the scale of the violence and deaths.

Military recovery will be observed: 

> One of the most vivid examples of military recovery, the publication notes, is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is restoring the Azov unit, whose soldiers were killed, wounded or captured during the siege of Mariupol and the storming of the Azovstal metallurgical plant last spring, and also died during the explosion in the barracks for prisoners of war in Olenivka.
Recently, at the base in the pine forest, the recruits of ""Azov"" spent five weeks mastering basic soldier skills.

> ""We will train new people, raise them to our level,"" Lieutenant Ilya Samoilenko, who was released from Russian captivity as a result of the exchange, told the publication.

> In order to ensure that only the most motivated soldiers get into the ""Azov"" assault unit, recruits are given the opportunity to choose. After completing the training course, they can choose to stay at the base or go into battle.",1680579877.0,1680578580.0,t3_12a8uh2,t3_12a8uh2,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

18f77564ecd9869810e28b55000462e1,12a8uh2,jet5th9,"Russian opposition media got their hands on the ""Memo to the Soldier"" pamphlet that the Western Military District has been issuing to all their servicemen since last September.

The memo begins by telling the soldiers that they can expect an “additional reward”  of 50 thousand rubles for taking down a drone, and a cool million for capturing a HIMARS.

However the bulk of the multi-page memo focuses on the justification for the war, and calls for harsher measures. 

> The text immediately announces that the Western countries have always been engaged in “enslavement of conquered countries and peoples”, and their ideals are completely contrary to the values of the Russian “original civilization”.
> 
> ""The welfare of the West was created by turning the inhabitants of Africa into slaves, the ruthless colonization of India, the genocide of the Indians, the deliberate destruction of the Chinese with opium."" The turning point was 1945, when the USSR ""withstood the blow of all of Europe united behind Hitler."" This forced the West to create NATO, which has since then ""been active in subversive work aimed at weakening Russia.""
> 
> Deprived of the ability to suck the juices out of the [former] colonies"", the West began to exist ""by destroying the economies of the countries of the former USSR"". Faced with yet another ""resource shortage"", the United States decided to ""destabilize"" Russia, ""plunge it into chaos"" and ""suck all the juice out of it."" The pamphlet explains to the soldiers that the West is trying to conquer Russia “by proxy”. 
> 
> ""Western leaders are not fighting against our ruling class, but against the country itself. Against our people.""  They are using ""active Nazis"" and the perpetrators of ""numerous bloody crimes of the Kyiv regime"" that must be ""brought to trial"". ""Our strength lies in truth and justice!""

Surprisingly the pamphlet does not mince words when it comes to Russia's defeats in Ukraine: 

> ""The people of Russia, Donbass and many border regions of Ukraine treat the Russian army with love and respect. However, the shameful surrender by our units of previously liberated territories, as well as the abandonment of people who entrusted their lives to us, undermines their faith in us and our victory.""

This criticism is then used to propose ""concrete steps to improve the situation at the front"", namely ""a return to Stalin's methods of warfare.""

> The authors of the memo cite at length the famous [Stalin Order No. 227](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_No._227), better known as ""Not a step back!"". 

Multiple paragraphs in the brochure quote directly from the order, just changing 'German occupiers"" to ""Nazi battalions"" and ""Red Army"" to ""Russian Army"". 

> “Returning Ukraine to ourselves, we are taking our enemy's most dangerous weapon from their hands”. 

> The brochure ends with quotes from the address by the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR Vyacheslav Molotov on the day Operation Barbarossa began: “Our cause is just. The enemy will be defeated. Victory will be ours!”

A third video starts a few moments after the explosion. It shows that Trepova was one of the last people to leave the cafe. She stands right outside the entrance, seemingly dazed and confused.

Russia's collapse will be terrible and bloody. There's no realistic scenario where everyone secedes freely. The only way Tatarstan and Tuva and Dagestan can gain independence without bloodshed is if there's a bloodbath in Moscow, which is perfectly within the realm of possibility too. 

The extent at which Putin's insane propaganda resonates with ethnic Russians is also clear. It suggests that whatever Muscovy core remains after the collapse will be run by an angry fascist with the world's biggest chip on his shoulder.

It’s just not feasible right now from a cost/benefit perspective. I think training some pilots on a western airframe (F16, 18 or Gripens) is a great idea and a couple of dozen could do well if Ukraine can keep them in the air.

^(Edit: *meaning*, Russians are accustomed to their terrorists ‘looking a certain way’—not *ethnically* Russian, but rather “southern” which means Caucasian/from Caucasus, so resemble West Asian like Dagestani, ingushetia, think ‘Stalin features,’ so have dark complexion, hirsute; or, “eastern,” like from central Russia or one of the -stans, where people look more East Asian, the way Tatar or Mongolian people look.

>I lived in Russia at the time, and what I could never get across to Russians was that Americans really are that idealistic, and they really believe what they’re saying about democracy, about freedom, about human rights; that this isn’t just cynical lying; that this isn’t just a cynical fig leaf in trying to take over oil wells in the Middle East. 

>... And Russians, even the most liberal Russians, often wouldn’t believe me. They would think—they would equate idealism with stupidity, and this would fit their stereotype of Americans as stupid. 

>And then I would come back to the U.S., and Americans couldn’t understand how cynical Russians were; that they really didn’t believe pretty much anything they said; that there was always a lot of machinations going on and that there was just—that they really were that comfortable lying to you, to your face.

The US and the rest of the Western world have done their share of illegal wars, extrajudicial imprisonment and torture, and cynicism and hypocrisy is absolutely a part of the Western culture, especially when big money is involved. Many large corporations are an embodiment of a dystopian nightmare with how they treat their employees or the environment.

The West has pretty much looked the other way when Putin invaded Georgia, bombed Syria, occupied and annexed Crimea, used radioactive and chemical weapons to murder defectors in the UK, imprisoned or murdered every single one of his political rivals, all because business with Russia was just too lucrative.

For instance, as a general rule, offensive casualties in these situations are expected to be higher. One guy is sitting in an entrenched position, the other guy is obligated to push over open ground to get there. Since Russia's offensives have been extremely long and protracted, while Ukraine's counteroffensives have been quick and overwhelming when they occur, Russia is spending way more of the war in this loss-heavy phase.

There's also simple induction you can do about the overall scenario. Russia has more troops. If it was trading those evenly with Ukraine... Ukraine couldn't possibly win. Indeed, if it was trading relatively evenly, there would be no incentive to ever 'pause' the offensives in the way we've seen. You'd keep pushing them and eventually all the defenders would be dead and you'd win. Instead, we're seeing the opposite behavior. We see Russians start offensives and then see them stall out. We've seen the pace of the war stagnate. None of this is consistent with the idea that Russia is fighting 'evenly.'

Then there's just... basic think with your head shit. We know the time tables of the mobilizations. We know how long it takes to train a soldier.

yes, except we have common sense from what we do know. It shows how completely incompetent Russia has been. How they admit willing that they just send people to their deaths and gain nothing.
