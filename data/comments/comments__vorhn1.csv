👉 In the north near Kharkiv the war remains a stalemate.

👉 In the east near Lysychansk there are reports a small group of Ukrainians still hold out near the city's oil refinery as the main forces in the city perform a fighting retreat.  russia is expected to claim full control of the city over the next few days.

👉 In the south the only news was the big news of the day: the russians abandoned Snake Island (also known as Ziminy Island).  This will allow Ukraine to control more of the area, protect Odessa, and protects their mineral and fishing rights in the area.  Its a start to re-opening the sea lanes to Odessa, but russia's submarines can still keep a blockade in place.

👉 Yesterday, russia released its dismal [second quarter economic numbers](https://twitter.com/jakluge/status/1542220132856090624) and today Gazprom (the state oil and gas company) refused to pay dividends causing the stock to lose over [30% in value](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1542524522678538246).

👉 Belarus has begun sending out [conscription notices](https://twitter.com/markmackinnon/status/1542486394857218048).  Also russia is now recruiting men in Transnistria.  This is all part of russia's stealth mobilization.  Today russia also passed laws allowing military recruitment of young men who have not yet undergone conscription, and a law that allowed the government to mobilize private industry if needed.  This is all to address russia's greater difficulty in fielding men and material for the war effort.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,vorhn1,iefqg4c,"Attacks on pro-Russian officials in southern Ukraine 'suggest growing resistance movement' - report

US officials say recent assassination attempts targeting pro-Russian officials suggest a growing resistance movement in parts of southern Ukraine, according to CNN.

Three have been just three incidents in the town of Kherson in the past two weeks, but officials told the news outlet they could grow into a wider counterinsurgency that would make it harder for Russia to control its newly captured territory. 

 Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said on Wednesday that the Kremlin faces ""rising partisan activity in southern Ukraine"".

The US believes Russia does not have enough forces in Kherson to effectively control the region, especially after pulling forces from the area and redeploying them in the eastern Donbas region.

Another US official told CNN this may have provided Ukrainian partisans with an opportunity to attack locally installed Russian officials. 

Ukraine has also carried out limited counterattacks near Kherson, adding to difficulties for Russian forces.

The region is crucial to Russia's control of coast and access to the Crimean peninsula.

It's unclear how many Russian forces are in or near Kherson.

Russian forces had been using Snake Island to carry out radio reconnaissance, according to the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council.

Oleksii Danilov told Ukrainska Pravda they had been using the island to monitor Odesa, the Bessarabia region, and issues in Transnistria. 

""They had a very powerful position there,"" he said, calling it a ""strategically important"" victory for Ukraine.

He also refuted Russia's claims that its forces had left the island voluntarily.

He said: ""The way the Russian Federation interprets the events – that they allegedly left as a gesture of good will –  is not consistent with reality.

""In fact, they were dislodged from there by our heavy artillery. 

""Our armed forces using all means available inflicted the respective damage twice.

***Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 1 July 2022***

* On 30 June 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that its forces had withdrawn from Snake Island in the north-west Black Sea. The island was seized by Russia on the first day of the invasion and sits along the main shipping lanes to Odesa and its adjacent ports.
* The Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted attacks against the Russian garrison in the past few weeks using missile and drone strikes. In addition, it used anti-ship missiles to interdict Russian naval vessels attempting re-supply the island.
* Russia has highly likely withdrawn from Snake Island owing to the isolation of the garrison and its increasing vulnerability to Ukrainian strikes, rather than as a 'gesture of good will', as it has claimed.
* Separately, Russian ground forces claim to have captured the village of Pryvilla, north-west of the contested Donbas town of Lyschansk. Intense fighting probably continues for the commanding high ground around Lyschansk Oil Refinery.

Albania’s prime minister says his government is in talks with NATO to build a naval base at Porto Romano, a port under construction on its Adriatic coast.

Edi Rama told a news conference that Porto Romano, situated close to the coastal town of Durres and intended as the country’s biggest port, would have a commercial section as well as a military naval base.

He said the base would be built and co-financed by NATO and Albania, which became a member of the security alliance in 2009.

Back in May, Rama said his government was also offering NATO its Pashaliman naval base some 200km (124 miles) south of Tirana.  Pashaliman was set up by Moscow as a submarine base in the 1950s to host 12 submarines near Vlore, where the Adriatic and Ionian Seas meet.

Day 128 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we actually didn’t get shelled even once, but Derhachi did, and we heard the explosions from here, but otherwise it was actually surprisingly quiet, there’s also quite a lot of sound coming from our artillery firing at Russian positions throughout the day, and even right now.

At 11pm the missiles from Belgorod did launch as always, but weirdly enough they only fired 2 of them this time, usually they fire 6-8, so 2 is the bare minimum, as one Iskander launcher carries 2 missiles. What’s even better is that not a single one of those 2 missiles reached Kharkiv this time and there were no reports of a missile hitting something in oblast either. 

We got 2 separate videos of our AA intercepting something around that time, and seeing that the missiles didn’t land anywhere, it is safe to say that they were shot down. For the first time in over a month, not a single missile reached Kharkiv, feels pretty good, though we still couldn’t relax until 1am; we still thought that they might continue firing their missiles. 

The number of casualties from that missile strike in Odesa oblast yesterday increased to 21 dead and almost 40 injured, this is pure terrorism. And how did Russia respond to this? They basically ignored it, as if it never happened. They didn’t know how to justify it this time, so Peskov said “I want to remind you that Putin said that Russian Armed Forces do not target civilians and civilian infrastructure.” They are acting as if it never happened, because there’s no way to justify it.

And just as I was happy that today was a quiet day, of course they decided to ruin it. Right now, at 4am, we are getting shelled pretty badly from MLRS. There were at least 3 barrages of rockets somewhere not that far from us, apparently Saltivka is being shelled, at least one fire started, and a big smoke pillar can be seen.",False,1656724466.0,t3_vorhn1,t3_vorhn1,,0,87,0,87,1,0,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the initiative would build on EU moves to ditch Russian coal, oil and natural gas and would complement a bloc-wide push to accelerate the development of renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

“We are preparing emergency plans for Europe,” von der Leyen said in the Czech town of Litomysl, where she marked the start of the country’s six-month stint as holder of the rotating EU presidency. “Energy prices are high. People, rightly so, expect us to do something about it.”

“We have a saying in America, we say that nations with allies thrive, nations without allies wither and we’re watching Russia wither before our eyes right now,"" Mattis said.
When asked what military lessons could be taken from the war so far, the former US Marine said: “One is don’t have incompetent generals in charge of your operations.” 

He also called Russia's military performance ""pathetic"" and decried ""the immoral, the tactically incompetent, operationally stupid and strategically foolish effort"" of its campaign in Ukraine.

Mattis spoke of previous US efforts to try and bring Russia into the “community of nations,” but said that was not possible with Vladimir Putin as leader.

“The tragedy of our time is that Putin is a creature straight out of Dostoevsky. He goes to bed every night angry, he goes to bed every night fearful, he goes to bed every night thinking that Russia is surrounded by nightmares and this has guided him,” he said.
Putin had removed anyone from his circle that would disagree with him, so he ""probably thought that the Ukrainian people were going to welcome him,"" Mattis added.

*By Kieran Devine, digital investigations journalist*

Russia has reopened a key port in southern Ukraine as it seeks to tighten its grip on the economy of occupied parts of the country.

Footage from pro-Russian news channel Crimea 24 showed the first grain shipment coming from the port of Berdyansk, a city on the Sea of Azov, which had been shut since the start of the invasion.

Ukrainian officials have claimed that Russia is illegally exporting grain from southern Ukraine.

The footage released appears to have deliberately blurred the name of the ship, but analysis of photographs combined with vessel tracking data reveals that the ship is the Russian flagged Zhibek Zholy.

Ship tracking monitors show the Zhibek Zholy arrived in the Turkish port of Karasu this morning. The vessel appeared to turn its tracker off when it was in and around Berdyansk, a tactic the US state department has said is being used by some ships when illegally exporting grain from occupied Ukraine.

&#x200B;

Several shipments of grain from southern Ukraine have been tracked to Turkish ports, [including one which was the subject of a Sky News investigation.](https://news.sky.com/story/the-disappearing-ships-russias-great-grain-plunder-12639463)

The German government has now spoken to condemn attacks on civilians, which the BBC reports it has described as war crimes.

A spokesman said: ""The Russian President Putin and those responsible will have to be held accountable.""

The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the missile strikes that hit an apartment building and two holiday campsites in Odesa overnight.

The number of people killed in the strikes is estimated at 19 - including at least two children.

Another 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries.

NATO has been galvanised into the biggest changes in decades, says Sky's international affairs editor Dominic Waghorn.

He says NATO expansion and the changes announced at the alliance's summit this week, including the deployment of thousands of additional troops in eastern Europe, mean Vladimir Putin's ""worst fears are being fulfilled"".

He writes: ""After years of giving Mr Putin the benefit of the doubt, NATO leaders believe strength and resolve are the best way of containing a newly belligerent Russia.

""NATO's new stance may be necessary but it will not make the current situation any less dangerous. 

""A new iron curtain is descending through Europe. 

""The chasm between the democratic west and autocratic east is deepening.

""Mr Putin's advisers have long told him that NATO is an ever-growing threat to Russia and out to get him personally. 

""None of this will ease his paranoia.

""Britain says the next phase in the conflict is beginning. 

""Ukraine will be helped to pivot from its defensive posture to a more offensive one. 

""To drive Russia out, Ukraine's military will need transforming and far more weapons. 

""That will take enduring commitment on the part of the allies.

""The more they succeed the more dangerous Mr Putin may become. Dictators cannot afford to lose.""

If the battle of Kharhiv this fall will determine whether Ukraine stays somewhat intact or we see a new border for Russia on the Dnieper.

I simply cannot see the Russia having much success beyond that. This would be the best case scenario for Russia at this point.

Worst case (assuming no major things like Putin assassination) at this point IMO is Donbass is lost to Ukraine... I just can't see Russia getting pushed back from there.

Honestly, even considering the good news happening in the south and getting snake island back, unless something changes soon it really seems like it's going to end up like the Winter War: Russia will keep forcing the Ukrainians into these fighting withdrawals until they finally start to break the Ukrainian lines, but at that point they will be too devastated want to continue. At the same time, Ukraine will finally be forced to concede the lands its lost in the face of a full collapse across its eastern defenses. And in 75 years teenagers online will twist Ukraine barely making it out of a brutal war for survival at a massive cost in land and population into memes about how they dunked on the Russians. (Hell even the timelines match up. IIRC, it took the Soviets ~3 months to realize the Finns weren't going to roll over and that they needed to switch things up and start grinding them down with their overwhelming advantage in weapons and numbers.)

You're looking at it from a totally wrong angle. In a totalitarian dictatorship you get recognition and promotion not from results, but from properly reporting to key people about how well a job you have done.

So a military officer can order a single missile strike against a random warehouse, then report that it destroyed ""a shipment of NATO armaments"" or ""a training center for foreign mercenaries"". What are they going to do, go there and check? As long as his reporting form is filled correctly, the entire chain of command will have to treat it as fact, with all the benefits that it entail. That such strikes cause civilian casualties is almost a byproduct in this.

As a sidenote, this is also why the russia has been reporting about having destroyed 500 Ukrainian tanks, 1000 Baykraktars and having eliminated its entire air force more than once over. There is of course a propaganda element to this as well, but if the numbers have been reported at one level of the chain of command, the protocols demand they get passed further up, where they have to be processed as analyzed as factual, regardless of the fuckery that actually took place.",1656687889.0,1656687692.0,t3_vorhn1,t1_iegb50k,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

[Why the weapons the west has sent Ukraine might not help against Russia](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb357/ukraine-russia-weapons-missiles-javelin-nlaw-invasion-crimea-donbas)

From January 20th 2022.

>But with ranges of about 2,500 metres for the Javelin and 600 metres for the NLAW, these relatively short-range weapons, while effective against tanks, armoured vehicles and even low-flying helicopters, will probably have little impact.  
>  
>The Russian military will be able to degrade Ukraine’s military with rockets, missiles and heavy artillery located even hundreds of miles from any potential battlefield, leading experts have told VICE World News.   
>  
>But the problem, according to analyst Rob Lee, a former US Marine who closely studies the Russian armed forces, is that Russia would be unlikely to engage in battle under such close quarters.   
>  
>A former United Kingdom Special Forces soldier who currently serves as a security advisor in the region agreed that the Western weapons would be unlikely to cause much damage.   
>  
>“Unless Russia goes into the cities, the NLAW system won’t do much because the lads trying to get shots off will be long dead, wounded or dispersed by long range rockets and artillery, without considering Russia’s massive advantage in air power,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

>Ukraine’s military had eagerly awaited the arrival of the first batch of truck-mounted, multiple-rocket launchers, whose satellite-guided rockets have a range of more than 40 miles, greater than anything Ukraine had possessed. The weapons have even won grudging respect from some Russians for their accuracy and power, analysts said.

>Still, only four of the launchers, called High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS, and their U.S.-trained crews are in the fight, though four more are expected this month. Ukrainian officials say they need as many as 300 multiple-rocket launchers to combat Russia, which is firing several times as many rounds as Ukraine’s forces in the artillery-driven war of attrition in the country’s east.

>Ukrainian soldiers are using their new weapon judiciously, firing one or two guided rockets at ammunition depots or command posts, often at night, and keeping them well away from the front lines to protect them, Pentagon officials and military analysts say.

>“So far they seem to be a quite useful addition,” Rob Lee, a Russian military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia and a former U.S. Marine officer, said of the systems. “They will help hinder further Russian advances, but they won’t necessarily mean Ukraine will be able to take back territory.”

>The HIMARS are the centerpiece of a raft of new Western long-range weapons that the outgunned Ukrainian military is switching over to as its arsenal of Soviet-era howitzer and rocket ammunition dwindles.

>The Western weapons are more accurate and highly mobile, but it takes weeks to deploy them from the United States and Europe and to train soldiers to use them. In the meantime, Russia’s military is making slow but methodical gains in the eastern region of Donbas, where both sides have taken heavy losses.

>The Biden administration says that all eight HIMARS should be in Ukraine by mid-July. The first group of 60 Ukrainian soldiers trained to use them are now firing the guided rockets in battle, and a second group is undergoing training in Germany. Britain and Germany have each pledged three similar multiple-rocket launchers.

>A senior Pentagon official said this week that the Ukrainians appear to be employing the HIMARS with deadly effectiveness and that the four additional systems would be deployed in “the near future.”

>At a NATO summit in Madrid on Thursday, President Biden promised $800 million more in security assistance to Ukraine, including more ammunition for the HIMARS. The United States has committed nearly $7 billion in military aid since the war started in February.

>Since Russia focused its campaign on the east after failing to seize Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and other cities in the north, Ukrainian officials have pleaded with the United States and other allies for more advanced artillery.

>On June 23, Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced that the first American HIMARS had arrived, promising in a Twitter message, “Summer will be hot for russian occupiers. And the last one for some of them.”

>Two days later, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the top commander of Ukrainian forces, posted a video on the social media site Telegram of the HIMARS in use. “Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully hit certain targets — the enemyʼs military facilities on our Ukrainian territory,” he said.

>American officials said the Ukrainian statements were accurate, and Mr. Lee added that even Russian accounts acknowledged the HIMARS to be early successes.

>There is still a debate as to how many multiple-rocket launchers Ukraine needs.

>Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, said in June that Ukraine needed 300 multiple-launch rocket systems and 500 tanks, among other things, to achieve battlefield parity — several times as much heavy weaponry as has been promised.

>Michael G. Vickers, the Pentagon’s former top civilian official for counterinsurgency strategy, said the Ukrainians needed at least 60, and perhaps as many as 100, HIMARS or other multiple-launch rocket systems to win the artillery battle.

>“There are plenty available that could be supplied at minimal strategic risk,” said Mr. Vickers, who was the principal C.I.A. strategist for arming anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s.

>Mr. Lee noted that future success of the HIMARS and other multiple-rocket launchers depended not only on the number sent, but also on how much and what type of ammunition the United States and other allies provided.

>Ukraine has three types of Russian-made mobile rocket launchers, but ammunition for only the one with the shortest range is produced by its allies. Ammunition for Ukraine’s longer-range artillery rockets is made solely by Russia and Belarus.

Ukraine has three types of Russian-made mobile rocket launchers, but ammunition for only the one with the shortest range is produced by its allies. Ammunition for Ukraine’s longer-range artillery rockets is made solely by Russia and Belarus.

For the HIMARS, Ukrainian forces rely on a guided rocket that is aided by GPS signals and accurate to within about 30 feet of its intended target. Before launch, a three-person crew inputs coordinates for each strike.

After a NATO meeting in Brussels on June 15, Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

Biden, because with Trump, Putin would have not needed to invade Ukraine, he would have been able to install a Russia friendly undemocratic government as they did in other countries.

Which country benefits from having Germany and US at odds? Is sanctioning Germany a good thing?

>which President was the first to give offensive weapons to Ukraine

But Ukraine weren't allowed to use lethal weapons. Trump forced them to keep them in warehouses away from the frontline. Further don't act like the pre and post 2016 Ukrainian government are the same. One was literally the most corrupt government in Europe, one had a democratically elected president that was trying to root out corruption. Do you want to give advanced lethal weapons to a corrupt government? Because the US has been down that road many time and hasn't turned out great so far.

>which President happily let his son take a boardroom seat on a Ukrainian energy company as a bribe.

Proponents usually say things like ""the Kyiv attack was a feint"" or similar and shift the goalposts constantly to account for all the other failures of Russia.

TL;DR for the rest: Russia has a large, modern military. But the modern part isn't large, and the large part isn't modern. The rest of the world had gotten used to seeing the modern part.

The reality is that Western media and some Western intelligence had misunderstood Russia badly.

Before the war started, it seemed that Russia was quite capable in the small scale wars they had been involved in. Invasion of Crimea was done very professionally and competently and their intervention in Syria was generally of good military standards. The key part being that both of those were relatively small scale.

There was some arguing before the war started about what the state of the majority of the Russian military was. Most sources seemed to be of the opinion that the rest of the military, while probably not as good as those active units in Syria, were still of decent quality.

A minority had disagreed, pointing to unofficial numbers cited by service members in unofficial channels. These suggested things like army units being significantly understaffed and pilots receiving ~1/3 of the training time US pilots got.

When the invasion kicked off, it became a perfect storm of failure of planning, leadership, and the minority opinion about staffing and training.

We saw Russia try to execute a plan that might have worked in 2016, a quick attempt to capture Kyiv and decapitate the Ukraine government. It was a huge failure of intelligence as Russia didn't understand the massive modernization and restructuring Ukraine had gone through. In Crimea, Donbas, and Luhansk, Russia had been dealing with the old territorial militias; basically Ukraine's military was a bunch of semi-independent forces with limited centralized command or training - that had been fixed in the last 6 years.

Then there was the failure of leaderhip, Russia does not do NATO/US style leadership where officers' orders are more goals than specific commands and then they let the lower officers and NCO's decide how to achieve those goals. Russia says ""move down that road, to that intersection, be there by that time""; often with the commanding officer not even with the troops they are commanding.

Finally all the corruption and understaffing came back to bite them. Bad tires, either cheaper substitutes or just never replaced meant that Russian forces couldn't leave paved roads, leading to the ""X km convoy"" traffic jam, tanks didn't have the equipment they were meant to. Understaffing meant that often those armored personnel carriers didn't actually have enough troops in the back, which meant there was no supporting infantry to save them from Ukrainian ambushes.

The Russian air force's lack of training time and modernization meant that they couldn't get air superiority over a country that, frankly, has an old and backwards air force too.

It's a perfect storm of a shit show, removing 1 or 2 of the mistakes wouldn't fix everything. And I haven't even started in on the Navy yet.",False,1656709260.0,t3_vorhn1,t1_iehxevw,,3,15,0,15,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Russia can't maintain air superiority. So they do limited sorties flying low or using tactical bombers from within Russian territory. 

Russian usage of cruise missiles is severely less effective and in smaller numbers than USA has used in the past. They can be deadly still but far from the ""all enemy targets and infrastructure blown up"" like people suggested. It's FAR from that deadly and them actually hitting a relevant target is more the exception than the rule.

Due to Russia using a limited amount of conscripts (most that got dragged in did so in the first invasion when some were tricked it was another training excercise) this means they have an infantry shortage because conscripts fill out the grunt work. This complicates offensive operations as BTG's quickly lose their already lacking infantry core fast.

Russian truck logistics is a joke. No pallets, way too few trucks and shittily maintained trucks. But in the Donbas they've been able to use rail and move at a much slower pace so it's been less of an issue.

They've got 4 very geographically distinct coastal areas and to transit between any of them requires significant voyages, often in close proximity to less than friendly countries (think Turkey). This will always come up as a complicating factor in why the Russian Navy can appear reasonably large on paper, but have trouble forming a large strike group, including in this war.

The Russian Navy also appears to have funneled all of it's modernization and R&D into their submarine force and badly neglected their surface navy. At the close of the 80's they were in a decent modernization trend, closing the gap with the US and NATO. A bit better in a couple places, a bit worse in several others, but generally building a competitive navy.

But a key thing to note is that the latest and greatest ships were generally all being built in what would become Ukraine. That will become very critical as large military shipyards do not just grow on trees, the ships being built could only receive major service and upgrade work in Ukraine.

All but one of the Slava-class cruisers and the first of the Admiral Kuznetsov cruiser/carriers were mostly done when Ukraine got independence. A bit of Grand Theft Aircraft Carrier later, Russia was in control of the majority of the new fleet. Ukraine would either scrap or sell off the other ships under construction as they were not in a position to maintain such a large navy. Except for one Slava hull, which is still incomplete in Ukraine.

And that is largely still the surface fleet Russia is sailing around with. You might compare to the US Navy and say, ""but the US is still operating classes of ships from the 80's"" and that is kinda true. But most of those hulls are built in the 90's or later and the rest are scheduled for decommissioning as their replacements are built. The Moskva (that Ukraine sunk) was the original Slava cruiser, still in service. The rest of the Slavas, Kirovs, and Kuznetsovs are all in service, with no replacement in sight.

So the part of their navy that might be useful, the surface fleet, is horribly out of date and under maintained. The modern part, the subs, are of little use as there isn't a Ukrainian navy for them to hunt. They can't get reinforcements into the Black Sea because Turkey won't let them (Montreux Convention, 1936). Add in similar leadership issues to the land army likely paralyzing internal responses inside a given ship (think Moskva apparently not even getting its AA systems activated during the missile strike).

And you've got a Navy that is almost totally irrelevant to the current conflict. The best they can do is vaguely threaten an amphibious operation to keep Ukrainian forces tied up on the coast. But even that is falling apart as anti-ship missiles pour into Ukraine.",1656717056.0,1656715864.0,t3_vorhn1,t1_iei7sxy,,5,7,0,7,0,0,

>Traditionally, officials from the US national security council (NSC) brief the president before a call with a foreign leader.

>There will also be officials sitting in a secure room in another part of the White House, listening to the president's call and taking notes. Their notes are known as a ""memorandum of telephone conversation"", and like many things in Washington it has an abbreviation: ""memcon"".

>The president's calls with foreign leaders are also transcribed by computers. Afterwards, as former White House officials explain, the human note takers compare their impressions with an electronic version of the call.

But they end up passing through several revisions by nonpartisan career staff and political appointees, which, in the case of Trump’s July 25 conversation with Zelensky, has triggered fears of misconduct.

>White House conversations have not been recorded since the mid-1970s, when President Richard Nixon scandalized the practice, said Laurence Pfeiffer, a senior director of the White House Situation Room during the Obama administration.

>Memcons are instead created by a team of note-takers, initially, who contemporaneously record, by hand and on computers, what the president and the other party say.

There aren't any plausible alternatives I'm seeing to that future though. At least futures that involve an independent Ukraine.

Unless Russia somehow starts selling Soviet-style equipment to NATO so NATO can give it to Ukraine, there is a finite amount already in the west to give.

Alternatively, one can bet on the war being over before that finite amount runs out. Which is what I think a lot of politicians and whatnot are doing. Even if right, I think this is still kinda short sighted as it just kicks the ball down the road one election cycle.

(going to use M1 Abrams engines as an extreme example here, but I understand there are other things in play too)

So, IMO, NATO should be actively working to get Ukraine up to speed. And while, yes, it will take a long time for Ukraine to have the infrastructure to rebuilt an M1 Abrams turbine engine; there are also alternatives such as shipping it back across the Polish border to let the US handle while said infrastructure and training is being built out.

Optimistically, yes, the wheels are secretly in motion and there's a cadre of Ukrainians being trained on operating M1s, a cadre of tank engineers being trained, a stockpile of spare engines building up in Poland, etc. But until those are public info, I'm still going to lobby for them in whatever forum I can find.",False,1656716601.0,t3_vorhn1,t1_ieiadly,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
