fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,15tc7lt,jwn149m,"Day 534-540 of my updates from Kharkiv.

This past week has been mostly quiet for us here in the city. There was one attempted Shahed attack in the morning yesterday, but thankfully all the drones that were headed for the city were intercepted by our air defense. We did still hear at least one explosion from somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, possibly from a drone being intercepted because it didn’t have the usual shockwave/tremors which always follow after a missile/drone explodes on the ground.

Even though it was pretty quiet here in the city, unfortunately, it wasn’t quiet at all in Kharkiv oblast. Shelling is still constant there, as well as daily glide bomb strikes, which primarily target civilian neighborhoods. From what I could gather, just during the last week at least 4-5 civilians were killed by a glide bomb specifically targeting their house somewhere in our region, mostly in villages near Kupiansk.

The people that were killed are also mostly pensioners in their sixties-seventies, probably the people that have nowhere to go even if they were to evacuate. There are a lot of people like that, they just don’t want to leave everything they have behind and run, and I can understand why they don’t want to go, but sadly by staying they are making themselves a target for the Russians. At the same time, I have no idea why Russians think that killing pensioners is going to help them in any way. They aren’t killing potential soldiers, most of those people have no means to fight back even if they wanted to, so it’s not like they are hurting our army by doing this, but they are wasting their precision munitions to kill them.",False,1692309987.0,t3_15tc7lt,t3_15tc7lt,,0,144,0,144,0,0,

Part 1.  
  
  
  
Finally, the Russian command realized that the situation in the Tokmak direction is becoming very unpleasant for him... The enemy began to draw additional forces and means to at least stop the further development in this direction.  
In particular, I wrote about the movement of the 108th Airborne Assault Regiment of the 7th Airborne Assault Division to this direction the day before. But, judging by everything, the enemy did not stop there. Starting from the evening before yesterday, at least one more battalion of the 810th separate marine infantry brigade (MP model) began to concentrate in the area west of the village of Robotyne.  
At the moment, the most important events are taking place not in the village of Robotyne itself (in the northern part of which there are probably already advancing units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine), but further west and east of it...  
And in general terms, these events mean more than control over the settlement itself... The fact is that to the east of this village are the forward positions of the enemy's main line of defense, and to the west is a local line of support points (to the village of Kopani), which in idea, should cover the Novoprokopiv defense node of the enemy from the west and northwest... behind which, in turn, the forward positions of the enemy's main line of defense also begin. Therefore, it is obvious that bypassing by the advancing units of the Armed Forces of the village of Robotyne on both flanks, in fact, not only leaves no sense for the enemy to hold it, but also quite likely can lead to the Armed Forces making way to the main line of the enemy's defense on a fairly wide front. starting with Novoprokopivka and ending with Verbove.  
Considering the fact that the advancing units of the Armed Forces east of the village have already advanced to the enemy's main line of defense and continue to expand this wedge, the issue of advancing the Armed Forces along the road T-04-08 from Novodanilivka to Novoprokopivka (that is, from the other, western side of the village of Robotyne) becomes of special importance...  
The enemy equipped this local line of strongpoints along several long forest strips that stretch from the western outskirts of the village of Robotyne all the way to Kopany itself...  
The units of the enemy's 291st motorized rifle regiment (msp) are defending here. During the past 3 days, the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to dislodge its units from these fortified positions on certain sections of the defense area of this regiment... In fact, thus creating conditions for bypassing the village of Robotyne not only from the east, but also from the west...  
Moreover, as far as I understand, the enemy took these actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (regarding the bypass of Robotina from the west) quite seriously... That is why the battalion of the 810th Infantry Regiment, transferred here from the Myrne region, appeared in the rear of the enemy's 291st Infantry Division. And judging by everything, in this sense he will clearly not be the last...  
So far, the main efforts of the enemy are concentrated precisely in the direction of Robotyne - Novoprokopivka (there are units of at least 2 ""motorized rifle"" regiments of territorial troops\\msp TrV - 1430th and more ""fresh"" 1441th)... but, it is obvious that the issue of both flanks of this main offensive direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquires special importance for the enemy...",False,1692256427.0,t3_15tc7lt,t3_15tc7lt,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

Upon arrival at Indian ports, the cost of a barrel of oil rises to $66.

Putin's invasion is an attempt to restore the Russian Empire and should be seen as a global attack on the universal principles and the basis of the global security order: in particular, international law and the Westphalian principles. In this regard, the Ukrainian plan looks much more strategically thought out and realistic than the constant suicide proposals of Western politicians: we need to consolidate the Western military-industrial complex to ensure a powerful Ukrainian military fist; Russia must suffer a complete military fiasco and lose all occupied territories; Putin must be left with nothing and lose his intra-elite legitimacy, with the subsequent debunking of the cult of personality. Post-Putin Russia has a chance for a liberal transformation only in one case - if it loses this war completely.""

2. Ukraine is now sending the more elite units (with Western training and prime equipment) prepared for exploiting breakthroughs forward, despite lacking a clear breakthrough to exploit.

So both sides are going all-in, now. This, combined with the amount of degradation of Russian logistics and equipment, makes me think we're in for some serious fireworks this autumn.

Regarding the recent news of the small Ukrainian landing on the eastern side of Dnipro river, it seems if a reliable supply line such as a pontoon bridge across the river was established, massed Ukrainian forces could be supported logistically which could open up a new front. However this would require a bridge that is not constantly threatened by artillery and air power.

What is the main threat to establishing a Ukrainian bridgehead supported by a pontoon bridge? Russian artillery, cruise missiles or other air attacks?

If Russian artillery is the main threat, how far do the Russians need to be pushed back from the Dnipro to prevent artillery strikes on a pontoon bridge supply line? Could this be accomplished with a small commando force by taking a few small towns? Or would this be impossible without a massive Russian defeat in the area beforehand?

Can Russian air attacks on a pontoon bridge supply line be protected against?

Essentially I'm asking if it is at all possible for the Ukrainians to be able to mass forces here for a new front.

As you can see I am clearly a noob in the art of military tactics, I look forward to being put in my place (educationally speaking!).

Thwarted by minefields, Ukrainian forces won’t reach the southeastern city of Melitopol, a vital Russian transit hub, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment.

> The grim assessment is based on Russia’s brutal proficiency in defending occupied territory through a phalanx of minefields and trenches, and is likely to prompt finger pointing inside Kyiv and Western capitals about why a counteroffensive that saw tens of billions of dollars of Western weapons and military equipment fell short of its goals.

> Ukraine’s forces, which are pushing toward Melitopol from the town of Robotyne more than 50 miles away, will remain several miles outside of the city, U.S. officials said. U.S., Western and Ukrainian government officials interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.

> The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.

> Melitopol is critical to Ukraine’s counteroffensive because it is considered the gateway to Crimea.

At the moment, to counteract the further negative development of the situation in these areas, the enemy has the opportunity to QUICKLY use 4 formations...  
\- 100th separate reconnaissance brigade (one of its battalions has already deployed on the main line of defense in the Verbove area)  
\- At least 2 battalions from the 810th Infantry Regiment, one of which has already been deployed in the area of defense of the enemy's 291st Infantry Regiment  
\- the 108th infantry division, which will obviously ALREADY (or in the near future) be put into battle east of the village of Robotyne  
\- And finally, to launch an ""improvised barricade squad"" in the form of the 249th separate motorized special purpose battalion of the FSVNG ""Rossgvardiya"" ""Akhmat-Yug""...  
In order to continue increasing efforts in this direction, at least at the regiment/brigade level, the enemy command will need at least 2-3 days...  
The most likely option will be the use of 1-2 brigades from the 35th combined army (ZVA), most likely the 64th omsbr, or the 69th separate cover brigade (orrp), possibly the 177th separate marine regiment (op MP) of the 58th ZVA... from the so far unattacked areas in the Southern operational zone (Polohy area)...  
There is another option - to remove at least one brigade (the 34th omsbr, or the 5th separate tank \\otbr or the 336th abr MP) from the Berdyansk direction...  
But, both in the first and second cases, this is a certain risk for the Russian command for two reasons:  
\- As soon as the Ukrainian command establishes the fact of the movement of some formation from the 35th ZVA from near the city of Polohy to neighboring directions (and it will do so without fail, and in online mode), there is no guarantee that it will not be immediately activated and there...  
\- Well, the option with the Staromlynivsk (aka - Berdyansk) direction is also a certain risk, because the Ukrainian offensive did not ""exhaust"" there either, but after the liberation of the village of Urozhane gained a new momentum... and there are enough options for it continued in a very unfavorable form for the enemy...  
In the near future, most likely, one more regiment of the 7th dshd - the 56th dshp will appear in the Orykhiv direction...which will obviously ""subsume"" from the Dnipro military unit to the Vostok military unit as it deploys in the Crimean - Taurian direction of the regiments of the 70th MSD. And in this way, the entire 7th dshd will gather here...  
Thus, we can state several things about the operational situation in the Southern Operational Zone:  
\- The Ukrainian command is deliberately ""increasing the tension of the enemy's reserve ropes""... Active offensive actions only in 2 (TWO) directions - Tokmak and Berdyansk, are already causing the enemy certain troubles with reserve formations. But in this sense, obviously, the Armed Forces can potentially ""add"" 2 more, and then, if necessary, 1 more direction...  
\- Yes, this is also influencing Armed Forces (because they also have to use additional troops/forces for this). But the scale is not even comparable to the Russian one... because in this matter, not only the quantitative dimension (the amount of forces and means involved), but also the qualitative one (that is, the level of combat capability) is important. Because of this, where the Armed Forces manage with one formation of the regiment/brigade level, the enemy is forced to use 2, or even 3 ""equal"" formations...  
\- Moreover, it is obvious that there is a direct correlation between the terms of active actions of the Armed Forces in the southern operational-strategic direction and the quality (level of combat capability) of the enemy's formations. He is objectively forced to shorten the terms of ""restoration"", ""replenishment"" and ""preparation"" of his reserve formations, because his need for them is ""by no means"" decreasing... but only growing... Moreover, he needs them HERE and NOW, not once ""in 2-3 months""... A vivid example - the enemy has already drawn into his ""active"" troop grouping on the territory of Ukraine units and units from the strategic reserves, the formation and deployment of which he has NOT yet FINISHED .  
In conclusion, let me remind you... all ropes have a limit of tension that they can withstand, even steel ropes. Of course, taking into account the size of the human resources of the Russian Federation and taking into account the probability of another mobilization ""in the swamps""... we can assume that losing almost a battalion every day killed and wounded... the Russian army can afford it, for a long time.. .But in this sense, it is always worth remembering - in this case, the probability of a skewed balance between the quantity (volume) and quality (level of combat capability) of its formations increases sharply...",False,1692256438.0,t3_15tc7lt,t1_jwjnjw1,,1,68,0,68,0,0,

It sounds like Russia is only going to be using passenger aircraft to move material internally. Now, could they be lying? Obviously. But the powers that be would have to figure out what to with evidence that, say, China or NK or Iran are loading weapons onto civilian flights to Russia.

Question: if NATO can somehow acquire evidence that their are military munitions onboard a passenger flight, does that make it a valid military target? (Just speaking legally; yes, it would be horrible to shoot down an airliner full of civilians.)

Edit: I just realized that there will no doubt be a few civilian planes being ""shot down"" (in reality, false flag sabotage or just accidents). Shit.

That sound grim for their chances, I hope in spite of it they pull it off.

Rather than change their plan and use that brigade for a task they were not meant to do.

The main problem I see with this is that this brigade can be used to train other Ukranian brigades and they might be absent when Ukraine needs them the most, like if an unexpected breakthrough happens. GLSDBs are supposed to arrive in Fall, maybe September. Why not wait until they arrive and they pummel the Russian rear enough? A breakthrough by the brigades that are supposed to do it is more likely to happen then.

I hope this happened because objective logical adaptations by the high command of the UA and not because of the need for a big win to please western observers.

The Ka-52s were used fairly heavily at the start of the conflict when most of the Ukrainian engagements were infantry-heavy but underequipped, then petered off once the AFU were flooded with MANPADS.   The Ka-52s, being anti-vehicle focused, couldn't use the full capability and range of their weapons, and were thus forced to draw close to provide air support.  That put them right in the crosshairs of the AFU MANPADS that followed the troop movements.  Enough damage was done to force the Russians to back off using them, and they became a minor factor for awhile.

When the Ukrainians switched over to high-mobility vehicle assaults for the start of the second counteroffensive, the pendulum (temporarily) swung back in the Ka-52's favor, since that made their standoff-range weapons effective again while keeping them out (mostly) of harm's way, as most of the infantry-based Ukrainian MANPADS anti-air assets couldn't keep pace.  When the Ukrainians returned to the slower infantry-heavy assault tactics with attritional battle plans and heavy MANPADS support, that meant the Ka-52s had to swing back to closing in and taking risks.   

What's making life difficult for the Russians now is that the threat of the heavily mechanized Ukrainian units are back in play, which means the Kamovs will be pressed to serve on the front as one of the few consistently effective anti-vehicle weapon the Russians have besides their rapidly diminishing tank force and artillery.

Assuming they are not Russian trolls and bots, which given that you're on twitter is a decent chance. . . 

People expect war to be like a sporting event with significant gains every week, unfortunately. People have short attention spans and aren't as plugged into the actual ground realities of war. For every Sherman's march to the sea or Normandy breakthrough in Falaise, there's months of slog beforehand in Tennessee or the Bocage; for every Dnieper-Carpathian offensive, there's a Mius–Donets offensive that was a difficult slog beforehand.

This sort of thinking existed in the US and UK in 1944 and 1945 when looking back, it was clearly evident that the war was won in hindsight. Germany and Japan both had a snowball's chance in hell of turning the tide. It was just a matter of time. I strongly feel we're in a similar zeitgeist.

Many people also don't see the long term picture to this war. We, in the collective west, all naturally have a bias of Russia being a place that deserves to exist (as it has existed since the 15th century or earlier as an independent entity). It makes it difficult to accept the reality that despite being the more populous and larger nation, it failed so brazenly at its strategic objectives that its ability to recover from this war is not a guarantee. 

If the war ended today, yes, Russia would have new (economically dubious) territory but at the cost of a large proportion of its inherited soviet war chest, its economy, all of its political capital on the world stage, brain-drain, and a non-insignificant number of its young men. It would be one thing if it had spent those resources on becoming a world hegemon, able to challenge the US and China, but it's clear Russia did not even come close to that geopolitical objective. It's strengthened its geopolitical foes; weakened its allies and itself. All at the low, low cost of its future. It mortgaged the house to bet on black and lost.

If the US wouldn't do it for Sweden, there's no way in hell they'll do it for Ukraine, short of NATO membership.

The objective seems to have been to reach Melitipol, cutting off land access to to Crimea for the Russian army, but Ukraine has not made significant progress towards that objective.

Some sources have said that the U.S. and U.K. Advisors anticipated this during war game sessions, but recommended Ukraine push forward at a single front regardless of losses to try to create a breakthrough. Ultimately it was Ukraines decision though and Ukraine seems to have decided to limit losses and wage a slower, more methodical push against multiple areas of the Southern line. 

Ukraine is still destroying Russian equipment at a 3:1 ratio to their own losses, which is pretty incredible while on the offensive. I don’t think many expect Ukraine to have a decisive breakthrough, and Ukraine has committed their formerly held back reserves just this week, so they chance for them to push to Melitipol is probably gone.

Ukraine has had positive results recently in Robotyne and Urozhaine, they may be able to use that to push forward and cut off some Russian supply routes, but they’ve stalled out in their attempts to retake area around Bahkmut.

Impossible to say without detailed data.  If that data were public the leak would be its own news.  Even with excellent data there is still a wide uncertainty in wars.  

Predictions posted on reddit or social media are nearly a random spread. As with dice you can call out numbers.  Those who get the right number decide they are prophets.  Those who are only slightly off see that their methods were sound.  Those who are way off correctly say that that dice are random. 

Realistically years.  Plus or minus a few years.  I predict that future historians will look at this time period and say that ""signs of the outcome were emerging"".

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/06/30/valery-zaluzhny-ukraine-general-interview/

>For Ukraine’s counteroffensive to progress faster, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the top officer in Ukraine’s armed forces, says he needs more — of every weapon. And he is telling anyone who will listen, including his American counterpart, Gen. Mark A. Milley, as recently as Wednesday, that he needs those resources now.

>In a rare, wide-ranging interview with The Washington Post, Zaluzhny expressed frustration that while his biggest Western backers would never launch an offensive without air superiority, Ukraine still has not received modern fighter jets but is expected to rapidly take back territory from the occupying Russians. American-made F-16s, promised only recently, are not likely to arrive until the fall — in a best-case scenario.

>His troops also should be firing at least as many artillery shells as their enemy, Zaluzhny said, but have been outshot tenfold at times because of limited resources.

>So it “pisses me off,” Zaluzhny said, when he hears that Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive in the country’s east and south has started slower than expected — an opinion publicly expressed by Western officials and military analysts and also by President Volodymyr Zelensky, though Zaluzhny was not referring to Zelensky. His troops have gained some ground — even if it’s just 500 meters — every day, he said.

-

>The questions that weigh on him daily: When will Ukraine’s Western partners provide the arms he needs, particularly more ammunition and the F-16s? And how can he be expected to get the job done without them?

>Zaluzhny said he relays his concerns to Milley, whom he has grown to deeply admire and considers a friend, several times per week in conversations that can last hours. “He shares them absolutely. And I think he can help me get rid of those worries,” Zaluzhny said, adding that he told Milley on Wednesday how many more artillery shells he needs per month.

-

>But Zaluzhny also pointed to NATO forces’ own doctrine — which parallels Russia’s, he said — that calls for air superiority before launching ground-based deep-reaching operations.

>“And Ukraine, moving to offensive operations, should follow which doctrine?” Zaluzhny said. “NATO's? The Russian Federation's? Or is that none of your business? ‘You have your own doctrine. You have tanks, you have some cannons, you have some [fighting vehicles]. You can do it.’ What is that?”

>In his command post, Zaluzhny has a screen that shows him everything in the air at any given moment — the aviation from NATO countries at Ukraine’s western border, his own planes in the sky over Ukraine, and Russia’s on the eastern edges. “Let’s just say the number of aircraft that are on duty near our western borders is twice as much as the number of Russian aircraft devastating our positions. Why can’t we take at least a third of it from there and move it here?” Zaluzhny asked.

>Because Russia’s more modern fleet of Su-35s have a far superior radar and missile range, Ukraine’s older jets cannot compete. Troops on the ground are easily targeted as a result.",False,1692322404.0,t3_15tc7lt,t1_jwmuo5r,,2,-4,0,-4,0,0,

And the US military assessment was that the counter-offensive would play out largely like it has, slow advances against a sea of mines, and hardened defenses. So I'd say the odds of them being correct about how things will go in the future is most likely fairly accurate. This doesn't mean the counter-offensive is a failure by any rate, far from it.
