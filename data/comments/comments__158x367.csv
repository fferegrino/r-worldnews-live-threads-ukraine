 The Associated Press reports, citing unnamed US officials, that the administration of US President Joe Biden will send additional $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

These funds are allocated under the so-called ""presidential drawdown authority"" - a scheme that allows Biden to release funds without the approval of Congress.

According to the agency, the new package will include:

▪️Batch of nanodrones for Hornet observation.

▪️Missiles for HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems and NASAMS air defense systems.

▪️Hydra-70 air-to-ground missiles.

▪️Stinger and Javelin anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles.

▪️32 Stryker armored vehicles.

▪️Shells for howitzers.

▪️28 million rounds for firearms.

▪️ Subversives.

As the agency recalls, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States has already provided more than $41 billion in military assistance to Kyiv.

>  
>U.N. officials have not been able to visit Olenivka or Russia-occupied areas of the east because Russia had not provided necessary security guarantees or permission. But U.N. human rights investigators were able to interview 55 Ukrainian survivors of the blast over a period of four months starting in September 2022, including eight who were in a barracks building demolished by the blast. The investigators also analyzed and had access to satellite imagery of the detention center before and after the explosion, as well as videos and photos from inside and outside it.  
>  
>Experts concluded a HIMARS rocket would have inflicted much greater damage than that observed at Olenivka, Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turk said. The barracks hit by the explosion suffered only partial damage to the roof, walls, ceilings and windows, while satellite imagery did not reveal any craters or debris near the building. Moreover, bunks and other furniture that “would have been completely decimated” by a HIMARS rocket also sustained only partial damage, she said.  
>  
>“The prisoners of war who were injured or died at Olenivka, and their family members, deserve the truth to be known,” Mr. Turk said in the statement, “and for those responsible for breaches of international law to be held accountable.”

Even the worst-case scenario for Ukraine—minimal vehicle losses in Novostepne—still is good news. The strike at the very least should compel the Russians to disperse their logistical infrastructure in southern Ukraine, which would disrupt and slow vehicle repairs.

It's happening in multiple areas simultaneously, meaning they are weakening both Russian supply lines and fronts along a huge amount of the entire southern region, and now directly back into Bakhmut itself.

And it's working. We're starting to see notable breakthroughs of the entrenched Russian defenses on 3 fronts now...

1. On a direct path to Tokmak
2. South of Kherson and the Dnipro river (which saw a major breakthrough within the past 2 days, possibly pointing to a weakened western front line)
3. Back into Bakhmut itself, a huge logistical hub now housing 50,000 Russian troops is now under direct assault by Ukraine, with major steps being taken to encircle it.

These 3 movements alone are crucial and don't even take into account the long range poundings Russian bases, supply routes, and ammo Depots in Crimea have taken in just the past 2 weeks. This counter offensive isn't just one movement in a single territory. It's a push along nearly the entire south and south eastern war front.

I'll repeat what I've said here several times in the past few weeks; do not be fooled by the slow daily changes on UALivemap. The damage that's being done to the entire Russian front in the war right now is irreparably costly, and there are several months left before the next cold season for Ukraine to do oh so much worse. The daily casualty rates keep climbing to new heights on the Russian side, while the only territory they've gained recently at all are low altitude basins and valleys where their forces end up being sitting ducks to newly supplied artillery fire and cluster munitions.

Russian defenses and terror tactics may be buying them time, but that time is becoming incredibly costly and seems to get more expensive every day. Eventually the manpower and resource debt to buy said time could run too too high. And every km of territory Russia loses puts them at more of a disadvantage.",1690268190.0,1690267738.0,t3_158x367,t3_158x367,,0,93,0,93,0,0,

Putin really does intend to rule like a king during the feudal period. Every region will have a small military and the king will summon the banners of the lords in order to fight his wars. Russia doesn't have a strong system of rule of law and allowing everyone with any semblance of power to have their own military caries some pretty obvious risks. It's developments like this that actually make me very bullish on long-term Ukrainian victory.

>The Ukrainian soldiers trained in Germany, especially the young cadets, had understood “the operational principles of fire and movement” well. However, as soon as they returned to Ukraine they were being commanded by officers who did not operate according to Western procedures.

He also maintain that Ukraine counteroffensive is still in its relatively early days.  But on the same day, Russian president asserted that Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed.  How successful do you think Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been so far, in terms of regaining territory from the Russian forces?

> MR MILLER:  Let me step back and say, without respect to this counteroffensive, that’s right, Ukraine has already regained – it depends – if you look at the – if you include Crimea, it’s somewhere – Ukraine has regained somewhere around 45 percent of its territory.  If you look at the post-2014, not including Crimea, it’s somewhere around 61 percent of its territory since the launch of the full-scale invasion.  So, Ukraine has already been incredibly successful in regaining territory that Russia had temporarily occupied.  With respect to the counteroffensive, I am not going to provide commentary about it from this podium.  As I’ve said in the past, we will leave that to the Ukrainian military.

> I will reiterate, from our perspective, that Ukraine has everything it needs to conduct this counteroffensive.  We have supplied them with an enormous amount of military equipment, as have our allies and partners both in Europe and around the world, and we will continue to do so.

Both AA and artillery pieces destroyed increased since May

* Multiple reports of Russian soldiers lacking artillery support.
* Last year there were reports on Russia is short on shells, and did buy from North Korea, Iran and from former Soviet states.

Add Ukrainian hits on bridges, railway hubs, ammo depots.

Russia is losing over 600 artillery pieces per month. I'll say it is hard for Russia to replace them in the field. It is unsustainable.

Add training of artillery soldiers.

I believe Bulba when he say there soon will be a retreat.

I'll add one thing. Compare this year's counter offensive to last year in Kherson:

[https://deepstatemap.live/en#9/46.8743/33.2405](https://deepstatemap.live/en#9/46.8743/33.2405)

Use the time tool and set it to May 2022. Step forward.

Slow process in May to August. The same this year.

Some progress in September. Little more in October. And a big push in November.

The counter offensive this year is not much slower than last year.

Send more ammo and weapons to Ukraine. Send those jets, ATACMS, glsdb, Abrams, cluster bombs. It is well spent tax money.

Kerch bridge will go down, command posts will get hit, ammo depots, fuel depots, equipment reserves, bridges, rail hubs will get hit.

Increase sanctions. Stop sanction evasion.

If this was a ""normal"" war, Ukraine would send 30,000 troops towards Belgorod, bypass it quickly and march towards Moscow. Russia would be forced to withdraw most of their forces from Ukraine or have to use tactical nukes on their own territory. Russia would not be able to hold the long frontline within Ukraine under such conditions.

But it's not a normal war, the conditions are set from the outside and are not favorable for Ukraine. They have to get through dense minefields and prepared fortifications nearly everywhere, and they have to do it without air superiority and with only limited air and artillery support.

Medium-size cities like Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Bakhmut have been largely favorable defensive conditions, so Ukraine has stood its ground in them and forced Russia to exchange lives and materiel at high rates. By giving up land when conditions are bad, Ukraine makes sure it’s spending as much time as possible at “positive” exchange rates, sparing lives, morale, equipment and supplies.

Russia, on the other hand, has had the opposite approach: territorial gains at any cost. This plays well into Ukraine’s strategy, because Russians will seek to push territorial advantages until they can’t any more—usually when Ukraine has found more favorable defensive ground, eg the heights to the west of Bakhmut, and punished them severely.

Believing that, I don’t see the size of the territorial gains Russia is making in the north as very meaningful without also knowing what the casualty rates and materiel losses are, which we don’t.

So they have fresh supplies of cannon fodder.  They can also use tanks there for technical reasons more successfully.

They have little motivation to *hold* the ground they gain—no bonuses for holding—so they sacrifice men, supplies, technical equipment, guns in order to constantly regain, every few days.

Steele ran an investigation dubbed ""Project Charlemagne"", which noted Russian interference in the domestic politics of France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.[10] In April 2016, Steele concluded that Russia was engaged in an information warfare campaign with the goal of destroying the European Union.[10]",1690339827.0,1690339181.0,t3_158x367,t1_jtgxdny,,2,31,0,31,0,0,

Christopher Steele is the person who created the ""Steele Dossier"" which described Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US Presidential election in Trump's favor -- the dossier that claimed that there existed a ""pee tape"" of Trump that Russia could use to threaten and control the President, if Trump won (which he did).

[CNN Politics interviewed Steele in October 2021.](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/17/politics/christopher-steele-dossier-trump/index.html) TL;DR: Steele stands by his findings in the dossier, saying they are *mostly* true.

> “I think the first and most important (reason) is that **the problems we identified back in 2016 haven’t gone away, and arguably have actually got worse**, and I thought it was important to come and set the record straight,” Steele said.

> Steele’s unverified dossier became one of the most controversial aspects of the FBI’s investigation into Trump and Russia that led to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. **Many of the claims, such as the so-called “pee tape,” were never proven**, despite the FBI’s efforts to verify salacious allegations and years of congressional investigators looking into the claims involving the former president and Russia.

> Mueller’s report also concluded that another allegation Steele made – that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen traveled to Prague in 2016 to meet with Russian officials – was untrue.

> Steele reinforced his belief that most of the claims made in the dossier are accurate.

> “I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,” Steele said.

> Mueller, Steele argued, “was working to beyond-reasonable-doubt-level of evidence in criminal cases and prosecutions. And in much intelligence work, you never get to the point where you’re 99% certain of the evidence to secure a conviction.”

IMO Trump *acted* like Putin had *something* on him.

[Trump sides with Putin over US intelligence (CNN July 2018)](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-putin-helsinki-summit/index.html)

> Helsinki, Finland  
> CNN  
 — 
> US President Donald Trump, in a stunning rebuke of the US intelligence community, declined on Monday to endorse the US government’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, saying he doesn’t “see any reason why” Russia would be responsible.

> Instead, **Trump – standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin – touted Putin’s vigorous denial** and pivoted to complaining about the Democratic National Committee’s server and missing emails from Hillary Clinton’s personal account.

> **“I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,”** Trump said during a joint news conference **after he spent about two hours in a room alone with Putin, save for a pair of interpreters.**

> Trump’s statements amounted to an unprecedented refusal by a US president to believe his own intelligence agencies over the word of a foreign adversary and drew swift condemnation from across the partisan divide.

This might be pure rationalizing -- but my *theory* is that Biden is working with a fixed budget and is trying to allocate the most cost-effective weapons -- calculus which takes into account the state of the war on one hand, and on the other hand, the cost of weapons the US could provide. 

I'm not sure of my facts.

With ATACMS, complicating the issue is the relatively small US arsenal and the possible need for the weapon elsewhere. 

[NYTimes July 11, 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/world/europe/atacms-missiles-ukraine-us.html)

> American defense officials have warned that their arsenal of ATACMS is relatively small, and the missiles have been committed for other Pentagon war plans, in places including the Korean Peninsula. Only about 4,000 ATACMS have been manufactured since the missile was developed in the 1980s, a Lockheed Martin spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

> Giving them to Ukraine would risk readiness in the other hot spots.

> Shortly after Ukraine launched its counteroffensive last month, **House Republicans formally called on the Biden administration to “immediately” send ATACMS to Ukraine,** noting that other allies have already donated their own long-range missiles.

That's not what Russia is trying to achieve in Luhansk-Kharkiv. They are trying to fix Ukrainian counteroffensive units into defensive positions so that they cannot be used in the south.

From [yesterday's r/credibledefense thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1588ny5/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_24_2023/jtamuvs/):

>What caught my eye in the Twitter post is that the 32rd has been committed there. So that's another Bde of the 10th Corps that was meant to be used for this offensive that's been committed. Note, it was not meant to hold the line in Luhansk, but to support the strategic objective of liberating the South. So that's troublesome.

>**Russia seems to be duplicating what Ukraine did during the spring summer '22 Donbas offensive at Kharkiv and Kherson April-July, they're committing reserves to a counteroffensive to act as a supporting attack to fix as many Ukrainian units and resources so they can't be used offensively.** ""The best defense is a good offense."" That's a very Soviet way of thinking, not a stupid one either. Especially if it works.

In this respect, capture of territory is not actually the goal. The goal is to put pressure on Ukraine in a region where Ukraine doesn't want to reinforce with extra troops.

For one, mobiks in Luhansk mostly don’t have their phones, don’t see telegram (as a news source) and are rather clueless about whether gaining/losing ground.  Or that there’s even money to be had.

Second, it’s mostly officers who are awarded the bonuses.

Third, yes some money goes to the battalion as a whole, regardless of which unit in the battalion is responsible for the gains.

Fourth, just yesterday, I was reading that it has become common since the phones are already held by command at the field hq, and because bonuses are transferred via a payroll app.  It’s lately become common to seize the money that those in the battalion were granted—sometimes half is taken, sometimes all is taken.  Junior officers disclosed this to anti-war outlets because, basically, jr officers aren’t as corrupt and still are naive/idealistic; they says that what’s being actually done with those seized funds has been obscured from them, ie, what the senior officers are doing with it—but the senior RF officers in Luhansk are *saying* they’re using it to get more equipment.  There’s major retaliation in this, because if anyone complains, they’re immediately sent to front and not heard from again.  Then not even marked as MIA so that all of their share can be seized, or at least such people haven’t been marked *yet.*  Sidenote—it’s unlikely that is why the funds are seized.  Since when does a RF battalion commander organize and finance his own supplies?  It’s not unheard of, but it’s just not likely.  It’s more likely that stealing it, but marking it as donating it to battalion, and sending those soldiers to their death. 

Russian MOD has had the bonuses-for-advancement scheme in Luhansk for many months.  But this specific likely-graft has only been happening for a month or two.  Or at least that’s when the jr officers caught on to it.",1690311830.0,1690311404.0,t3_158x367,t1_jtf0t81,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

This is just from looking at maps, have you, but Popsana looks to me like the an almost mirror image of Bakhmut.

Offensively for the Ukrainians it's not a very valuable position.  It'd be nice to have if what you need to do, operationally, is stop a Russian advance, but spending too much power to take it is probably a bad idea.  It doesn't help you get anywhere but the next town in the urban belt.

From the Russian perspective, Popsana is a good place to attack from.  Your staging place for future attacks is secured, and it could threaten several other areas.

If I was a Ukrainian commander, I'd probe Popsana, maybe see if it can be taken with little conflict.  But, if the Russians want to keep it, let them.  I don't want to attack in that direction anyway.

But that window was in the 90s, and during that decade, almost everyone was suddenly impoverished. People's only concern at this time was getting food to last another day, avoiding the many organized criminal gangs and corrupt police (corrupt to such a degree that makes modern Russian police look utopian in comparison). People had no concept of democracy or free markets, of personal wealth, of voicing their opinions. They had no idea how the western world worked. 

Yelchin was obviously a buffoon though and it's easy to see how Putin quickly became seen as a savior. While he was quite unknown to the public in his first year or two, the changes that people experienced very quickly spoke loudly. The criminal gangs disappeared, the economy stabilized, people started living better lives, the Chechen crisis was solved, and police started to become more effective. Of course in hindsight we understand that the economy was more due to rising oil prices, and that the disappearance of gangs is more due to Putin's own gang becoming the biggest and baddest and killing off all the others. But at the time, people only knew what they could see and experience around them, and until 2008 it was mostly a time of optimism, freedom, and relief that the darkest times were behind. 

By that point, it was already too late. The FSB was already in control of everything - the media, the courts, the judiciary, the National Guard. With over a million members of the police and national guard, not to mention the military, it would have taken pretty much the whole country to rise up at the time when people were desperate to hold onto what seemed like the best condition that Russia had been in, perhaps ever. 

In 2012 and 2013, hundreds of thousands of Russians protested Putin's return, and the beginning of the violent police state began. The few real opposition leaders began getting arrested or killed, and finally with Nemtsov out of the picture the was no longer an opposition. 

Popular uprisings need at least one of the following things to be successful: military / paramilitary support, or opposition governments, or foreign support, or the ability to easily organize and coordinate action. I'm yet to see any popular uprising in history around the world in the last 100 years that defies this principle. Russians have had none of these things. For reference, Ukraine had all four of those things during Euromaidan.
