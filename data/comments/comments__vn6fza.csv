👉 In the north near Kharkiv the war remains a stalemate though russia does continue to lob missiles at the city; last night hitting an electrical substation.  Just a reminder that /u/SaberFlux does a daily report from Kharkiv if you are interested in first hand accounts from one of Reddit's own.

👉 In the east near Lysychansk there are conflicting reports about whether Ukraine is defending the city or performing a fighting tactical retreat.  With the city nearly surrounded by russian troops and supply lines nearly cut off, defending the city is, at this point, almost super-human.  If anyone can hold the city, its Ukraine; however, you should consider the city contested and not be surprised if a tactical retreat is announced over the next few days.

👉 In the south-east, there are continued reports russia is moving troops from the Donbas and Mariupol to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson areas to bolster their troops against a growing Ukraine threat.  

👉 In the south around Kherson, everything is quiet -- too quiet.  On the 28^th, its reported that Ukraine liberated Zeliny Hai, and Barvinok -- both just to the north of Kherson.  For an idea of how close Ukraine is to Kherson now, [this map is helpful](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWXjCVcXkAIVx93?format=jpg&name=4096x4096).

👉 In the south around Snake Island (also known as Ziminy Island) there were reports of up to 15 Ukrainian strikes on the island.  Control of the island would allow Ukraine to substantially impair russia's ability to blockade Odessa thanks to western harpoon missiles.

👉 The big news of the day is that Turkey withdrew its objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO. The process is expected to begin at the forthcoming NATO summit in Madrid.  This allows me to break out one of my all-time [favorite comics](https://i.redd.it/so5nz3han5z81.jpg).

👉 As Ukraine [published the names and photos](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1541693527104667648?s=20&t=-mbJ5JZfJIpmSmD2cwmfyQ) of the pilots who flew the bombers on the mall attack yesterday, there were [loud, impressive explosions](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1541880736747339776.html) at the airport in Kursk russia.

Day 126 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today some residential districts were shelled again during the day, at around 12pm, some people got injured, but thankfully nobody died. The usual missile strike actually didn’t happen at 11pm today; instead they fired their missiles at 1am. At first we thought that maybe there would be no missiles today, but they were just late.

They fired 6 missiles, 4 of which landed somewhere in the city and 2 in oblast, no fires started this time. In their yesterday’s missile strike they hit some factory, which made parts for farm machinery. That was the place where a big fire started. 

They also hit a residential district Pavlove Pole, they didn’t even aim at anything, the missile hit some random road and made a deep crater. It also broke all of the windows in buildings nearby, if that missile landed just 10 meters to the side from where it hit, it would have leveled an apartment building. How are they even choosing their targets? 

Today they also destroyed an apartment building with a missile in Mykolaiv, killing 5 people, but of course Russia will say it didn’t happen, even though it was caught on video. Just today Putin also said that they didn’t hit any mall Kremenchuck, and that they don’t hit civilian infrastructure at all. 

First they said it was an ammo depot, and that it wasn’t open at the time, even though we have a ton of evidence debunking that. Then they said it wasn’t and ammo depot, and that it was hit by the blast wave from the explosion which destroyed it, and now Putin says that it wasn’t hit at all by anything. Why can’t they at least just choose one story and not change it multiple times per day?",False,1656556148.0,t3_vn6fza,t3_vn6fza,,0,80,0,80,1,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 29 June 2022
 
- Russian forces continue to make incremental advances in their efforts to encircle the town of Lysychansk. Since 25 June 2022, Russian forces have advanced a further 2km near the Lysychansk oil refinery, south of the town.



- There is a realistic possibility the missile strike on the Kremenchuk shopping centre on 27 June 2022 was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target. Russia's inaccuracy in conducting long range strikes has previously resulted in mass civilian casualty incidents, including at Kramatorsk railway station on 9 April 2022.



- Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target.



- It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian frontline forces. Russia's shortage of more modern precision strike weapons and the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners will highly likely result in further civilian casualties.

NATO has been “naive” in its relations with Russia over the years, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told CNN on Wednesday.

Speaking from the NATO summit in Madrid, Sánchez said that NATO is “sending a clear message to Putin, which is that we are going to support Ukraine, and we are ready to support Ukraine until the Russian troops leave the country and they respect the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of Ukraine.” 

“I think it is important to send this message of unity and determination of the international community, especially NATO allies, and of course the G7, in order to make possible to return to a scenario where different countries – especially Russia in this case – respect a rules-based international order, which is undermined because of this terrible war in Ukraine,” Sánchez continued.

Reacting to Turkey’s agreement to support Finland and Sweden’s NATO membership bid, Sánchez said that “the entrance of Finland and Sweden in NATO is not because they want to expand their territories but to defend their values, their democracies, and of course, an international order based on rules, clear rules, that provide certainty and security to our societies.”

Asked whether it was a mistake to consider Russia a “strategic partner” even in 2010, Sánchez said that at that time, NATO had “tried to give Russia and Putin an opportunity,” but that “perhaps, over the years, we’ve been a bit naive in our relations with Russia."" 

“Nowadays, we’re seeing expansionist and imperialism behavior by Putin and his regime, and this is something unacceptable,” he added. 

“I think it is important what we are now approving in this Madrid summit, which is to define Russia as a strategic threat for the allies, and define what are the means, the instruments that we are going to put in place in order to respond to this global threat,” Sánchez said.

Spain has sent 400 tons of “military capacities” as well as humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he added.

By security and defence editor Deborah Haynes

The UK will commit an extra 1,000 troops to help defend Estonia, on top of 2,000 British forces already in the Baltic state, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has said.

The extra battle group will be based in the UK and deploy forward if needed.

A few hundred more soldiers will also be sent to Estonia to help create a new military headquarters.

The moves are part of Britain's contribution to a NATO-wide plan, agreed at a landmark summit in Madrid, to shore up its defences across the east of the alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Extra warships and jets are set to be used to help shore up wider NATO defences in the region, the defence secretary told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.

""We have now allocated a brigade, which will be another 1,000 (troops) because three battle-groups make a brigade - which is on standby back in the UK,"" he said. 

""We will be moving forward a brigade headquarters… that will be a few hundred people on top of the current 2,000.""

Ukraine is losing in the east but winning in two other areas, defence and security analyst Professor Michael Clarke has said. 

Commenting on a CNN report that White House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine can ever regain the territory Russia has captured (see 8.19 post), he said opinions keep shifting about whether Ukraine will win the war.

""People need to keep an eye on the big picture: this war is going on in three places,"" he said.

Prof Clarke, the former director of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said it looks like the Russians will take the small gap in the eastern Donbas region that is still being contested.

Russian forces already control most of the area.

""The Ukrainians are pulling back, as they need to do - they don't want to get trapped,"" he said.

""Meanwhile, the Ukrainians are attacking north and south of Izyum.

""They're attacking in Kharkiv fairly slowly, and they're making quite big gains in the southwest around Kherson. 

""What the Ukrainians will lose in the Donbas they may well gain in the north and the south.""

He said Ukraine is due to receive more military aid but it will not arrive until the autumn. 

""They are going through a very dangerous period and their thinking I guess is to try and lose as little territory as possible until the pendulum moves in their favour, which is should do later in the summer,"" he said.

""More people in uniform than the Russians have got and more weapons.""

Clarke stressed that Ukrainian forces needed to ""hang on"" until more ammunition arrived.

""They've got to hang on for the next month or so and not be decisively beaten until all this new stuff arrives,"" he said.

""It's always been a dangerous period, and I think we've got to accept that but keep an eye on the big picture.

""They're losing in one place - they're withdrawing in one place; they're winning in two others.""

He added: ""Between now and then they've got to hang on, they've got to lose as little amount of territory as possible because getting it back is not impossible at all but it will require a different sort of war on their part.""

Global exports of semiconductors to Russia have plummeted by 90 percent since the United States and allies slapped export controls on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.

Raimondo, speaking at an annual Commerce Department conference, also said that controls placed on Russia’s aerospace sector were hammering its ability to generate revenue and support military aviation.

“Russia may be forced to ground between half and two-thirds of its commercial aircraft in the next four years in order to cannibalize them for spare parts,” she added.

British surveillance aircrafts could help secure shipping routes to release Ukraine's trapped grain, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said.

Mr Wallace told reporters at the NATO summit in Madrid that Rivet Joint or P8 Poseidon aircrafts could patrol areas of the Black Sea if a deal was done to allow grain ships to leave Ukraine's blockaded ports.

But he played down the prospect of Royal Navy warships being sent to the Black Sea.

He said: ""We have to put this in perspective, even when Ukraine is at full throttle in its ports, it's about three million tonnes a month. They have 23 million tonnes to ship.

""So you've got to sort of manage the expectations. If there's a ceasefire on the Black Sea or there's a safe passage, it's not going to be like 'oh, you can have it for six weeks, isn't it generous of Russia'. I mean, you're going to get out not very much in exchange.

""What the Turks are trying to do is - with the UN - hammer out details with the Russians about doing it.

""This is first and foremost about getting Ukrainian grain out of Ukraine.

""It's not about helping stolen grain, allowing Russian ships with stolen grain out of the Black Sea, because the Ukrainians won't buy that and they are not going to lift things for that.

""So we have to see what we could do. Britain's role in that could be ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), we could help in overwatch, we could help in Rivet Joint, P8s down in the southern part of the Black Sea to protect.

""The Turks have got it pretty covered on mine hunting. We know the disposition of the minefields. So I think all of those things are definitely possible.

""But we're not going to be sending our ships to the Black Sea because that would mean we would ask the Turks to lift the blockade on foreign warships or warships from other fleets.""

---

So first of all, transliteration. If you hadn't noticed, Ukrainian and Russian use the Cyrillic alphabet, not the Latin alphabet, so we need to convert words and names in some way for use in English. For example, Luhans'k is actually called Луганськ in Ukrainian, and Luhansk/Luhans'k is just the Latin alphabet equivalent. However, there are multiple ways to go about this. For example, do you go for something an English speaker would pronounce correctly, or do you go for something more scientific? Or if there are letters that make the same sound, like eta and iota in Greek, do you bother distinguishing them or not? This is where we get the first bit of trivia, Zelenskyy's name. In Ukrainian, in the Cyrillic alphabet, it's unambiguously Зеленський, but that suffix -ський can be anything from -s'kyj (most accurate) to -skyy (official) to -sky (dropping the double letter). The weird part is just that you have y as a vowel followed by y as a consonant, which is where you get all the variations like -skyy, -skiy, -sky, and -skyi.

Next, there's the relationship between Ukrainian and Russian. They're two separate languages both in the East branch of the Slavic languages. So when you hear about Ukraine and Russia having different names for things, think of it as similar to Spanish vs Portuguese. (Spanish vs Catalan is a bit closer politically, but that's also Ibero-Romance vs Gallo-Romance, so they're further apart linguistically) You can have a variety of things like names spelled the same, but pronounced differently, like Lisboa, or names that are really closely related, but distinct, like Fernando vs Hernando. This is where the next bit of trivia comes in. Володимир (Volodymyr) and Владимир (Vladimir) are just the Ukrainian and Russian versions of a name meaning Great Power, so it would be like if a Spanish ruler named Juan and a Portuguese ruler named João were duking it out. Except to make it even *more* ironic, the *expected* version of the Russian name is actually also Володимир, like in Ukrainian, but pronounced differently and transliterated Volodimir. Владимир is actually borrowed from Old Church Slavonic and South Slavic. 

So, finally, the deal with Kyiv. See, Kyiv is one of those *really* old cities in Europe that's been around for so long that the name's evolved with various local languages and has proper translations in them. For example, the Latin name Flōrentia becoming Firenze in Italian or Florence in French (which was borrowed into English). In this case, the city of Kыѥвъ (Kyjevŭ) became Київ in Ukrainian or Киев in Russian. And I want to emphasize here that, while the Ukrainian government very pointedly uses v instead of na for ""in Ukraine"" when writing in Russian, which is the geopolitical equivalent of not using the definite article, that they also just use the name Киев when writing in Russian because that's its name in Russian. The actual motivation behind the ""name change"" is that, since independence, the Ukrainian government has requested that if we're going to borrow a name from a local language, to please make it Київ (Ukrainian) instead of Киев (Russian). It would be sort of like if Catalonia gained independence, then asked that we start calling them Catalunya instead, since that's its name in Catalan.

However, you may notice that, being Ukrainian and Russian, those names are written in the Cyrillic alphabet, not the Latin alphabet. Киев, the old/Russian name, is typically just transliterated Kiev, although Kiyev and Kijev are also reasonable. Meanwhile, Київ, the new/Ukrainian name, is typically just Kyiv, but could also be Kyyiv or Kyjiv. But because transliteration *is* involved, I feel like people get too focused on it as just a ""spelling change"", which is dangerously close to Russian propaganda. Russia actually claims that Ukrainian is just some weird Russian dialect, and not a language of its own. So knowingly or not, talking about it as how the Ukrainians vs the Russians spell/transliterate the *same* name as opposed to having separate names comes really, really close to implying it's just a spelling difference within a language, on the level of color vs colour.

---

tl;dr

* Transliteration's an inexact science, which is why no one can agree on how to spell Zelenskyy's name in English, although Zelenskyy's the official spelling

* Vladimir vs Volodymyr is like John vs Juan, but to make it even funnier, in an alternate timeline, it's possible that Putin's name could have been Volodimir in English, but spelled identically to Volodymyr in Cyrillic

* Kyiv and Kiev are two separate names for the city, not two spellings of the same name, like how you wouldn't call Catalunya the ""Catalan spelling"" of Catalonia

EDIT: One more tl;dr bullet point

* Intentionally or not, calling Kyiv and Kiev just two *spellings*, as opposed to two *names*, is actually playing into Russian propaganda",1656525813.0,1656522026.0,t3_vn6fza,t3_vn6fza,,0,45,0,45,2,0,

This is an evil theory so buckle up.

What if...

The reason for NATO/US/etc. for not sending everything they have is because the overall (secret) aim is not to save Ukraine but to cripple Putin as much as possible?

As in

- if Ukraine gets EVERYTHING in one go, (let's assume) they kick Russia out reasonably quickly, sanctions might get lifted one by one again over time, etc. with Russia surviving reasonably intact.

BUT

- if Ukraine gets arms in small doses Russia keeps being locked in a war that they think they could win and get ground down over time, sanctions bite, economy goes down, etc., so once the war is over Russia is pretty much done for.

In a nutshell: the quantity of support is a fine balance between stopping Russia's advance while maximizing their loss (internally and at the front) and keeping them locked in the conflict, as opposed to really helping Ukraine winning as quickly as possible.

In other words Ukraine soldiers are used to ruin Russia.

P.S.: No, I am not a Russian troll. But from a long-term NATO perspective this would seem logical - if immoral - to me.

Edit: The idea being obviously that a completely ruined Russia is no threat for the foreseeable future/decades. A quickly defated Russia with less internal and military losses might retry the same stunt in a shorter amount of time and remains a big threat.",1656541763.0,1656540905.0,t3_vn6fza,t3_vn6fza,,0,-52,0,-52,0,0,

Especially if this war is going to drag on for years as some experts are predicting, we can’t spend all of that time bolstering troops and ramping up the rhetoric. We should just continue what we are already doing. Public interest will fade and while NATO should still send weapons and aid Ukraine, the rhetoric and saber rattling and tensions will probably dial down. Why put all of this money towards beefing up nato when we have issues going on at home and NATO right now is already capable of destroying Russia in a conventional war. And also, I know I will get downvoted for saying this, The whole reason Russia is invading Ukraine in the first place is because of NATO’s expansion. I am not saying what they are doing is right or what we are doing is wrong. They broke the promise of not invading Ukraine when they gave their nuclear weapons to Russia. And they deserve all of the sanctions and condemnation. So the last thing we need to do is to expand NATO even more.

While more boring than some of the more conspiratorial answers, it seems most probable they get medically retired and replaced like in pretty much any other military. No amount of corruption or nepotism is going to make giving a soldier with an infected stump arm a rifle useful in an offensive war, and even though the Russians are having issues making gains they are still ultimately the ones with the materiel and manpower advantages at this stage in the war, so keeping injured soldiers in the fight is only a waste of supplies on a frontline where every soldier is a logistical burden that needs to pay at least a small dividend for Russia to make gains. Of course, considering its tight grip on the media Russia is going to downplay or censure casualty reports, but I kind of doubt dissapearing that many people would have less risks than just sending them home and flooding the airwaves with bullshit to diminish any mixed feelings seeing them come back with less limbs they left with would have.

>Or what about those suicide trench-diggers from Chernobyl?

As for the trench-diggers, its not like militaries denying assistance to their veterans from injuries caused by their superior's fuckups is unprecedented. I wouldn't be surprised if Russia said ""не супер, не ужасно"" and nothing further came of it.

>These guys must at some stage return home and spread the news what is really going on, or not???

It needs to be remembered that not all of those wounded soldiers are going to come back reformed lovers of peace and tolerance. A lot of them are going to be even more fucked up and nationalistic, channeling their hate towards those that injured them rather than those that put them there in the first place. Those that aren't are going to have a hard time spreading their beliefs around as compared to the cadre of government affiliated news agencies marching lockstep, assuming they didn't just take the safe route and just keep their heads down and mouths shut about the war. Most people have difficulty with the kind of personal sacrifices needed to advocate for a cause like that in an environment so tightly controlled, so a lot of them are bound to just try and move on with their lives and forget the best they can.

I believe all of this uproar over the situation is a Russian propaganda push, intent on isolating Lithuania and creating the appearance of divisiveness in the EU. I'm basing that on Josep Borells' statements at the beginning of the EC meeting. It seems clear that the matter they are trying to clear up is how to impose the sanctions without also restricting the movement of *allowed* shipments.

I'm just posting the relevant bits, as some of it is part of a Q & A period.

>First, in Kaliningrad, there is not a blockade. The Lithuanian administration is implementing the guidelines of the [European] Commission in accordance with our sanctions. But, at the same time, we want to make controls that could prevent any kind of sanctions avoidance, and not preventing the traffic. And the [European] Commission and the European External Action Service are going to review the guidelines in order to clarify that we do not want to block or prevent the traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad. [There are] two objectives: to prevent circumvention of the sanctions; and not to block the traffic. Both things should be possible, and we are working on that.

>Let us clarify: there is no blockade. But there are some goods which are under control and this control has to be implemented in a clever and smart way in order to control the sanctions, but not obstructing the traffic between Kaliningrad and Russia.

>Q. How dangerous is the situation around Kaliningrad at the moment? 

>I do not think it is dangerous, but as I explained, the [European] Commission and the [European] External Action Service are working on guidelines to be sure there are no circumvention to the sanctions and not to create troubles for the transit.

Let me repeat, for those who don't want to read the whole thing:

If you have the proper stuff, you just need to have enough of it in one place and a runaway chain reaction happens. Things then get really, really hot extremely quickly. Which is one way to describe an explosion. 

So building a bomb is largely just acquiring enough of the special stuff, which fortunately for the rest of us is very difficult to do. 

One thing about that bomb, though, as it's releasing energy, getting super, super hot and generally becoming a bomb is that it's blowing *itself* up at the same time — in fact it's the very first thing it blows up, because, you know, it's right there. And unlike, say an unstable chemical compound it *needs* to be together to blow up. 

In fact making the bomb isn't the hard part, but  keeping it together  long enough so it can blow up real good is. And that part is really hard because you've just literally dropped a nuclear bomb on it. 

For what starts as a very simple machine — a mass of stuff that spontaneously blows itself up — there's a really large number of things that can go wrong when waiting a millisecond too long is enough to really screw up the balance. In a millisecond your explosion is 20 meters across and your stuff is everywhere. Think nanosecond timing with electronics and conventional explosives. 

All that infrastructure is sitting there being exposed to some serious radiation if you're right next to it. Radiation breaks stuff, like chemical bonds. Plutonium weirdly develops cavities inside it. Electronics get fried. All this infrastructure needs maintenance. Very, very high-tech maintenance. Expensive maintenance. 

Money that can be stolen. 

It's a thought, no? What if they didn't do it? Maybe the bombs fizzle, meaning they mostly blow themselves apart — still wouldn't want to be near it, but not like the big stuff — or don't even go off. 

I or you wouldn't know this, but someone who understands such things, with a very high security clearance, might be snickering right now.

For years Putin has empowered and encouraged an ethno-nationalist hawkish right wing, because it served as an loyal power base, rewarding it's members with positions of power and wealth.   But as that political posture has calcified into ideology, it's members have become true believers and more loyal to the idea of Russian supremacy and destiny rather than Putin.  And Putin is now dependent upon them in a way that he's always managed to avoid with previous waves of oligarchs.

It'll take us at least a decade to understand with certainty why exactly the invasion was decided upon, but I think the theory that Putin had bad, overly optimistic intelligence from some combination of yes-men and hawks seems pretty consistent with everything we know.

That's because you don't understand how this works. Those Pzh are not sitting in a shed rusting away, they are dedicated to the defense of eastern Europe in case the Russians were to attack there. They are part of the security architecture of NATO in Europe. They have an assigned place and are meant to work together in conjunction with other units in that area. If you remove them there, you lessen the entire effectiveness of that unit. Removing them has actual implications for the security of NATO.

> And I am 100% sure that there's a lot more backroom-planning and decisions going on than we can think of.

And I'm sure there's a healthy dose of stupid paranoia going on in your brain. There is absolutely zero additional advantage to stretch this war out for the US and the EU. It's driving up the costs of fossil fuels, putting additional strain on global supply chains and driving a food crisis in Africa. And when things go bad in Africa, where do you think the people flee too if not Europe? Migration has been a huge policy issue in the EU for the last 20 years, fueling the rise of right wing parties in every country. Combating migration has been top issue for the EU for years now, leading to the name ""fortress europe"". 

Additionally, the damage to Russia has already been done and is irreversible for the coming generation. Their economy is crippled, the army went through most of their modern tech, civil unrest has never been as high as it's been. The cost benefit analysis of stretching out this war does not add up for the EU/US.

So please, stop trying to beautiful mind this shit. You just are thinking conspiratorially because it allows you to feel good about yourself because you think you have some type of unique insight.

They expected Russia to use it's Air Force, etc., to overwhelm UA's initial resistance, hence the offers early on to evacuate Zelenskyy and his cabinet and have them set up a government-in-exile in Poland.

So, the military training and aid provided to UA over the years, and planning for the ensuing fight, was geared more towards resistance and guerilla warfare.

Oh lord no. Please don't think this.

NATO is happy to respond in-kind to conventional attacks.

Whether nuclear weapons are use VERY much depends on the alert posture. And Russia has not positioned their nuclear assets for even a small attack, let alone a full-scale exchange.  And that kind of mobilization is impossible for Russia to do in secret.

>any military invasion in to Russian territory would be countered primarily with nuclear weapons

Just because it's their doctrine, doesn't mean it will happen that way in the real world.

Russia can pretty much say ANYTHING is ""Russian territory"" (including DNR/LPR, or Crimea) and use that as justification.

Where the rubber hits the road, if Russia keeps their nuclear posture relaxed, NATO keeps their nuclear posture relaxed.  It's possible and even very likely that Russia and NATO could get into a full-scale conventional slugfest, and Russia would not use nukes until they're in danger of losing.  Just as it's also possible that Russia could nuke Kyiv out of the blue if Putin has a bad day.  But full-scale nuclear exchange isn't going to happen without at the very least, several-week's worth of warning as weapons are put into alert status.

>Thus any talk of buffer zones etc is simply political propaganda and not rooted in military doctrinal needs since the large scale adoption of nuclear weapons.

Not entirely true. The problem for Putin is that having a Western-oriented and free Ukraine butting right up to Russia (and Belarus) is a potent threat to his regime, not so much for military reasons as for social reasons. If Ukranians, which many Russians see as ""Little Russians"", start significantly surpassing Russia in standard of living the way Baltic countries have, it increases the chances of revolt and reform inside Russia.

1. Russian recruits are already receiving far less training before being deployed in country.  Separatists even less, I think a week's worth of subpar training?  They aren't even being given ammunition for their weapons until they get to the front.
2. Teaching guys how to do things like set up pontoon bridges, driving heavy vehicles, medics/doctors, and most importantly training pilots takes months and years for those higher tier jobs.  You can't just draft your way out of that problem.  Especially the guys smart enough to go to ground or flee the country the first chance they get.
3. Equipment wise Russia is already scraping the bottom of the barrel.  W/ the exception of their artillery they've burned through a full third of their operational tanks to the point that they're pulling museum pieces back into service.  Separatists are being forced to use unarmored civilian vehicles to go into combat, and in Kherson especially right now they're using freaking technicals w/ machine guns b/c they're supply lines are so overstretched.  Not to mention the ammo dumps that are being destroyed FAR behind the lines which Russia has no artillery option to respond w/ since their standard artillery is imprecise and their ballistic missiles would take too long to reach the target.

 Their targeting systems are different due to the expected nature of the target (big metal object on water).

If the guys running the military have been skimming off the top thinking nobody would ever notice what do you think the guys looking after the nukes are doing?

They could cause absolute devastation thats for sure, but the picture you paint of 800 warheads systematically targeting and taking out 800 cities is beyond the capabilities of American  logistics nevermind Russian logistics. Even next door in Ukraine their missiles have a massive failure rate and even when they do launch they are way off target(and those missiles had a reasonable expectation to actually be used).

Russia would most likely massively double down on striking cities / targets of note in particular to make sure they hit, leaving much of Europe and America unscathed.  A truly horrific outcome for sure, but most of the death would be caused by the logistical confusion that follows rather than cities being wiped off the map.

> Russia would most likely massively double down on striking cities / targets of note in particular to make sure they hit, leaving much of Europe and America unscathed. A truly horrific outcome for sure, but most of the death would be caused by the logistical confusion that follows rather than cities being wiped off the map. Its bad but its far far from an apocalypse.

Russia is easily the second most corrupt European country, however, quality of life has improved dramatically since 1998 - what many consider our lowest point. Putin, for better or for worse, consolidated power by reigning in the Oligarchs - though Russia is a totalitarian kleptocracy, it’s preferable to the lawlessness and literal mob rule of the 90s. For this reason alone I’d rather he be in power than whatever western puppet would take his place, in the case of our collapse - I do not want to see a repeat of “the bad days”, in which our current issues would be amplified in severity, and new ones would arise. 

>	Poverty can be experienced easily by visiting the eastern provinces. Crime is normalized - the state takes what it wants.

No need to even go that far : poverty can be experienced by going outside the Moscow Ring Road. Said poverty, however, is nothing compared to what we saw in the 90s, with teachers being paid in bottles of vodka and factory workers in sausages. Again : whatever we’d see if we were to collapse would be worse by several orders of magnitude.

Do you really believe that delusions of grandeur are the driving force behind this conflict?

Could you elaborate on this please? By “that” do you mean our current quality of life rather than what we had in the 90s or what a western puppet government would give us?

Nonsensical analogy in this context. Again, what do you think the cause of this conflict is? Who are the participants and what motivates each one of them?

Even top-ranking public officials admit to using VPNs, they’re ubiquitous here and have been for a while.

Not the case for people age 50 and under, as per Rosstat in 2018. Probably skews even more towards the internet being most peoples primary news source these days.

Thing is, you don’t need to have all the cards. See, the game of “Mutually Assured Destruction” seems to be going strong, and as long as that’s true, I’m confident in my safety.
