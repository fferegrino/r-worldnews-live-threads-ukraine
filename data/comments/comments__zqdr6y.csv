Day 300 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today a couple of times throughout people were reporting hearing explosions in and around Kharkiv, we heard some of them too. Some people were saying that it was the sound of our air defense intercepting some UAVs, while other people were saying that it was the sound of artillery duels happening in Kharkiv oblast. 

Around the same time that people were hearing the explosions here, there were a lot of reports about Russian positions over the border being hit by our forces, so it could have indeed been the sound of artillery as some people were suggesting. There have been confirmed hits on some energy infrastructure in Belgorod’s and Bryansk’s oblasts, which is a regular occurrence at this point.

As usual after today’s Zelensky’s visit to Bakhmut Russians were crying yet again about not hitting the city while he was there, even though it gets shelled all the time, but I guess they don’t understand that. Some were mad about Putin not doing the same as Zelensky, so Peskov said that Putin apparently already visited Donbas, but of course there is no evidence of it ever happening, so there is no point in believing it. Some people are already joking that tomorrow Peskov will say that Putin already visited USA, met with Biden and addressed Congress, because they have to copy what Zelensky is doing to make Putin look better to the Russians.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 December 2022

- On 16 December, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Joint Headquarters of the Special Military Operation.

- Putin was filmed meeting with a number of senior military officers including Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov and Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu. He invited proposals for next steps of the Special Military Operation. Commander of the Russian Group of Forces in Ukraine, General Sergey Surovikin, was one of those who presented a report.

- In this choregraphed meeting Putin likely intended to demonstrate collective responsibility for the special military operation. This display likely aimed to deflect Putin's responsibility for military failure, high fatality rates and increasing public dissatisfaction from mobilisation. The televised footage was probably designed to also dispel social media rumours of General Gerasimov's dismissal.",False,1671519263.0,t3_zqdr6y,t3_zqdr6y,,0,67,0,67,0,0,

Edit:

There are weird things in the document. The document is dated from the 1st December 2022 and the reunification with Russia was supposed to happen on the 12th of December. But we're already the 20th of December. 

So if the document is real, then Belarus is already part of Russia but not yet announced?

Rough translation of the page:

> Tyumen will celebrate the reunification of Belarus and Russia
> 
> On December 22, events are planned in the Tyumen region regarding the signing of the Treaty on the reunification of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation into one state.
> 
> “Cultural figures of Tyumen are already preparing a surprise that will delight the residents of the state and emphasize the unity of the two peoples,” commented Elena Mayer, Director of the Department of Culture of the Tyumen Region.
> 
> According to her, ""the information about this significant event turned out to be a pleasant and historical surprise.""

Before the Russian invasion the point was to 1. Prepare allies for what was about to happen and get them time to prepare their responses in advance. 2. Frame public opinion of what is happening ahead of time so that bad actors and useful id**ts wouldn't be able to muddy the issue. 3. Try to prevent the invasion from occurring by telling Russians we know what their plans are and the element of surprise is gone.

Now... would any of these 3 point work in the Belarus case? 1 and 2 don't have much point anymore - everyone already knows what up and can't really get any more outraged. That leaves 3 - but when 3 didn't work in Feb 2022, I'm not all that sure that it's any more likely to work now.

They'd would have been an excellent transfer before the war. They basically a flying Hilux (no runways, no dedicated support infrastructure, no problem) and doctrinally the are a direct western counterpart to the Su-25. The A-10 may be a decade or two past it's best by date, but it is still an upgrade in many places and a shallow onramp to western aviation.

The big problem, now that this a hot war, is that training any pilots/mechanic/etc on western hardware is going to take time and take them out of the fighting. Given Ukraine's underdog position, anything that grounds a group of good pilots for an extended period of time better provide not just incremental gains but major new capacities / advantages. I am going to guess that eventually, they get F16s because people are phasing them out in favor of F35s and because they are truly multi-role so they can do SEAD and air defense as well as CAS missions, whereas the A10 is a one trick pony, and that trick (classic CAS missions) is slowly being phased out on a doctrinal level in western air forces.",1671573381.0,1671572386.0,t3_zqdr6y,t1_j10i92h,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

> A month later, the NSC’s Principals Committee—the group of Cabinet secretaries and military chiefs—played the same game, but with very different results. Some of the same concerns were raised—the possibility of isolating the Russians by not taking the nuclear bait, the lack of any sensible targets, the uncertainty of whether nukes would dampen or further escalate the war. Still, the principals decided we had to respond with nuclear weapons, to maintain credibility among our allies and adversaries. They decided to fire a few nuclear weapons at the former Soviet republic of Belarus, even though, in the game, it had no involvement in the Russian attacks—and then they ended the game, without playing the next few steps.

Russia is wrong.

Ukraine is right.

I don’t need to take joy in the death of another human being, but war is different.  I don’t know how another human being (mostly men), can point and intend on killing another human being, just because they are on the “other side”, but I guess it’s a necessary evil - until human kind can come to their senses.

That's what that casualty count is: not 'Russians': soldiers invading Ukraine.

Oh, but guess who *is* killing Ukrainian women and children?

Go on, guess.

Nice try on the equivocation, though.

To make this even more blatantly obvious, here is the text from the casualty count that '100,000' figure is referencing. It is the same in every post, but for the numbers, e.g.

> The total **combat losses of the enemy** from 24.02 to 19.12 were approximately:

> * about 99,230 (+430) persons were liquidated

> * tanks ‒ 2995 (+7) units

> * armored combat vehicles / APV ‒ 5974 (+5) units

>Kamikaze couldn't circle targets for hours waiting for an opportunity to strike, drones can

They could, and did so often. Locating the enemy during WW2 was often really bloody difficult.

>Kamikaze were never allowed to abort missions and always died trying

They could, and did. Mechanical failures, or failures to locate the enemy were grounds to return to base. Although the failure to do their duty would come with social and professional stigma, and an assortment of punishments could follow, outright execution was likely rare, especially if it was an 'understandable' reason for return. 


>Kamikaze refers to the inhumane practice of forcing young powerless soldiers into suicide missions at the threat of death to them and their families.

They were almost exclusively volunteers, indoctrinated and blinded by rituals, peer pressure and honours, but still volunteers. If you force someone into a flying bomb at gun point, they might just turn that bomb back around at you. Various books and museums hold collections of the last letters made by the pilots, they are terrifying/enlightening on the effects of war, and how someone killing themselves can be seen as an honour, or redemption for not living up to expectations.

>They were bolted into the cockpits of planes 

This is a myth. Although, you could well argue that indoctrination and fear of being seen as a coward was just as effective as any bolt or weld. The Japanese also operated suicide boats, torpedoes, and human naval mines.

this is not true. multiple youtube channels have produced very interesting videos on the topic of kamikaze, their impact on ww2, and what their missions were actually like. 

many missions were aborted due to mechanical issues or issues related to guidance/targeting and many kamikaze survived their missions (so technically they failed??) to either be captured or seppuku.   


also not all were ""young \[and\] powerless"", not all families were threatened, and many volunteered (see videos from the japanese perspective on pearl harbor)

in general though you're 100% on point that the name needs changed.

also many people here may be interested, there were only 2,800 (successful??) kamikaze in total. and the last surviving kamikaze pilot was still alive in 2020 when the NYT produced an extended article about his life which included this :   


""Mr. Odachi’s Zero — the agile Japanese fighter plane that dominated the Pacific skies in the war’s early years — was loaded with an 1,100-pound bomb, weighing it down so much that it would be impossible to outmaneuver the enemy. When American fighters spotted him, he jettisoned his bomb into the ocean and managed to escape.  
On his next sortie, his group failed to find a target. The next six missions also ended in failure.....  


On his final mission, his plane was preparing to take off when a member of the ground crew ran onto the runway, shouting and waving for the squadron to stop.

>“The first meeting with the Chief Commandant of Ukraine’s National Police, Ihor Kłymenko, took 1.5 hours. We talked among other thing about material aid. At the end of the meeting we exchanged gifts as is customary. I gave the general [commandant] some modest police gadgets – a wallet, pen, business cards and a bottle of Polish alcohol. He gave me the launch tube of a grenade launcher which he said was spent, unloaded, safe and converted into a speaker which can be used via Bluetooth. He even demonstrated how the speaker works.”

>Along with the speaker, the Polish chief received what he says he was informed was a spent launcher. He then said he accidentally fired off the weapon while repositioning it in his office; the anti-tank rocket pierced through the 3rd story floor and ended up on the ground floor. According to Polish media, the hole in the floor was about the size of a dinner plate.

Whatever it was it apparently went through 2 floors.

>The exact type of anti-tank weapon accidentally fired by Szymczyk has not been confirmed but its is widely speculated to have been an [RGW-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATADOR), which Ukraine has received from a number of countries including Germany and the UK.

Unsure what you mean here. The Abrams was literally designed to fight on the Central European Plain.

I assume you are referring to the fact that the Abrams in US Army service uses JP-8. Every tactical vehicle in the US Army runs on JP-8. That is simply a logistical choice, as the US Army and Air Force have standardized on JP-8 to avoid using different fuels.

JP-8 was selected for the standard fuel in the mid-90s. From the time the Abrams reached IOC in 1980 to the mid-90s, the Abrams used bog standard diesel (DF-2). It still uses that fuel in other military services outside the US. Gas turbines are inherently multi-fuel and can run on anything from diesel to alcohol to gasoline/petrol.

The T-72 also gets “gallons per mile” fuel effeciency. That’s just part and parcel of being a tank. If you are so concerned about fuel effeciency, don’t get a tank.
