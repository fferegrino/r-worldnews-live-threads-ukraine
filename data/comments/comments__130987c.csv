Instead of a quick and easy victory Russia has bled themselves out and used up vast quantities of manpower and firepower in the city. Ukraine could probably reinforce Bakhmut but at this point it’s served it’s purpose and has pushed Russian casualties to unacceptable levels while also giving Ukraine time to fortify areas farther back.

> One of the torpedo prototypes has already been presented at the Brave1 exhibition (defense tech development support coalition in Ukraine). The range of this underwater drone is 2,000 kilometers. In case of jamming, the device identifies the jamming zone. It can be in standby mode for up to 3 months. It automatically scans the area with a 3D sonar, hydrophone, and camera. Such scanning will help to make mine maps for demining.


> The guidance system uses GPS, or works with the help of an inertial navigation system in the absence of GPS (underwater), or during signal jamming. It identifies targets using video cameras and thermal imaging cameras and visually using a neural network. The guidance system includes passive sonar—identification and bearing of underwater and surface objects using a hydrophone system. Ultrasonic sonars (active sonar) at close range are also included. Orientation and identification by size of objects.

> In total, three versions are being developed: TLK 1000 (4-12 meters long); TLK 400 (4-6 meters); TLK 150 (2.5 meters long).  The TLK 150 will be equipped with an electric motor, have a range of 100 km and the ability to carry up to 20-50 kg of explosives.

The soldiers and milbloggers all have difficult, negative news today.  It’s tough. A second channel now also reports the extreme distance west that Russians have reached [this far](https://goo.gl/maps/WZuW4b2PaFkc88t59). Some channels had redundant info, others didn’t publish. 
Here are portions from three, with a fourth in footnotes:


[I]

@bahshid2023

> There is an battle for Khromove; our positions are completely stormed by attacks 8-10 times per day. In places to the north, we also go on assaults. While the Russians aren’t surrounding us, they still have an advantage with weapons and aviation. 

[II]

@krvchkwar confirmed the Russians reached Tchaikovsky, and included map.^^1,2 **See the map here:**
https://t\.me/krvchkwar/12341

[III]

The @peredovich0k channel had a lengthy update.  It’s so long I’m just gonna use google translation: 



> The northern side - the situation is quite difficult, because the enemy pressed at night, during the day and is still pressing on  Tolbukhina, Levchenko, Victory streets; the assault does not stop for a minute, the meat is scorched and scorched, that's why many positions were left by the boys and that is a very good decision. Aligning the front line is very difficult for Russians, so they stick forward between everything. 

> The central part - the situation is actually shit, because the enemy is pressing without even wanting to slow down, the intensity of line changes is simply crazy, then they moved forward a little, then back and so on around the clock, but we are simply being bombarded with meat, which even I don't think is very good, who understands where we got to at this stage. Polyova street came under the full control of the Russians at night, the defense is partial on Pushkina street, but the boys will be taken out from there, maintenance is not realistic in that area. 

> The southern part - the situation is not better here, because the enemy's advance is significant, it means gaining partial control over some streets, after joining the two lines, the enemy pushed forward, after which they gained control over several streets in that part. 

> The Khromove track is a fierce battle, the guys are on the defensive, there were about 10+ attempts to advance during the night, well, nothing yet. 

> Conclusion: as I said, the enemy accumulated a lot of forces while conducting combat reconnaissance (about two weeks ago) when there were almost no changes in the territory, but there were many counterattacks from our side, the guys were incited, from Syria and Africa (this is about the PKV) they launched assaults, drove the mobilized to the flanks for containment, and began to simply push us out of the city. 

> I will say more, it seems that no one really wants to surround Bakhmut anymore, because looking around, you understand that there is more hell in the city, so you begin to understand that the desire to surround the city is not so great as to simply push us out of it, because this is exactly what is happening. We are literally being pushed out of town. And looking at the situation, we begin to understand what to do against a pile of meat that storms you from groups of 30-40 people, then there are storming groups that are already training, and what can I say, even prisoners recruited by this private mercenary, who by some miracle are still alive, already know how to fight well, because the best skills come in practice. 

> Somehow, there is no good news yet, but we are not discouraged, yes, it is difficult, but we are carrying out a combat mission, which we are doing very well so far, many understand what I am talking about, and who still does not understand what we are holding , better wait and at one point I will tell you, the task is for Bakhmut.

If they were given ATACAMS too early Russia would figure out and plan around it. But if you shock and awe them in the counter offensive and all of their supply and sleeping quarters are blowing up, it makes it a lot more impactful.

The Russians found that out to their cost early in the engagement, and they've gone to infantry-heavy assaults.  The Ukrainians would face the same issues.

The Ukrainian commanders are focused on doing what they believe will give them the best shot at winning and the more they can detach the political needs of the counter offensive from the military needs the more successful they will be. We’ve gone from “Russia will take Kyiv in three days” to “Russia is so incompetent Ukraine should be able to easily crush them with only minor efforts” and that second narrative is dangerous.” Ukraine needs more weapons and the results of the counter offensive will help determine what Ukraine gets.

We saw something similar in WWII when support for arming Britain fell after the fall of Poland and France when the war looked increasingly unwinnable. In many ways Ukraine needs a successful counter offensive to be able to argue for more weapons but that also will depend on how we interpret “success.” 

In terms of US congressional support Ukraine currently has enough funds left in drawdown authority/lend lease to get them roughly through the end of 2023. That was all passed in the final weeks of the last congress but beyond that point things could get tricky especially since Congressmen may not want to take risky votes as the presidential race heats up. That said the “anti Ukraine” House members generally suck at parliamentary procedures and such and the Senate Republicans are much more supportive of Ukraine so I think if push comes to shove a new Ukrainian aid bill could still be passed in some form. Very few voters are actually basing their votes off of Ukraine aid and if something is done quietly it could avoid national attention. I don’t want to get too much into prognosticating 2024 but currently I think it may actually be easier to pass a Ukraine bill after the 2024 election than it is today.

There are many other areas where far more could be achieved beyond first steps.

The East is also dense, layers of defence and enough troops in the region to easily withdraw and defend.

That is a really bad idea for a counteroffensive.

First, the 3-1 rule of thumb that has a lot of assumptions built in. Think of it more like 3-1 ""fighting power"" instead of just men. 3 guys with rifles vs 3 guys in a tank is not a fair fight. Same with 10 guys with rifles on the ground vs 1 guy in a plane in the air.

As /u/nurnmurmer pointed out, it is also about where those people are. Russia attacked from 4 major directions and had operations from another 2 fronts (airborne and naval). Basically they were spread out over the whole border and seaboard of Ukraine. So doing a country-vs-country comparison was useful. Here it won't necessarily be.


Last time Ukraine went on the offense, they only attacked 2 places, and one of those may have been purely opportunistic (they saw an opening and took it near Kharkiv).

In Kherson they managed to get local superiority not necessarily by pure numbers, but also by preventing Russia from getting heavy equipment to the area. So Ukraine could attack with tanks and armored fighting vehicles, while Russia didn't have many.

In Kharkiv, they attacked with rapid strikes on low manpower areas, this was closer to the typical 3-1 scenario.

We also don't know where Ukraine will do the offensive, if any. It is unlikely that we will see a general offensive along the entire front. More likely Ukraine will pick a relatively small section to attack from. Their goal will be to either make Russia put its troops in the wrong spot, or to make Russia spread them out evenly along the entire front line. In either case, when Ukraine attacks they will have local 3-1 superiority.

This is to accommodate armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) rounds that are commonly used these days.  They are fin stabilized after discarding its outer shell or sabot upon leaving the barrel.  This achieves the same purpose as rifling, while allowing the round to leave the barrel faster, since it is not losing velocity from friction and rotational energy from having a rifled barrel.

To clarify the rationale behind smoothbore tank barrels: the barrels can operate longer between replacement and achieve a higher muzzle velocity if they are not rifled. They can also fire a wider variety of projectiles (like atgms) although this is not common anymore.

The drawbacks are reduced shell stability, which affects accuracy. APFSDS rounds achieve stability through the use of fins, which also cause the penetrator to follow a very flat trajectory. HEATFS rounds also exist to attack armored targets without reactive armor.

It should also be stated that (at least in Western doctrine) tanks aren't really supposed to fight tanks. Their main purpose is infantry support, and in that role they would primarily be firing high-explosive rounds at enemy concentrations and fortifications, and engaging light vehicles.",False,1682601453.0,t3_130987c,t1_jhwpcdv,,4,12,0,12,0,0,
