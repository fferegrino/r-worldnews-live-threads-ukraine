Russian attacks continuing current patterns are unlikely to generate enough momentum to regain the battlefield initiative.

Day 253/254 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet; we had no missile strikes in Kharkiv this time, but not that long ago, at 3:40am, some missiles were launched from Belgorod and they landed in Chuhuiv. There were about 6 of them and they weren’t launched from the usual positions, but from somewhere farther into Belgorod, which makes the launches hard/impossible to see from our side of the border.

About that yesterday’s missile strike on Kharkiv, they hit some factory, but then Russians started saying in their telegram channels that they destroyed a *Tesla factory*. But that wasn’t even the weirdest thing they said, they started saying that this factory was a Tesla factory *in the past,* but was now making *GMLRS for HIMARS.* So what they are saying is that Lockheed Martin opened a new GMLRS factory just 3 months after they were asked to increase production by DOD, and of all places they decided to open it in Kharkiv, a city that constantly get hit by Russian missiles? Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

And apparently from what our government is saying, no new agreements about not attacking their fleet were signed with Russia. I guess if we promised something, then it went something like this “RU: don’t use grain corridor to attack us. UA: we have not used and will not use it to attack you. RU: good, we will now return to the grain deal.” That is, if there were even any negotiations about grain deal that included us, I’m not sure if our side talked to them at all, it could have been just Turkiye and UN that talked with Russia.

>Unlike Presidential Drawdown authority (PDA), which DoD has continued to leverage to deliver equipment to Ukraine from DoD stocks at a historic pace, USAI is an authority under which the United States procures capabilities from industry. This announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine.

>Through both PDA and USAI, DoD continues to work with Ukraine to meet both its immediate and longer-term security assistance needs.

So, to be clear - PDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority) and USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative) are two different things, and the money comes out of separate budgets. Remember this when you see claims about one or the other running out of money, as people often conflate them.

Also, neither of these is Lend-Lease, about which we've heard nothing. Whether or not it is being used, or simply exists as a back-up, I don't know. I do remember reading, not long after it was passed, that any transactions under Lend-Lease would be considered private information between the countries involved (it's not limited to Ukraine), so we might not know when or if it is used.

As to why? It looks pretty simple actually. Russians want to slow down UA at Kherson. They want to tire the forces at Donetsk. Wagner got their 20k inmates so it should be enough for a few days. Those few days should be enough for forces from Kherson to move to Donetsk and the vet units to catch a break.

Yes, looks like Russians don't care about lives.

Kherson is defended by mobiks and Wagner, same as Svatove. Their role is just to slow down Ukrainians at the fortifications. The key is Donetsk.

As to how bad is it for Russians - yesterday they had to build a single battalion from survivors of 4 battalions. From two regiments they were able to make about two companies.

Playing devil's advocate, and knowing that Musk likes to run his companies with minimal staffing for customer service, it's entirely possible that starlink wasn't aware of the fact that these were being disconnected, and it just happened automatically when the payment didn't arrive.

It's also not clear exactly what percentage of the total military units were disconnected.  If nearly all of the 20k are military, then 1300 is something like 7% of the total.  If most are civilian, then it could be nearly all of them.  Hard to know without more data.

I think you may have missed the point. There were under 10 drones in the raid, each likely at a cost of under $100k and which can be manufactured in a time frame of under six months. Whereas the replacement costs of the russian surface warfare ships are between $100mm to $500mm and can take years to manufacture.  

This is not unlike the invention of the torpedo boat in terms of revolutionary technology. Until countermeasures can be developed for the larger surface warfare ships, they are simply obsolete. 

It didnt matter what damage they did the first go round. Its the fact that the vessels were damaged at all.  This with the idea that Ukraine can quickly field many more such drones will keep the surface warfare component of the Black Sea fleet at harbor.

1. China has a great deal of influence over Russia 

2. Russia takes over Ukraine then probably Moldova, Belarus, and Others

3. Now Russia is able to exert immense amounts of pressure on eastern Europe. Maybe even enough to win/scare/force Germany and France towards its corner. 

4. NATO is weakened, the US loses their strongest allies in the region.

5. China controls Russia which controls eastern Europe 


6. A weakened and fractured NATO cannot respond to further Russian aggression in Europe *and* Chinese agression in Asia at the same time. What is left of NATO would be preoccupied with their own backyard. This let's Xi take Taiwan without much pushback. 




But the problem is Putin is a fucking moron. So they both ended up in worse positions. Now Xi must contend with opportunity cost. If he had not been on Russia's side he could have used his ability to help Ukraine as leverage to get better terms in western relationships. 


Xi cannot end the war. He can only minimize the collateral damage that China gets by staying quiet. A rational actor would rather get something in return for doing nothing than just minimize punishment by doing nothing.


Therefore, staying quiet isn't really working out for them that well. It's better than actively supporting Russia and worse than actively working against Russia.


To highlight costs to China by quietly supporting Russia:

1. NATO is stronger than ever and grew in size rather than shrink 

2. The US is seen as maybe an even more important member of NATO than ever before. The invasion of Ukraine has expanded the US's influence.

3. NATO has proven that they can hold back Russian agression without dedicating troops. They are more than capable of responding in Europe and Asia simultaneously. 

4. China's strategic ally of Russia had its economy decimated, military demilitarized, and leaders humiliated. This renders their main friend in Eruope as a liability rather than an advantage. 

5. Potential future allies can see plain-jane that China will not back up even its closest allies with push comes to shove. China is seen as an unreliable partner. 

6. Internal doubt in Xi's decision making may rise. He picked the wrong horse and it hurt China. 

7. China is seen tucking tail on Taiwan. This does not bode well for the superpower image they are trying to project. 

8. China just spent billions manufacturing weapons based on Russian designs. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated that Russian weapons are easily outmatched by western weapons. This hurts China's ability to project force and market a weapons industry. The value and expected impact of those weapons is in the shitter.



If Xi could stop the war today he would. He hasn't and that is all the evidence you need that he cant.",1667599301.0,1667597867.0,t3_yloac1,t1_iv28cfb,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

 >Duranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership. The admission of the USSR to the League of Nations in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between fascism and communism as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. Many reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union.

Similar story with the Mi-24 Hinds. They caused significant casualties to Afghan forces during the war there. It was referred to as the Devils Chariot by the Mujahideen. It was/is heavily armored and capable of carrying a plethora of weapons. It can also carry eight troops which was of real concern to NATO - it was a troop carrier and had the tough hide/firepower to support those troops once they had landed. The US went through GREAT lengths to get their hands on one

Again, it had drawbacks. Incredibly fast, but not very maneuverable. It also lacked the electronic sophistication of Western helicopters. Right now a big issue with Russian procurement is that Putin/Russia’s ego is such that they still think of themselves as a world power. Financially, they just aren’t. Their means don’t come close to their ambitions, especially once you add the mind boggling amount of corruption. For example, here’s a look at the SU-57 line and Lockheed’s F-35 line 

https://mobile.twitter.com/alexhollings52/status/1576003763675856896

Now, the picture is somewhat deceiving in that they’re shot at different angles but it’s also undeniable that Lockheed has made about a thousand F-35s compared to a handful of Felons. Russia wants to make thousands of T-14s. Interesting tank. Cool features. Who knows if it works because Russia can’t afford to make them. So I wouldn’t say that Russian gear is necessarily shit. More like it’s different. Built with different priorities and different tactics in mind. Who knows how good they could really be if they were maintained properly and used by troops that had been really trained to use them and led by competent officers. What we’re seeing in Ukraine is a perfect storm of inadequately maintained gear, manned by poorly trained troops, commanded by shitty officers, and they’re attacking a highly motivated and heavily armed force that is defending their homes and families.

Thing is, they can't really dig in. Ukraine can pound those positions until there's nothing left and just keep doing that.  I agree that we (the West) should give them the AA they need. That and those 300km+ range HIMARS etc.

As for the damage, repair the things that are really needed (bridges, basic infrastructure etc). Marshall plan 2.0 on steriods will take care of the rest after the war.

I know this probably won't happen but the EU for example could send in ""repair crews"", no uniforms, no weapons and start fixing stuff.

NASA:

SpaceX: Getting humans onto multiple planets

Just because SpaceX doesn't do what NASA does doesn't mean it's not much better at doing what it wants to do. On top of that you're choosing to ignore that SpaceX is around for only 20 years, while NASA is around since the 50s if I remember correctly (though a previous form existed before that).

They're now the leading launcher per year. They're leading edge on rocket design, engine design, and on mass production and reuse of rockets. None of the companies NASA was paying are really anywhere close to them on even one of those things.

Your comment is really more like saying ""trucks are cool, but they're nowhere near as cool as Bugattis"", missing that trucks are way more important than Bugattis.

Yachts are cool, but cargo ships and planes are what made the world truly global, and that's the industry SpaceX is in right now. Everything else is about funding or working towards that goal of multiplanetary humans. Starlink is to create a demand for rocket launches, as well as it likely being potentially useful for cheap long distance communication to mars in the long run, and the revenue to help fund SpaceX's development.
