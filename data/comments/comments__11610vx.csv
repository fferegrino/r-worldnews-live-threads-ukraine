> Arguably, any concessions to Russia will not reduce the probability of a nuclear war but lead to escalation. If Ukraine falls, Russia may attack other countries (Moldova, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Finland or Sweden) and can also use its nuclear blackmail to push the rest of Europe into submission. And Russia is not the only nuclear power in the world. Other countries, such as China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are watching. Just imagine what will happen if they learn that nuclear powers can get whatever they want using nuclear blackmail.

There are a select amount of shows and individuals whose goal is to prepare civilians for new stages of the war or suppress criticism of the government by creating faux-criticism and faux-movements which never lead to anything. 

As an example, Girkin says that Russian government is such a dumbo wumbo and they lose like idiots. It seems like good news to us, but in reality it's useful for Kremlin as that message conditions civilians for conscription and increases war support / fervor among zealots.

You might have a popular TV show where they say that Ukraine are brothers, that Russia is the bad guy, and that the Kremlin is stupid. The goal of that criticism is to avoid real grassroots movements and people from engaging with the conflict, potentially revealing and popularizing ideas that would be harmful for the Kremlin.

You will recognize authentic criticism once there are calls for violence against Putin, calls for protests on the streets, calls to strike from work, or just anything that isn't just hand gesturing that something is ""bad.""",False,1676815397.0,t3_11610vx,t3_11610vx,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

[https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/how-the-war-in-ukraine-ends](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/how-the-war-in-ukraine-ends)

>\[Putin\] is not a strategic figure. People kept saying he was a tactical genius, that he was playing a weak hand well... \[Putin\] didn’t increase the talent in his own country, his human capital. He didn’t build new infrastructure. He didn’t increase his wealth production. And so if you look at the ingredients of what makes strategy, how you build a country’s prosperity, how you build its human capital, its infrastructure, its governance—all the things that make a country successful—there was no evidence that any of the things that were attributed to his tactical genius, or tactical agility, were contributing in a positive way to Russia’s long-term power.  
>  
>In Ukraine, what is it that he’s gained? If you look over the landscape, he’s hurt Russia’s reputation—it’s far worse than it ever was. He consolidated the Ukrainian nation, whose existence he denied. He is expanding NATO, when his stated aim was to push NATO back from the expansion undertaken since 1997. He’s even got Sweden \[and Finland\] applying for NATO membership. And, so, all across the board, it’s a disaster.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Ukrainians rose up against their domestic tyrants. Why? Because they wanted to join \[the European Union\]. It’s the same goal that they have now. And that has to be the definition of victory: Ukraine gets into the European Union. If Ukraine regains all of its territory and doesn’t get into the E.U., is that a victory? As opposed to: If Ukraine regains as much of its territory as it physically can on the battlefield, not all of it, potentially, but does get E.U. accession—would that be a definition of victory? Of course, it would be.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Well, you accept it or you don’t accept it—meaning you continue to fight. And, if you continue to fight, your country, your people, continue to die, your infrastructure continues to get ruined. Your schools, your hospitals, your cultural artifacts get bombed or stolen. Your children get taken away as orphans. That’s where we are right now. I understand they want all of that territory back. But let’s imagine that they can’t take all the territory back on the battlefield. What then? We’re in a war of attrition right now, and in a war of attrition there’s only one way to win. You ramp up your production of weaponry, and you destroy the enemy’s production of weaponry—not the enemy’s weapons on the battlefield, but the enemy’s capability to resupply and produce more weapons. You have to out-produce in a war of attrition, and you have to crush the enemy’s production.  
>  
>...  
>  
>...the sanctions were supposed to destroy Russia’s ability to produce weapons, and that’s not happening. Russia can produce about sixty missiles a month under sanctions. So that’s two horrible barrages against Ukrainian civilian homes and infrastructure, their energy infrastructure, their water supply—sixty missiles a month. That doesn’t include what they’re buying back from Africa that they previously sold. What they’re trying to get in deals with North Korea or Iran. The Soviet arsenal, the biggest arsenal ever assembled—a lot of it is rotting, but not all of it is rotting. Some of the production is still ongoing, not as much as Russia would like, but enough to carry out the strategy of “If I can’t have it, nobody can have it.”  
>  
>If you’re in a war of attrition, you’ve got to be bombing the other side’s production facilities. You have to be denying the other side the ability to resupply on the battlefield. And you have to be ramping up your production like we did in the previous wars where we were directly engaged, but we haven’t done here. So tell me: How do you fight a war of attrition with your left hand tied behind your back and your right hand tied behind your back? The Ukrainians are amazing. It’s just so inspiring to see what they’re doing. But if we get every inch of territory back—and we’re not close to that—we still need an E.U. accession process.  
>  
>...  
>  
>I’m not worried about resolve here. I came up with this equation early in the process, which is: Ukrainian valor plus Russian atrocities equals Western unity and resolve. And it’s held. Because the Ukrainian valor continues—and it continues to inspire the whole world, not just their own war effort internally. The Russian atrocities continue because that’s what this war is. It’s an atrocity. It’s more like murder than it is like war. So I’m good on the Western alliance holding together. My problem is material. I don’t have a military-industrial complex on the scale to continue this indefinitely.  
>  
>...  
>  
>...Ukrainians deserve the chance to try to win on the battlefield before we get to that part that you described as: each side has to sit down and make unpleasant concessions, and you have to sit down across from representatives of your murderer, and you’ve got to do a deal where your murderer takes some of the stuff he has stolen—and killed your people in the process.

Ukraine isn't talking about losses but if they even took half of what the Russians did that's pretty ghastly. Some estimates are that they've had 100,000 killed.

Militaries find it convenient to classify things contrary to what we may wish. It makes their lives easier when justifying their actions. They use it to hide their actions and it can be used as propaganda.  

Purely as an example, think of something along the lines of classifying any boy over the age of 12 or 13 is a soldier. That would be used as justification to *not* report killing children.

Julia also said that unlike us, Putin really doesn't see Ukraine as a real country.  

The problem with propaganda is that without having access to any other information the people who view this stuff day in and day out will not know any different.  

I'll give you an example:  
I had an uncle who as a boy believed bananas were blue. He grew up during WW2 rationing and never saw a real banana. His only source of information on bananas was a colouring book where someone had coloured the banana in blue. Therefore he thought bananas were blue. It was many years later when he actually saw a real banana for the first time that he learned they were not blue.  

That may sound funny, but just stop and think. If someone could believe bananas were blue so easily then how much more so would a person believe a carefully crafted diet of propaganda?

Iirc the amount of conscripts Russia could legally use in Ukraine if war were declared is somewhere around 200-350k. Many of these will be needed outside of Ukraine just to meet minimum standards at military facilities in other parts of Russia. By declaring certain regions of Ukraine as Russian territory, Putin has a legal loophole to use some of these conscripts already. On the industrial side of things nothing will change much near term, unless a lot of preparation has already occurred secretly, and Russia hasn't been good at secrets.

It's unlikely Putin would declare war, and this would be a sign he is extremely desperate. So far Putin has done nothing to risk turning the population against him, but declaring war could. This may seem impossible to some but that doesn't matter. If Putin declares war anytime soon, he is feeling pressure from somewhere other than the regular Russian population. A lot of failures can be covered up by propaganda, but declaring war can't.

As to some thoughts about the timeframe...

* Putin isn't backing down and doesn't care about RAF losses. The biggest threat to putler's hold on power would \^be\^ a full defeat in Ukraine
* Ukraine wants Crimea back not just the Donbas.
* A few dozen leapord tanks is a start, but not enough to radically shift the balance of power. More and more modern offensive weapons are needed by Ukraine
* And perhaps most importantly a Ukraine victory (restoration of pre 2014 borders) is likely insufficient to cause the fighting to stop.

They tend to believe the propaganda which makes sense as they have no other point of reference in their lives. The younger demographic tend to get their news online. They tend to be more anti-Putin. The further out from the cities the more pro-Putin people tend to be as well.  

Just to confuse things, some people are even paid to be pro-Putin counter protestors. They're paid to come out whenever an anti-Putin protest may start to form.  

That's an incredibly basic overview. I don't like pigeonholing people like that, but hopefully you get the idea.   

A big problem is that you cannot properly poll the Russians during this war to ask what they truly believe. As a Russian said, if a man knocks at your door and asks if you support Putin you say yes. Saying no is dangerous. Very dangerous to you and your loved ones.  

The idea of always saying you support the leader when questioned like that makes sense when you consider their history of mistrust towards the KGB spying on the public and how brutal the police are towards anti-Putin protestors.  

Speaking of propaganda, I'm not sure if children are still brought up on pro-Putin propaganda at school or not. I know they did teach kids at school how ""great"" Putin was back in his early days. You can see a class of kids with the pro-Putin books in the seventh part of the BBC documentary Russia 1985–1999: TraumaZone What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy.  

Indoctrinating anyone, but especially children, with propaganda like that is utterly vile. Propaganda is a war or assault on the human mind. It can have a far reaching effect.

They try supporting all sides of any arguments in an attempt to widen the natural cracks in our societies, causing us to break further apart and sow discord. The goal is to cause us to turn inward and concentrate on our own problems rather than looking outwardly to pay attention to what Putin and Russia is doing.  

See for example the [Internet Research Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency). The many timelines involved, from an American perspective, can be found here [Timelines related to Donald Trump and Russian interference in United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelines_related_to_Donald_Trump_and_Russian_interference_in_United_States_elections) which [goes back to 1977](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book).

As for Russia using those tactics against Ukraine, that's been going on for many years too. See here [Russian information war against Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_information_war_against_Ukraine) and here [Media portrayal of the Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_portrayal_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War).  

Put simply, Putin fears democracy in Ukraine. For if it works there then the Russian people may notice it actually working for people in their region of the world. Should that happen then they too may want democracy and freedom.  

The Euromaidan protests were an existential crisis for Putin. Democracy was far too close to the Kremlin for his liking. His paranoid KGB mind saw it as being fomented by America and the CIA. Clinton voicing support just reinforced his paranoia. That's why Putin sees democracy as a threat, a tool used by America and the CIA to overthrow dictators. That's why Putin ordered such a harsh response to be carried out.  

Putin doesn't want to die like Saddam or Gaddafi with the people demanding freedom and overthrowing him, their dictator.  

There are other reasons in his twisted mind for invading Ukraine and interfering in all of our societies, but these are some of the things that really fuel his paranoia and fear.  

As for people being in the pocket of Russia, Julia Ioffe mentioned recently that when western countries kicked out many known and suspected Russians it has meant that Russia will start calling upon people it's cultivated for many years.  

Your mentioning ""foreign agent"" also reminded me of the [Russian foreign agent law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_foreign_agent_law). The Kremlin will brand people or organisations as foreign agents to silence critics of Putin.

News media usually needs to present a story they know will grip their target demographic audience and hold their attention. That requires the news to be presented in a specific format and style and in turn leads to promoting some stories and angles over others.

First of all, no, he wouldn’t be locked up. That’s exactly what I’m trying to tell you. You have a very skewed perspective of how Russian (war) politics works. Putin isn’t the end-all-be-all like Kim Jung Un is in NK


Putin has several factions competing for influence and power not just with regards to Russian society but sometimes himself/his gov objectives.  

The biggest factions in Russia are going to essentially the nationalists via the millblogger community, people with armies like Wagner leader and Chechen leader, Putin loyalists like Gerasimov etc. 

Girkin represents the millblogger community who have been preaching Russians incompetence since the war began to the absolute detriment of Putin. In fact, Girgin and Wagners leader are probably the biggest pains to Putins ass apart from Ukraine since the war started 

 If Putin starts cracking down *hard* on not just specific millblogger (like Rybar) but the community as a whole it would kill his war effort. The millblogger community has a level of influence in Russian society that easily surpass that of the Russian MOD. Russians follow the war through the lens of the millblogger eyes. Those millbloggers turning on Putin without a way to organically reduce their power means literally the end of Putins days. So he has to toe this really fine line with how to make the millblogger community self-censor (which won’t happen) to protect what Putin sees as the war effort and Putins own ability to maintain power but also how to address the concerns of that community (which are completely unrealistic to the detriment of this community). 


It’s a lot more complicated. 


People on Russians state tv and state propagandists like Solovyov are *not* the same as Girkin. Whatever rhetoric folks like Solovyov say on tv to the public has been rehashed with the Kremlin and is exactly what you wrote in your post. Girkin is acting by his own means for his own means (which he likely does think is truly for the better of Russia) consequences be damned (which in his last doomer poster he quite literally said he was fine being suicided if it meant this war was conducted more competently via his criticism directed at Putin).",False,1676820036.0,t3_11610vx,t1_j960l2r,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

What's worse is that you have in effect elevated the Russians to a state higher than normal people. All people are susceptible to lies, propaganda, PR and even wishful thinking.  

If the Russians are immune to those effects then they are far beyond being human.  

If a person were so paranoid so as to not believe any lies or propaganda then they too would still be effected by it for they would believe nothing which was true and see lies and conspiracies wherever they look. That too would serve the goals of those spreading lies and propaganda for that person would be crippled in the sense of never ever knowing any truth.  

The internet does not make the problem go away. Just ask the flat Earth group or the anti-vaccine group.  

Algorithms on the internet feed people more of what generates a response. It in turn causes page impressions or clicks, which in turn drives advertising revenue. You are being analysed and manipulated by those algorithms all the time. We know that people like and respond to having their own thoughts presented back to them. They purposefully make an echo chamber.  

I actually fear what will happen when advanced AI is combined with those algorithms. It will be able to easily customise the content in real time which is presented to people. They may even believe they are conversing with a real person and thus be more likely to believe what they are told.  

Propaganda is a war or assault on the human mind. No one is immune to it. If a person where immune they would not be human for propaganda, PR, advertising and the art of lying are all grounded in the science of human psychology.  

Even seemingly mundane things people do can be influenced by our human psychology. The tobacco industry used advertising campaigns based on psychology to influence people to think smoking was acceptable and desirable. Psychology was even used to influence women to think using instant cake mix was acceptable at a time it was considered to be cheating to use cake mix. The egg you add to the cake mix is there for symbolic psychological purposes only.  

If information is so easily found now, why do I still know people who believe [eating carrots can give you a degree of night vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#Night_vision)? It's easily debunked WW2 propaganda yet people still believe it.  

I remember reading a comment from someone who worked at a TV network saying they have to add a canned laughter track or people will not realise they are watching a fictional comedy. They may believe it to be a factual documentary.  

Here's a quote from Karal Ann Marling, professor of American studies and art history at the University of Minnesota taken from the Wikipedia article [laugh track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track):  
>Marling added she was concerned more about canned laughter as a symptom of a larger social willingness to accept things uncritically, which included political messages as well as commercial messages. ""It's a kind of decline in American feistiness and an ability to think for yourself,"" she said. ""It certainly is embedded, but that doesn't make it a good thing. There are a lot of things that we do every day of the week that aren't good things. And this is one of them.

But it doesn't really matter. Russia can't produce them, so instead they're importing them through circumventions in the sanctions. We've seen US-made chips end up in Russian and Iranian missiles, and that's not going to stop. Indeed, I suspect that we're going to see domestic development of the ""good enough"" variety that gets the job done.

Mass production of equipment for the ground forces is quite possible. Instead, what is likely to happen is that many systems' productions will be bottlenecked- we will see plenty of refurbished T-72s and T-62s but very few deliveries of the Su-57. We will see downgraded electronics on Iskandur missiles that may degrade their performance, but the Russians will eventually be able to dedicate factories towards their production and compensate for a decreased accuracy with increased volume of fire.

Chips are not the thing that prevents people from making factories. Lada may make bad cars, but [they already possess the tooling](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/izhevsk-russia-december-assembly-line-production-new-lada-car-automobile-factory-avtovaz-134620087.jpg) to turn their factories into BTR producers.",False,1676830044.0,t3_11610vx,t1_j96mu34,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

Anyways, this also misses the point on what wartime economies actually entail. The entire population of Russia would be mobilized towards the war effort. Men would be conscripted *en masse*. Women would work in factories that are now retooled to build tanks, guns, and bullets.

We've known that for... well since artillery was invented.  Thats why WW1 was the shitshow it was.  Artillery just doesnt kill entrenched infantry.  So they had to go over the top into hails of machine gun fire.

Russia has no PGM for their artillery and its not causing ""heavy casualties"".  They do not have the training, discipline, logistics or capability to operate their unguided munitions in a precise manner.  Russia artillery only works by levelling areas which reduce the effectiveness of fortifications and allow advances by massed units.  Its a shitty way to do war and its not one which inflicts significant casualty rates against a modern army using Defense in Depth.

That is also why they all started a new comment thread rather than responding to each other.  You aren't looking for answers under any of the other comments saying the same point as you.

Even if you are just a victim of hybrid warfare seeking reassurance and seeking alternate viewpoints and information, you should consider alternate viewpoints and replies such as the one that Ukraine will not take as many casualties because entrenched positions don't take as many casualties as those aggressively advancing on entrenched positions.  Which side has been aggressively advancing to take territory and sending men out to take fortified positions? Russia.  The fact that will ignore comments like that reveals that you aren't really interested in the answer.  Given the article from the BBC you just posted is months old, (from November)  shows you don't have any new information that would make you doubt the casualty figures, but that you looked for an article to support your post that looks official that you can use as a fig leaf.

However, let me humour you. There is a small chance that you have merely been duped to reproduce Russia's talking points on a new part of the internet from where you got the information.  Since my time is worthless, here is why you have been convinced to spread this talking point.  Russia is not trying to convince anyone of this talking point, not really.  They are getting people to think about how many casualties Ukraine is taking rather than thinking and talking about the real news about how the war is going badly for Russia or how little progress they've made.  Even debating the numbers of just how many casualties Ukraine is taking is going to get people talking and thinking about Ukranian casualties.  Who does that benefit?  Russia.

In the movie the Manchurian Candidate (1962), the senator who is the dupe of his Soviet handler wife asks why exactly he doesn't choose a consistent number of how many public servants are members of the Communist Party.  She tells him that they aren't trying to convince people that there isn't a certain number of Communist infiltrators.  They just want people to talk about and wonder how many Communists there are.  Even by debating this with you, I am helping Russia to get me, you and others reading this to wonder just how many casualties there are in Ukraine.

The answer to any rational thinking person is a lot.  More than Ukraine wants to spend.  More than any official figures will admit to or even accurately estimate with their own numbers.  A rational thinking person will take that as a given.

But that is irrelevant to whether Russia will be victorious.  Russia is obviously having trouble supporting its army and equipping their current number of soldiers with their logistics and tactics.  Russia is obviously not advancing and taking significant territory which would show that Ukraine is exhausted and withdrawing.   Until either of those situation changes, there is no reason to believe that Russia has enough manpower or that Ukraine is running short of manpower.  You are a layman, and will not be privy to the information required to figure out the situation ahead of time.  You will not suss out the reality of the situation with your superior powers of skepticism.  You will find out when the rest of us do, when Ukraine loses territory or surrenders.",1676793450.0,1676792124.0,t3_11610vx,t1_j94x8be,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

We might be approaching historic levels of consequence if the extreme scenario is carried out where the actual state of Russia breaks up. If it ceases to be.

This is the fairy tale version of sanctions. In reality, countries under sanction actively work to subvert or work around them. Sometimes that means that they produce equipment locally. Other times it means that they go onto the black or grey markets are start smuggling equipment in.

If sanctions worked the way you describe, Iran would have collapsed decades ago. Instead, they've built their own military industrial complex that specializes in subverting the existing sanctions that they've lived under for years.

Good lord, you're still doing it. Zero numbers or proof, but going in for ""definitely"". Some sort of deity where your opinion is made truth.

> ""Very high"" is subjective from the get go. If you want to argue semantics, that's fine

You are the one claiming a 1:1.5 ratio between Ukraine and Russia, and used the opening weeks as an example of that. ""Very high"" would have to be very high indeed to reach that ratio.

> But at this point you seem to be arguing for the sake of arguing since you don't dispute that there were high casualties in the beginning of the war.

Perhaps you haven't been reading what I said before, but I don't think they had very high casualties personally, as they pulled back constantly in the first weeks, luring the Russians into kill zones and ambushing convoys. I believe the heavy casualties for Ukraine have been happening more recently defending places like Bakhmut. 

If you think they did have very high casualties in the opening weeks then that's your opinion, and as we don't have the numbers or proof, neither of us really knows the truth. It's just opinion.

The issue is when you declare your opinion as fact, with no proof to back up your statement. That's what you continue to do, and that's where I'll continue to call out your bullshit.",False,1676792695.0,t3_11610vx,t1_j94zdkl,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

So this is the true reason you are arguing with me, not that you want to call out my bullshit but because you have a bullshit belief that contradicts mine. You believe that the entire Ukrainian army retreated in good order and managed to inflict much much greater casualties during the opening weeks of the war. 

I told you last time that ""very high"" or ""a lot"" is subjective and not the exact omniscient knowledge that you are using as a straw man to argue against. I initially couched my 1:1.5 opinion as just that, an opinion, and then gave a few reasons why I thought this was true. You were the one taking my statements as unvarnished fact.


In truth, here is someone who I have relied on heavily to make my estimate.

This man knows much more than either of us about the war. Oh wow did I just present opinion as truth? After all, you might be some sort of Ukrainian military expert or an actual officer on the ground. But you're not, so I can rest easy presenting claims that are basically opinion as fact.

My point all along, and let me condense this for you as you are having trouble here, is that you:

1. Said that the ratio of Ukrainian to Russian casualties was about 1 to 1.5.

2. Were asked why you thought that.

3. Stated that Ukrainian casualties were high in the opening weeks.

4. Were asked what you based that statement on.

5. Were unable to give any proof or numbers. Then admitted we don't know the numbers. Then went back to claiming they ""definitely"" had high casualties. You know, despite just admitting we don't know that.

My point all along is that if you don't have proof for your statement claiming that Ukraine suffered high casualties in the opening weeks, then don't claim it. Especially, don't say it ""definitely"" happened.
