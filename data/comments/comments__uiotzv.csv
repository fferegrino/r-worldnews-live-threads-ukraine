I asked what the USSR in general was like. She said it wasn't terrible, there was just 'no hope'. She explained that the government provided you with everything from housing to a vehicle if they deemed it necessary. But your monthly pay check provided by the government was *just* enough to buy groceries/maintain the lifestyle they gave you, which wasn't much. 

Once it collapsed, it was chaos. She said you basically had different factions/mobsters controlling various areas. The newly formed government had almost no say anything. Crime was through the roof, industries were given to those already in power (would later be known to us as oligarchs), and people had been 'kept dumb' for so long they couldn't acclimate. 

In comes Putin. She was fervent about him. She explained that he is seen as a 'savior' to Russian's after what they went through in the 90's. In her exact words 'Sure he might do some bad things, but he's made Russia the best it's ever been. Most of the things you hear about him are lies.' 

It was odd. The entire conversation was so organic and open, then as soon as Putin came up her entire tone and facial expression changed. She went into complete defense mode and all I had asked was 'what do Russian's think about Putin?' I tried to lighten the mood by making a joke along the lines of 'I think he won the last election with 105% of the vote' and she just gave me a stern look so I dropped the conversation.",False,1651771176.0,t3_uiotzv,t3_uiotzv,,0,80,0,80,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Day 71 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Just as it was said yesterday that Russians are now out of range for their artillery to reach our city, today we woke up from some intense shelling (most likely from MLRSs), and believe me, hurriedly waking up because there are explosions happening nearby and running to the bathroom to hide is not fun at all.

We thought that the shelling was pretty far away from us, but around 2-3 hours later we found out that we were wrong. When we came out to get drinking water at our usual place, which is a water vending machine around 150 meters away from our home, that stands next to a kiosk, we saw what was shelled. 

It turned out that one of the shells landed just 1 meter behind the kiosk, leaving a hole in the ground and completely destroying the kiosk in the process. Thankfully the kiosk is closed so there was nobody in it, otherwise they would be dead. Also the water vending machine survived too, with some minor dents.

That same shelling destroyed some garages nearby and caused a fire. And of course the explosions themselves broke most windows in the apartment buildings nearby, as the shells landed around 10 meters away from them. There are literally no military targets anywhere nearby. They are just shelling civilians for fun.

Also as usual, they shelled Saltivka again (and not just once), destroying some garages and cars in the process, and causing even more fires. Russians are definitely not out of range where they can shell the city yet, but they are getting steadily pushed back. Our forces are conducting counteroffensives around Kharkiv and Izyum, so yes, there’s less shelling now, but it’s not gone completely yet.",False,1651789847.0,t3_uiotzv,t3_uiotzv,,0,167,0,167,1,0,

A deputy Ukrainian commander fighting in the Azovstal steelworks has accused Russian troops of thwarting efforts to evacuate civilians.  
  
In a video posted on Telegram, Capt Sviatoslav Palamar said: ""It's day three since the enemy entered the Azovstal factory, where heavy, bloody fighting continues"".  
  
""Yet again, the Russians have broken their promises of a ceasefire and did not allow the evacuation of civilians who continue to shelter from the shelling in the factory's basements.  
  
""Our enemy observes no ethical norms, conventions or laws"".  
  
Palamar also asked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""take care of wounded soldiers who are dying in horrible agony because there is no appropriate medical care"" and called on the international community for further assistance evacuating civilians.  
  
Earlier, a Kremlin spokesperson was quoted by Reuters as saying that Russia was not storming the plant and that humanitarian corridors out of the steelworks were functioning.

Maybe the real wizards were the intelligence analysts we made friends with along the way?

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/us/politics/russia-generals-killed-ukraine.html

WASHINGTON — The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials.

Ukrainian officials said they have killed approximately 12 generals on the front lines, a number that has astonished military analysts.

The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. That intelligence also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of Moscow’s secret battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the officials said. Officials declined to specify how many generals had been killed as a result of U.S. assistance.

The United States has focused on providing the location and other details about the Russian military’s mobile headquarters, which relocate frequently. Ukrainian officials have combined that geographic information with their own intelligence — including intercepted communications that alert the Ukrainian military to the presence of senior Russian officers — to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers.

The intelligence sharing is part of a stepped-up flow in U.S. assistance that includes heavier weapons and tens of billions in aid, demonstrating how quickly the early American restraints on support for Ukraine have shifted as the war enters a new stage that could play out over months.

In a 50-second audio clip that Ukraine’s Security Service says is an intercepted communication between a Russian soldier and his friend, the soldier complains of more losses in Ukraine “than in four years in Chechnya.” His comrade admits that he doesn’t even know the real death toll, as “they don’t voice [the numbers] here.” He then asks if it’s true that members of the RosGvardia, Putin’s National Guard, have been leaving Ukraine along with the special police known as the Omonovtsy. The soldier erupts with fury: “We don’t fucking need them. They’re returning [home] because they’re staging revolts, they don’t want to go any further. All these fucking special forces, our fighters, dammit, backtracked… and they refuse to go further.” Ukrainian authorities did not specify where the purported soldier in the recording was based in Ukraine, and it was not clear when the call was intercepted.

For the first time, Russian forces have managed to push deep into Azovstal in Mariupol and are likely to be operating within the steel plant, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its assessment of Wednesday's military situation.  
  
The news comes after days of fierce fighting at the steelworks, where the last of Ukraine's fighters in the city are holding out, along with hundreds of civilians.  
  
The US-based think-tank also said Ukrainian defences have largely stalled Russian advances in eastern Ukraine.  
  
Ukrainian forces had so far prevented Russian forces from merging their offensives to the southeast of Izyum and west of the Donetsk-Luhansk frontline.  
  
In western Ukraine, Russian attempts to disrupt aid shipments to Ukraine from Western countries and slow down weapon re-supply efforts have also proved unsuccessful, the ISW said.

May 5, 2022

In Russia, attempts continue to overcome the critical situation in the production of military-industrial complex, which arose as a result of international sanctions. However, the activities of Russian officials bring additional chaos to production schemes and exacerbate the crisis.

In particular, this is stated in a letter on behalf of JSC ""Tyumen Battery Plant"" to ""Deputy Chief of Staff for Combating Economic Sanctions"" Sergei Sobyanin: and spare parts for equipment not manufactured in Russia, we purchased abroad. Modern realities force us to either organize our own production or look for new suppliers… However, what our officials are doing to us is much worse than sanctions. ”

It is a question of total incompetence of the state regulator. Due to the changes, the production cannot get enough raw materials to continue production. In addition, the hazardous waste disposal system was destroyed, as a result of which the organizers of the scheme ""will contaminate large areas with acid.""

As a result of such a ""fight against economic sanctions"", the outflow of production to China is expected.""

The PMC drove into the location of our battalion just at the time when I was ""fucking"" there, which I will tell about later. We went rich. Dump trucks with a personal shmurdyak of fighters, carts with DShK based on the UAZ-Patriot, a platform with two D-30 howitzers. The entire corridor on the first floor was crammed with boxes of UAVs, electronic warfare and generators. The boys are all smart - carcasses light. Armor, unloading, helmets and other things that we never dreamed of. True, they were all dressed in summer - straight from Africa and into the snow. The guys did not understand where they were and asked me where they were and how to call the Russian Federation.
In total, 500 people came to us, although, according to them, the total number is three times more - they are in other locations. There is also its own art and MLRS.
250 people were immediately sent to Popasnaya, without even having time to unload dump trucks and pick up things. The rest were sent a day later - also without things. Two fighters were left at the location, who then loaded the entire shmurdyak to be sent to the front.
According to the radio exchange, at first everything was great: the dill had 20 200ths, a lot of prisoners. And then something incomprehensible began - the wounded were drawn from the hospitals.
A fighter arrives in a taxi with a hand torn off by a fragment. Satisfied and happy:
- I'm going home, to Moscow! Well, fuck such a war! The infantry is thrown onto the concrete! We entered on two behahs. Two pizdulins from Bayraktar and 19 people were gone!

>Then ""refuseniks"" began to arrive - those who refused to continue to fight. The contract allows it. Kalmyk:
- There were only Kalmyks in my platoon. Everyone died, I was the only one left. Three assaults. We reach the concrete, they close the armored shutters and cause mortar and artillery fire on themselves. And everyone is fucked. The machine gunners are purely snipers, they land without a miss. I personally won't go again.

>From the radio exchange, I heard how the headquarters of the PMC in Pervomaisk was covered with artillery, apparently - with 152 caliber. Immediately 50 two-hundredths, fucked sweet BC, and dump trucks with shmurdyak scattered around the district. In the news, it passed like the shelling of a civilian in Pervomaisky.

>In general, in March, the unit based at our location lost about half of its personnel. In April, I bought equipment from ""refuseniks"" - armor, unloading, uniforms. It doesn't make much difference who to throw on concrete fortifications - professionals with five business trips behind them or miners with no experience - the result will be the same.

>According to the private soldiers, the Russian Marines fought with them and fought well

The Russians can't sustain this type of loss rate, especially if troops are buying gear off one another

Some clarification:

>Yep. Gruz (Груз) 200 is the code for dead body transport. From this is extrapolated to name fatal losses of a unit. Gruz in russian means cargo.
300 are wounded and 100 is ammo. Although all three are unofficial terms, they are widely used since the soviet war in Afghanistan.",1651783013.0,1651782822.0,t3_uiotzv,t3_uiotzv,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

ROMAN PETRENKO - THURSDAY, 5 MAY 2022, 14:02

Valeriy Zaluzhniy, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has announced that Ukraine's defence forces have launched counteroffensives on the Kharkiv and Izyum fronts.

Source: Zaluzhnyi, from a conversation with the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley

Quote from Zaluzhnyi: ""As is customary, I briefed my American counterpart on the operational situation.

In particular, I reported on the enemy's main movements on the Luhansk front, where fierce fighting continues near Popasna, Kreminna and Torske, and on the transition by Ukrainian defence forces to counteroffensive actions on the Kharkiv and Izium fronts.

I stressed the renewed use of cruise missiles by the Russian aggressors. The main purpose of these attacks is to disrupt logistical routes for supplying military and technical assistance to Ukraine [...].

Therefore, the issue of providing Ukraine with M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple-launch rocket systems is very urgent.""",False,1651786177.0,t3_uiotzv,t3_uiotzv,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

> b. Legality. According to he constitution if the president is unable to carry out his duties - the PM, currently Mishustin, steps in as interim. But this is for long-term incapacitation, not brief periods of indisposition. There is no provision for any transfer of power then

> c. Politics. Patrushev is no honest broker, no consensus-minded chair of the board. He is the hawk's hawk, and giving him this kind of power, however briefly, would have serious and destabilising political implications. First of all... 

> It would terrify and anger the technocrats who, however little traction they have on security/foreign policy, Putin still trusts and relies on to run the country for him. He has backed them over siloviki on econ policy for eg. 

> But even siloviki might not be comfortable at, in effect, seeing Patrushev elevated as virtual heir apparent. He is widely respected, feared by many, but liked by rather fewer. More to the point... 

> There's no need for it. If Putin urgently needs  surgery then the system can run for a while on autopilot. If the op/recuperation will be so lengthy that he not even be able to give strategic decisions for weeks/months, then more than an informal stopgap will be required.

* **Blitzkrieg eastern Ukraine and Kiyv with minimal civilian casualties and military losses**

* **Establish a puppet government in Kyiv**

* **Legally annex Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea after Ukr. surrender**

* **Leave western Ukraine under Polish protection as a western-aligned state** (It seems Russian forces never even attempted to go west - also Lukashenkos map shows nothing in the western direction)

* **Transcarpathia would be ""liberated"" by Orban**

* **Western sanctions would be symbolic** - why lower our standard of living for part of Ukraine nobody in the EU cares about and which was defeated in a few days?

* **Putin, Orban, and Kaczynski become popular heroes**

* **West is angry, but nothing really happens,** situation normalizes in a few months, and business continues as usual apart from a few token sanctions

It starts to make sense when you put it like this.

There is a fair amount of concern in Israel that the demographic trends of the area could put Israeli identity or even existence in to jeopardy. Stories about the low Israeli fertility-rate vs. the much higher fertility-rates of the surrounding populations are staples of Israeli media.


By the time I was there, most of the Jewish people from the developed world who wanted to move to Israel had already moved there. Immigration to Israel had slowed to a trickle. So an organized group of Israelis started looking to the USSR for a place to find would-be immigrants. They made deals with the Soviet government so that people of Jewish descent could get permission to emigrate. They did all of the ground-work, they got them jobs in Israel, got them plane-tickets, and helped them pack.



It was controversial in Israel from day-1. A lot of Israelis worried that the new immigrants were less ‘Jewish’ as an identity, and more just poor Russians who managed to discover that they had a long-lost Jewish grand-mother that they had forgotten about and that they would say or do pretty much anything to get out of their shit lives. There were also concerns that the new immigrants might be getting selected based on their political views and were being used deliberately for internal Israeli political gains.



But despite the controversies, the program went on. Before the fall of the USSR, and continuing through the present day, Russia, and other post-Soviet countries, have been extremely helpful in fighting what Israel considers an existential threat, the threat of being out-bred by Palestinians.

>[…]

> **Most Western analysts argue that Vladimir Putin’s invasion was fueled by an imperialistic desire to seize territory, rather than any provocations from Ukraine. But in Lula’s view, even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who faced a months-long buildup of troops at his borders before the outbreak of war in February, shares blame.** “I see the President of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,” he says, shaking his head angrily. “This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war. Because in the war, there’s not just one person guilty.” 

>He argues that it is irresponsible for Western leaders to celebrate Zelensky rather than focusing on closed-door negotiations. “You are encouraging this guy, and then he thinks he is the cherry on your cake. We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.”

> . . . Western sanctions on Russia have unfairly impacted other regions’ economies, he adds. **“War is no solution,” he says. “And now we are going to have to foot the bill because of the war on Ukraine. Argentina, Bolivia will also have to pay. You’re not punishing Putin. You’re punishing many different countries, you’re punishing mankind.”**

Guessing the Kyiv Independent is counting the Chechan Tushayev, which still makes no kind of sense.  Plenty of Chechens with that 'rank' have died.  It's basically any family head.  Meaningless.  There are mercs in Ukraine with similar sized military units whose commanders are simply 'commander' or whatever their last earned rank was, captain, lieutenant.  It doesn't really matter.  The naval commander Paliy had way more authority and responsibility than Tushayev and he was only a captain.  And Chechens are subpar units with smaller less-experienced groups under their command and therefore not useful for, well, whatever the generals-killed-in-Ukraine rubric is useful for.  

Which ultimately might not be much, considering how the army operates.  Everyone is expendable, including the generals.  They just promote someone else.  The 20-odd starting units of that rank in this conflict are not indicative of the whole pool, which is large.  Generals typically have desk jobs until they're needed.  Or scapegoated into doing something constructive.  The idea that generals have combat experience they can bring to the table is significantly mooted by the Russian strategy of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.  They mainly study WWII battles, religiously, and nearly all of them were won through attrition.  Plus the crony system is always hard at work, and although that exists in the west at that rank, the west is much better at filtering generally competent people into higher officership before it's all networking.  Shoigu isn't even military FFS.  

And then there's the fact they're only so close to the front lines precisely because they couldn't get anyone to listen to them.  How important is a general, anyway?  

Nor do I think Russian units admire their officers  If a general survives on the front and involves themselves with the men, goes to/gives briefings, shares insights or declassified intelligence directly, maybe, but Russian generals don't do that.  They get visibly drunk every single day and stay far the fuck away from the men just in case one of them puts two and two together.  

Still, it's not great for morale to see the command structure self-destruct like this, and it stops operations in their sphere of control for several days or more.  That's maybe the most useful thing.  

In brief, a Russian general dying in combat isn't as earthshattering as a general in most other armies dying.  It's more like wearing one of your better shirts and somehow ripping or staining it 30 minutes after you're out the door.  Ruins your day, but you have more shirts.

**General geopoliticals analysis time... Will the allies continue to support Ukraine when public support waivers and why?**

Short of it - Yes and because it's a test run.

**The Long of it**

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is actually the perfect wake-up call the world needed that the long peace would not be sustained.

(Look up the long peace if you are unsure, but basically it a lack of a BIG war since WW2).

In the world today, many arguments can be made for aggressive world powers, but the two most threatening to democratic countries are easily Russia and PRC.

Russia eyes former Soviet Republics, PRC eyes Taiwan and SEA.

Russia invading Ukraine has basically become a geopolitical parallel to PRC and Taiwan.

NOT in military tactics and logistics but in geopolitical and diplomatic reaponse.

If we assume the USA will rush to Taiwan's defence (very likely) and Japan and Australia will at least assist (very likely); we can assume some sanctions will be enacted by EU.

So it's likely the largest chunks of Chinese exports and imports can be brutally cut off...

**Bottom line**

The allies and the world are likely to continue to support Ukraine and sanction Russia, even if public support isn't particularly high as it is in everyone's interest to ensure this doesn't happen again in Taiwan.

Supporting Ukraine irrespective of being the right thing to do is going to be in the national interest of most peaceful, democratic nations the world over. Most of those nations benefit from the prosperity and trade that peace provide.

PRC is going to be looking at such a response and thinking about soft power and coercise options to change it, as the invasion of Taiwan isn't just militarily costly, but economically crippling too.

Thoughts?

Tucker Carlson said the Taliban is a national treasure because they keep feminists in their place and prevent women from getting an education. When questioned why he would say something like that, he claimed that Afghan women were all going to school to do a degree in feminism and complain about the patriarchy and adding nothing of value to the world. He said what Afghan women really need is to obey their husbands and stick to their culture which has ""worked"" for them for thousands of years etc

Tucker then invited Matt Gatez (A child sex trafficker and a friend of his) on his show and then went onto claim that children in Ukraine who were raped by Putin's thugs should be forced to carry the pregnancy (because the unborn did nothing wrong) and he slammed the US President calling Joe Biden a murderer for wanting to send abortion pills to help pregnant children who were raped by Russian Nazi Soldiers of Putin's regime.

We see borders on a map. ""Here be Ukraine"", ""Here be Russia"", and ""Oy, Crimea belongs to Ukraine, get out!"". This is a fundamental way Western democracies, especially European ones with a history of re-drawing national borders, view things.

Russians see territory more like ""all our base are belong to us"": Kyiv and Odesa? Russia! Belarus? It's right in the name, Russia! They don't need to own the territory, politically, but they insist on being able to control it because, culturally and economically, they view it as part of theirs.

The war in Ukraine is the fight between western nationalism and russian imperialism.

That's why there is a grain of truth to the idea that NATO ""expansion"" threatens Russia.  Not Russia the country... Russia the \*empire\*.  Russia invaded Ukraine to protect its imperialist dreams.

Ukrainian forces, having spotted a Russian warship in the Black Sea, called their American contacts for confirmation that it was in fact the Moskva, sources familiar with the events told CNN. The US responded that it was, and provided intelligence about its location.

It is not clear whether the US knew Ukraine would move to strike the ship, however, and the US was not involved in that decision, the sources said. 

The ship sank after it was struck by two Ukrainian cruise missiles on April 14, dealing a huge blow to the Russian military.

The episode, first reported by NBC News, reflects the Biden administration’s increasingly forward-leaning posture when it comes to sharing intelligence with Ukraine, part of a broader policy shift toward helping Ukraine defeat Russia decisively on the battlefield and significantly weaken its military. 

But it also raises questions about what both the US and Russia’s red lines are when it comes to US military support to Ukraine.  

The US has for months been providing Ukrainian forces with intelligence about Russian troop movements inside Ukraine, including intercepted communications about Russian military planning. It also provides Ukraine with maritime awareness information to allow them to better understand the threat posed by Russian ships in the Black Sea, many of which are firing missiles onto Ukrainian territory. 

There are also clear limits, however, to what the US will share, multiple sources told CNN. 

For example, the US has so far declined to provide information to Ukraine about potential targets inside Russia itself. And while the intelligence the US shares about Russian troop movements inside Ukraine can include details like vehicles and types of personnel at a particular location, the US has not provided Ukraine with intelligence about specific Russian military leaders’ whereabouts, officials have said.  

“We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. Kirby added that “Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intelligence that they themselves are gathering on the battlefield, and then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions.",False,1651809357.0,t3_uiotzv,t3_uiotzv,,0,2,0,2,1,0,

a) Both sides engage in non-nuclear fashion, Russia is forced to retreat out of all of Ukraine and Crimea. Russia is condemned and isolated.

Because if the farewell en bloc of the members of the commission, according to what emerged on Tuesday, will be the first step to lead him to leave the chair, the former senator M5s already announces his counter -move : ""I will not resign and in any case I will appeal to the Constitutional Court ”, he announced.

“I will not appeal the decision - not yet formalized - of the expulsion from the 5 Star Movement . I have been in politics since I was sixteen and I am used to everything but I believe that ""the decision to remove me from the presidency of the commission"" could create a dangerous precedent "", he explained intercepted in the Senate where the Foreign Affairs commission was convened at 10, but it was not turning point given the situation. “I feel a little sorry for the situation - he concluded by letting it be known that he will not reconvene any session - for the structure of this institution . It will certainly be a case study for jurisprudence . Perhaps, since we are in a climate of war, some might think it would be useful to eliminate a dangerous pro-Russian and pro-Putinian , I believe that in reality everything has been edited "".

Meanwhile, the resignations of the members are in the process of being formalized, as emerged on Tuesday evening after the meeting of the Council for the regulation of the Senate . All the groups left the third commission, including senator M5S Alberto Airola , together with colleagues Paola Taverna , Simona Nocerino and fellow Movement companion Gianluca Ferrara . Confirmation came from the League this morning that ""the senators who are part of the Foreign Affairs Commission have signed the letter of resignation"". These are Tony Chike Iwobi , Stefano Lucidi , Matteo Salvini and Manuel Vescovi. The resignation of the members of Fi confirmed, as announced by Petrocelli himself, and also that of Adolfo Urso , the only representative of the Brothers of Italy .

In any case, the formalization to the presidency of the Senate of the resignation of the members of the Palazzo Madama body is now awaited, to then proceed to a new meeting of the group leader , who will take note of the new situation. Once the resignation arrives, the presidents of the groups will have to formalize the intention not to replace them with party colleagues. At this point, the president Maria Elisabetta Casellati and the Council for the regulation would be willing to support the dissolution of the commission itself due to the impossibility of being able to continue to carry out its duties, in such a delicate moment determined by the war in Ukraine .

The areas closer to the border are not really possible to 'hold', though they can keep them from being occupied.  Ukraine can't operate out of them or anything, as they're well within artillery range from inside the Russian border, and the area is well outside safe airspace for UA planes.  They may be able to evacuate formerly occupied civilians, but you couldn't label those towns 'liberated'.  

It will be interesting to see what if anything UA can do to capitalize on these successes (not that they've happened yet, but they look promising).  There are about 5-6 brigades operating in and around Kharkiv for UA.  The three largest of these are militia, which are mostly locals.  It is unlikely many of them will be used in attacks or defense on other fronts and arenas.  Two of the remaining brigades are not full strength (I mean, none of Russia's are either, but still), and so it would be unwise to redistribute those right away.  Because a river bisects the area running north to south, the only way eastward toward the Russian supply lines is by fording it, since Russia has blown the bridges there.  So there is no clear next step in that direction except defense.  

I suspect UA will continue to push Russian forces out of Kharkiv until a strip 50-70km between the city and the border, which will remain unoccupied by either force.  That is, Staryi Saltiv represents the extent or near to the extent of territory Ukraine can utilize.  At that point things will start to slow down for UA as they recover and focus on long-range artillery strikes against the Russian supply lines toward Izyum east of Kharkiv, and Russian operational targets in Belgorad north of Kharkiv.  They should also be able to send the bulk of their tanks and APCs to join up with Donbas forces.  Not sure how many that will be; they will also be the principal losses among UA equip in these counteroffensives.",False,1651802124.0,t3_uiotzv,t1_i7i1833,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

24fd37983f0d450de9f47d145189ce22,uiotzv,i7dx0qz,"(CONT.) U.S. intelligence support to the Ukrainians has had a decisive effect on the battlefield, confirming targets identified by the Ukrainian military and pointing it to new targets. The flow of actionable intelligence on the movement of Russian troops that America has given Ukraine has few precedents.

Since failing to advance on Kyiv, the capital, in the early part of the war, Russia has tried to regroup, with a more concentrated push in eastern Ukraine that so far has moved slowly and unevenly.

Officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the classified intelligence being shared with Ukaine.

The administration has sought to keep much of the battlefield intelligence secret, out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war. American officials would not describe how they have acquired information on Russian troop headquarters, for fear of endangering their methods of collection. But throughout the war, the U.S. intelligence agencies have used a variety of sources, including classified and commercial satellites, to trace Russian troop movements.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III went so far as to say last month that “we want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.”

Asked about the intelligence being provided to the Ukrainians, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that “we will not speak to the details of that information.” But he acknowledged that the United States provides “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves.”

After this article published, Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement that the battlefield intelligence was not provided to the Ukrainians “with the intent to kill Russian generals.”

Not all the strikes have been carried out with American intelligence. A strike over the weekend at a location in eastern Ukraine where Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s highest-ranking uniformed officer, had visited was not aided by American intelligence, according to multiple U.S. officials. The United States prohibits itself from providing intelligence about the most senior Russian leaders, officials said.

But American intelligence was critical in the deaths of other generals, officials acknowledged.

The United States routinely provides information about the movement of Russian troops and equipment, and helps Ukraine confirm the location of critical targets. Other NATO allies also give real-time intelligence to the Ukrainian military.

The Biden administration is also supplying new weaponry that should improve Ukraine’s ability to target senior Russian officers. The smaller version of the Switchblade drone, which is now arriving on the battlefield, can be used to identify and kill individual soldiers, and could take out a general sitting in a vehicle or giving orders on a front line.

American officials have acknowledged publicly that the United States began giving Ukraine actionable intelligence in the run-up to Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24. Ahead of the invasion, for example, U.S. intelligence agencies warned of an impending attack on the Hostomel airport north of Kyiv. That allowed Ukraine to strengthen its defenses. Russian airborne forces were ultimately unable to hold the airfield.

While the information the United States has provided Ukraine has proved valuable, Russian generals have often left themselves exposed to electronic eavesdropping by speaking over unsecure phones and radios, current and former American military officials said.

“It shows poor discipline, lack of experience, arrogance and failure to appreciate Ukrainian capabilities,” said Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe who is now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. “It is not hard to geo-locate someone on a phone talking in the clear.”

Russian military tactics have also left senior generals vulnerable. A centralized, top-down command hierarchy gives decision-making authority only to the highest levels — compared to the more decentralized American structure that pushes many battlefield decisions to senior enlisted personnel and junior officers — forcing Russian generals to make risky trips to the front lines to resolve logistical and operational issues.

“When there are problems, the general officers have to go sort it out,” said General Hodges.

Although the administration remains wary of inflaming Mr. Putin to the point that he further escalates his attacks — President Biden has said he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a “no-fly zone” there — current and former officials said the White House finds some value in warning Russia that Ukraine has the weight of the United States and NATO behind it.

Some European officials believe, despite Mr. Putin’s rhetoric that Russia is battling NATO and the West, he has so far been deterred from starting a wider war. American officials are less certain, and have been debating for weeks why Mr. Putin has not done more to escalate the conflict.
Officials said Moscow has its own calculations to weigh, including whether it can handle a bigger war, particularly one that would allow NATO to invoke its mutual defense charter or enter the war more directly.

“Clearly, we want the Russians to know on some level that we are helping the Ukrainians to this extent, and we will continue to do so,” said Evelyn Farkas, the former top Defense Department official for Russia and Ukraine in the Obama administration. “We will give them everything they need to win, and we’re not afraid of Vladimir Putin’s reaction to that. We won’t be self-deterred.”

But intelligence sharing is considered a safe form of help because it is invisible, or, at least, deniable. American intelligence has given secret information to Ukraine in a wide range of areas, from Russian troop movements to targeting data, officials said.

Last month, the United States increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine about Russian forces in the Donbas and Crimea, as Kyiv’s military forces prepared to defend against a renewed offensive by Moscow in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials said.

“There’s a significant amount of intelligence flowing to Ukraine from the United States,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate panel on Tuesday. “We have opened up the pipes.”",False,1651723806.0,t3_uiotzv,t1_i7dwsro,,1,40,0,40,0,0,

The driveway was around a quarter of a mile long passing a small lake and a copse of redbuds blooming to signal spring. The cabin was set behind all of these. There were no neighbors beyond fields of corn and wheat yet to start sprouting. Hanging from a small pole at the door of the cabin was a Ukrainian flag. It was there hidden from performance and posturing. You could tell the owners put it up in a small act of defiance and support.  It was a reminder that thousands of miles away in a part of the world that is arguably one of the most secure and removed from the war people see the injustice, they see the suffering, they see the kinship that binds us to the people of Ukraine and to each other.

On the surface, it was just a flag. But someone watched what is occurring. Someone felt something; sympathy, empathy, sadness, anger. What, I cannot say. But there was closeness in the act, and the solitary nature of it. Closeness to the people of Ukraine. They found a flag and took the time to hang it.

The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. Ukraine was one of the largest grain producing states in the USSR and as a result was hit particularly hard by the famine. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly.

So depends on the size and scope of the coup.  If it's a simple internal replacement, say via military, Russia would stop that immediately.  If it's a popular revolution, even a peaceful one, it will be more difficult for Russia to prevent it.  They would probably still try, and if unsuccessful, claim part of the territory of Belarus that encompasses where their bases are, and sit in it for months to years.  

If Belarus' new government has enough time to mandate policy from a central location, they could open the country up to peacekeeping forces, but that's problematic if Russian military is still in the country, which is another reason they wouldn't just leave.  

So I don't think anything immediate would be resolved with regards to Belarus, but I absolutely think it would shorten the war in Ukraine.  Russia wouldn't vacate those bases, but they couldn't operate out of them, either.

Running around with a 5-ton gun that costs $500,000 without any engine that can actually move that gun around is a dumb idea today. That's why anti-tank guns aren't used, because you can't run-away effectively. (Might as well have a proper tank, you know, big enough engine + big enough armor to protect the gun and crew).

Once you are in the ""always have a nearby truck to tow the gun"", you then start to add armor to the tow-truck, the armor weighs a lot so you need to add more engine to move the armor+truck+gun, so you add a bigger engine, but the bigger engine is a bigger target, so you add more armor to protect the engine... and lo-and-behold you're reinventing the tank.

------------

Instead of an anti-tank gun, AT4 and Javelins are used instead, because chemical-explosive penetrators have gotten better and better. And instead of weighing 5+ tons (like an anti-tank gun weighs), AT4 and Javelins weigh 15lbs to 50lbs (8kg to 20kg), and are therefore man-portable. Worst case scenario, you can run away while holding a 15lb to 50lb weapon. You cannot run away with a 5+ ton gun however.

That's an important difference, given the reporting in that NYTimes article that the US didn't provide the intel on the strike that targeted Gerasimov,

I thought that was obvious, but we're the only two who've drawn that conclusion.

What he was saying was ""Yes to the lesser generals, no to the country's leaders"". Gerasimov was the exception, and they specifically said they did not share his location.

This is because it's difficult to defend against assassination. So a mutual courtesy that Russia and the US and others have extended to each other for 70 years, is that senior government officials are off limits.

Because you can't realistically protect these people if someone with a nation's resources wants them picked off. If you start killing theirs, they they start killing yours, and then the whole world is unstable because no one knows or trusts anyone or has relationships with them because everyone's always new, and no one has experience, there's constant overthrows, etc.

Targeting Gerasimov is more of a political target than a military one. He's the person in charge of the armed forces for all of Russia.

And, yeah, things are so fucked up he literally traveled to Izium to see people face to face so that people stop lying and he can get truth out of them. Same reason every general is having to get right to the goddamn front lines and start telling people ""You go there and do this. You go that way.

Eh. Don't agree. Russian army is top heavy with little independence on lower levels, so the top of the chain is important even if it can be replaced. Also, they may start off incompetent, but even if they continue to be they'll begin to adjust to the situation on the ground, they gain an understanding of how the enemy reacts and how shit their army is and what to expect out of them.

Whenever a general dies a new general has to be brought in that hasn't had sufficient time to get up to speed. They're either giving orders before they know the situation or pausing operations until they get a base level of understanding.

And, what we've seen is, they get up to speed, realize they're fucked, get close to the front get bombed and die, starting the process over.

 * 1) Ensure the stockpiles are absolutely as massive as possible.
 * 2) Prior to any such invasion/attack, move as much of that money out of foreign banks/corporations and into Chinese based entities as possible.

Russia had ~$660 billion in dollars around the world and didn't think sanctions were going to hit as fast and hard as they did. As such around half of that is frozen and unable to be used. If they'd managed to extract most of it to Russian banks, they would be much more comfortable about a longer slog of a fight.

The other big takeaway is that vast quantities of cheap and relatively low-capability defensive weapons can be exceedingly meaningful. Load up Taiwan with tens of thousands of shoulder fired rockets (both anti-tank and anti-air) and you dramatically level the playing field when it comes to military resources. Whatever troops actually manage to make it ashore would have to do things almost purely with infantry. The only way to properly deal with that would be for China to effectively level the island with long range weaponry, which would negate the vast majority of the point in taking it. China gets more money out if it existing like it currently does than they would destroying all of its money making enterprises by taking it. Not to mention there's already a growing emphasis on providing them better anti-shipping weapons.

And of course, all the major militaries are sort of squirming a bit because this war is just a taster of things to come for small drones. The Switchblade 300 (antipersonnel) has a unit cost of just $6,000. The Switchblade 600 (antitank) is almost certainly not MUCH more expensive. Even if it was $20,000 it would effectively be free. A T90 tank has a unit cost of around $4.25 million. Assuming that made up $20K number, it means for every single T90 produced, you could have 212 Switchblade 600s.

Now, to be clear about drones, someone put it well a while ago. Drone tech is in the same space planes were in WW1. Rapidly evolving developmentally and almost able to operate with impunity. Various things done in WW1 couldn't be done in WW2 simply because now there was a form of mature anti-aircraft weaponry around (flack guns) so new tactics and technologies had to be developed. Right now nobody knows of a GOOD way to deal with drones (detecting them is hard, and killing them without spending a million dollars to take out a drone three orders of magnitude cheaper is not a long term solution), but in the next 10-20 years SOMEONE is going to figure it out and then things will change again.",False,1651745310.0,t3_uiotzv,t1_i7ejju0,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

ASEAN will not get involved with Taiwan. They're completely out of their depth with China and don't have the same level of cohesion (imo) as the EU. And even if they were, they do not have the arms to even think about helping.

So any Chinese invasion will likely lead to full on war with the US, and Korea/Japan will likely be pulled in due to them having bases. 

So, I don't think seeing the failures of Russia has changed the situation much. The main factor is how willing China is to go toe to toe with the US.

I think the US, the NATO alliance and the institution of the EU have so much to gain here there is no way they will let it go in the foreseeable future. Most of the pain for them is already done. It will be mostly about gains for them now. 

But there’s much more to this than just economic and political gains.

Russia has been a serious pain in the arse for most 1st world countries over the last 20 years. It has become a safe haven for organised crime. Ransomeware is almost a national industry. Russia’s influence and active encouragement of corruption and autocracy has been disastrous for the 1st world’s efforts to improve the lot of people in areas like the Middle East and Africa. 

BUT the biggest negative influence of Russia is the reason - more than anything else - why it will be ground into dust by America, Europe, the UK, Japan, Australia and many other powerful 1st world countries is its political interference and support for organised crime.

The fact that Trump, Qanon, Le Pen, and many other corrosive political interests have been propped up and sometimes even created by help and money from Russia has been noticed. It’s been remembered.

Biden and the Democrats won’t forget this. Macron, who has been neutral toward Russia, will not forget who financed Le Pen. Even now, it’s obvious that Russia and its political influence even interferes in a deliberate corrosive way on America’s current debate over abortion. 

Russia’s heavy handed approach to crime and political interference has made it HATED in most of the worlds powerful countries.

Russia has seemed to think they have been cleaver in these things.

It’s my opinion that these morally immature and destructive actions by Russia will ensure that it won’t be forgotten, and the West will have absolutely no mercy on it.

Above anything else, this foolish and disrespectful approach to its neighbours and international policy will seal its fate.

As it should.

- Significantly damage an opponent of their influence.

- Cut Russia from a closer relationship with traditional US allies.

- Get the max amount of power and influence shown to the world, for a fairly low cost. (If they were to consider a similar action towards China, the cost would be high and impact much smaller.)

- A preemptive show of force towards China and the rest of the world.


EU has a high economic cost, an ideological reward and no ''soldiers lost''.

- War on their doorstep, in a time of ''No more war in Europe''.

- Costly and damaging sanctions, but with massive popular support, dooming the careers of many who are opposing it.

- Gives politicians a free hand to implement massive reforms of the EU and their own nations political boundaries. (EU probably will be given a role in buying oil and gas from now on.) (Germany rearms and opens for expanding their spending.)

- No warexhaustion from losing thousands in battle, weapon exports have no real impact on the population. A form of ''low cost, high prestige'' policy, which they can't back down from without political repercussions.


UK has limited direct economic damage, Londons role internationally impacted.

- Follows US position somewhat

- A nice distraction for the political leadership, at a very important point of time.

- Limited direct damage to the economy, but massive damage to their position as a safe harbour for Russian money. Likely willing to try and limit this damage as quickly as possible.

Chinas massive headache, coming at a bad time.

- No interest in disturbing status quo, must maintain good relations with Russia to balance India/Russia/US relations.

- Losing Russia impacts their national security and makes the risk of pushing them towards India, an regional rival. 

- Any progress for US in Europe, will impact China in the pacific.

- Weaking economic growth, national security concerns, an show of force from the US regarding Chinas massive economic reserves. This is a bad situation, and needs to end quickly without Russian political backlash towards China.

India is given a limited role in this conflict.

- They have their needs and issues. (Sri Lanka crisis on their border, energy demands skyrockets)

- Being pressured by EU and US, for fairly insignificant but symbolic gestures.

- Balances relations with foreign powers for numerous reasons, Pakistan, China border, Russians strategic position, US/EU demands and influence. Is in somewhat of a bind, and therefore can't alienate any party to a large degree.


Rest of the world: Shitty situation getting more shitty. (Especially for Turkey and the poorer regions of the world.)

- Food prices increase

- Gas and energy prices increase 

- Economic growth will stall, likely a worldwide recession is coming.

- More political unrest, impact from global warming overshadowed by this high profile war and the resulting refugees. Limiting the amount of aid and political will from the richer nations to act in other crisis.

There's pretty much nothing wrong with 152mm guns... except one thing. USA makes 155mm ammo... not 152mm ammo.

So USA has to provide Ukraine M777 guns so that Ukraine can actually use the 155mm ammo we give them. M777 is a newer design, made out of lighter-weight Titanium so that they're easier to move compared to the older 80s-style guns, but their tactics are fundamentally the same.

The 155mm artillery shells we give also have neat tricks: everyone knows about the M982 Excalibur by now, but the Soviet-era 152mm shells also have neat tricks, like laser-guidance. We just can't supply 152mm shells (smart or dumb) to the Ukrainians.

In the ideal world (for Ukraine), USA could have provided more 152mm guns that Ukrainians were already trained on, and 152mm ammo. Alas, USA is on the 155mm NATO-standard instead, so the only reasonable way to supply Ukraine is to get them to switch weapons, which is really complicated to do during a war.

Extremely unlikely for man portable drones, Bayraktars and bigger yeah ok .

For a drone to carry a gun of relevant size with a relevant sniper rifle calibre .308 or higher you take away the inherent quality that makes off the shelf drones so useful - small and agile, hard to spot and hit. It is also far easier to make and mount a bomb (anyone that has completed basic HS chemistry can make a bomb) and a release mechanism which is optional - see switchblade. It is exponentially more complicated to piece together a drone with stabilisation, a strengthened airframe and carrying capacity capable of carrying the weapon.

You need to pack in stabilisation, sniping is an art and requires a stable platform. 100-200ft in the air and you are being buffeted by winds, you are combating gravity ie bullet drop. All of which makes precise shots harder. You don't see helicopters and planes using sniper type rifles as their armament for this very reason. It's machine guns, gatling guns autocannons - accuracy by volume of fire. You need the drone to have the ability to carry the damn thing, you compromise flight characteristics - rifles typically require 20"" usually 26"" barrels. So the drone will need to be massive in comparison to something like a switchblade. It's just not economical

fd93d0f1688bb1fea43222f7e46577dc,uiotzv,i7eszwl,"I wrote a post about this a few days ago. 

**TL;DR**: These weapons give the operator a way to precisely strike valuable targets from safety at quite long ranges. They're effective in situations where you don't have air supremacy or artillery available. They're also a LOT cheaper than the vehicles they'll be destroying.

US doctrine places a heavy emphasis on air supremacy, so their planes will be uncontested when doing precise strikes on enemy ground vehicles and positions. These can be done by planes with guided munitions and targeting pods, or UAVs. Loitering munitions will add another facet to how they can make these kinds of attacks, but they're already able to do this kind of thing without them.

Ukraine doesn't have air supremacy or the same kind of precision guided missiles and bombs that the US uses. If you want to carry out precision strikes on valuable targets your options are a lot more limited when you don't control the air.

They've been using the Bayraktar to good effect in this role, but they don't operate very many of them and attacking targets requires flying the drone to within a few kilometers of the target, which can leave them vulnerable to enemy antiaircraft defenses. Make no mistake, these are very useful platforms, but they can't win the war by themselves.

Another option is precision-guided artillery. You can use a laser designator or GPS to guide artillery shells precisely on a target. With this, artillery won't be a numbers game where you hope your shell or rocket lands close enough to the enemy to cause damage. Every hit can be a devastating direct hit.

Ukraine has its own domestically developed and produced precision-guided artillery shell, but we don't know how many they have. Their new western artillery will contain some number of guided munitions and I'm sure these will be put to great use.

Laser guidance still requires something to designate the target. The Bayraktar can do this , and Ukraine could be receiving or producing other UAVs in this role, from US platforms to cheaper drones armed with laser designators. We've already seen Ukrainian drone operators doing real time observation and fire correction for friendly artillery. It's an ideal role since you can have a great vantage point up high and these drones are often stealthy enough to fly all around the enemy. The operators are kept much safer than any recon or observation team would be on the ground trying to do the same job.

Their limitation is that artillery only has so much range, and they can be targeted in turn by enemy aircraft or artillery.

But what about hitting something that your artillery can't reach? Or isn't currently set up to attack? Maybe you can't get a designator drone into the area very fast or safely? Can you carry out a precision strike on these kinds of targets?

Enter the Phoenix Ghost and Switchblade. These are drones that can fly themselves into the enemy and explode, all controlled by a remote operator. These can be launched from kilometers away, and are hard to defend against. It's almost impossible to determine where they are being launched from. They're one-way, you just send them out and it's done. No need to fly a drone back to your territory to rearm.

The heavier ones, the Switchblade 600 and Phoenix Ghost have huge ranges and can loiter for a long time. These weapons are powerful enough to destroy most Russian vehicles.

Ukraine likely won't have enough of these systems to say, destroy every tank the Russians have, but they can be used to precisely hit very valuable vehicles. You could take out artillery batteries, or counter-battery radar. SAM launchers. Command posts. Ammunition or fuel dumps. Maybe even enemy aircraft that is landed.

The current war effort is unsustainable for Russia on the long run.

Current estimate put losses of Tanks and armored combat vehicles at 90% of the initial committed forces and 19%/33% of the available stockpile.

Meaning that this current war cannot be sustained more that 4 times the current during at the same intensity.

So, 2.5x4=10 months to go maximum.

Yet, others factors will play.

Troops losses and moral can trigger and collapse of the Russian army at any point. But, it's will probably be gradual and not all at once.

Some estimates says that this plus the losses will trigger a collapse in may/june. (But, could be negated but full mobilization of Russian)

Economic crisis in Russia or in the West can also trigger the end of the war.

Of this part the timeframe is the end of the years. Winter heating and oil contract renew.

But, everyone is worrying about an escalation of the conflict with Belarus adding their troops or Moldova opening a new front.

But it depends on what you mean by the war ending. This invasion really is just an extension of a war that's been going since 2014. Unless the Ukrainians manage to push the Russians all the way out, and keep them out, this is going to drag on for many, many years.

If the Russians keep going the way they have, with offensive operations, losing personnel and equipment at the current rate, they will likely not be able to sustain offensive operations beyond the winter, and the winter will take its toll. Most of Ukraine can get very cold in winter, and, as we all saw, the Russians don't even have proper winter clothing.

So, I think the most likely outcome (if Ukraine can't push them out) is that Putin, realizing that they aren't able to grab more land, at some point by the end of the year will claim a limited victory, and try to fortify whatever border there is at that point, just like in 2014.

But a lot of things could happen that would make this end (or escalate) very quickly. People in power suddenly die or are deposed, allegiances change, priorities may be forced to change, the economic effects of the sanctions may suddenly hit unexpectedly hard, Putin actually goes mad and uses nuclear weapons or attacks NATO territory etc. It's impossible to accurately predict what will happen when there's so much outside of the battlefield that could happen.",False,1651749499.0,t3_uiotzv,t1_i7elgnq,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Professional, disciplined armies not only provide training to reduce the risk of such atrocities, but actively seek out and punish such criminals from their midst.  The Russian army actively encourages such behaviour: it is part of their doctrine!  Putin even rewarded the perpetrators of the Bucha massacre with an honorary title.

Personally I don't *gloat* about any of what is taking place right now in Ukraine.  It is all horrific and appalling, and the suffering is immense.  But I do applaud every Ukrainian military success, and unfortunately that usually entails Russian soldiers getting killed.  As you say, that's the nature of war.

The C130 airplane can carry roughly 20-tons of cargo (depending on the C130-variant we're talking about of course).

That's 5x M777 guns.

In contrast, the Pzh 2000 weighs 60-tons and cannot be transported by a 20-ton cargo-plane **at all**. M109 Paladin is 27 tons, probably fitting on a larger cargo-plane but think about the logistics still: would you rather move 6x M777 guns per airplane delivery, or just 1x M109 per airplane delivery?

--------

M777 therefore is better at moving from USA to Ukraine. You can move them 6x faster than an M109 (because they're 1/6th the weight), and also move them in ways unavailable to the M109 (lighter tow vehicles, or even using  a helicopter).

But the more I dug into it and the tests/research that have actually gone in to the topic, I got rapidly more scared.

No I don't believe whatever resulting wave would ""plunge the british Isles into the depths of the sea"", but from what I can tell from a couple quick searches, a 100MT nuclear bomb would be theoretically capable of causing a tsunami. Whether it would be the size they claimed on TV is massively up for debate, but any kind of tsunami carrying radiation, hitting a country that does not have any form of defence against extreme 'weather' is bad news.

My primary worry here actually extends past the nuke,

They show an animation of a bomb going off off the coast of Donegal, Ireland, and go on to refer to it as ""the British Isles"".

Which says to me that if things were to escalate, whether or not theyre letting off tsunami causing nukes or just plain old ordinary boring ones, and say the UK intervene and become a target, wtf happens to Ireland?

It'll be two static artillery positions dueling it out for a long while.  

Yeah, I don't think there's any scenario where UA tries to occupy Russian territory.  Many reasons:  

- We obviously criticize the Russians for their treatment of civilians in towns they capture, but civilians are a thing you address.  However humanely Ukraine tried to be, many of them would die or have to be relocated and they're neither prepared nor willing to do that.  It would be a bad look, take more manpower than they have, and they wouldn't gain anything from it.  They're missing 10 million civilians themselves who fled the country or were captured into Russia; they couldn't populate even a ghost town and it wouldn't produce them materials for the war effort or anything like that.  

- Extends themselves further out from re-supply and open to attack on more sides.  

- What would be the end game of that strategy?  They're not capable of rolling into Moscow, and have no claim to Russian provinces any more than Russia has claim to Ukraine's.  If they take or destroy the bases set up inside Belgorad so Russia can't operate out of them anymore, Russia will continue to attack Belgorad from Voronezh, and so on and so forth.  What's the point.  Suppose they drew out troops from the Donbas; they'd be back there within a few weeks while UA loses their entire advancing force.  Suppose they took Moscow and sat inside the Kremlin; war doesn't end there like a chess match, it just gets harder.  

- Would trigger mobilization, something I'm still skeptical Russia will even attempt.  

- Would lose some allies within the EU, and they still need every one of them they can get.

There's a hierarchy to these automated and semi-automated accounts; some are set up as shepherds which promote a message or narrative (or sometimes more subtle nudges to a narrative; like we've seen here where someone opens a top-level discussion asking a carefully-phrased question) - and then following the shepherds are the sheep, who, en-mass (usually on Twitter or FB), reply with provocative responses, and upvote the shepherd. 

This gives the shepherd a very outsized karma rating, which amplifies their 'signal'. The sheep will upvote each-other as well, to add volume and resilience to the entire network.

These will also tie-in to a lot of the more vocal loudmouths (much more prominently on Twitter), who are the celebrities and influencers we know. The accounts of influencers will often have a large bot following: some are legitimate PR agencies (who still use these techniques; just to promote an overt narrative that aligns with the influencer's agenda), and some are externally controlled foreign helpers (ex. Russian troll-farms who have supported folks like Trump or Matt Gaetz, MTG, etc).  The ""official"" connection there is either covert or tenuous, in order to give plausible deniability.

 >Cargo 200 (Russian: Груз 200, Gruz dvésti) is a military code word used in the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states referring to the transportation of military fatalities. Officially, the term Cargo 200 is military jargon to refer specifically to the corpses of soldiers contained in zinc-lined coffins for air transportation. Unofficially, Cargo 200 is used to refer to all bodies of the dead being transported away from the battlefield, and has also become a euphemism for irreversible losses of manpower in a conflict.

But Israel has military in Syria in order to minimize Iran from growing and supporting pro Iranian militants. Syria, Iran, and Russia are all buddies in that conflict but on a day to day basis, Israel primarily coordinates with Russia so they don't end up in active conflict. Recently Russia went radio silent on Israel and even went so far as to keep their jammers up in Israeli controlled territory in Syria. Because Russia was then flexing and potentially putting Israelis at risk in Syria, Israel hasn't said too much with regards to Ukraine. Again, Israel officially is neutral in most foreign affairs except for Iran and the other Middle East nations that seek to destroy Israel.

Syria, Libya, and Yemen have been proxy wars with smaller proxy wars inside them, with insurgencies and race wars sprinkled in and it's good to know about them, but suffice it to say that whenever someone replies with one of those three nations to a complex question, just understand it's an absolute international political cluster fuck and whatever country you're asking about is probably just trying to keep their citizens alive in a very real sense.

>Perhaps the main factor in Israel’s official reluctance to criticize Putin harshly is Russia’s support of the regime in Syria, where both Russian and Iranian forces are present. Israel negotiated an understanding with the Russian military that enables Israeli forces to deconflict with Russian forces and strike Iranian targets in Syria. Israel views the Russian presence there as a check on Iran’s influence and therefore an important protection for Israeli security.

 >The nuclear-powered Project 949A Antey (Oscar II class) submarine Kursk (Russian: Project 949A Антей Atomnaya Podvodnaya Lodka ""Kursk"" (APL ""Kursk"")) sank in an accident on 12 August 2000 in the Barents Sea, during the first major Russian naval exercise in more than 10 years, and all 118 personnel on board were killed. The crews of nearby ships felt the initial explosion and a second, much larger, explosion, but the Russian Navy did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the sub for more than six hours.

To be fair, there is one difference: Vast areas of Europe were destroyed during WW2, so there wasn't really anywhere else for people to go. I would assume that new Mariupol will have only 20-50% of its pre-war population as many people will settle down in Ukraine or Europe before new housing is built (and it's quite possible that Ukraine will already factor that in while planning reconstruction).

New Mariupol will most likely be a city with high living standards though. I'm more worried about some small cities in the East, such as Volnovakha, where there is less symbolism around their reconstruction. I'm sure there will be some efforts undertaken but most inhabitants who fled to bigger cities will struggle to find a reason to return either way, so I find it perfectly plausible that cities like Zaporizhia or Dnipro will basically have entire settlements of people from destroyed towns.

Nobody's even close towards making a quadcopter sized drone that's nudging around Mach 1, much larger drones yes, but you've got normal SAM to deal with those. Further, the high frequency of the blades is probably a distinct enough signal that you can likely make sensitive band-pass filters for it.

That does not apply in Ukraine. Women are in active combat forces. Therefore the American term wouldn't be accurate and would imply only men are fighting. I believe 'friendly fire' would be more accurate and representative and not liable to metaphoric confusion.

Like, I know that's the common belief, but there's no way Germans didn't notice their neighbors being dragged off in Einstatzgruppen death vans (2 million people died this way) or paramilitary death squads.  This shit happened with thugs busting into people's homes and businesses, and every single contemporary source, from Anne Frank to resistance records, make it clear that every man, woman, and child knew that it was dangerous to even let a German citizen know you were Jewish, and they openly talked about what they were doing. Every town saw Kristallnacht, every town reported Jews and suspicious people to the Gestapo, and every town had people shot and killed within the town. 

Like, maybe they didn't know the exact mechanism.  But they sure as hell knew that Jews and other minorities were being killed. 

Another comparison is the Italians.  They were under a fascist, antisemetic dictator as well, and throughout WWII the regular Italian Army refused to ship Jewish prisoners to Germany because they didn't agree with what would happen to them.  The Pope and Catholics helped ship people out of Italy and the rest of Europe, Italian doctors made up fake panedmics to scare the Nazis away from the Jews, and the moment the SS invaded Italy to reinstate Mussolini in 1943, Italian farmers and citizens immediately hid Jewish children in their homes and attempted to get them out of the country. If dirt poor Italian farmers who themselves had voted in a fascist knew that Germans taking charge of Jewish children meant certain death, then the Germans absolutely did too. 

Every single level of knowledge from WWII, from Hitler's own words and plans that he announced publicly in newspapers and his book, to contemporary letters, to knowledge of people on the ground, they all knew that Jews and other ""undesireables"" were being killed en masse. Jewish fighters in Greece and Croatia intentionally preferred to get captured by the Italians instead of the Germans because they knew that they would just be interred and not sent to death camps. There's tons of documentation on this. 

There's this weird belief among more modern historians that there's no way that a huge group of modern people could be so unquestionably evil, and they're pushing the theory that the average German citizen had no idea what was going on, but the truth of the matter is that it's simply impossible to try an entire nation for murder.  

Arnold Schwarzenegger mentioned this a bit in his post January 6th speech, his father the men he grew up around from Austria were broken alcoholics who were absolutely certain that they were going to hell, and he knows they did.

That's one hell of a lot of physical deliveries to coordinate and manage.

And even then, before a channel has carried the size of its pad in messages, a new pad must be physically delivered to each participant in that channel.

Oh, and these physical deliveries become a vulnerability so you need to be super careful they're not intercepted (often by essentially dividing the pad across multiple separate couriers).

 >INS Arihant (SSBN 80) (Sanskrit: Vanquisher of Enemies), designated S2 Strategic Strike Nuclear Submarine, is the lead ship of India's  Arihant class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. The 6,000 tonne vessel was built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project at the Ship Building Centre in the port city of Visakhapatnam. Arihant was launched on 26 July 2009, the anniversary of Vijay Diwas (Kargil War Victory Day) by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. After fitting out and extensive sea trials, on 23 February 2016, she was confirmed as ready for operations, commissioned in August 2016, and deployed operationally in 2018.

 >Rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus), also known as rape, or oilseed rape, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of erucic acid. Canola are a group of rapeseed cultivars which were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and are especially prized for use as human and animal food. Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.

Russia are in occupation right now of most of the lands they intended to occupy before the war. It's really only Odessa they lack. If they mobilize as expected, they will probably achieve the larger goal of lands east of the Dniper.

Georgia they already largely control - they don't need to do more, Moldova is probably a target, and nothing can be done about this.. Finland? That's quite unrealistic.

Banking on Russia collapsing is too unreal to bet your country on - it's a hope and a dream. If Russia mobilizes and are unsuccessful, the next step is tactical nuclear weapons - which they have promised to use if their state is at risk (which it would be). 

And if they use them, they will use them on the Ukrainan NATO dagger in their heart. I think this is far more realistic a scenario, and a completely unnecessary one.

You are comparing things that have no relevance to one another because you don’t understand aviation or the military. In fact, Russia’s change in tactics implies things are going to get more dangerous for them, not less. Russia has used up so much of its stockpile of long range Air to Ground munitions that its planes are being forced to fly closer for their sorties now. That means fewer, more dangerous sorties. 

The UN coalition in all of Korea lost between 190 and 130 aircraft. Korea lasted 3 years. The invasion of Ukraine has lasted two months. Again, if the USAF lost 200 planes, it’d be massive news and a massive loss. We’re talking about a number in two months that matches or exceeds nearly every other loss of aircraft in any war post WWII. 

You yourself estimated only half of Russia’s aircraft work, so I was using your own numbers. If we’re suddenly changing to Russia’s stated numbers, a 4% loss of aircraft is still massive. 4% losses represent lost experience from dead pilots, lost equipment, lost personnel.
