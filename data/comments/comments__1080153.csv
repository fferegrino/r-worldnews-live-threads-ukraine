Day 320-321 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days haven’t been quiet at all, yesterday Russians were shelling everywhere they could reach and during the morning they fired a missile at a market in Shevchenkove, Kharkiv oblast, killing 2 civilians and injuring 6 more, including a child. They were not even trying to hit some military target, they just hit a meat store, killing its shopkeeper and one more person, fucking bastards.

Today it was quiet for most of the day, but at 10:53pm we suddenly heard a weird long-lasting sound, which we didn’t understand what it was at first, but immediately after people started reporting explosions, so it became pretty obvious what it was. The air raid alert was late by at least a minute, so we weren’t expecting incoming missiles at the time. They fired 2 missiles total and both of them landed in Kharkiv.

The sound was so weird because they hit a very unusual “target” this time. At first, we thought that people were joking when they were posting some kind of fireworks videos, but it turned out that Russian actually hit a fireworks warehouse. The “explosions” it made are unmistakable, they were very pretty and colorful, but Russians reported that it was a weapons warehouse anyway, I guess they never seen fireworks in their life and they think that that’s how ammo explosions look like. 

It was actually surprising just how much fireworks there were, they were exploding for at least 15-20 minutes straight, if not longer. But I guess it’s understandable because fireworks are now outlawed in our country during the war, if you use them in the city, you will almost certainly get found and jailed, so the fireworks market is not exactly booming right now, it makes sense that the warehouse would be full. I really don’t get what Russians were trying to do by blowing up fireworks, but good job on wasting 2 missiles destroying some fireworks.

>  
>Fighting has intensified around Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Kyiv warned Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian forces “have concentrated their greatest efforts” on Soledar, a salt mining town just three miles from Bakhmut, where the land is “covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes.”  
>  
>A senior Ukrainian defense official said Russian forces had regrouped and launched a powerful assault on Soledar over the weekend. The recent fighting has been “really savage,” including “thousands upon thousands of artillery rounds that have been delivered between both sides,” a senior U.S. defense official said Monday.  
>  
>Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.  
>  
>*Key developments*  
>  
>\* “Everything is completely destroyed, there is almost no life left,” Zelensky said of Soledar, which is divided between Russian and Ukrainian forces. “This is what madness looks like.” Russian forces and hired fighters from the Wagner Group are likely in control of most of the settlement, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday. For now, Ukraine is maintaining “stable defensive lines,” the ministry said, adding that both sides were wary that abandoned tunnels in the mining town could be used to infiltrate each other’s positions.  
>  
>\* Iran could be contributing to war crimes in Ukraine by providing military support to Russia, the White House said Monday. Russia has used hundreds of Iranian attack drones to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. “Their weapons are being used to kill civilians in Ukraine and to try to plunge cities into cold and darkness, which, from our point of view, puts Iran in a place where it could potentially be contributing to widespread war crimes,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.  
>  
>\* Two British volunteers went missing in the Donetsk region over the weekend, Ukrainian police said. The two men — Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry — were last seen leaving Kramatorsk for the front-line city of Soledar early Friday morning, British media reported. Bagshaw was in the country helping deliver humanitarian aid and evacuating elderly Ukrainians from their homes near the battlefield, New Zealand’s public broadcaster reported.  
>  
>*Battleground updates*  
>  
>\* Russia is turning to “increasingly drastic means to project force” beyond its borders into Ukraine, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday. He pointed to Moscow’s growing reliance on fighters from the Wagner Group, a private mercenary organization. “There are now tens of thousands of fighters associated not with the Russian military, but with the Wagner Group” in Ukraine, Price told reporters at a briefing. “And if you look at the backgrounds of so many of these fighters, these are not highly trained infantry men, these are convicts. … We have made the point that it reeks of desperation. It’s not going to change the ultimate tide of the battle.”  
>  
>\* Officials at a vocational school in eastern Ukraine dismissed claims by Russia that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in a missile strike there, the Associated Press reported Monday. Russia said Sunday it had targeted the school in Kramatorsk and killed 600 Ukrainian troops. Reporters visited the site Monday, where Yana Pristupa, the school’s deputy director, scoffed at Moscow’s claims. “Nobody saw a single spot of blood anywhere,” she told the AP.

These are the first ever Spetznaz GRU casualties confirmed by Russia, and both are high-ranking officers. ~~They're both~~ All three are from Special Operations Center ""Senezh"" military unit 92154, Russia's preimere special forces outfit, a rough equivalent of Russia's Delta Force. 

The [first meaty casualty](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1612702156682928128) is none other than the Commander of the Special Forces GRU Special Operations Center ""Senezh"" himself, a Lieutenant Colonel Mikheev Boris Vladimirovich. Born in 1985, graduated special forces 2003, served in Russia, 'middle East' and Syria, and received multiple awards. 

The [second casualty](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1583742943785287683) from the same day is a major Aseev, also from GRU Special Operations Center Senezh, military unit 92154. Described as having ""served abroad for 12 years"" and being wounded in action multiple times, the ""fighting major"" from Buryatiya was buried at the unit's top secret base near Moscow. 

[Edit] Oh apparently there's a third Major from the same special forces unit that died on the same day, but that one was announced back in August. [Major Shtepa](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1558138997989326850) was buried in his hometown on Aug 12th. His 33rd birthday would have been on the 8th. 

Russians provide scant details about how they died. Lt Col Mikheev apparently died of blood loss in the hospital after supposedly ""selflessly risking his life, he held the line of defense. Having been wounded, until the end of the battle he led the personnel and supporting fire weapons"". He received the Hero star posthumously. The fighting major ""died in battle saving wounded friends"".

On August 4th Ukraine was close to retaking Izium as well as probing around outer Kherson defenses. There were also various artillery and HIMARS strikes all over the place. Hard to say which was responsible for decapitating Russia's premiere special forces unit.

A couple of things:

>every morning I come in and I find out that the Russians have claimed to shoot something that we find out later that they did not. So I'd just -- I'd urge you to kind of take that with a grain of salt. And I'm not saying they didn't; I'm just saying, you know, their claims have largely been hyperbolic.

Here's the official announcement about the Patriot training:

>I can confirm that training for Ukrainian forces on the Patriot air defense system will begin as soon as next week at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The training will prepare approximately 90 to 100 Ukrainian soldiers to operate, maintain and sustain the defensive system over a training course expected to last several months.

Interesting slip up here:

>And once fielded, the Patriot will continue to -- excuse me -- will contribute to Ukraine's air defense capabilities 

(I wouldn't put much stock in it, as he probably just saw a word beginning with ""c"" and misspoke)

And some more bits on Ukrainian training that I think people should be aware of, and a reminder that we are not told everything that is going on:

>There has been training of Ukrainian forces in the United States before, as well as development. Ukrainians have attended our professional military education schools, they have embedded in headquarters of some of our units.

>I know from personal experience, during my time at U.S. Central Command, we had Ukrainians there as -- as part of a multi-nation coalition looking at regional threats in the CENTCOM AOR. So hopefully that -- that addresses that.

And, in answer to a more specific question:

>In terms of training in the United States, what -- we'll take your question. Yes, we have conducted training of Ukrainian forces, since the Russian invasion, in the United States but let me take that question and we'll -- we'll come back to you with whatever details we're able to provide on that.",False,1673396623.0,t3_1080153,t3_1080153,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

Even pro-Russian sources believe that Russian claims to fully surround it are BS. The situation is likely similar to what we see on maps like [this one from Def Mon](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1612891435128262675), two pincers to the north and south, and fire control over Ukraine's supply route into the city. 

Def Mon reads that as Russians being able to fire directly on the round from the high ground he marked, but that's likely wrong. Russian guns or tanks would be ultra high-priority targets that deep into Ukraine's backyard, and as such would be an easier problem to deal with. 

What Russia likely does now have is the same thing Ukraine's been enjoying for months: a good drone-artillery link. Russians control a lot of ground close enough to the road to where they can keep it under constant drone surveillance. 

This is somewhat corroborated by our favorite Bakhmut drone ace, the stick guy МАДЯР. His [video](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1077cbe/ua_kamikaze_drone_strike_russian_position_ukraine/) from a few days ago shows something incredible: a Russian drone operator getting VOG'd by Madyar's drone. A burly rescue squad arrives within 4 minutes, which is absolutely unheard of in theater. They jog with the drone operator in a stretcher for easily a mile before getting VOG'd again. 

Ukrainian defenders also report that the Russians attacking Soledar are far less anemic than the usual condemned mobiks they've gotten used to. There are freshly refitted VDV troops fighting alongside Wagner. 

That suggests Russians have their good reinforcements that incorporate high-profile drone operators in the area as part of the new offensive. Can't forget that Russia asked for their pinky-swear truce right before their offensive began. 

As the map looks today, Ukraine's position in Soledar looks untenable. The two Russian pincers are of course ripe for a counter-attack. For the next few days I would expect that

* Ukrainians try to retake ground around the city before they try to retake the city itself;

* Both Ukrainians and Russians pour reinforcements into the area;

* Ukrainian war-winning drones and artillery are likely stretched beyond thin. Their ability to bullseye Russian attacks while fending off reinforcements and doing round-the-clock counterbattery duty will decide the outcome of the battle.

* Ukrainians in Soledar will not be reinforced or supplied as well as we'd like until the supply route is secure;

* Russians are likely to continue to lie and claim far more progress than they attain;

* Ukrainian forces are by now guaranteed to have a set of conditions and a codeword for pulling out of Soledar. The longer Russians can hold the ground around the city they recently took, the more likely that retreat will be. Ukrainians are also guaranteed to have boobytrapped the famous salt *mines* and will deny Russians their use one way or another.

Lastly, maps and words are just maps and words. Bakhmut is a small town and Soledar is even smaller, only 5 square miles. These are not giant set piece battles with entire divisions. Individuals matter. A single squad can have a deciding effect on the day's events. 

Everything will be decided in the next few days. If Russia can keep up the momentum, Ukraine will be right to pull out. So the main question is, how big and how good are Russia's reserves?",False,1673389783.0,t3_1080153,t3_1080153,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

Speeding it up by providing advanced weapons, training and logistics is what's needed. We already provide a lot of intelligence, which is crucial and positive. But more help is required.

Is the western strategy to boil Russia and provide advanced weapons at a slow pace intentionally, to avoid a knee jerk reaction or to avoid feeding Russian rhetoric that this is a war agains't ''all of NATO''?

Ukrainians can profitably sell supplies to soldiers stationed in the NATO bases and collect high rent on the property NATO leases.  

Another option that will never happen is for Russia and NATO to agree to partially demilitarize their industries.  Everyone needs to spend a minimum percentage of defense appropriation on arms manufactured in Ukraine.  This is the best way to kick the MIC (Russian and Western) in the teeth long term.   In this scenario Ukraine will simply be better armed than Russia and Moscow will need Ukrainian ammunition if it wants to get into a war.

This is where negotiation should be focussed IMO.  No one lives in that water.  There is no *land* being given up.  Banning all gas exploration there is a goal everyone should back.  Just for Earth's climate regardless of what we think of the war.  Fishing *should* be limited to local fishers.

Of course they're stubbornly and incessantly propping it all up while posturing that everything is absolutely fine -- but ask yourself this -- if Europe should fall over and die over some high gas prices and the freezing poor (of which we have _far_ fewer than Russia, by percentage and numbers) how does the same line of thinking not make people understand Russia is keeping itself together using your metaphorical equivalent of spit?

Even if they keep shelling Ukraine for the entire year, their state is getting from bad to worse.

1) avoiding rapid Russian escalation
This isn’t really about nukes although they are something NATO has been worried about even if it would Russia committing murder-suicide. It was about things like preventing Russia from starting mobilization or entering a war footing. The fact that Russia didn’t go onto a war footing or start a “partial” mobilization until the fall has been a blessing for Ukraine. By slow-walking the weapons, Russia didn’t have the justification to mobilize or enter a war footing politically until the Kharkiv offensive happened. Unsurprisingly, Ukraine’s allies are sending a lot of powerful equipment now. 

2) avoiding other parties helping Russia
Russia has long been a major player in geopolitics but the only two countries actively sending them military aid are the international pariahs Iran and North Korea. The West paid attention to the lessens from WWI and the Korean War and have very deliberately tried to keep this a localized war. If they all ganged up on Russia and intervened more overtly, it could have given China a reason to intervene and flex its powers to protect an ally. Instead things have gone slowly, with Russia’s losses clearly being due to Russian incompetence instead of simply just Western intervention. China can just call Russia a moron and stay out of the stupid fight it picked. 

3) avoid draining Ukraine’s logistics  
NATO-standard weaponry is relatively new in Ukraine and often requires a longer logistical train and some training time. Back at the start of the war, people were talking about it taking 6-12 months for the Ukrainians to be trained on and have the logistics in place to handle NATO equipment. It’s been eleven months and suddenly Ukraine is getting a crap ton of NATO weapons and armor. The timeline lines up.

**If Ukraine loses Soledar:** It will have consequences for the defense of Bakhmut. Russia would be able to attack it from multiple directions, and probably interdict Ukraine's supply lines. Ukraine would likely have to retreat from Bakhmut and redeploy troops to plug the hole in their lines, delaying any planned offensives. 

**If Ukraine holds Soledar:** They don't gain anything in terms of territory, but they would take a lot of pressure off of Bakhmut, and potentially create more opportunities for offensive operations. The balance of the war would tip even further in Ukraine's favor. 

I have a lot of faith in Ukraine's ability to win this battle.

Besides, consumer drones are much more readily available and easy to replace.  From a logistical standpoint, they’re a much better tool than a long range suicide drone that’s powered by a lawnmower engine and flies at subsonic speeds.

1. Power consumption in the form of electricity is enormous (unless it's a non-electric laser, but then your advantages disappear): Lots of energy in a short time = huge, low-energy-density capacitors

2. Thermal blooming puts strict limits on both power and range. Short version: Pumping large amounts of energy through a small volume of the atmosphere causes heating which causes your laser beam to disperse and become ineffective after a certain range (more power = less range).

Number 2 in particular limits its usefulness for drone defense. Defending a trench from loitering munitions? Probably ok. Defending infrastructure. large areas: Gun-based systems probably have the upper hand while maintaining low cost (range-wise missiles are even better, but cost-prohibitive against cheap drones).

On behalf of the United States of America, I would like to make the following statement in regards to the remarks made by u/respondstostupidity in which was said ""Fuck apologizing to Putin:

> We know that it is wrong to apologize to Vladimir Putin for him thinking that we were insulting him for only being 5 feet 4 inches tall. Please be aware that statement was not apologizing to Putin for making light of the fact that Vladimir Putin is only 5'4"". What the statement was saying is that Vladimir Putin's height, which is only 5 feet 4 inches was not the reason he was being called a ""small man"", instead it was a statement about his character.  Also to get ahead of any further criticism, the statement did not in any way imply that Vladimir Putin being only 5 feet 4 inches tall has a small penis as some people believe that penis size is proportionate to height.  The fact that he has a small penis was in no way suggested by the statement. I apologize sincerely for any misunderstanding.",1673401396.0,1673401130.0,t3_1080153,t1_j3tu31p,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

As for the storage of small arms in the salt mine, 95% of modern small arms have been removed from there. The export process continues. Large batches of weapons from the Second World War remain in the mine: Thompson submachine guns, Mauser and Nagant pistols, fifteen thousand Mosin three-rulers from the First World War, German MG39 and MG42 machine guns, domestic Shpagin submachine guns (PPSh), machine guns "" Maxim"" and other ""exotic"", according to Biryukov.*",False,1673344300.0,t3_1080153,t1_j3q8or1,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

Their Black Sea Fleet HQ has been based in Sevastopol since the founding of the city. It was fairly easy for Russia to take over the peninsula. In other parts of the country, there were a number of pro Russian protests after Yanukovych fled. Most of these died out. In the Donbas, these protests were taken over by Russian nationalists, of which Girkin was a major player. He was the first “defense minister” of the so called DPR. They drove the protests and pushed to break away from Ukraine. Girkin openly admitted that he hoped there would be a repeat of Crimea in the Donbas. When Ukraine sent in their army, they quickly overpowered the ragtag militias. Rather than let them be defeated, Putin decided to send in the army under the guise of “patriotic volunteers” which was just as much bullshit as the little green men story. One of the units that downed MH17 was a regular Russian unit that had been brought into the country. He is a big reason why things have played out the way they have.

A lot of this will depend on practical circumstances and weapons like that have a lot of variability (weather conditions like rain, clouds fog, dust,...,drone shielding, etc.), so in practice that range can be a lot lower.

It also points out that ""more power = more range"" but in reality while more power allows you to lose more energy, blooming will also sap more of it as well, so there might be diminishing returns.

100-300kw laser output power also means also requires you to have a megawatt-scale power supply. Could be done loading it on one huge truck with trailer (supply and weapons system) or two smaller trucks, but it's definitely too much for the power generation of any ground vehicles normal power supply.

Drones could also be relatively cheaply shielded. This would not completely mitigate the system but greatly degrade its performace, especially at range.
