Day 109 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Thunderstorm went on for half a day since morning, so some of today’s shelling was masked by thunder. They always shell us more when there’s thunder, it’s pretty difficult differentiating them from one another, it really sucks that they are so similar sounding.

Today they also fired more missiles at us than usual, probably around 7, if not more, some were intercepted, but at least 4 hit their targets, whatever they might be. I think they fired 2 missiles during the day and then 4 or 5 more at 11pm, which is their usual time. Each one of those missiles costs millions of dollars, this is such a colossal waste of money, they don’t want to live better themselves, they just want others to live worse.

And then there’s their celebration of their national holiday in occupied territories, which was basically ignored by the people living there. Problem is that even those 30-50 people that showed up in Kherson are enough to create the fake image for Russians, they just had to choose the right angles.

Ukraine remains in control of the Azot chemical plant in Severodonetsk where hundreds of civilians are sheltering, the region’s governor said.

The comments came after a Russia-backed separatist leader claimed 300 to 400 Ukrainian fighters were also trapped there.

“The information about the blockade of the Azot plant is a lie,” said Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region. “Our forces are holding an industrial zone of Severodonetsk and are destroying the Russian army in the town.”

Ukraine has said some 800 people were hiding in several bomb shelters underneath the Azot plant, including about 200 employees and 600 residents of Severodonetsk.

Rodion Miroshnik, a Russian-backed representative of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, said 300 to 400 Ukrainian fighters were blockaded on the grounds of the plant, along with civilians, and had tried to negotiate their passage to the city of Lysychansk.

“Such demands are unacceptable and will not be discussed,” Miroshnik said, adding negotiations with fighters about civilians at the plant were under way

Also, the video claims Russia captured Novoznesneske in Kherson Oblast and Lupareve in the far south of Mykolaiv Oblast. This seems a bit illogical to me, since Ukrainians hold Tavriiske and Oleksandrivka, and Lupareve is right behind those two.

The L2 weighs over 60 tons, whereas the T-80 and its ilk are just over 40 tons. To that end, a non-trivial number of Soviet Era bridges were built to a standard capable of supporting the T-series tanks with not a lot of extra capacity. Not as an offensive measure, but as a cost savings measure. Good enough and no further.

If this is actually true (and I've got zero info on Ukrainian bridge standards, so apply salt liberally) then it does cause a pretty decent problem for the potential deployment of a variety of Western tanks.

Unlike US shells and rockets they are very dumb, simple and crudely designed. So they are dirt cheap. And this translates to design and build of their artillery and rocket systems.

The result of this is having a massive artillery capacity that however is very imprecise. Look at the videos from Russian artillery they hardly ever hit a target precisely. NATO general commented in April that only some 8% of their conventional and rocket artillery actually hit a designated target.

They use their artillery as wide area suppression to push the opponent back then advance with a BTG.

Ukraine has a completely different doctrine. Resembling more NATO strike groups, they do calculated precise artillery.

Their doctrine was codeveloped by Canadians who are at the very top of field artillery and their artillery university.

M777 and the various SPGs only improved on this. See from videos how precise UA artillery is.

Additionally Ukraine split up their artillery you hardly every see a full battery (4-6 units) usually its 1 or 2. They rely on being spread out and highly mobile so that pretty much any soldier can quickly call in an airstrike.

Russia has continued to invade non-NATO Ukraine over the years (2014 and now 2022) and has created a track record of being very untrustworthy. This makes peace deals especially difficult as the trust in Russia honoring the deal for more than a short period of time is quite low. Likewise, let’s not forget that Ukraine is its own country and really needs to be respected. The population doesn’t matter, but it is 40+ million people if you’re not aware. Finally, Russia really is the big instigator here. They are the ones who invaded Ukraine for ridiculous, ever changing reasons and have since then, *among other horrible things*, have prevented the shipping of Ukraine’s grain (it’s easier to ship via port than send via rail) and in some cases, have destroyed or stolen the grain themselves.

Something does need to be figured out here, but for Ukraine to call it quits now and let Russia essentially get away with everything is really what Russia wants. They want Ukraine and any country that supports Ukraine to grow tired of this and feel like the effort and support isn’t worth it anymore. There are sacrifices for supporting Ukraine, but the consequences of not supporting Ukraine are far greater. Accepting this likely will have terrible global consequences. Among other things (I am not going to get into everything here - there is a lot), it will send a message that if you do something bad to another country nothing will really happen to you in the long run.

Russia does saturation bombardments ahead of assaults on defensive positions, like WW1. Ukrainians can poke at armour from their concealed trenches with Javs and other AT systems, making armoured pushes that much less likely to succeed in breaching defensive lines without supporting precision air and arty cover.

Russia blows their arty load and don't really hit anything except adding more UXO to clear around the positions with overhead protection. Ukraine uses their guns to hit precise targets with fewer rounds (with doctrinal training and advisory services of the madlad Gunners, The Royal Canadian Artillery). A tactical view still has Ukrainian defenders in the cauldron at a defensive advantage if the aim is to be a killing field for Russian units - which it has been.

Yes, Ukraine is being provided with modern 155mm artillery, but we're still under 200 units based on reported numbers. The artillery is forced to operate at mid-range relatively close to the front.

It's why the long range MLRS/HIMARS munitions restriction is even more frustrating. If artillery parity isn't an option, then give Ukraine a greater ability to strategically target logistics, support, and command assets at a safe distance.

I posted this 2month ago about our Bunker system
>It's because after German reunifaction and the so called peace dividend, we hardly had any use for the bunkers. So as an example my home city build in WW2 over 35 huge air-raid bunkers and 141 small shelters. One reason why there have been relatively few deaths here, even when the city was 90% destroyed. But in the last few decades we turned them into penthouses, residence building, museums & culture points.

Now about the older weapon systems, warehouses and factorys, the picture is not that ""bleak"" if you look at the industry. We scrapped lots of the older tanks or sold former GDR equipment  to e.g. Poland, the got 9 MiG29 fighter jets for €1($1.20)  back in 2004. However lots of tanks got into storage. Like in 2015 the Bundeswehr bought back 100 Leopard 2 but  every tank had to be brought up to date first and thats was a bottleneck. In the cold war area you need to maintaince thousands of tanks after 2011 only 225 leo2 was left from ~3000 once.

If we're being honest, this war is probably going to drag into the fall, winter or maybe even 2023 and beyond. Russia has the ammo to keep the war going. They will continue to butcher tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops throughout that time. How will Ukraine weather that storm?

It's not a question of if, at this point -- both Ukraine and Russia are on the verge of logistical, and then military, collapse. It's just a question of when this will happen -- which country will suffer that logistical breakdown first. We are fucking hoping that it's Russia, but I don't know. Russia has nearly limitless ammunition and gun tubes to keep doing what it's doing. And contrary to claims here and elsewhere, they are not going to run out of manpower within a few months.

The best hope for Ukraine is that Russia's military will succumb to a full-scale, escalating mutiny, 1917-style, where soldiers along a whole front line just completely refuse to go into battle. That may well happen to Russia, but will it happen *before* Ukraine has to start large-scale withdrawals from their fortified positions because of a lack of enough arty and ammunition to counter-barrage Russian arty?

I honestly don't know if we can be so confident here. The reports that Ukraine has started conserving its counter-barrage fires out of fear of diminished ammunition is, IMO, the worst update we've had on the war since the opening weeks. There also appear to be more open reports by Ukrainian leadership of significant casualties on the front line. I think if these two updates are related, we're soon going to see reports of waning Ukrainian frontline soldier morale. How can you eagerly run into battle or maintain a pillbox trench system if you know that Russian artillery will inevitably kill you in a matter of weeks?

Something needs to be done that is different from the current Western donation scheme, and I don't know if it's as simple as just giving more NATO guns and launchers.",1655063457.0,1655062693.0,t3_vadu3l,t1_ic4ccch,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

The ability to publish information and make it accessible to others used to be the main roadblock to information exchange (expensive printing presses, information traveling only by written word or word of mouth, etc.); the amount generally accessible to the public was scarce enough that interest (in the information) was a good enough proxy for quality (of the information). Freedom of speech made perfect sense in that era, to minimize those roadblocks and make more information available to people to prevent stifling of the truth.

But these days, making information broadly available to people is so cheap it might as well not have any value at all. The bottleneck these days is not availability of information, but the scarcity of attention - you can see the hundreds of billions we spend on advertising, on the little bits of human attention extracted from people by online services and resold as ad space.

The goal, then, would be to have the truth win that competition - to make sure that people get more informed (from quality information) given everything they have access to. But, as noted above - it's abundantly clear this isn't the case.

Freedom of speech is still an important principle, in the sense that censorship does matter and can be used to suppress the truth. But mere access to information is not in-and-of-itself the end goal - not even access to true information is. The end goal is a well-informed populace that can make good decisions, and we need new principles to ensure that condition if we want democracy to survive into the future.",1655068517.0,1655068140.0,t3_vadu3l,t1_ic4o922,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

I'm not responding to the article per se; I'm responding to this particular chain of logic in your comment. The presumption that propaganda is weaker in the modern era than the Iron Curtain era due to increased access to information is, IMO, deeply flawed. People do not naturally gravitate towards the truest piece of information they have access to, far from it.
