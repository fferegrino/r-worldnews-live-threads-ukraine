>
>Parishioners have denounced Russian priests who advocated peace instead of victory in the war on Ukraine. Teachers lost their jobs after children tattled that they opposed the war. Neighbors who bore some trivial grudge for years have snitched on longtime foes. Workers rat on one another to their bosses or directly to the police or the Federal Security Service.
>
>This is the hostile, paranoid atmosphere of Russians at war with Ukraine and with one another. As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime cracks down on critics of the war and other political dissenters, citizens are policing one another in an echo of the darkest years of Joseph Stalin’s repression, triggering investigations, criminal charges, prosecutions and dismissals from work.
>
>Private conversations in restaurants and rail cars are fair game for eavesdroppers, who call police to arrest “traitors” and “enemies.” Social media posts, and messages — even in private chat groups — become incriminating evidence that can lead to a knock on the door by agents of the Federal Security Service of FSB.
>
>In March last year, Putin called on the nation to purge itself by spitting out traitors “like gnats.” He has since issued repeated dark warnings about internal enemies, claiming that Russia is fighting for its survival.
>
>Since the invasion began, at least 19,718 people have been arrested for their opposition to the war, according to legal rights group OVD-Info, with criminal cases launched against 584 people, and administrative cases mounted against 6,839. Many others faced intimidation or harassment from the authorities, lost jobs, or had relatives targeted, the organization said. According to rights group Memorial, there are 558 political prisoners now being held in Russia.
>
>“This wave of denunciations is one of the signs of totalitarianism, when people understand what is good — from the point of view of the president — and what is bad, so ‘Who is against us must be prosecuted,’” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who, like many Russians, has been designated a “foreign agent” by the authorities.
>
>There are dozens of reports in schools — teachers reporting children, children reporting teachers, directors reporting children or teachers — undermining the educational work and sowing divisions, fear and mistrust in school staff rooms, said Daniil Ken, head of the Alliance of Teachers, a small independent teachers’ association, who left Russia because of the war.
>
>The state’s use of snitches and the many random arrests serve as powerful tools of social control, Arkhipova said.

> *""donated 350,000 USD to provide medical equipment""*

That can be compared to their Russian business that expanded in 2022 and made a **profit of around $300 million in Russia**. 

I can see no good excuse for Mondelez. They can afford to leave Russia. They are not making critical humanitarian goods. They are not helping Ukraine by remaining.

Currently, he remains under medical care there. Leading specialists have been mobilized to address his critical condition. Blood purification procedures have been conducted, and Lukashenko's condition has been deemed non-transportable. The orchestrated efforts to save the Belarusian dictator aimed to dispel speculations regarding Kremlin's alleged involvement in his poisoning.

Irrespective of whether he recovers or not, doctors caution about the possibility of relapses. As  representatives of the Belarus Democratic Forum of the Republic of Belarus, we earnestly urge Western leaders to convene a strategic session in the coming days to discuss the ""Elections"" initiative and other measures that should be undertaken in order to secure the transitional period. We firmly assert that the existing technologies are adequate for conducting fair and transparent elections in Belarus in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, without direct interference from the Kremlin.

 By doing so, we will establish a legitimate institution in the eyes of all Belarusians and the global community at large. Holding elections during such a critical juncture will not only help restore law and order in the future Belarus but also lay the groundwork for stabilizing the situation on the borders of the European Union and the world.

They project fear as strength in place of sincerity, while being observably more akin to prisoners locked in a prison of their own making.  ""Dark ego"", bully's mind, unhealthy dependency relationship with the victim defending their oppressor (Stockholm/whatever label). Else, why try and hide it, rather than continue to proclaim from the pretentious pedastool of insecurity that they are, ""in fact"", truly superior, rather than following with underhanded endeavor to rewrite fiction over truth? The very effort to hide & bury it like the steaming pile it is, itself reveals the lie of what they pretend to otherwise.

For their masters, it is soulless strategm to avoid losing control to those they've wronged in pursuit of their own base appetites. Objectively sensible, when that same appetite continues unsatiated (and never will be, since it efforts to fill a void). But for their property? It's to keep them manipulated & controlled by replacing real with fiction & agency with arbitrary laws against that very agency (what, in some mystic texts I read way back, the ""marks of beasts"" symbolizes/represents in practical application, absent the rest of the 🎭)

It becomes self-fulfilling. They either victimize, &/or become victims themselves, mind shut off to alternatives & rigidly invested in an inflexible identification with a reality whose true nature is far more flexible. They refuse to bend, integrate, cooperate, include, etc., so they break & are, inevitably, broken, often by their very own efforts. [Insert wise or pithy phrase about vanity, hubris, egotism here]

Sad, to see human potential reduced to wallowing in such misery & spreading it in a desperate attempt to deny, rewrite, and control a reality that fear/desire refuses to navigate less destructively. They could be very successful as a nation, and never have to assault anyone, given all they have available in their own borders. Instead? They let delusions of grandeur - and the insecurities of that grandeur being observably false, regardless of loud shouts from them to the contrary - rule over them.

I could see Putin seeing negotiating anything as a sign of defeat and just not bothering. People in the thread often mention reparations and extraditing Russian war criminals but since there won't be boots on the ground inside there is no way to force them to agree to any of that. You could argue ""well if Russia wants any sanctions relief they'll have too"" but that presupposes that Putin *cares* about the economy for the average Russian, he obviously doesn't.

Putin and his cronies will be fine and if the economy of Russia goes to permanent shit what's the difference to them? As long as they don't see any signs of revolution, of which we have none of right now, they can just ride Russia into a North Korean style abyss. Plus they might suspect, as would be the truth, that it's not like Europe is going to suddenly start buying their oil and gas again anyway. So if India and China are going to be our main customers anyway does getting rid of sanctions help them  all that much? Plus they can always spin it as the west is the reason that Russia isn't doing well, which is what they've been saying in their propaganda for years. It all gets blamed on the west anyway so sanctions being permanent is one more excuse for them to accept zero responsibility for how bad things are in the country.

As in many places these borders remain in the same spots and are not paid similar reinforcement attention than in critical areas to the South, it would be good place to break trough. Russia has basically abandoned their cause and is clearly interested only in the land strip connecting Crimea to the main land.

Ukraine does not need a decisive victory this year. It is sufficient that it manages to use the western aid properly and create some tangible results. This would prove that with proper usage of Western equipment you can make the difference that Russia with their poor equipment didn't. The long term trends are what matter here.

There is one particular place of breaktrough i've been eyeing out for long time and it is the Marinka. It has straight highway passages to 2 directions making it dangerous to north and southern sectors and could provide quick route to encircle Donetsk city with mere presence.

In terms of the one-and-done counteroffensive, I think that’s a vast oversimplification of potential outcomes. 

First off, what does one-and-done mean? That Ukraine completes the counteroffensive and there’s a period of time between the next one? That there is never another counteroffensive? If the first case, how long does that period need to be before it’s considered one-and-done?

There are many possible outcomes, some that would of course lead to Ukraine needing some time to plan, re-supply, bolster the defence of any reclaimed territory, etc, before considering further counteroffensives, to varying degrees. So ultimately, I’m not sure what the point is of stating it’s a one-and-done counteroffensive, in terms of what they’re trying to say. Of course Ukraine will be looking to replenish any equipment loses, as well as requesting additional equipment, but that is an on-going thing.

There are still half a million members of the National Guard who are deeply loyal to Putin - not only to money - Rosgvardiya is basically a cult of Putin and Rosgvardiya's leader is one of Putin's oldest friends. Prigozhin doesn't have anywhere near the money to buy Zolotov, and Zolotov would be a moron to betray Putin and throw his lot in with an unpredictable pretender who will have every cause to murder Zolotov the minute he gets power. 

Then there's the secretive but powerful FSO (Federal Protective Service) who are Putin's most elite personal security force. They're the guys who have snipers covering everywhere that Putin goes, plainclothes agents, and other roles to protect the most important figures in Russia. Their whole point is to be seen as little as possible, but counter any possible threat. 

Then there's the FSB itself, which basically rules Russia (considering Putin is basically the king FSB guy). The FSB may be in the news for its fumbles and mistakes, but it would be foolish to think that they don't have the ability to protect their interests, and their interest is a monopoly on power. Prigozhin is not FSB and not part of the top silovik club, and like Zolotov, the FSB will know that Prigozhin will eliminate all Putin's old allies if he ever gets into power. Therefore all the most powerful figures in Russia have a *very* strong incentive not to let an outsider like Prigozhin get anywhere near the Kremlin. And if by some miracle Prigozhin even managed to get close to the Kremlin, Putin obviously won't be there.

But their livelihoods are also tied to Putin, if he goes down there is no guarantee who ever ends up in power will keep them around, in fact a new leader is more likely to want their own people in charge of those key areas. So the problem like in any coup is are you sure you're going to be on the winning side? Maybe you're not able to steal as much as you used to but it's still better than being dead. Also those around Putin are now often on sanctions list themselves, their assets abroad are being seized, do they want to risk installing a new leader that might be willing to take what they have left and give it as reparations?

With what seems like an almost totally docile Russian population the most likely cause of Putin being overthrown is from someone with some existing power in the country but all of those people are tainted by the war, I don't think it's clear cut to say that their life gets better under a new leader who you can't be certain what they will do. Does their life get better under a new leader? Can they travel abroad again and make new schemes? Or do they end up with what they have left given as reparations or maybe even worse in the dock at the Hague...

Putin might still be deposed but him and his inner circle have been destroying the Russian economy with decades of corruption and incompetence, the sanctions make it all much worse but that doesn't mean it isn't something Putin can't survive.

> The price cap on oil will certainly stay, it’s actually beneficial to the whole world in general.

The price cap exists for now but fast forward to a time where the war has been quiet for a couple years and Ukraine has all its territory back. India and China already don't care about the price cap, if that's who they're selling their oil to anyway it's functionally no difference to them if the sanctions are lifted by countries who don't want to buy their oil anyway. Plus if the Russian/Ukrainian border becomes pretty quiet for a couple years with few or no deaths countries that never agreed to the sanctions or price cap know they will get less flak for buying Russian oil and gas. So now all the sudden maybe India and China can't push Russia on price so much and the price they can charge goes up anyway.

I'm not sure about that. IMO Timothy Snyder has [a pretty good explanation][1] (youtube link to a specific question) on what Russian elections and Russian ""democracy"" mean.

And a quote if you prefer to read it:

> I mean, the Putin system is based upon turning democracy into a ritual using what Russians call the administer of resource. Because there’s no alternative ideology to democracy, Putin only survives with the repeated legitimation that democratic theater acts, democratic performances provide him. So every so often, every six years, we’re going to have an election, and Putin’s going to win that election. And he has to win it by a lot, not because people actually believe in the results—they don’t—but because the election proves that he’s the one who’s in charge, because he’s the one who’s running the election. That’s how it works. 
>
> The idea that elections could be real, whether it’s Pompeo who’s saying it or Clinton who’s saying it, the idea that elections could be real is a threat. Putin needs Russians to believe that elections are always a circus, a farce and a fake, because if Russians believed that British elections and German elections and American elections are also fake, they’re not going to mind that their own elections are fake. 
>
> So when Americans come to Russia and talk about votes being counted, I think he authentically regards that a threat, and the way he expresses that sense of threat is to say, “Our democracy is real. Their democracy is fake. We care about ourselves. They only care about meddling in our politics,” and so on and so forth.

From watching front line reports from Ukraine soldiers Russia did lose a lot of men.  But so many of those men were Wagner and then there are different level of soldiers inside of Wagner.  What Ukraine observed was that Russia would send a group of 4-6 Wagner to run 10-30m and try and entrench a position.  These are the fully dispensable prisoner population wagner with basically no military training, if they are killed in this effort then they get 6 more and try somewhere else.

Then if they succeed in entrenching that position more wagner move up to help fortify and expand the trench, these ones are the more trained wagner with better equipment etc, once that is done they will then have Russian military move into that position and the 4-6 wagner prisoners will try and move another 10-30m, rinse repeat.  

My point is that the value of the 1 Ukraine to the 3-6 Russians is quite different, Russia will win a war of attrition as they put less worth on their soldiers and have a much larger pool to recruit from.

On the one hand we have spin, talking up the strong points and downplaying the weak. This is is putting your best case forward and may involve some exaggeration if there is informational fog obscuring the facts. You pick the best numbers, even if they might be wrong. 

On the other hand we have the Russian way, which is to look at every piece of information released, good or bad, as a weapon that should in each and every case be exploited for maximum effect. The idea of referencing an external truth is not only unimportant here but actually detrimental. The planning is larger, and to discredit the very existence of an outside truth that can be used to compare and judge their statements against. 

For the Russian citizens, they are assaulted by contradictory facts about even basic things, yet need to get on with their lives, and so are effectively forced to just believe and work with it. They even have a special word, vranyo, for lies that everyone knows are lie but all parties pretend to continue to believe, even as all parties know full well that the other party also knows they are lies.

This is obviously confusing but more so is profoundly fucked up. 

It's an assault on the very idea of truth. In this it goes beyond even lying, by attacking the context where lying even means anything anymore. If nothing is really true they can substitute their own truth, completely. It's a means to control the population and seems to work, if you don't care about morality and consider it a weakness.

This is breathlessly cynical behavior. I think at the core this philosophy expresses a nihilistic moral relativism taken to its logical extreme. Information becomes no longer about describing reality, rightly or wrongly, but about constructing reality itself. It's about the power to literally make reality. The working principle is if everybody believes something it must be true, and it then becomes a fact. 

So no, the two sides are very, very different. They are in fact so different as to be fundamentally incomparable. 

They aren't even living in the same world. 

The sometimes large differences in reports between the US Pentagon and the UA Command or the British MOD are about perspective and biases. The difference between what the West says and what the Russians say is a fundamentally different approach to the purpose of communication itself and even the existence of an external truth at all. They are attacking reality itself.

Prigozhin has no chance, he has no base of power among the oligarchs or Russian elite and would be the least loyal to them, there is no way current Putin loyalists would want him in power. He is viewed as an upstart wannabe general, if Putin was deposed by the people around him they would pick someone from that circle, not outside of it. Plus as incompetent, corrupt and over extended as they are the regular Russian army is massive compared to Wagner, which also depends on the Ministry of Defense for it's ammunition and arms. Any prospective leader needs to get the MoD onside not Prigozhin, he might be loud but him and Wagner are nothing compared to the Russian army and internal security forces. Not sure who you heard that from but they are way off base on thinking Prigozhinn has a real chance of leading Russia.

> India and China love the price cap!

Yes but the price cap is working now because India and China are mostly the only ones buying. If the war stagnates and there are no more casualties with Ukraine having taken back everything more of the countries that are staying away from Russian oil will start buying again. It's mostly Western countries and their close allies that signed onto the price cap, most of the world is only staying away so they don't get any flak from the price cap countries. To be blunt if the body count goes close to zero and Ukraine won they'll start buying again because they know the heat will be off them and the price of Russian oil could easily go past the price cap.

The objective truth (as you call it) is that if Ukraine sends 4 Battalion's of men to take Oblast's main city - there is *nothing to stop them* there currently. They would straight up occupy the city. 80 to 400 guys (depends on your source) were able to get 10 miles into the Oblast being deciding to return home on their own. 4 Battalions would be able to get to the main city in less than a day.
