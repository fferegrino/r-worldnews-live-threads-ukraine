1.) FlightRadar uses ADS-B transponder data, not actual radar. These transponders transmit an ICAO address to aid in traffic control and flight tracking. FlightRadar simply uses this public domain data as a service.

2.) Military aircraft will turn on or off an ADS-B transponder based on the needs of the mission- either they're using civilian air corridors for routine flights or they want to be seen for any multitude of reasons, both benign and less-than. Actual shoot-em-up missions will NOT be on FlightRadar.

3.) It's a fun time-kill to watch, but remember that routine military missions happen all the time in places you wouldn't expect.

4.) ""BLOCKED"" is almost always an individually owned private jet that needs its ADS-B transponder on to use regular flight routes, but does not want to advertise whose aircraft it is and therefore, who may be on it.

FlightRadar is a neat diversion even in normal times; please don't try to read anymore into it than what's being shown. The revolution will not be televised (at least, not on FlightRadar.)

Back on 15 Jan when the LSTs left the Baltic and Northern Fleets, I wrote they’d likely be brought to the Black Sea for a possible amphibious assault landing at Odessa or Mariupol in tandem with an overland push.

They did in fact go to the Black Sea and Russia has kept an AGI (intelligence collection ship) loitering about 20 miles off the coast of Odessa for about 1-2 weeks so far. They then released a NOTAM saying they were closing off waters around Odessa to all commercial shipping and airlines. It seems way too obvious.

It’s been confirmed now some units in Crimea are leaving, whether they’re going to their home garrison or being repositioned is yet to be seen.

I think the most likely conclusion to be drawn is the Crimean buildup is potentially a feint or perhaps going to have some troops diverted to the Rostov region.

I’ve noticed their smallest buildup by far is their troops nearest the Donbas. The 150th motorised rifle division hasn’t done shit so far yet it lives like 40 miles from the UA border. I think I saw some OSINT that the 34th SMRB had deployed a BTG there and that was it.

Look at this map for an idea of what I’m talking about:

/r/warinukraine/comments/sunyqj/russian_ground_forces_posture_as_of_february_15/

All this talk of genocide in Ukraine, mass graves, recognising DPR/LPR and yet, hardly anything is deployed in the vicinity during this buildup. What gives?

My guess: Crimean units may swing over that way and reinforce that buildup while Russia says they’re de-escalating/pulling troops out. LSTs may depart. An amphibious assault would be difficult to pull off and Kyiv seems to clearly be the target based on their posturing in Belarus/Kursk/Belgorod regions.

Every other source discusses that Belarus could host or install weapons *after* this conflict. The word deploy is incredibly misleading.

They are talking about installing weapons after this conflict if they to perceive that they fall under western threat. While that is potentially dangerous and scary, it is very unlikely that Belarus has the resources to do this. Simultaneously, that news article will have zero effect on current Ukraine-Russia tensions and was therefore an irrelevant article to the situation that has just stoked fear.

3) Formula for de-escalation and package approach: Russia releases its reply to US

4) CAS affirms trimetazidine likely got into Valieva’s system through her grandfather’s drug

Now here are the top 4 stories of Tass.ru as of 7:30AM. I used Google Translate to convert the Russian to English. 

1) The US Senate adopted a resolution in support of Ukraine

2) The State Department said that Blinken is ready to meet with Lavrov at the end of next week

3) Izvestia: Russians will be able to revoke consent from banks for the processing of personal data

4) Antonov said that the United States condone the forced assimilation of Russians in Ukraine

They crave the chaos, while simultaneously saying, we just want peace and acceptance.  No, you want to be outraged to compensate for your particular lack of skills, personality, drive, etc.

The reality is humans need chaos.  Utopia no matter how desirable to the masses, becomes incredibly boring and meaningless. If things were perfect, social media wouldn’t be needed, the drive to progress wouldn’t be needed, and really nothing would mean anything.  Like it probably does anyway. 

Media shapes things to create a story. I feel for the people of Ukraine if invasion is really imminent and they’ve suffered much more hardships than the majority of users on this site.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banned_video_games#China

Developers don't want to lose the Chinese market so they usually avoid doing anything to piss them off, like actually acknowledging their existence. Most developers would rather turn a profit than have their games reflect reality, history or to make any kind of statement with them.

Don't forgot that the trailer for COD Black Ops got banned just for including a brief shot of Tinanmen Square.

https://www.vice.com/en/article/ep489p/china-bans-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-trailer-because-of-1989-tiananmen-square-footage

Developers kowtowing to China is ridiculous given that there's every chance the game gets banned anyway as the list of things which pisses them off is long, ridiculous and constantly changing. Blood and gore can get a game pulled. Or anything they consider vulgar/sexual content by their very prudish standards. Also they have a problem with games featuring skeletons, ghosts or other superstitious elements. Games have changed character models for China due to this.

Considering the recently imposed restrictions on playtime for children and that China had Valve make their own censored version of Steam which does stuff like prevent users having avatars or usernames and has only a fraction of the games available it seems possible that they may ultimately move to just ban all foreign games. It would be great for the world if they did because then we'd stop having developers compromise on content and actually tell the story they want to tell rather than the one the CCP wants.

The next COD game would only be about China if this happens.",False,1645154519.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxeaoc3,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

1369478f61a27484dfce934253bae7ae,suvioa,hxdmfpp,"Depends on their objective. If it’s an all out invasion then no. The Russian Air Force would start the conflict by neutralizing the Ukrainian Air Force, destroying them before they even leave the ground. At the same time missile batteries on the border would be taking out vital Ukrainian military targets such as radar stations, missile batteries, communication posts, anti aircraft/SAM sites and command centers. The Russian Navy would also be launching missiles from ships and submarines in the Black Sea. The ground forces would likely hold back and wait for the Air Force to finish mopping up the Ukrainian Air Force, this is to avoid friendly fire incidents. 

Once the Russians have complete control of the air then Russian armor, mechanized infantry and heavy weapons would move in. Long range artillery would be used to soften up Ukraines armor/tanks and heavy weapons as Russian tanks moved forward. Behind them the regularly infantry would follow in trucks and by train if possible to hold the territory their mechanized units have taken.

There likely won’t be a lot of pitched battles, if any, in this war. The Russians would pretty much roll over the Ukrainian ground forces. Once Russia is satisfied with the ground they have they’d dig in to repel any Ukrainian counterattacks. Calling in air strikes while using missiles to destroy any Ukrainian strong holds.

I’d expect to see something similar to Desert Storm and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. However the Russians don’t have adequate manpower or firepower for an all out invasion. The US and UK had amassed over twice what the Russians currently have to take out Iraq in 2003. Russia would need about 100k more men, plus a lot more air and ground assets to completely conquer Ukraine.

Followed by heavy units pushing to contact. Once a line would be found, quick heavy units would attempt to break the line to allow follow-on forces to get through the line and then surround.

Additionally there could be airborne assets dropping deep in Ukraine setting up command posts and begin fighting there to extend the forces out.   

Ukraine's play is to make it as bloody as possible and draw it out, reject the paratroopers and not allow a rush to break their line. Also rely on their population to continue resistance in territory once taken.

eed0dc09a9768b1cbd943b9e3001de03,suvioa,hxdts59,"Tim Sanders on Quora: ""There are indeed several airlines operating Polar Flight Routes where Great Circle Navigation provides a benefit (lower cost and shorter flight times).

However, airlines or private aircraft don’t simply decide to operate over Polar Routes on any given day, they must receive regulatory approval to do so.

Operation at high Latitudes (above 78 deg North or South of 60 deg South) are considered flight in areas of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU) and there are many issues that need to be addressed before receiving approval to do so.

Navigation - The flight must navigate using True Courses and not Magnetic Courses. At and near the pole the lines of longitude converge so rapidly that simply flying in a straight line involves constantly changing the heading. In addition near the magnetic north pole compasses are nearly useless due to “dip” in the needle amongst other things. The aircraft must have either INS or IRS (Inertial) Navigation capability as a basis for FMS Navigation to back up GPS.

Communications - VHF radios are largely useless, and HF Radios do not function very well either at high latitudes. Satellite Communications is better suited.

Training - The Flight Crews need specific training for Polar Operations covering Navigation Procedures, Communication, Abnormal Procedures and Emergencies, etc.

Maintenance and MEL - Policies and Procedures to support all the above must be part of the Maintenance Program.

These are just a few brief examples of many issues needing resolution before the FAA or any regulator will issue authority (Operations Specifications Paragraph B40 sub part to B50).

Even private jet operators are subject to prior approval. A letter of Authority for Polar operations needs to be received. Operators flying to or from the USA or Canada will be operating in the portion of airspace that is under Canada control and this area is known as “CMNPS” or Canadian Minimum Navigation Performance Airspace.

There are three kinds of guns:

1. Direct fire -- Machine guns, Sniper rifles, Tanks. You point your gun at the target and go ""bang"".

2. Mortar -- You point your gun somewhere between 45-degrees and 90-degrees into the air, and go ""bang"". The round then flies really high, clearing hills, trenches, and most terrain, and landing.

3. Artillery -- You point your gun near 45-degrees. Like Mortar, it goes over most targets, but not as much.  Your goal is __RANGE__, and 45-degree angles shoot the furthest.

-------------

""Shelling"" is artillery. The guns can be anything from 1-mile away to 40-miles away.

> Who's shooting and what are they shooting? Mortars?

Mortars are relatively close weapons. Since they shoot with such high-angles, Mortars fire in a range of less than 5-miles (and only heavy mortars at max range get that far in the first place...). You use Mortars to shoot people on the ""other side of a hill"" (you can't see them, so sniper-rifles won't work. The hill is blocking your attack). By shooting the gun really high up (70, or 80-degrees up), your round avoids the hill and lands where the enemy is.

While mortars have been around for hundreds of years, their modern use came in WW1 when they became an effective ""trench warfare"" weapon. By shooting the mortar high into the air, you can shoot from inside your trench (safe from enemy snipers or machine guns), and land the explosives inside the enemy's trench.

-----

There are reports of the ""really big"" artillery shells being used. IIRC, Russians use 152mm rounds for their ""big"" artillery. (In contrast, tank ammunition is 120mm).",1645168230.0,1645167088.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxextbb,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The same would happen. Russian will not fire on NATO troops. That's why their invasion-liberation kinda went to shit and they half retreated and covered their ass in fear when their moron in charge shot a civilian plane full of dutch (and others) people in ukraine by mistake.

Just a small request to folks on this sub. Ceasefire violations happen across the world wherever there is territorial dispute. This doesn't mean that two nations are ready for war.

I am from India and every 2-3 years we have similar situation with Pakistan when everyone is pumped up. Ceasefire violations are common. People in both nations don't want war and to some extent know that all this drama is for political mileage. Media in both the countries tries to create hype. 

We have been having similar issues with China also. There are constant encroachment attempts by China. As an Indian, I would obviously believe that China is evil but honestly I don't even trust my government also (whether they are telling me the truth).

So, guys just relax. There is always more to the story and don't fall for media telling you that war is imminent. US has been warning the world since Nov'21 but nothing has happened yet.

Such escalations get resolved. No one in sane mind wants war. Even Putin won't.

If war happens it's not because it's fun or helpful, it's because of the actions of the people who pull the levers of power.

Ukraine has been fighting with separatist groups for more than a decade and those groups have recently stepped up their aggression because they are bolstered by Russian aggression (and money and weapons).

These groups launched a larger than normal attack today and one of the targets was a kindergarten. It's unclear if the school was a target or a mistake. But it puts Ukraine in a bad position because Russia is claiming to recognize these separatist groups' claims to autonomy in the SouthEastern region of Ukraine, so a powerful strike back to them could be painted by Russia as an attack on their interests and a cause for war to enter Ukraine.

It's possible Ukraine can simply drive these forces out eventually. But Russia is constantly supporting them financially, and now seemingly has interest in using them as a pawn in a greater war between Russia and Ukraine",False,1645127488.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxcldub,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

CQ is a code used by wireless operators, particularly those communicating in Morse code, but also by voice operators, to make a general call. Transmitting the letters CQ on a particular radio frequency is an invitation for any operators listening on that frequency to respond. It is still widely used in amateur radio.

The rest is coded, and reddit will not be able to break Russia's code. It's likely they are transmitting codes that correspond to real world documents. 

It's almost like the message is saying something to the effect of ""Listen, listen. Open code book XXXXX. Read message XXXX. "" so without whatever real world document they are reading this from, we won't have.

 >An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles (missile defense). Ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological, or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term ""anti-ballistic missile"" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat; however, it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Like in these threads, for example, there's been the constant comparison of US alarm over this crisis to US' lies about WMDs in Iraq, despite the fact that the two situations are so completely different (in terms of verifiability, possible motivations, etc.) as to make the comparison absurd.  

The other big one, especially with respect to Russian disinformation, is projection.  Russia loves to muddy the waters by preemptively accusing their enemies of exactly that which they themselves are guilty.  Again, in this situation, that's been ""Biden is trying to distract from an increasingly poor domestic political situation"".  The idea behind doing this is just like the ""Firehose of Falsehoods"" - if you put casual observers in a place where they just see both sides accusing each other of the same thing, they're more likely to fall back on gut instincts, tribalistic biases, and emotional manipulation rather than actually trying to analyze the facts to determine which claims have more validity.",False,1645176431.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxf82ec,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

and Iraq had just invaded Kuwait a decade before hand and had used scud missiles on Israel and other neighboring countries. And they had just invaded Iran in the 80's. 

You're leaving out a SHIT load of context and painting it like U.S. invaded Sicily over because someone claimed they had nukes.

tl;dr - there were a lot of reasons to suspect they had wmds of some sort - it wasn't just made up about a peaceful country minding their own business. 

I could throw in the torture cells for Iraqi olympians and mass murder of kurds by Saddam and his sons but I assume you really don't want to chase objectivity here.

America was wrong in believing he still had them. You are correct about that.

IMO, a country cannot have 'lost' a war so long as they have nuclear weapons - for the exact reasons you listed. Inevitably, we will hear out treaties or demands to ensure that those nuclear weapons aren't used, even if we have the upper hand. It will potentially cripple a country, or there may be a change of guard by other governmental powers within those nations, but nuclear warfare is more of a positioning than anything else.

I know I can be wrong - and that nuclear warfare is possible - but I don't believe it will ever come to be on the scale that people are suggesting now that so many countries are armed with them.

Early maps drew the island west of Brittany and southwest of Ireland, but it later moved towards the Americas (Newfoundland, Bermuda, West Indies).

Yes, but im saying that prior to a standard invasion by the Russian Army, unmarked Russian Army can still go to Donbass and create untold escalation, pretending to be seperatists. They then can try to justify a full invasion based on the pretenses of renewed fighting.

In 2014 the russian army in much smaller numbers were stacking up on Ukraine Borders, similarly to right now, yet they still sent unmarked heavy weapons into Ukraine and then claimed they were seperatists. The real obvious one, was the [Battle of Debaltseve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Debaltseve) in 2015, this was almost completely run and fought for by Regular Russian Army, but according to Russia those were all farmers who raided weapons from UKR army.",False,1645130507.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxct926,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

At least in the US, getting licensed is pretty easy - it's a 35 question test, either in person or remote, and all the questions are from a bank of 400 or so, and they're all available online. Not sure if the UK is similar. someone over at /r/amateurradio would definitely be able to help you though. 

Other than that, just listening to shortwave is cool as well. I have a couple of RTLSDR's I picked up for like $20 a piece, that let me listen to anything from shortwave to CB to FM radio and everything in between (smart power meters, my key fob for my car, VUF/UHF radios). A small, battery powered shortwave is also around $20 as well.

But yeah, sorry for the huge pitch, but being able to talk thousands of miles with less wattage than a lightbulb uses is pretty cool imo :)

 >A numbers station is a shortwave radio station characterized by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which are believed to be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift keying and frequency-shift keying, as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, other stations appear to have no discernible pattern and broadcast at random times. Stations may or may not have set frequencies in the high frequency band.

And all of them tell me that older people (their parents) generally hate him. But you know what? Let's just look at a poll.  [Here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1201958/attitude-toward-activity-of-alexei-navalny-by-age-russia/) you can see that even under the age of 39 only one 1/4 to 1/5 of people know and support Navalny. Above 40 it's only about 10%. In summary he's just not very relevant/liked. He's by many not seen as a serious politician, but an ""internet activist"" or somehow who ""only knows provocation"" (both quotes I've heard personally). 

To your second point: all NATO countries have signaled or even directly stated that they won't send soldiers into Ukraine. The fact that they don't even pretend they would do it to scare off Russia, should already tell you everything about potential support. 

True, Ukraine being occupied by Russia would be catastrophic to NATO, but how would skipping right to a war with Russia be any better than a mere increased threat of war with Russia? I don't get that logic. 

Your last point isn't wrong and it doesn't contradict my argument. In opposite. They're closely related. Putin wants to reestablish Russia's former glory precisely to signal that it can and will intervene if its puppets get threatened. It's all about the Russian sphere of influence. There might also be internal considerations. No, Russians generally don't feel surpressed. They in large support Putin. Independent polls confirm that. He is somewhat worried though that this support might decrease if the inflation and devaluation of the Rubel continues. If you ask any Russian what currently really bothers them, they will say inflation.

 >Battle of Debaltseve was a military confrontation in the city of Debaltseve, Donetsk Oblast, between the pro-Russian separatist forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, starting in mid-January 2015 during the war in the Donbass region. The DPR forces recaptured Debaltseve, which had been under Ukrainian control since a counter-offensive by government forces in July 2014. The city lay in a ""wedge"" of Ukrainian-held territory bordered by the DPR on one side, and the LPR on the other, and is a vital road and railway junction.

The fact of millions of people divided into ""Russia"" and ""Ukraine"", while stemming from ~1000 years of regional history, is just a line drawn in the sand and has substance only in people's cultural recognition of those concepts.

re: MsEscapist - this is not a ""fundamental difference"".  Imagine Russia annexed Ukraine, and over 100, 200 years assumed a ""Russian identity"".  Some of the separatists there already *take* that interpretation.

Nevermind that both countries are autocracies right now - I'm not sure if you've been following Ukrainian politics for the last few years, but it's not exactly ""the world's winner in the democracy contest"".  *Some people anywhere take the realistic interpretation that any government is an occupying force, which is inevitable when you are told as a population that you must be subject to someone's will besides your own.*  Attempts to military expand influence like these are what really show this truth, as we all recoil in watching the violence underlying that establishment of control - before that control is normalized.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Statement_of_the_Leaders_of_the_Five_Nuclear-Weapon_States_on_Preventing_Nuclear_War_and_Avoiding_Arms_Races#:~:text=The%20joint%20statement%20is%20about,the%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council.

This statement was made last month and essentially the five countries you probably imagine when you imagine a nuclear war came together and said that a nuclear war can never be won and that any path that could lead to one must be avoided. They also state that they aim to work with each other and others on the national stage to progress to a world with no nuclear weapons on it.

I'm not saying that this statement is a blood promise that can't be broken, but Russia made this statement most likely WELL after they had made these plans for Ukraine and that has to count for something. They signed a statement saying that nuclear war must be avoided and that a non nuclear planet is better for everyone, knowing that they'd be doing this. I think it's fairly obvious that no western nation wants or would consider nuclear war for any means other than MAD. So we can reasonably assume that for both sides, nuclear war is something that they wouldn't even consider. It's further than their last option. Sure they might make ambiguous statements that might make it seem like they're okay with the prospect of making a war nuclear, but they aren't. Nobody is.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Island_incident

Go ahead and look at this. It goes into detail in the article, but essentially a US and Chinese aircraft collided in air and killed the Chinese pilot. The US aircraft was forced to land in Chinese territory and they were taken into custody.

Click on the link and open the section titled ""on the ground""

Read that entire first paragraph.

Two of the biggest nuclear powers in the world had military aircraft collide, resulting in the death of one. Yet look how they were treated. They were given what could almost be considered gifts and shown as much hospitality as their procedure allowed.

These nations like to act like wild dogs constantly pulling on their leash and snapping their jaws, but when something actually happens it's kindness and diplomacy.

That's essentially what Russia is doing now or any time you see something saying they're ready to go nuclear to defend their sovereignty. They want you to see that. They want their statements about not being scared to go nuclear to spread so that nobody tests them and find out that they're most likely bluffing.

1) He does not want to directly border NATO or EU countries, he wants a buffer zone of vassals between them.  

2) Tons of gas supplied by Russia travels through Ukraine into Europe and he might want more positive control over that process, especially because the regular population might shut it down. 

3)  All of Russia's military aircraft engines are made in Ukraine, and since 2008 Russia has tried to produce them internally, but that finally was declared failed in 2018. He might want to control, or at least deny use to the enemy of the industrial aircraft production that supplies pretty much all of the civil and military engines and parts across the whole former soviet-bloc industry. 

4) Russia is constantly thirsty for warm water ports, and while Crimea technically is one, it does not have all of the capabilities that Odessa would. 

5) Russia, despite being in the 21st century, is still an actual unironic imperialist country, and they've been taking land through force or implied force since the mid 90s. Like, they literally send goons into Georgia in the middle of the night to physically move the border twenty feet, and over years they've taken miles of land this way. 

6) Putin is relatively instable internally, with enough people shaken by recent exposures of his private life and what he's doing to Navalny, so a great patriotic war to defend Russians would help his polls. 

7) He wants to break apart NATO/the EU by forcing a situation where some of them might want to take military action, and some of them definitely would not, creating a conflict in the EU and NATO charters.",False,1645161082.0,t3_suvioa,t1_hxer6om,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
