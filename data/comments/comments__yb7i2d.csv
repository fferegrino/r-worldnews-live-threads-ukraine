Day 242 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was an exceptionally quiet day. It’s so quiet that it just feels weird, as if Russians are planning something. There were no missile strikes *anywhere* in Ukraine the entire day, as for Kharkiv we had no air raid alerts in the past 26 hours, which is basically unheard of here. We get air raid alerts constantly even when nothing is happening, but right now we haven’t had even a single one of them in over a day.

Just to put this into perspective, Kharkiv is #1 when it comes to the number of air raid alerts. We had approximately 1303 air raid alerts (second place being Donetsk oblast with 1061 alerts) in 242 days of this war, so about 5.4 alerts per day. And now we have a day where we had 0 air raid alerts, which somehow just doesn’t feel right, even if that is supposed to be a good thing in theory. 

Usually when nothing is happening, like no missile strikes in a couple of days, they do a big one right after, so that’s something that could happen in the morning. They are even losing ground around Bakhmut now, which is supposed to be the one place where they had any kind of “success”. And then there’s another one of their jets falling on residential buildings in Russia today, seems like that is becoming the norm for them now. It’s such a strange day all around that I don’t even know what to think.",False,1666571653.0,t3_yb7i2d,t3_yb7i2d,,0,167,0,167,1,0,

Russia is *losing* and all of these strikes are proof of that.

Russia strikes schools and theaters and hospitals ***because they literally can't identify and strike valuable military targets*** which would help them on the battlefield.

Putin's missiles aren't hitting Ukraine's air defense, bases, ammo/fuel depots, or command and control.

Putin's missiles can't even stop the flow of support from the West to Ukraine.

***RUSSIA STILL DOESN'T HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY*** over Ukraine!!!

Putin's missiles aren't used to turn the tide of *actual battle* in Kharkiv or Kherson.

*Putin's war goals are political* and he seeks to influence politics by instilling terror and sowing chaos and division among Ukraine and its allies.

He wants the world to go back to the WWI era when Russia could play countries off one another and the West would never be united enough for sanctions or to challenge his power.

Ukraine will win this war.

Ukraine has chosen to look to the future, to look away from authoritarianism and regressivism and look to democracy and the world community of the West.

Ukraine will join NATO.

Ukraine will join the EU.

>Russian sources reported that private businesses are offering to train mobilized men on privately owned military and medical equipment in exchange for money.

More from the report:

>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the NATO alliance in scare-mongering calls with several NATO defense ministers on October 23. Shoigu separately called his counterparts from France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States on October 23, claiming that Ukraine is preparing to conduct a false-flag attack using a dirty bomb (a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material that is not a nuclear weapon) to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction.[1] Russian state media amplified this false and ridiculous claim.[2] Russian Ministry of Defense reports on the calls contain slight differences; they state that Shoigu discussed a claimed “steady tendency towards further, uncontrolled escalation” in Ukraine in the call with his French counterpart; discussed the “situation in Ukraine” and made false claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb in his calls with the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey; and simply discussed the situation in Ukraine without reference to a dirty bomb in his conversation with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Shoigu last spoke with Secretary Austin on October 21. Representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, and Ukraine categorically denied and condemned Shoigu’s false allegations, and US Secretary Austin called his UK counterpart, Ben Wallace, following the calls with Shoigu.[3] France and Turkey have not issued formal statements as of this writing.

Also:

>Shoigu’s claims likely do not portend Russian preparations to use non-strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine either. . . . Such a decision would be inherently personal, but Putin’s stated red lines for nuclear weapon use have already been crossed in this war several times over without any Russian nuclear escalation.”[6]  Russia does not “need,” under formal Russian nuclear doctrine, a further event to justify nuclear weapons use.[7] Ukraine is not apparently on the verge of tripping some new Russian redline, on the other hand, that might cause Putin to use non-strategic nuclear weapons against it at this time. Shoigu’s comments are thus unlikely to presage a nuclear terror attack against one or more major Ukrainian population centers or critical infrastructure . . .

Also:

>Shoigu’s calls—and Russian state media’s amplification of false dirty bomb threats—are therefore likely intended to intimidate Western states into cutting or limiting support for Ukraine as Russia faces continued military setbacks and the likely loss of western Kherson by the end of the year. ISW has assessed since May that Putin seeks to force Ukraine to accept his terms and deter continued Western support for Ukraine through nuclear brinksmanship.",False,1666565539.0,t3_yb7i2d,t3_yb7i2d,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

Original post:

Вечернее обращение Владимира Зеленского:  
Коли сьогодні російський міністр оборони влаштовує телефонну карусель і обдзвонює іноземних міністрів із розповідями про так звану брудну ядерну бомбу, усі все добре розуміють. Розуміють, хто є джерелом усього брудного, що тільки можна уявити в цій війні.  
Усюди, куди Росія принесла смерть і деградацію, ми повертаємо нормальне життя. Саме це – про українців. Там, де Україна, – ніколи не знищується життя.  
А ось там, куди приходить Росія, вона всюди залишає по собі масові могили, катівні, зруйновані міста й села, заміновану землю, знищену інфраструктуру і природні катастрофи. І якщо хтось і може застосувати ядерну зброю у нашій частині Європи, то це лише один субʼєкт – і цей субʼєкт як раз і наказав товаришу Шойгу кудись там телефонувати.  
Вважаю, що зараз світ повинен максимально жорстко відреагувати. Якщо Росія підготувала чергове підняття ставок і черговий ескалаційний крок – вона вже зараз, превентивно і до будь-якого нового свого «бруду», має побачити, що світ це не проковтне.

>
>Thoughts from a bunch of stubborn Ukrainians after eight months of the invasion.
>
>A thread.
>
>1. Ukraine will never surrender.
This is an existential war for Ukrainians. If we stop fighting, our homes will be turned into rubble, our children will be taken away, and our people will face mass terror.
>
>With or without military or political support from the democratic world,
>
>Ukraine will keep on resisting – because we are fighting for our right to exist.
>
>For us, the reality of perpetual military resistance is more acceptable than the reality of the Russian occupation.
>
>2. None of us is okay – even if we say we are.
Every day people across Ukraine keep dying from Russian shelling. Every week new stories of horror of Russia’s genocidal campaign emerge. Each week brings a new little catastrophe – and every week
>
>a little part of us quietly dies inside. This has become the new norm Ukrainians are learning to navigate.
>
>But we keep holding on. In a way, trying to be okay as Ukrainians is the final act of resistance against Russia’s attempt to wipe out everything that is Ukraine.
>
>3. Ukraine is fighting against #RussianColonialism , not just Putin.
>
>Putin may have pulled the trigger, but the root of the invasion lies deeper than the current regime in Russia. For centuries, Russia has led colonial conquests from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Far East.
>
>It conquered and assimilated multiple indigenous peoples – and exterminated those who resisted.
>
>The war might be paused when Putin’s regime implodes, but Ukrainians know all too well that a lasting peace is only possible with a decolonized and disarmed Russia.
>
>4. Russian-speaking Ukrainians are not “more Russian.”
>
>Yes, most Ukrainians are bilingual. Yes, 26% of Ukrainians are Russian-first speakers and 27% speak an equal amount of Russian and Ukrainian in their daily lives. But do you know why? Since the 19th century,
>
>Ukrainians were deliberately banned from using their language in education, labor, and public spheres of life. As a result, millions of Ukrainians switched to Russian and deliberately hid their Ukrainian traces. And Ukraine learned to exist successfully as a nation of bilinguals.
>
>So, if you meet Ukrainians who speak Russian in their daily lives, do not assume they are “more Russian” than any other Ukrainian or that they support Russia in any way. They probably have a more interesting story to tell about language and identity – just ask them.
>
>5. Ukraine never had a Nazi problem.
>
>Not only Nazis in Ukraine had nothing to do with Russia’s invasion, but the entire notion of Ukraine being run by the far-right is and always has been ridiculous.
>
>The story of a “dangerous Nazi regime in Kyiv” has always been nothing more than a Russian propaganda myth. 
>
>Ukraine’s far-right movements have always been marginal and never had more than 5% of public support combined. Unlike some European states that do have a problem with far-right populism, Ukraine never really had a Nazi problem.
>
>6. Ukraine is a democracy. Zelensky acts as our representative.
>
>Ukraine is not perfect. But Ukrainians always fought back whenever authoritarianism loomed over: they protested in 2004 after a rigged election, and overthrew a corrupt wannabe dictator in 2014. 
>
>Not many people understand that Zelensky – who received 73% of the public’s vote in 2019 – always acts on our behalf. Following the full-scale invasion, Zelensky’s actions were supported by 91% of Ukrainians.
>
>Notions of Zelensky forcing anything onto Ukrainians are out of touch with reality.
>
>7. We will not shut up. Not anymore.
>
>For too long, the Ukrainian perspectives were silenced by Russia and pro-Russian sentiments around the globe. Like many other nations colonized by Russia, Ukraine had to shut up and, at best, politely debate whatever Russians had to say.
>
>Ukrainians were denied agency: their choices were explained through conspiracies about the “US and NATO aggressive expansion.”
>
>All of this must remain in the past. As the genocide continues, we will remain unapologetically Ukrainian – and make sure our voices are loud and clear.
>
>8. Yes, we think all Russians are responsible for the war.
>
>Ukrainians do not blame just Putin or the elites for the war – we blame the entire Russian nation. Putin and his cronies do not personally launch missiles at residential buildings. They don’t torture civilians living under occupation. They don’t take away Ukrainian children. They don’t attack Ukrainians abroad or online. Ordinary Russians do all those things.
>
>They failed as a society, and now millions of Ukrainians are suffering from genocide because of this ongoing collective failure.
>
>9. Ukrainians are afraid of what comes next. But we won’t surrender to our fears.
>
>The only country that tries to occupy a sovereign state all while blackmailing the rest of the world with nuclear catastrophe is Russia. Like it or not, the genie is out of the box – Russia is already a fascist dictatorship on nukes that invades its neighbors. It is already a threat to global security – and this has nothing to do with the way Ukraine resists.
>
>Ukrainians are afraid every night as we go to sleep and every morning while reading news of more death.
>
>But if we let our fears consume us, Russia will most likely win, and its illegal invasion, genocide, and nuclear blackmail will be rewarded. This is exactly what leads to another world war.

She seemed like a down to earth person and open minded. But she was sure there was not going to be an invasion and talked about all the “warmongering”, people playing up the tensions. Of course that didn’t make sense… those were just warnings of what might happen, and it did happen. The US leadership did a great job anticipating and warning etc. and it wasn’t warmongering, that’s not what warmongering is. 

Well, to her credit, after the invasion she was humbled and serious and said she was totally wrong. Since then she has been posting things just about everyday life there, including answering questions people had about all the businesses leaving and whether there were shortages. She has been in the vicinity of some protests, showing all the paddy wagon buses being filled with protestors, but didn’t actually overtly protest herself I think. She has a cousin in Ukraine that she has been really concerned about.

I listened to every word that Vladimir Putin spoke when he announced the full-scale invasion. I heard him say that Ukraine wasn’t a real country, that Ukrainians weren’t a real people, and that it was his intention to end Ukraine as a country and Ukrainians as a people. He said everything except the actual word ‘genocide’ in describing his intention to carry out a genocide.



I know the enemy. I know what gets said in Russian media. I know what the Russian people are being told. They’ve been saying it every day since day-1.



I see zero benefit to giving their message any air time whatsoever, not anywhere, and especially not in these threads. Linking, quoting, or disseminating the hate message of the day benefits the people who wish to spread that hatred.



And yet, Russian propaganda gets disseminated in these threads at a steady clip under the guise of “knowing the enemy”, or “understanding what Russian people are having to live with”. 


I find it all very reminiscent of the “valuable discussion” argument that used to go on here in Reddit when the openly racist sub used to dominate the front page. Yes, it is an argument.

The Russians probably collectively knew the war was lost as early as last March once the attack in Kyiv was defeated in ignominious retreat.  In fact there was a brief window on official Russian television where it was acknowledged that even if Russia somehow won, it would take generations to force the Ukrainians to bend the knee.

The past 6 months have sadly been an exercise of Russia going through the motions so that after the war comes to some conclusion, they can say leadership tried all options.  

The collapse of the Russian forces west of the Dnipro seems imminent, and there is no way to retrieve any of the heavy equipment.  They may lose what is left of their better soldiers.  The attempted partial mobilization has shown there is nothing that is going to save the Russian military in the foreseeable future.

I won't lie I've been audiobooking this one as I paint the outside of my house purple.  

But anyway a lot of this book centers around the use of War mythology/stories/novels/movies/books/etc. Where they came from, truth vs mythos, authors influenced by them, How those authors have impacted Russia. 

So he teaches us this by digging into different Russian wars. 

I like when he digs into the invasion of Napoleon. In 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia causing on of the deadliest milarary operations. He uses this War to illustrate ideas of Russian exceptionalism, the mythos of the Russian warrior, Tolstoy, and the idea that suffering = national greatness. National greatness being more important and necessary than personal success. 

I'm going to quote the Witcher right now. ""Sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die."" 

That seems to be the essence of one the the themes that pops up. 

The idea just that it can be honor in the their sacrifice. But that their sacrifice is a necessary part of their inheritance. 

I'm definitely going to have to read this again after doing some research. So before reading this have better understanding of Napoleon than my almost nothingness and an understanding of basic Russian history. It'd a good one but not an intro one.

You could hear the boom, crump, crump, crump, of heavy bombs at their work of tearing buildings apart. They were not too far away.  
  
Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of a third of the entire circle of London.

[‘We Heard It, We Saw It, Then We Opened Fire’](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones-iran.html)

>After a drone swarm attack on Kyiv on Monday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed to Israel for air defense weapons. The plea was rebuffed by Israel’s minister of defense, Benny Gantz, largely because Israel depends on Russian cooperation for the Israeli Air Force to conduct raids in Syria. Israel, he said, would provide early warning systems, but not air defense weapons.

>Mr. Sak, the adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said Israel could be missing an opportunity to hone its tactics in facing down threats in its own territory by assisting in the counter-drone efforts now underway in Ukraine.

>“These Iranian drones that are hitting Ukrainian cities were not developed, not meant for Ukraine,” Mr. Sak said. “They were developed as a mass capability to strike Israel. They are using Ukraine as a testing ground, to see weaknesses, to perfect them, and sooner or later they will use them against Israel.”

>A Ukrainian official, speaking off the record, has said Israel has provided intelligence useful for targeting the Iranian drones.

Why?  Because the *purpose* of the UN is to act as a forum for diplomacy amongst nations *especially* when they disagree over security matters; and Russia (due to its weapons stockpile if nothing else) has a significant role to play on that front.

Second, some ""big picture"": what happens if this drive to remove Russia from the Security Council and/or UN succeeds?  It would almost certainly result in Security Council authorisation of force to secure Ukraine against Russia's aggression.  That sounds like a good thing, right?  But to be clear, such resolution can pretty much only be enacted by a NATO-led coalition: so it would result in kinetic engagement between NATO forces and Russian forces.  Is *that* a good thing?  No doubt Russia would lose that conflict provided it remains conventional, but what if it becomes unconventional?

Third, some detail: suppose we do in fact renege on the status quo to now declare Russia's position in the UN without basis, not because of their behaviour in Ukraine but because of a technicality everyone has ignored for decades.

The fact that McConnell (Senate Maj Ldr) publicly broke with McCarthy about that the very next day suggests a lack of unity among Republicans on Ukraine. Democratic support for Ukraine is pretty much unanimous. Assuming Republicans flip the House but not the Senate, I think you'd see a lot of pressure on McCarthy to make concessions on that position. The Speaker can whip all they want but if he doesn't have the votes, he doesn't have the votes.

The neoconservatives (Bush Sr/Bush Jr/McCain etc) are still a significant wing of the Republican party, and McConnell aligns with them rather than the alt-right Trump faction. The Republican House caucus has a greater percentage of alt-righters than neocons, but the latter are still significant. Probably more than enough for an outright majority combined with the Democrats on Ukraine.

It’s also the case that it’s the only city that I’ve repeatedly posted about the long-standing, fervent pro-Russia support...as relayed by the pro-Ukraine residents (I’ve translated and posted from an Azovstal engineer, from an ilych engineer, from a school principal, from several “defenders.”)  And the pro-U sentiments *remaining* in the city are said to be below 5%.

The main factors is that they had primarily Russian television (not just Russian-language).  So... what Fox did to half of America. How you can’t convince them of reality.  It’s that. 

Ironically, going across the southern edge—to berdyansk, Melitopol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odessa—they all were speaking Russian last year.  But see, they didn’t have *exclusively* a Russian cable/satellite television hookup.  So the percentage of the zombified, pro-Russian was much smaller.

Further, Mariupol really developed quickly.  Twenty years ago, it was completely different, and much smaller.  A lot of the transplants were Russians themselves.  

These other regions didn’t have that.  In fact, Melitopol/Zaporizhye has always had that Cossack culture, a sort of hord of rebels.  Donbas—not so much. Kherson and Mykolaiv were shipbuilding cities thru soviet days.  Odessa has always been a beloved, prized city.  A jewel.  Full of culture and beauty.  Like a Venice or Vienna.

The detonation as way more powerful than anticipated, and the weather didn't go as-forecast, so a lot of fallout landed on the Rongelap and Rongerik islands. Virtually all of the inhabitants experienced severe radiation sickness, and were evacuated.  Three years later, the evacuated residents returned, but still developed acute radiation sickness. 

In 1972; residents again tried to move back to their home islands; (about 100), and still experienced radiation symptoms including sillbirths, miscarriages, and genetic abnormalities in their children. One 11 year old boy (born in 1971) died from cancer linked to radiation exposure.

In 1998, the IAEA report found that Bikini should not be permanently resettled because of dangerous levels of radiation in locally produced food (though background radiation was now near-normal levels).   However; Gamma radiation levels in 2016 are still 184 mrem/yr, well above the maximum allowed for human habitation. Residents of nearby islands have an elevated risk of thyroid cancer and leukemia.  Over 60 years later.

And Castle Bravo was not an intentionally dirty-bomb.  The real thing could be much worse; though if it's not paired with an actual thermonuclear device, it would only cover a very limited area, and cleanup would be relatively less complicated.

The idea that Ukraine would do this, to effectively permanently contaminate a wide swath of some of the richest farmland on the entire planet, is really so mind-bogglingly stupid, it's beyond belief that Russians would think they could convince anyone that it's a fact, that Ukraine is planning to do this.",1666552797.0,1666552462.0,t3_yb7i2d,t1_itgv8b1,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

One is that a successful comeback would breed hope in others, and right now, Trump is looking for anything that could give him hope (that he too would have successful comeback).

If Johnson were selected despite criminal? investigations about to gear up, Trump would see that as a sign that criminal investigations don’t matter. 

The whole situation is getting a lot of press coverage in USA, and word is that Trump is missing that attention, big time.

> [Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday said that Marxism is full of vitality in 21st century China and called for developing the doctrine to make it shine brighter.

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in a congratulatory letter to the World Symposium for Marxist Political Parties.

Xi noted that Marxism is a scientific theory that artfully reveals the patterns underlying the development of human society, points out the path for humans searching for their emancipation and advances the process of human civilization.

""It is the formidable theoretical tool which we use to understand the world and effect change,"" he added.](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-05-27/Xi-Jinping-Marxism-is-full-of-vitality-in-21st-century-China-10BYt1amE1i/index.html)",1666557348.0,1666533382.0,t3_yb7i2d,t1_itggm7q,,3,-9,0,-9,0,0,

Flat out, no way in hell the government would authorize the release of sensitive data that could (and reportedly did) get people killed. The government waste fraud and abuse system would have escalated the problem high and wide enough until those with the power of enforcement would act against the illegal monitoring activities. FBI would probably have gotten involved.

Naturally, this would have taken a bit. Given the classified nature of the documents, individuals would be granted need to know status as the investigation continued. This would fall under law enforcement, and they flat out do not care about other organizations. Obstructing or threatening them would be bad for whoever tried it. Long term, the illegal monitoring would have been systematically brought into legal guidelines. Probably. 

I stated in another post that I won't try to predict exactly what would have happened, but this would have. But the government is slow sometimes. That probably would have happened here.

Now, what would have happened to Snowden himself: fuck and all. He brought up a problem and presented it correctly if he did the above. Hell, he could have done it anonymously as well. There are protections for these actions. They can't even block him for promotion. there might be some inner department friction, but legally, that isn't allowed either.

But that doesn't change the FACT that Americans DO NOT choose who goes on that final ballot, the national committee of each party does.

Because of this being the case, and how people are generally emboldened to see like minded people in power, a conservative getting elected anywhere DOES impact the electability of conservatives across the world. 

I can spell it out further but this is how Boris and Donald are interconnected and related, BOTH individuals AND their parties are emboldened when similar people and parties are elected elsewhere, it makes electing more of that ilk more likely.
