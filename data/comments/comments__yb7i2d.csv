Day 242 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was an exceptionally quiet day. It‚Äôs so quiet that it just feels weird, as if Russians are planning something. There were no missile strikes *anywhere* in Ukraine the entire day, as for Kharkiv we had no air raid alerts in the past 26 hours, which is basically unheard of here. We get air raid alerts constantly even when nothing is happening, but right now we haven‚Äôt had even a single one of them in over a day.

Just to put this into perspective, Kharkiv is #1 when it comes to the number of air raid alerts. We had approximately 1303 air raid alerts (second place being Donetsk oblast with 1061 alerts) in 242 days of this war, so about 5.4 alerts per day. And now we have a day where we had 0 air raid alerts, which somehow just doesn‚Äôt feel right, even if that is supposed to be a good thing in theory. 

Usually when nothing is happening, like no missile strikes in a couple of days, they do a big one right after, so that‚Äôs something that could happen in the morning. They are even losing ground around Bakhmut now, which is supposed to be the one place where they had any kind of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. And then there‚Äôs another one of their jets falling on residential buildings in Russia today, seems like that is becoming the norm for them now. It‚Äôs such a strange day all around that I don‚Äôt even know what to think.",False,1666571653.0,t3_yb7i2d,t3_yb7i2d,,0,167,0,167,1,0,

Russia is *losing* and all of these strikes are proof of that.

Russia strikes schools and theaters and hospitals ***because they literally can't identify and strike valuable military targets*** which would help them on the battlefield.

Putin's missiles aren't hitting Ukraine's air defense, bases, ammo/fuel depots, or command and control.

Putin's missiles can't even stop the flow of support from the West to Ukraine.

***RUSSIA STILL DOESN'T HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY*** over Ukraine!!!

Putin's missiles aren't used to turn the tide of *actual battle* in Kharkiv or Kherson.

*Putin's war goals are political* and he seeks to influence politics by instilling terror and sowing chaos and division among Ukraine and its allies.

He wants the world to go back to the WWI era when Russia could play countries off one another and the West would never be united enough for sanctions or to challenge his power.

Ukraine will win this war.

Ukraine has chosen to look to the future, to look away from authoritarianism and regressivism and look to democracy and the world community of the West.

Ukraine will join NATO.

Ukraine will join the EU.

Ukraine will be *forever* free.

>Russian sources reported that private businesses are offering to train mobilized men on privately owned military and medical equipment in exchange for money.

More from the report:

>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the NATO alliance in scare-mongering calls with several NATO defense ministers on October 23. Shoigu separately called his counterparts from France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States on October 23, claiming that Ukraine is preparing to conduct a false-flag attack using a dirty bomb (a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material that is not a nuclear weapon) to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction.[1] Russian state media amplified this false and ridiculous claim.[2] Russian Ministry of Defense reports on the calls contain slight differences; they state that Shoigu discussed a claimed ‚Äústeady tendency towards further, uncontrolled escalation‚Äù in Ukraine in the call with his French counterpart; discussed the ‚Äúsituation in Ukraine‚Äù and made false claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb in his calls with the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey; and simply discussed the situation in Ukraine without reference to a dirty bomb in his conversation with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Shoigu last spoke with Secretary Austin on October 21. Representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, and Ukraine categorically denied and condemned Shoigu‚Äôs false allegations, and US Secretary Austin called his UK counterpart, Ben Wallace, following the calls with Shoigu.[3] France and Turkey have not issued formal statements as of this writing.

Also:

>Shoigu‚Äôs claims likely do not portend Russian preparations to use non-strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine either. . . . Such a decision would be inherently personal, but Putin‚Äôs stated red lines for nuclear weapon use have already been crossed in this war several times over without any Russian nuclear escalation.‚Äù[6]  Russia does not ‚Äúneed,‚Äù under formal Russian nuclear doctrine, a further event to justify nuclear weapons use.[7] Ukraine is not apparently on the verge of tripping some new Russian redline, on the other hand, that might cause Putin to use non-strategic nuclear weapons against it at this time. Shoigu‚Äôs comments are thus unlikely to presage a nuclear terror attack against one or more major Ukrainian population centers or critical infrastructure . . .

Also:

>Shoigu‚Äôs calls‚Äîand Russian state media‚Äôs amplification of false dirty bomb threats‚Äîare therefore likely intended to intimidate Western states into cutting or limiting support for Ukraine as Russia faces continued military setbacks and the likely loss of western Kherson by the end of the year.

>Thoughts from a bunch of stubborn Ukrainians after eight months of the invasion.
>
>A thread.
>
>1. Ukraine will never surrender.
This is an existential war for Ukrainians. If we stop fighting, our homes will be turned into rubble, our children will be taken away, and our people will face mass terror.
>
>With or without military or political support from the democratic world,
>
>Ukraine will keep on resisting ‚Äì because we are fighting for our right to exist.
>
>For us, the reality of perpetual military resistance is more acceptable than the reality of the Russian occupation.
>
>2. None of us is okay ‚Äì even if we say we are.
Every day people across Ukraine keep dying from Russian shelling. Every week new stories of horror of Russia‚Äôs genocidal campaign emerge. Each week brings a new little catastrophe ‚Äì and every week
>
>a little part of us quietly dies inside. This has become the new norm Ukrainians are learning to navigate.
>
>But we keep holding on. In a way, trying to be okay as Ukrainians is the final act of resistance against Russia‚Äôs attempt to wipe out everything that is Ukraine.
>
>3. Ukraine is fighting against #RussianColonialism , not just Putin.
>
>Putin may have pulled the trigger, but the root of the invasion lies deeper than the current regime in Russia. For centuries, Russia has led colonial conquests from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Far East.
>
>It conquered and assimilated multiple indigenous peoples ‚Äì and exterminated those who resisted.
>
>The war might be paused when Putin‚Äôs regime implodes, but Ukrainians know all too well that a lasting peace is only possible with a decolonized and disarmed Russia.
>
>4. Russian-speaking Ukrainians are not ‚Äúmore Russian.‚Äù
>
>Yes, most Ukrainians are bilingual. Yes, 26% of Ukrainians are Russian-first speakers and 27% speak an equal amount of Russian and Ukrainian in their daily lives. But do you know why? Since the 19th century,
>
>Ukrainians were deliberately banned from using their language in education, labor, and public spheres of life. As a result, millions of Ukrainians switched to Russian and deliberately hid their Ukrainian traces. And Ukraine learned to exist successfully as a nation of bilinguals.
>
>So, if you meet Ukrainians who speak Russian in their daily lives, do not assume they are ‚Äúmore Russian‚Äù than any other Ukrainian or that they support Russia in any way. They probably have a more interesting story to tell about language and identity ‚Äì just ask them.
>
>5. Ukraine never had a Nazi problem.
>
>Not only Nazis in Ukraine had nothing to do with Russia‚Äôs invasion, but the entire notion of Ukraine being run by the far-right is and always has been ridiculous.
>
>The story of a ‚Äúdangerous Nazi regime in Kyiv‚Äù has always been nothing more than a Russian propaganda myth. 
>
>Ukraine‚Äôs far-right movements have always been marginal and never had more than 5% of public support combined. Unlike some European states that do have a problem with far-right populism, Ukraine never really had a Nazi problem.
>
>6. Ukraine is a democracy. Zelensky acts as our representative.
>
>Ukraine is not perfect. But Ukrainians always fought back whenever authoritarianism loomed over: they protested in 2004 after a rigged election, and overthrew a corrupt wannabe dictator in 2014. 
>
>Not many people understand that Zelensky ‚Äì who received 73% of the public‚Äôs vote in 2019 ‚Äì always acts on our behalf. Following the full-scale invasion, Zelensky‚Äôs actions were supported by 91% of Ukrainians.
>
>Notions of Zelensky forcing anything onto Ukrainians are out of touch with reality.
>
>7. We will not shut up. Not anymore.
>
>For too long, the Ukrainian perspectives were silenced by Russia and pro-Russian sentiments around the globe. Like many other nations colonized by Russia, Ukraine had to shut up and, at best, politely debate whatever Russians had to say.
>
>Ukrainians were denied agency: their choices were explained through conspiracies about the ‚ÄúUS and NATO aggressive expansion.‚Äù
>
>All of this must remain in the past. As the genocide continues, we will remain unapologetically Ukrainian ‚Äì and make sure our voices are loud and clear.
>
>8. Yes, we think all Russians are responsible for the war.
>
>Ukrainians do not blame just Putin or the elites for the war ‚Äì we blame the entire Russian nation. Putin and his cronies do not personally launch missiles at residential buildings. They don‚Äôt torture civilians living under occupation. They don‚Äôt take away Ukrainian children. They don‚Äôt attack Ukrainians abroad or online. Ordinary Russians do all those things.
>
>They failed as a society, and now millions of Ukrainians are suffering from genocide because of this ongoing collective failure.
>
>9. Ukrainians are afraid of what comes next. But we won‚Äôt surrender to our fears.
>
>The only country that tries to occupy a sovereign state all while blackmailing the rest of the world with nuclear catastrophe is Russia. Like it or not, the genie is out of the box ‚Äì Russia is already a fascist dictatorship on nukes that invades its neighbors. It is already a threat to global security ‚Äì and this has nothing to do with the way Ukraine resists.
>
>Ukrainians are afraid every night as we go to sleep and every morning while reading news of more death.
>
>But if we let our fears consume us, Russia will most likely win, and its illegal invasion, genocide, and nuclear blackmail will be rewarded. This is exactly what leads to another world war.

The Russians probably collectively knew the war was lost as early as last March once the attack in Kyiv was defeated in ignominious retreat.  In fact there was a brief window on official Russian television where it was acknowledged that even if Russia somehow won, it would take generations to force the Ukrainians to bend the knee.

The past 6 months have sadly been an exercise of Russia going through the motions so that after the war comes to some conclusion, they can say leadership tried all options.  

The collapse of the Russian forces west of the Dnipro seems imminent, and there is no way to retrieve any of the heavy equipment.  They may lose what is left of their better soldiers.

I won't lie I've been audiobooking this one as I paint the outside of my house purple.  

But anyway a lot of this book centers around the use of War mythology/stories/novels/movies/books/etc. Where they came from, truth vs mythos, authors influenced by them, How those authors have impacted Russia. 

So he teaches us this by digging into different Russian wars. 

I like when he digs into the invasion of Napoleon. In 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia causing on of the deadliest milarary operations. He uses this War to illustrate ideas of Russian exceptionalism, the mythos of the Russian warrior, Tolstoy, and the idea that suffering = national greatness. National greatness being more important and necessary than personal success. 

I'm going to quote the Witcher right now. ""Sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die."" 

That seems to be the essence of one the the themes that pops up. 

The idea just that it can be honor in the their sacrifice. But that their sacrifice is a necessary part of their inheritance. 

I'm definitely going to have to read this again after doing some research. So before reading this have better understanding of Napoleon than my almost nothingness and an understanding of basic Russian history. It'd a good one but not an intro one.

Please continue updating us, it gives a great sense of what Ukrainians are going through and someday you may want to expand it into a book. Something like ""*With Saberflux in Kharkiv during the War*."" There are many accounts of the blitz in London - 

>It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire. They came just after dark, and somehow you could sense from the quick, bitter firing of the guns that there was to be no monkey business this night.  
  
Shortly after the sirens wailed you could hear the Germans grinding overhead. In my room, with its black curtains drawn across the windows, you could feel the shake from the guns. You could hear the boom, crump, crump, crump, of heavy bombs at their work of tearing buildings apart. They were not too far away.  
  
Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of a third of the entire circle of London. As we stepped out onto the balcony a vast inner excitement came over all of us-an excitement that had neither fear nor horror in it, because it was too full of awe.  
  
You have all seen big fires, but I doubt if you have ever seen the whole horizon of a city lined with great fires - scores of them, perhaps hundreds.

>After a drone swarm attack on Kyiv on Monday, Ukraine‚Äôs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed to Israel for air defense weapons. The plea was rebuffed by Israel‚Äôs minister of defense, Benny Gantz, largely because Israel depends on Russian cooperation for the Israeli Air Force to conduct raids in Syria. Israel, he said, would provide early warning systems, but not air defense weapons.

>Mr. Sak, the adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said Israel could be missing an opportunity to hone its tactics in facing down threats in its own territory by assisting in the counter-drone efforts now underway in Ukraine.

>‚ÄúThese Iranian drones that are hitting Ukrainian cities were not developed, not meant for Ukraine,‚Äù Mr. Sak said. ‚ÄúThey were developed as a mass capability to strike Israel. They are using Ukraine as a testing ground, to see weaknesses, to perfect them, and sooner or later they will use them against Israel.‚Äù

Why?  Because the *purpose* of the UN is to act as a forum for diplomacy amongst nations *especially* when they disagree over security matters; and Russia (due to its weapons stockpile if nothing else) has a significant role to play on that front.

Second, some ""big picture"": what happens if this drive to remove Russia from the Security Council and/or UN succeeds?  It would almost certainly result in Security Council authorisation of force to secure Ukraine against Russia's aggression.  That sounds like a good thing, right?  But to be clear, such resolution can pretty much only be enacted by a NATO-led coalition: so it would result in kinetic engagement between NATO forces and Russian forces.  Is *that* a good thing?  No doubt Russia would lose that conflict provided it remains conventional, but what if it becomes unconventional?

The fact that McConnell (Senate Maj Ldr) publicly broke with McCarthy about that the very next day suggests a lack of unity among Republicans on Ukraine. Democratic support for Ukraine is pretty much unanimous. Assuming Republicans flip the House but not the Senate, I think you'd see a lot of pressure on McCarthy to make concessions on that position. The Speaker can whip all they want but if he doesn't have the votes, he doesn't have the votes.

The neoconservatives (Bush Sr/Bush Jr/McCain etc) are still a significant wing of the Republican party, and McConnell aligns with them rather than the alt-right Trump faction. The Republican House caucus has a greater percentage of alt-righters than neocons, but the latter are still significant. Probably more than enough for an outright majority combined with the Democrats on Ukraine.

The main factors is that they had primarily Russian television (not just Russian-language).  So... what Fox did to half of America. How you can‚Äôt convince them of reality.  It‚Äôs that. 

Ironically, going across the southern edge‚Äîto berdyansk, Melitopol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odessa‚Äîthey all were speaking Russian last year.  But see, they didn‚Äôt have *exclusively* a Russian cable/satellite television hookup.  So the percentage of the zombified, pro-Russian was much smaller.

Further, Mariupol really developed quickly.  Twenty years ago, it was completely different, and much smaller.  A lot of the transplants were Russians themselves.  

These other regions didn‚Äôt have that.  In fact, Melitopol/Zaporizhye has always had that Cossack culture, a sort of hord of rebels.  Donbas‚Äînot so much. Kherson and Mykolaiv were shipbuilding cities thru soviet days.  Odessa has always been a beloved, prized city.  A jewel.  Full of culture and beauty.  Like a Venice or Vienna.  But Mariupol didn‚Äôt have some long-standing, many-generation identity...so it fell victim to Russian BS easier. 

Now, with no one hardly from the pro-U side remaining,it‚Äôs difficult to learn what‚Äôs up.",False,1666557153.0,t3_yb7i2d,t1_iti11qx,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

The detonation as way more powerful than anticipated, and the weather didn't go as-forecast, so a lot of fallout landed on the Rongelap and Rongerik islands. Virtually all of the inhabitants experienced severe radiation sickness, and were evacuated.  Three years later, the evacuated residents returned, but still developed acute radiation sickness. 

In 1972; residents again tried to move back to their home islands; (about 100), and still experienced radiation symptoms including sillbirths, miscarriages, and genetic abnormalities in their children. One 11 year old boy (born in 1971) died from cancer linked to radiation exposure.

In 1998, the IAEA report found that Bikini should not be permanently resettled because of dangerous levels of radiation in locally produced food (though background radiation was now near-normal levels).   However; Gamma radiation levels in 2016 are still 184 mrem/yr, well above the maximum allowed for human habitation. Residents of nearby islands have an elevated risk of thyroid cancer and leukemia.  Over 60 years later.

And Castle Bravo was not an intentionally dirty-bomb.  The real thing could be much worse; though if it's not paired with an actual thermonuclear device, it would only cover a very limited area, and cleanup would be relatively less complicated.

The idea that Ukraine would do this, to effectively permanently contaminate a wide swath of some of the richest farmland on the entire planet, is really so mind-bogglingly stupid, it's beyond belief that Russians would think they could convince anyone that it's a fact, that Ukraine is planning to do this.",1666552797.0,1666552462.0,t3_yb7i2d,t1_itgv8b1,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in a congratulatory letter to the World Symposium for Marxist Political Parties.

Xi noted that Marxism is a scientific theory that artfully reveals the patterns underlying the development of human society, points out the path for humans searching for their emancipation and advances the process of human civilization.

Do you even realise how unrealistic your proposal is? No sane government would have missed the chance to buy gas from Russia at that time.

Eastern Europe back then was very poor and could not have been even remotely the source of income that the rest of Europe was, eastern Europe still is poor in many cases. Places like Poland only started to become wealthy after they joined the EU, and once in the EU it can be an EU wide policy.

> there would be a pipeline to China.

If you don't know anything about a subject you really would be better served closing your mouth rather than making a fool of yourself. 

>Do you even realise how unrealistic your proposal is?

Do you even realise how unrealistic it is that both the EU and NATO Demand a country meet certain democratic and anti-corruption standards before they can join? OMG that's like meddling with internal politics! omg that policy would never have ever worked in a million billion years! OMG! OMG! 

lol. lmao.

Oh yes, such a wonderful business opportunity that totally hasn't resulted in crushing economic disaster for the all of europe. What a wonderful idea that was, just absolute genius levels of thinking to become entirely dependant on the insane country next door, you got it man, these people all must have been great strategic thinkers and this dumpster fire could never have been seen coming by anyone!...
