Everyone\* celebrates Christmas on December 25th. It's just that while Western Christianity has completely switched over to the Gregorian calendar, a lot of Eastern Orthodoxy still uses the Julian calendar. The difference is really just whether century years are leap years or not. On the Julian calendar, they always are, but on the Gregorian calendar, they only are if they're divisible by 400. (e.g. 2000 was a leap year, but not 1900 or 2100) As a result, the Julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, so even though they'll be celebrating Christmas on *Julian* December 25th, it'll look like *Gregorian* January 7th

The complication and the reason I included that asterisk, though, is Epiphany. It's celebrated 12 days after Christmas on January 6th, with Gregorian Epiphany currently being the day before Julian Christmas. But because the Armenians celebrate the Nativity on Epiphany, this sometimes gets conflated with Julian Christmas currently being 13 days after Gregorian Christmas. And to complicate things even more, while the Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates it on Gregorian Epiphany, the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem celebrates it on Julian Epiphany, which is currently Gregorian January 19th

So to summarize:

* Western Christianity- Gregorian December 25th

* Most of Eastern Orthodoxy (including Russia)- Julian December 25th = Gregorian January 7th

* Some Armenian churches- Gregorian January 6th

* Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem- Julian January 6th = Gregorian January 19th

EDIT:

Actually, Easter addendum. This is *broadly* also what happens for Easter. We both look for an approximated full moon in a certain range of dates, and just celebrate on the following Sunday. But because of that offset, in any given year, one of three things will happen:

* The Gregorian calendar notices a full moon and the Julian calendar also notices it before a Sunday arrives, so Gregorian and Julian Easter are on the same day

* The Gregorian calendar notices a full moon, but a Sunday arrives before the Julian calendar notices it, so Julian Easter is a week later

* The Gregorian calendar notices a full moon before the Julian calendar even starts looking, so Julian Easter is around a month later

EDIT: Also, there's technically also the Revised Julian calendar, which fixes the too many leap years problem in a different way, but since it currently aligns with the Gregorian calendar, I'm not going to complicate things even more",1672952848.0,1672951620.0,t3_103oyrf,t3_103oyrf,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

Day 316 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was yet again very quiet, there were no missile or drone strikes anywhere, and we had no big air raid alerts either, but as usual all the towns that are close to the border or to the frontline get shelled every single day. Kherson, Kupiansk and many other smaller towns were shelled again, but thankfully there were no reports of civilian casualties that we know of.

The Russians asking for a Christmas truce is just laughable, but after seeing some comments under the news about the truce it’s disappointing how many people believe in Russian words and will now be calling us warmongers for rejecting a “truce” that would have never been upheld anyway. So it was fine when Russians did massive missile strikes on our cities during New Year’s Eve, but rejecting a fake truce that wasn’t proposed in good faith is unacceptable? I just don’t get people that think that way.

All those news coming out now about us soon getting quite a lot of western IFVs and even another Patriot battery are just incredible, finally the red line is getting pushed back. It will certainly open the possibility of us also getting western MBTs relatively soon, and it is even already getting talked about now, which is great. I guess Patriots were what opened the flood gates for a bunch of new weapon systems getting approved for transfer, or maybe they were all being discussed at the same time. It’s great news either way.

- The Bradley can still perform many of the duties the Abrams can w/ its auto-cannon and TOW missiles.

- How do minefields impact using Bradleys for assaults? Do they essentially do a rolling barrage of artillery in attempt to clear mines or just risk it?

On 5 and 26 December 2022, the LRA’s Engels air base was struck and several aircraft damaged. Russia has highly likely responded to the incidents by conducting a general dispersal of LRA aircraft, especially to airfields further away from Ukraine.

The LRA will still be able to fire air launched cruise missiles into Ukraine because the weapons have a 5000km range, in addition to the flight range of the bombers.

However, operating from dispersal locations will add additional maintenance stress and will further deplete the limited flying hours available on these aging aircraft.

They're already digging in to T-62 stockpiles (and trying to modernise those that are working), sourcing ammunition from friends and conserving planes...

Add to this, mobilisation and basic equipment issues and they're at a tipping point.

Manpower is basically what they have left. Fun fact - manpower does not make an offensive, it makes a bloodbath.

It will be dirty, costly and terrible but Ukraine has got this, the question is just time...

Ukraine conducts offensives intelligently, Russia does not.

Russia targets non-military targets, Ukraine does not.

Russia treats captured and occupied people inhumanely, Ukraine does not.

Ukraine has Russia beaten, how long can Putin prolong it without repercussions? Probably many years.

So let us send more aid, donate where we can, pressure politicians where we can. We the Allies are many, rich, productive and strong, we can and ***should*** do this!

Tanks require significantly more maintenance and are less versatile  than bradleys.

Funny how the media span the story. To state the facts: The german offer was as follows: States with sizeable soviet equipment would give that to Ukraine (because Ukrainian Army wouldn't need training) and Germany would in turn provide new equipment to those nations. Thus Germany was willing to foot the majority of the bill.

For example. It offered Poland 100 Leopard 1A5 and 20 Leopard-2A4, Poland said no thx unless they get 44 Leopard 2A4. 

It send a Patriot to Slowakia (in exchange of an S300 going to Ukraine, Netherlands send a second Patriot), Slowakia 15 and the Czech Republic 14 Leopards (those countries then send in turn 70 tanks to Ukraine). Slowenia got military transporters (iirc mader?) and send 28 tanks. 

Greece simple wanted Germany to moderinze their army. 

&#x200B;

So yes, Germany could have send more arms but considering that within the ringtausch program Germany already provided 30+ Leopards and a Patriot system I find it funny how everyone disses the germans...

&#x200B;

This is the reason why eg the poster below /u/Front-Sun4735 thinks the USA had to pressure Germany when this is already the second Patriot battery they donated to the effort.

Anyway, the interesting question for Germany now is whether it's even possible to deliver tanks, as the Bundeswehr itself is severely underequipped in that area, plus there was a recent exercise in which the IFV Puma proved itself to be a serious liability, so the army may not even be willing to give away their old Marder vehicles (which the Puma replaced).

Germany doesn't want to be the first to deliver modern MBTs in a solo action, but there is also the problem of how many Leopard 2 Germany could spare.

You would need about 40 tanks, better some more, to equip a single tank battalion. That would be about a third of what the German army currently has operational. Giving away so many MBTs would severely reduce the ability of the Bundeswehr to fulfill its NATO obligations (Germany just took over the leadership of the NATO High Readiness Task Force) and even training of the own crews.

It's not a symbolic action from other allies to contribute to Leopard 2 deliveries, it is the only way possible.

5.56 is still lighter, smaller, much less recoil, which means more of it can be carried, and you can argue that it still kind of has a role due to the fact that it's superior in terms of that mobility.

Russia needs to join the other European nations in decoloniql efforts and accept that it is not the unbeatable behemoth that it likes to think it is.

The brief period of democracy in the Weimar republic was the first time ever Germans had any say in politics, and that lasted all of 15 years.

It is more likely that there is not a fixed amount of conflict that needs to happen.  The end occurs when Russians decide that they are done.  The end itself needs to be promoted as a thing that is desirable.  That end might come much faster taking a day off now.  It is hard to predict with accuracy.
