>*Allies can be exasperating. But try being invaded by your neighbor and lectured by everyone else.*
>
>“The history of all coalitions is a tale of the reciprocal complaints of allies.” Thus said Winston Churchill, who knew whereof he spoke. This summer of discontent has been one punctuated by complaints: from Ukrainian officials desperate for weapons, and from Western diplomats and soldiers who think that the Ukrainians are ungrateful for the tanks, training, and other goods they have received.
>
>Most of the Western sputtering occurred in and around last month’s NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, through anonymous leaks and public grumbles. Indeed, according to one report, the U.S. administration was so miffed by Volodymyr Zelensky’s complaint about the slowness of the NATO accession process that some advocated watering down language about NATO membership for Kyiv. Withdrawing the word *invitation* from the communiqué would, in their view, be a suitable punishment for a mean tweet.
>
>One gasps at the petulance on display here, as at otherwise staunch British Defense Minister Ben Wallace’s snap about Ukraine treating its Western suppliers as a kind of Amazon of weaponry.
>
>Such eruptions occur when officials let their irritations suppress their empathy. At the moment of peak whine, they forget what it means to have a fifth of your country occupied, or to know that a far bigger country is attempting, every night, to smash your power plants, blockade your ports, and destroy your crops. They are not holding in the forefront of their minds obliterated towns and mass graves. They do not know what it is to welcome back exchanged prisoners of war who have been castrated. Or to mourn old men and women murdered, or younger men and women tortured and raped. Or to worry frantically about thousands of children kidnapped. They forget that while a Western official’s sleep may be interrupted by a phone call or an alarm clock, a Ukrainian official’s sleep is more likely (and more often) interrupted by a siren or the crash of a missile slamming into an apartment block.
>
>Ukrainian officials are thankful. Analysis of their speeches reveals plenty of expressions of gratitude. But they are also insistent and vociferous in their cries for help. They would be both inhuman and derelict in their duty if they were to be anything else. Hopefully, after a whiskey (or two) on the plane back to Washington or London, Western officials simmer down and return to some level of maturity in understanding their beleaguered ally.
>
>Unfortunately, the impulse behind the whining can also manifest in subtler, but no less pernicious, forms. Much of the public discussion of Ukraine reveals a tendency to patronize that country and others that escaped Russian rule. As Toomas Ilves, a former president of Estonia, acidly observed, “When I was at university in the mid-1970s, no one referred to Germany as ‘the former Third Reich.’ And yet today, more than 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we keep on being referred to as ‘former Soviet bloc countries.’” Tropes about Ukrainian corruption abound, not without reason—but one may also legitimately ask why so many members of Congress enter the House or Senate with modest means and leave as multimillionaires…
>
>The latest, richest example of Western condescension came in a report by German military intelligence that complains that although the Ukrainians are good students in their training courses, they are not following Western doctrine and, worse, are promoting officers on the basis of combat experience rather than theoretical knowledge. Similar, if less cutting, views have leaked out of the Pentagon.
>
>The Ukrainians indeed received a diverse array of tanks and armored vehicles, but they have far less mine-clearing equipment than they need. They tried doing it our way—attempting to pierce dense Russian defenses and break out into open territory—and paid a price. After 10 days they decided to take a different approach, more careful and incremental, and better suited to their own capabilities (particularly their precision long-range weapons) and the challenge they faced. That is, by historical standards, fast adaptation.
>
>A besetting sin of big militaries, particularly America’s, is to think that their way is either the best way or the only way. As a result of this assumption, the United States builds inferior, mirror-image militaries in smaller allies facing insurgency or external threat. These forces tend to fail because they are unsuited to their environment or simply lack the resources that the U.S. military possesses in plenty. 
>
>The Ukrainians are now fighting a slow, patient war in which they are dismantling Russian artillery, ammunition depots, and command posts without weapons such as American ATACMS and German Taurus missiles that would make this sensible approach faster and more effective. They know far more about fighting Russians than anyone in any Western military knows, and they are experiencing a combat environment that no Western military has encountered since World War II.

Ukraine has shown it can attack these ships at will if Russia doesn't do anything to protect their merchant marine fleet.

&nbsp;

The mine fields the UAF has had to move through so far have been way denser than expected, anti-vehicle mines every 0.5-2 meters in some cases.  This is way more dense than Russian doctrine dictates, it's almost like they used the mines for the later lines of defense upfront.  Why would you break doctrine?  Well driving large vehicles through a minefield is dangerous especially when your troops weren't trained to drive those large vehicles in the first place.  It would probably make resupply extremely risky if conscripts and mobiks kept on blowing themselves up delivering ammo to the front lines plus all those secondary detonations will scatter UXOs everywhere.  They probably had to use the mines far more sparingly in the 2nd and 3rd lines of defense to be able to resupply the line of contact.

&nbsp;

Russian doctrine calls for slowly moving back into fortifications when on the defensive but the Russian army has been doing the exact opposite of that.  Every time Ukraine takes a trench or position, Russia sends a bunch of soldiers to counterattack.  This is why Russia is still suffering worse attrition than Ukraine despite Ukraine technically being on the attack.  But how does this make sense?  Russian troops should be falling back to their most defensible positions to preserve combat strength.  This strategy would only make sense if these minefields were actually their most defensible positions in the region.

&nbsp;

Russia has 3 notable strengths they've been exploiting that have caused most of Ukraine's losses during the counteroffensive; mines, artillery and loitering munitions.  Russia has been waiting for vehicles to be immobilized by mines before saturating the area with artillery and picking of stragglers with loitering munitions.  It's great for Russia as you don't exactly need the most competently trained or equipped troops to pull off this strategy.  Those later lines of defense will require much more disciplined and trained troops to properly utilize a defense in depth strategy.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: Russia is trying way too hard to keep the UAF from reaching their fortified lines and the only way Russian attrition rates make sense is if the UAF is already pushing through the areas the Russian army can defend the best.",1691263463.0,1691263270.0,t3_15ild52,t3_15ild52,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

 Germany was occupied and the successor state has spent decades doing their damndest to educate how those atrocities happened and working to avoid them happening again. Few people alive from states victimized by the Nazis blame German people as a whole.

Italy had a revolt before the allies could finish invading, helping to distance themselves from Mussolini’s Nazi collaboration, and even before that were often framed as the “bumbling side-kick” to Nazi Germany.

Japan was occupied and developed into a part of the Western alliance system... but there is still lingering animosity amongst the people they subjugated because of how the government has been seen to downplay or sidestep what they did (biggest example I can think of is Korean people thinking the Japanese state hasn’t done nearly enough for the atrocities committed especially for  the women subjected to violence by Japanese soldiers/officials, while the anger is centred on the state the feelings seep into individual interactions sometimes).

NATO seems to have a strategy of ignoring nonsensical russian provocations.  They're happy to have all the escalation happen in Ukraine and not spread elsewhere.  This does make some sense in the context of appeasement, since it gives the appearance of that without contributing much to that.

At the same time, the strategy on an actual incident would be rapid escalation.  Poland and the Baltics in particular are ready for ""hybrid war"" like what happened early on in Donbas, where little green men of unprovable origin come in with guns and pretend to be locals.  Here you just go in and root them out, and they have to either escalate along with you toward article 5, or get the fuck out.

None of that monologue was about Romania, or about stuff flying through NATO space to strike in Ukraine.

Not much. The Abrams is a very good tank, but it runs into the same problem that the Bradleys and Leopards are having, too many mines, not enough air support. Abrams were designed with a certain doctrine in mind, and they perform exceptionally well in that framework, but Ukraine can't replicate those conditions.

Ultimately until Ukraine can move past the landmines and get into a phase of maneuver war, AFVs are going to be of limited utility.

A good example of this is how much the javelin has changed the battlefield, and the amount of tanks Russia has lost so far, with Oryx confirming over 2.2k now.

And there’s definitely a shift even with Russia not deploying a whole heap of tanks anymore (granted there’s probably not many left that aren’t from the 1940s lol)

I could see a sanctions reduction/withdrawl for troop withdrawl being floated, but a final settlement is unlikely.

There is no real problem with supplying Ukraine with short range anti air defense. But those are based around guns, and are only useful for defending specific targets. Like a fuel depot, or a command center. They aren't able to defend larger areas, or stop Russian planes from attacking. To do that you need missiles.

The big name missile defense systems, the ones that can protect whole cities, are some combination of expensive AF (Patriots) and exist in severely limited quantities (Iris). NASAMS aren't as effective as those two in terms of range, but they use American air to air missiles that exist in huge quantities, many of which are kind of old as well.

Signees would acknowledge Ukraines right to seek an unconditional surrender. Instead, they’re agreeing that all the areas Russia has occupied INCLUDING CRIMEA, are Ukraines and that Ukraine has a right to continue the war until they are retrieved. The parameters for victory are being set. 

This will help NATO decide things like when is the war “over” and Ukraine can join NATO. Russia will continue to fire rockets into Ukraine even after losing all territory inUkraine.

With the concerns over police militarization the US military isn’t handing over tons of surplus military gear to police anymore and yet the issue of what to do with surplus equipment was still there. Now with the war in Ukraine the US has a quick and easy way to git rid of this surplus equipment and vehicles. Many of these vehicles were designed to fight against Russian weapons and so they’re perfectly suited for Ukraine and the long term maintenance costs aren’t a big issue for Ukraine given that they aren’t sitting around for years.

Dear (news site, or politician) ,I hope this email finds you well. My name is Samuel, and I am a concerned European citizen deeply troubled by the impact of Russian propaganda on civilians worldwide. I am an avid listener of your channel in Europe, and I commend your efforts in providing unbiased news to enlighten the global audience.I wanted to express my appreciation for (inset news site or politician) dedication in spreading accurate and reliable news across the globe. 

&#x200B;

However, I feel compelled to raise a concern regarding the insufficient coverage of critical issues in Latin America and Asia. Russian propaganda channels, such as RT, are disseminating misinformation and fostering animosity towards the West, which is deeply concerning.Through studying your YouTube channel, I have observed a noticeable gap in reporting on the atrocities perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine and its scheming activities on the international stage. As European citizens, we may have a clearer understanding of the true face of the Russian regime, but unfortunately, this awareness is not prevalent worldwide.I firmly believe that public opinions can significantly influence foreign policy decisions, and I urge you to expand its coverage in regions like Latin America and Asia. 

&#x200B;

By shedding more light on the realities of Russian aggression and manipulation, we can help foster a more informed global audience and encourage a united stance against such activities.I am aware that you are already doing a lot to provide reliable news, and for that, I am grateful. However, I humbly request that you consider increasing your efforts to address this pressing issue, given its potential impact on shaping the world today.Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to witnessing positive changes and a deeper commitment to spreading the truth and promoting a more enlightened global community.

This means that the money they spend doesn't have to come from other places, such as pensions. If they keep going at the current rate, they will have burned through those reserves within the span of a year. 

At that stage, Putin can no longer avoid impacting people directly. Either he has to raise taxes on the people directly (right now it's just windfall taxes for companies) or he has to touch social benefits. The last time Putin cut the pensions his support received a massive drop, something like 20-30%. 

So far the strategy from Putin has been to isolate his base from the effects of the war as much as he can. They are not forcefully recruited, they are not taxed additionally, and they do not see a cut in their benefits. It's in part because of this that he has bee able to survive politically speaking. If in a year he is forced to create such effects for his base, it will be a different situation. 

It may very well be that he is able to control the populace, but it's also clear that his position is incredibly weak if another from the elite were to challenge him.

Extremely long wavelengths will do it and several countries have built antennas several kilometers long for submarine comms though even that is wildly inefficient, very low bandwidth and one-way only because doing the same on the sub to transmit back is impractical.

While VHF radio over the surface of the conductive sea to base is an excellent mode of propogation, as your sub gets further away from you the signal has to go through more and more water to get back to the pilot.

One solution for submarines is to surface when they want to talk, or to release a tethered bouy to the surface with an antenna on it. Since the drone is giving constant feedback, that's not practical.

I dont know if this is too long of an answer, but Perun does a fantastic job at explaining how war economies work; and why countries which declare crises when the BDP drops by 0.5% can go on for years with 5%,10%, or even 45% drops (that last number is Ukraine, btw).

Mind you, Russia's economy is doing far better than the west hoped. Sure, it was expected to grow by 11% a year, and now that growth is 5%, but that's better than any western country except USA.

That, combined with Putins sky high support amongst Russia citizens means its very likely that this war is going to have to be won the old fashion way. The sanctions might help around the edges at most, and a weaker Russia in the future wont be able to build such an vast military. But collapsing into suing for peace?

A couple of drones however that fall in the middle of nowhere, that clearly are misfires, don't do any actual harm or show any intent.

3373fc979be369977e18881a1d239cd1,15ild52,juvpnyj,"Part of the difficulty here is how words are differently by different people.

Let's take the word casualty. Generally speaking, this defined as a person unable to continue in their military role due to death, injury or illness (here's a couple of sources, one being the [Australian War Memorial](https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/definitions/casualties) and the second being a [US state government source](https://www.mass.gov/doc/military-glossary-0/download).

Now, look at how the word is used in general media parlance. In this article by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187847548/how-many-russians-have-died-in-ukraine-new-data-estimates-soldier-casualties) for instance, the headline uses the word 'casualty', even though the researcher is talking about military deaths through indirect tallying measures like inheritence claims and headstone counts. So the article itself confuses an issue it claims to be clarifying.

Now let's look at the preferred English term used by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in their publicity material, which is 'liquidated'. As far as I'm aware that doesn't have a specific military use. Taken in general parlance it means something, often a business, no longer operating as such, its componenets being rolled up or sold on. As a metaphor, that matches the loose idea of a casualty being a person no longer militarily capable, but not necessarily destroyed.

Aslo, the lack of clarity around the word 'liquidated' is often reflected by the use of scare quotes in headlines where the word is used; see [here](https://www.ft.com/content/175720c7-9312-4a56-964a-d20f8ec5377a), [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-fsb-says-ukrainian-saboteurs-liquidated-while-trying-enter-border-region-2022-12-26/) and [here](https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-news-ria-novosti-demands-liquidation-ukraine-ukrainians-war-crimes-civilians-putin-1558378).",False,1691231204.0,t3_15ild52,t1_juvi5pf,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Infamous mirror sites inaccurate for other reasons, like Minusrus accepted the number as kills; they then multiplied it by three to report a bogus WIA number.  A number thankfully people have stopped reporting because it would have been 3/4 of a million by now.  

But the second number was the fabricated one; they were right to accept the UA data as kills and not kills + casualties.  However UA command does not tell us everything, and may have included wounded in the count on numerous occasions.  They may even have switched to counting KIA+WIA as a matter of policy.  And of course, these are only estimates based on strength of arms in a given battle, max occupancy of destroyed structures and vehicles, etc.  

So IMO it obviously began as a kill count, but by now it may reflect something more encompassing.  However it also may not.  As late as November 2022 some US generals went on record suggesting the figures were not just valid, but potentially underestimates.  It would also be wrong to change our ideas about this number just because it's climbed too high.

And well, we're talking about another number now, the number on the field.  I think that's got to be a couple million, but we have no way of verifying it.  We know only how many were amassing on the border prior to the war and the number officially asked for in the pre-winter mobilization, but we also know they exceeded that number through gloriously illegal means, and we know cadets from the bi-annual call to service have shown up in Ukraine since spring 2022.  

So 200K, plus 500K+, plus an unknown amount from regular drafts, plus the entire supply and infrastructure side of it.  Even construction crews have been sent to war and they weren't officially on anybody's books.
