These are necessitated upon the belief that Russians are a persecuted minority just trying to live their lives. They've been there for generations  and just wish to live in peace. They then make a parallel between the revolution in 2014, and its most extreme elements to ordinary politicians. This is easier than most believe. In the US for instance,ANTIFA becomes equated with Biden. In Russia, Nazis are associated with Zelensky. All of the public propaganda coming out in Russian, is reliant on this idea that Russians are being persecuted.

The Russian AF has ~1m active personnel and 2m reservists. About 150k troops were mobilized to the Ukraine border(with reportedly about half of them pushed in now).

Ukraine, on the other hand, has ~3m people living just in the greater Kiev area alone.  Let's say only ~2m of those people are adults of a ""viable fighting age""(roughly [67% of the population looks to be between 15-64yo](https://www.indexmundi.com/ukraine/demographics_profile.html)). And then let's say that only 25% of those 2m actually pick up weapons or make any kind of attempt at assisting the defense.  And THEN let's say I'm still way overestimating that number somehow and it's only actually around ~200k.  

That's still ~200k people - in Kyiv alone - who are incredibly pissed off because a foreign invader is coming to try to take over THEIR fucking country and have literally nothing more important on their daily schedule than doing everything they possibly can to defend it. And meanwhile, Russia effectively has ~75k or so troops actually in country right now - spread out across several cities.  I'm not sure how many are allocated specifically to assaulting Kyiv, but I'd guess somewhere between 20-40k?   

And ALL of that putting aside(or possibly in addition to, depending on degree of truth to each) all of the various reports/theories flying around regarding how well packed/how long of a campaign the Russian forces were expecting, how well-equipped/trained the troops themselves actually are, etc.

I know I'm leaving a lot out of the picture here(and probably overlooking some important factors myself, like air numbers/tech advantages).  But still.  Those just seem like some potentially staggering differences in numbers to me.  

These brave regular folks who picked up those Kalashnikovs from the trucks and crafted Molotovs with their neighbors just might be a much bigger difference maker in this whole thing that any of us are even realizing.",False,1646028741.0,t3_t37kmg,t3_t37kmg,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. The US condemned the order and said Putin was “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”.

The rouble is expect to plummet at least 25% amid panic when markets open on Monday, reflecting the unprecedented sanctions announced by the US and European Union over the weekend. The European Central Bank said on Monday morning that Sberbank Europe, a fully owned subsidiary of Sberbank Russia, which in turn is majority owned by the Russian state, is failing or likely to fail.

Belarus reportedly approved in a referendum a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the country has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. The move could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. The package of constitutional reforms also extended the rule of leader Alexander Lukashenko.

Ukraine’s interior ministry says 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. It says an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. The ministry did not give any information on casualties among Ukraine’s armed forces. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, claimed Russian forces had lost about 4,300 servicemen, a figure it was not possible to verify independently.

Satellite imagery taken on Sunday showed a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of the capital Kyiv from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away. The city remains in Ukrainian hands. The images released by Maxar Technologies showed a deployment comprising hundreds of military vehicles and extending more than 3.25 miles (5km), the company said. The convoy contained fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery, it said.

Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but “let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance”.

British prime minister Boris Johnson said he called the Ukrainian president who said he believed the next 24 hours was a “crucial period” for Ukraine. Johnson said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine.

The EU will buy weapons for Ukraine. Multiple European countries are offering military aid to Ukraine, including Sweden, which hasn’t sent weapons to a country in armed conflict since the Soviet Union’s invasion of Finland in 1939.

The EU plans to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, including the private jets of Russian oligarchs. The bloc will also ban Russian-state backed television channels RT and Sputnik.

A rare emergency special session of the UN general assembly is due to be held on Monday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the security council has made such a request.

The UN refugee agency has said more than 368,000 people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries. Up to 4 million people could become refugees if the situation continues to worsen, the UN said.

The World Health Organization warned that thousands of lives are at risk from falling Ukrainian oxygen supplies. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have spoken out against Putin’s invasion. Fridman said: “I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” Deripaska called for peace talks to begin “as fast as possible”.

Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken” by the war and appeared to take direct aim at Putin by condemning people who “trust in the diabolic and perverse logic of weapons”.

The UK will send an additional £40m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while the US said it is sending nearly $54m (£40m) in new humanitarian aid

Russian police detained more than 1,400 people at anti-war protests on Sunday, an independent monitoring organisation said, lifting the tally for crackdown arrests to over 4,000.

The rest of the world isn’t going to bat for Ukraine, but they sure as shit are supplying Ukraine. Like, nobody is sending their troops to the front line, but everybody, even countries that tend to be neutral, are sending military equipment to Ukraine’s aid. And even though equipment and arms aren’t the same as soldiers, you can’t help but feel like it’s similar. Clearly most countries want Ukraine to win, it’s obvious and out there. 

So what happens next? If Russia takes Ukraine, and they stop there, what do we do? Accept it? Continue sanctions until they go back? What if they take parts of Poland to the Baltic and cut off Lithuania/Latvia/Estonia? Do we step in then? If Ukraine holds steady and Putin pulls back, do we just accept that stalemate or go after Putin for potential war crimes?

The United States has some good aces in the hole- they have the most advanced capabilities in many sectors, many that we don’t know fully of what they’re capable of but have seen glimpses of.

Our cybersecurity-the one of the most sophisticated hacks came from a US attack called Stuxnet. It would not surprise me if they produced that for an Iranian nuclear powerplant, I would imagine Russia’s nuclear defense has absolutely been considered.

Hello, I’m YOUR\_NAME, one of your new constituents in YOUR\_TOWN.  
  
As I am sure you are aware, the Ukrainians are currently making a historic and valiant stand against an insane and despotic leader. I am shocked and appalled at how Russia is blatantly attacking an innocent and harmless neighbor. Make no mistake, history has shown that stopping dictators will only get harder, not easier. If they fail, Russia will be emboldened and they will surely move on to attack and threaten other allies in Europe.  
  
The Ukraine issue is extremely important to me. The Ukrainians are a good people, and they deserve a better leader than Putin. I urge you, in the name of human rights and democracy, to help them as much and in every way humanly possible. In particular, a bill is coming up to provide more aid to the fighters, I strong encourage you to vote in favor. This is not their fight, it is our fight.

> The Donetsk People's Republic (DPR or **DNR**; Russian: Донецкая Народная Республика, tr. Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika, IPA: [dɐˈnʲetskəjə nɐˈrodnəjə rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə]) is a self-proclaimed breakaway state located in Ukraine, formed on 7 April 2014. The capital city and largest city within the DPR is Donetsk. Denis Pushilin has served as the DPR head of state since 2018.

> Ukraine regards both the DPR and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as terrorist organisations. Ukraine considers them to be part of the ""temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine"" as a result of Russian military intervention, together with the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. The DPR and the Ukrainian government estimate that around 2 million people – over half of the total population of Donetsk Oblast – live in DPR-held regions. Although the rebels do not govern most of Donetsk Oblast in terms of area, only controlling 7,853 square kilometres (3,032 sq mi), they hold major cities such as Donetsk (the capital), Makiivka, and Horlivka.

> On 21 February 2022, Russia officially recognised the DPR and the LPR as independent states, becoming the first UN member state to do so. Russia had formerly already recognised identity documents, diplomas, birth- and marriage-certificates, and vehicle registration plates issued by the DPR since February 2017. Both republics are at the center of the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.",1646029740.0,1646029690.0,t3_t37kmg,t3_t37kmg,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

The Kuril Islands or Kurile Islands is a volcanic archipelago part of Sakhalin Oblast in the Russian Far East. It stretches approximately 1,300 km northeast from Hokkaido in Japan to Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the north Pacific Ocean. There are 56 islands and many minor rocks. The Kuril Islands consist of the Greater Kuril Chain and the Lesser Kuril Chain. They cover an area of around 10,503.2 square kilometres, with a population of roughly 20,000.

Henrik Paulsson - Visiting Fellow at Marine Corps University, and PhD at Swedish Defense University:

>  A lot has been said by others, but one thing that strikes me is that maps are poorly updated, often being very hesitant in assigning territory to Russian forces. Can lead to unwittingly obscuring view for us observing, but for example the Ru to the west of Kyiv have now essentially placed themselves in a blocking position. Might not have large forces to actually defend against larger counter-attacks, but clearly they hold more terrain than is depicted.
> 
> Similar goes for forces to the north of Melitopol; check out LivemapUA with updates from the 27th only, and contrast the furthest forward forces with what maps from all different(mostly western) outlets are showing. Seems that there are significant forces and movement not noted or observed at this point.

One day I saw the Russian kids hacking away and destroying the net for no reason. When I approached them they ran away with their sticks screaming ""onwards to victory!""

I got stuck with them in the same elevator at the school one day and they just stared at me in complete silence. I tried to talk to them about famous ice hockey players who are Russian in the NHL and they had no idea about them.  I told them they could use the soccer goals if they wanted to. I fixed nets and saw them playing one day and having a good time.

2)Putin **vastly** underestimated the economic blowback and western support. It cannot be understated that with Donald Trump, he was basically *given* Syria, and the sanctions over Crimea were truly a slap on the wrist. He expected **more of that**, and didn't get it. In fact, quite the opposite.

3)Not accounting for as fierce resistance. This ties in to 1 and 2 and an overall poor evaluation of thinking he could ctrl+c and ctrl+v his Georgia/Syria/Crimea strategy. This is not what is happening.


While there are definitely people taking note, the amount of armchair generals speculating they have seen the full might of the Russian Army in a total war scenario, brushing them off as a third-world country is as dangerously underestimating what's happening as it was for Putin to underestimate Ukraine.

**Edit:**  I am apparently arguing against people that sincerely believe 

A)Russia is lying about having ""any"" nukes 

B)Russia has clearly deployed 60-80% of their military in the region (with the commenter saying ""I read somewhere"", no source provided)

C)I am also apparently a Putin propagandist because I don't believe this reflects the total strength of the Russian military, and that it devalues the hard work going in to defending the people of Ukraine against Russia. It's ""soooo easy"". Fuck off.

D)That a nation being unable to take another nation in 5 days means their army is shit. It took the USA three weeks to capture as not receiving EU support or the equivalent of $1-2 billion dollars in outside aid a day. We also didn't ""win"" Iraq. Or Vietnam. Or Korea. If that makes you knock the American Army down a few pegs, please feel free to talk about how that is leagues different from the conclusions you're basing 4 days into the conflict. **I've yet to see one person willing to take this argument**. I dont see how stating Putins miserable failure at this invasion does not equate the overall strength of Russia at this point. Nations with powerful armies do, and can have Colossal military setbacks without depowering them to ""50th best army"", especially when their previous spot was in the top 5. *That* is silly.",1646031173.0,1646029051.0,t3_t37kmg,t3_t37kmg,,0,-9,0,-9,0,0,

e5ddeada8209a80e768cb6f178dac272,t37kmg,hyqsxtd,"I said it before and I’ll say it again. 

Every dollar that we spend on military spending is a dollar that we could’ve used to feed to hungry, house the homeless and educate our children. I know people (especially on Reddit) are caught up in their hawkish stance right now, but we shouldn’t be so irrational and do things like praise like Olaf Scholz’s [promise](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-commits-100-billion-to-defense-spending/a-60933724) to spend 100 billion euros on defense. 

That money could’ve gone to the 15% of Germany’s population who are currently living in relative poverty. It could’ve gone to to students who have trouble paying for living costs while at university. It could’ve been used on infrastructure and pensions that could in return boost Germany’s economy and raise wages for its workers. Instead it will be spent on weapons, a lot of it which will go to big companies in the military industrial complex. 

I’m reminded to Eisenhower’s quote 

> Every gun that is made, every warship that is launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the genius of its scientists, the sweat of its laborers, the hopes of its children. 

The United States spent over 5 trillion dollars on Iraq and Afghanistan trying to export “freedom and democracy” to the world and feeding people from the evils of Saddam Hussein and the taliban. Yet 2 decades later what has that gotten us except wasted blood and treasure? 

Would America not been better off spending that 5 trillion dollars on healthcare, education, and infrastructure? How many schools and hospitals could we built? How miles of rail could we have laid? How many of our children’s hopes and dreams could we have helped fulfill? 

When leaders across the west are announcing these massive amounts of aid to Ukraine I can’t help but think back to the leaders back then who were in charge during Iraq and Afghanistan. It all sounds so similar.

I just hope that everybody understands that every dollar/pound Biden or Boris promises to Ukraine is a dollar/pound that could’ve gone to the NHS and Medicaid.",False,1646026599.0,t3_t37kmg,t3_t37kmg,,0,-93,0,-93,0,0,

Doesn’t matter how advanced your armored division is, a well placed rocket and a strong vantage point for the enemy can REALLY mess things up for entire columns. Problem with heavy military machinery is it is almost always broadcasting exactly where it is, hard to be stealthy with multi-ton tanks with loud-ass engines. Meanwhile it’s fairly easy to get ground troops in and out of a location with relatively secrecy... so setting up ambushes against armored vehicles isn’t all that difficult for properly trained soldiers who know what to look for. 

Sounds like a weird comparison, but maybe you’ve played a Command and Conquer game before, idk. In those games, tanks were good against buildings and other tanks, awful against soldiers. That’s pretty realistic, tanks are for tank battles and tearing down barriers. Russia played the dumbass card here by sending mostly tanks into a country basing their defense around ground troops. These tanks have like no visuals, move slow, are hard to maneuver in closed urban locations, and need constant refueling to work, and these morons are like “yeah, let’s doubles down on the tanks”.... if Russia had chose to set a steady artillery barrage on key supply routes while they sent their better trained soldiers to clear buildings, using tanks only to clear strongholds, this would have been a much different conflict. But Putin’s Boys Club has flubbed this at every chance they’ve gotten.

____
I actually wouldn’t be surprised if Russia wants to ramp up the assault in both the south (Odessa) and the north (Zhytomyr/Lviv?) following the SWIFT-ban, in order to cut the whole of Ukraine off from moving refugees to and getting supplies from, EU/NATO countries, such as Poland and Romania.

Perhaps this is also why the EU and other European nations have significantly ramped up deliveries of weapons and supplies, after having received intel pointing to this being possibly imminent.

I wonder how much of that must drive Putin nuts.

Years, *decades*, of staged photoshoots, things like riding shirtless on a horse in an idyllic meadow or getting a hockey team to move out of the way so he can score a goal.

Compared to the images of Zelenskyy that have gone viral, spreading around the world three times over. Images of him in fatigues with a 5 o'clock shadow, huddled around with other soldiers, bracing for a siege. 

Every picture Putin put out was a carefully posed and constructed photo-op, and looks to be it. About as natural or as human as a Vanity Fair spread. The pictures of Zelenskyy, by contrast, tell a natural narrative of David and Goliath, the leader of a brave country defending it against an aggressive but overconfident invader. 

Zelenskyy didn't have to tell a Creative Director, 'I'm going for a Leonidas at Thermopylae angle, can we do that?' But that's what ended up happening given the circumstances. Putin riding shirtless on a horse became a laughing stock, a meme, years ago.

Ultimately what ended up happening is, due to the secrecy, for generations people in the West developed this mystique around the Russian Forces. Since we knew so little of them, we made them into whatever we wanted them to be. Writers, movie directors, especially took the advantage to make them into the next ultimate scary bad guy in a world that was still too battle weary from Nazis. A well armed, hyper-competent bad guy makes for a better story than a blundering, incompetent one, so that's the story we told over and over again until it became the story we told because it was the story we grew up with.

The reality of the Russian Armed Forces ended up being a lot more mundane than our imaginations had made it out to be, however.

The same corruption that cripples the Russian government is also at play in its military. Connections, rather than experience or aptitude, decide your placement, which means a lot of their tactics are based on vague and outdated theories as opposed to practical experience.

America had 10x the spending Russia ever had and Iraqi's and Afghanis were nowhere near as supported as Ukraine is by the west.   

Not to mention all the propaganda from Russian side is so rigged, all their government papers are controlled by Kremlin they do not have a free press.

That's the other option.

While not confirmed, Poland does operate 23 MiG-29s (fighters) and some older SU-25s (ground attack fighters). Those are probably what was referred to as ""EU is sending Russian aircraft"", the list of ""Russian aircraft"" operated by an EU country is really short.

Ukraine also operates the MiG-29. While the Polish fighters have been heavily updated to NATO standards, they should be reasonably familiar to a Ukrainian pilot already trained on a MiG-29 and compatible with all the weapons and ammo Ukraine already has.

Edit: The reason I'm so certain of Polish MiG-29s is that they are there, ready to go, and already slated for replacement by F-16s or F-35s soon (so no big deal for Poland to let go of a little early).

If they spend less this year than they did last year their minimum budget is adjusted and that becomes their new number.  Gaining money is harder.  Because of this the bases will spend money on things they don’t need.  A very simplified example is construction of buildings.

Every dollar that we spend on military spending is a dollar that we could’ve used to feed to hungry, house the homeless and educate our children. I know people (especially on Reddit) are caught up in their hawkish stance right now, but we shouldn’t be so irrational and do things like praise like Olaf Scholz’s [promise](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-commits-100-billion-to-defense-spending/a-60933724) to spend 100 billion euros on defense. 

That money could’ve gone to the 15% of Germany’s population who are currently living in relative poverty. It could’ve gone to to students who have trouble paying for living costs while at university. It could’ve been used on infrastructure and pensions that could in return boost Germany’s economy and raise wages for its workers. Instead it will be spent on weapons, a lot of it which will go to big companies in the military industrial complex. 

I’m reminded to Eisenhower’s quote 

> Every gun that is made, every warship that is launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the genius of its scientists, the sweat of its laborers, the hopes of its children. 

The United States spent over 5 trillion dollars on Iraq and Afghanistan trying to export “freedom and democracy” to the world and feeding people from the evils of Saddam Hussein and the taliban. Yet 2 decades later what has that gotten us except wasted blood and treasure? 

Would America not been better off spending that 5 trillion dollars on healthcare, education, and infrastructure? How many schools and hospitals could we built? How miles of rail could we have laid? How many of our children’s hopes and dreams could we have helped fulfill? 

When leaders across the west are announcing these massive amounts of aid to Ukraine I can’t help but think back to the leaders back then who were in charge during Iraq and Afghanistan.

In a simulation done in 2018 modeling this exact situation (NATO vs Russia) using the active stashes (around 3000 nukes), ""only"" 35 million people died instantly with 60 million additional injuries in all of Europe, Russia and North America from the blasts.

This simulation didn't account for any being intercepted (which some undoubtfully would), how many are actually active (for example, I doubt Russia has the ability to actually fire 1500 warheads on short term notice given what we have seen) and launch sites being destroyed prior to full firing capabilities. The USA would already have significant info on group related deployments and would see the common location of them on radar with jets already in the air.

That leaves basically 1 billion people alive and having to deal with the aftermath. If you didn't live in the direct center of a large metropolitan or within 30-50km of a military base, you would probably survive unless you were unlucky enough to be in an area hit by one of the largest devices of the arsenal. Nuclear radiation also clears to non-lethal levels after a blast very quickly (under 48 hours I think) unless there is a firestorm that keeps particles suspended/burning. 

The problems then become things like staying away from radiation suspended in smoke in the atmosphere or in the water, if the planet begins to rapidly cool (nuclear winter is actually a pretty debated topic), the effects of EMP from the blast that will wipe out some tech throughout the continents and disasters like nuclear power reactors that begin to malfunction or were directly in the blast.",1646030050.0,1646029510.0,t3_t37kmg,t1_hyqw2fx,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

A large segment of the military corp is also against this based on a public letter from former head of the russian military in the 90s.  What does this mean?  If we send troops in to fight a conventional war, the moral of Russian troops will immediately skyrocket as this goes from an offensive war of choice to a defensive war, and the military command will immediately be less likely to perform a coup.  In other words its not worth the risk and will make things worse.

In the baltics, we already have troops there on the boarder and we have traditionally left it as a trip wire, Enough that if russia moves they know we will strike back, but not enough that triggers russia to see it as a large threat.  Additionally, due to game theory, if russia hits us there we HAVE to hit back.  Its incredibly damaging not to as it ruins any and all credibility.  Additionally, if Russia hits we have troops there that will likely be hurt causing any US leader to retaliate.  

All taken together there are good reasons for the current affects.  Additionally, given the now clear state of Russia's military, I dont think they are a threat to any modern military",False,1646026745.0,t3_t37kmg,t1_hyqqakl,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

As an explanation, actually look at his career.  He was a spy, but not a spy in a foreign country, a spy who hunts down other spies in his territory, and a politician.

They didn't establish air superiority before throwing troops into battle so they've lost more in 4 days than the coalition did in Iraq in 4 years. Part of the reason it took coalition forces in Iraq so long to take Baghdad was that they moved slow and steady instead of spreading their military across huge areas and tried to secure their rear, which the Russian forces don't seem to be doing a good job of, to say the least.

They've massively undersupplied their troops, and you can't underestimate the impact of the low morale that causes on the ability of an army to fight. They simply shouldn't be running out of fuel en masse and looting for food and water at this stage.

The coalition probably did underestimate the Iraqi forces, but not nearly as much as Putin seems to have underestimated Ukrainian resistance and pride in being Ukrainian.

They also seem to have been completely unprepared for the resources that Ukraine would have at their disposal. They don't seem too bothered by the sanctions because they would have expected those, but their lack of logistical preparation for their troops suggests that they either don't have better resources available - in which case the fuck up was in starting a war at all - or they undersupplied because they thought it would both be easy and that no one would really do anything more to support Ukraine than sanction Russia.

Leaving logistics lines not protected. Losing soldiers and equipment due to suicide attacks against well defended positions. Those are all issues the US took care of before hand.

A lot of this is due to the fact that Putin is approaching this as a surprise attack and not as a slow and steady war. Russian soldiers were air dropping into Ukraine's capital on day 1 of the invasion. That's just not what you do.

The US took it slow, gained and held ground, destroyed Iraq's air force, and still it was a three weeks campaign. Iraq also didn't have the weapons they needed to make the US hurt, while Ukraine does due to Western aid. That makes a huge difference.

But perhaps more importantly, there is a morale difference. Ukraine knows that *if they just hold on*, Russia will tire from all the sanctions and NATO will pull through with enough weapons and aid. Time was on their side, they just needed to make Russia pay for each attack.

By contrast, Iraq didn't have that hope. Nobody supported Iraq against the US. It wouldn't have gotten better for Iraq even if they could make the US pay for every attack. The US had tremendous resources, far more than Iraq did. The only hope Iraq had was to make it like Vietnam where the US lost so many soldiers its public called for an end to the war.

These issues that Russian armor is facing is not a new problem, but its now so easily countered due to surveillance, a lack of complete air superiority, an abundance of anti tank weaponry, and the effectiveness of those anti tank measures. I'd argue the US could have easily fallen victim to a similar situation in Iraq (both wars), had they employed similar strategies as Russia. But the US is fantastic at combined arms and supporting their troops, plus the complete and utter annihilation of the Iraqi Air Force meant that tanks were a huge bonus rather than an expensive coffin. 

So in all, I think they still have their place, particularly for a dominant power, but if I was China and looking at these results, I would think twice about investing in tanks.

After the Sino-Soviet split in the 1950s/60s, the P. R of China (under Mao) had several border clashes with India over territory. The USSR again sent them military aid, mostly in an effort to piss off Mao.

Also a good twitter thread read that helps to explain the current state of Russian armed forces, and how they got to where they're at.

Basically Russia needs to go neutral itself. Ironically if Russia were to eventually enter the EU/have a direct partnership with them so they can still act somewhat independently in their foreign policy, they would be heavy weights and likely be growing at an insane rate economically as has happened in Poland and Hungary since joining the EU, despite corruption.

I also think that Ukraine will try to retake Crimea eventually, it's value both strategically and because of the amount of offshore natural gas is huge. I could see crimea being offered a high degree of autonomy, but Ukraine wants the offshore resources (I could also see them maintaining Russian fleet basing rights in sevastopol if there's a different Russian gov't).

Fundamentally, the only way out of this is a new generation of thinkers in Russia regarding geopolitics, and re-interpreting their role/goals on the world stage. Russia has gotten too corrupt/economically weak to be a world power, they're a regional power at best. They should be focusing on gathering foreign direct investment and trying to grow their population. Basically fixing the country internally. 

Western powers have proven time and time again that they're non-aggressors so long as you let their businesses operate in your country, even with super stringent conditions (look at China).

He's made clear that NATO expansion into Ukraine is a solid red line for Russian security for over a decade, yet Ukraine's relationships with the West have only been improving. He views a Ukrainian alliance to NATO as the final nail in the coffin to any future chance at Russian exceptionalism, at least under its current political structure. Allied Ukraine is the win condition of NATO in a geopolitical war against Russia, as far as he's concerned. His protests to the UN over the years have been met with complete dismissal, and his subterfuge against Ukraine has been riddled with failure (such as the coup plot that was exposed last year, among others). He genuinely believes invasion to be his final option and sees it as absolutely necessary to the continued existence of Russia in its current form.

In that context, I fully believe he's prepared to make this into a World War. I've seen a lot of people saying ""Putin didn't expect this response,"" but I don't buy that. I think he knew full well what the response would be but viewed it as the only path forward; That he would have to win a game of nuclear chicken for the continued existence of his regime, or ultimately lose Russia one way or another. And for a man who sees no value in a world without Russia, that's not a game of chicken I'm keen to play.

I hope I'm wrong. You're absolutely right that nobody really knows, least of all me. But I do I think people have been way too dismissive of how Putin views the situation with Ukraine.

You can do it if you have a dedicated ground-based system, but that system can only cover a small territory. There are also cluster-like ICBMS with multiple nuclear warheads on-board. Before the ICBM comes anywhere into interceptor range, it splits into multiple separate warheads.

Israel's iron dome misses rockets all the time, and those are drastically slower, and fired over a static system set up to intercept them flying overhead. ICBMs dont fly over, they fly out of and then back into the atmosphere and fall nearly straight down.

Got disable them on the ground or you're fucked. But even if NATO has every ground-based launch site identified, Russia - like the US - has a cache of undetectable nuclear submarines with nuclear ICBM platforms prowling around the seas.

The October 2021 polls delivered a shock to the presidential team. According to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, Zelensky’s approval rating as president dropped from 33.3 percent in September to 24.7 percent in October, separated from Poroshenko’s approval rating by fewer than ten percentage points. The Razumkov Center’s poll demonstrates that Volodymyr Zelensky overtook Petro Poroshenko and now has the biggest “anti-rating” among Ukrainian politicians.
