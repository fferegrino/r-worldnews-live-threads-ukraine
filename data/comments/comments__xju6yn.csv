It also depended on the other side not having limitless resources. Neither of those factors for eventual Russian success are applicable here.

Russian men are going to be slaughtered, beginning with the rural and ethnic minorities in Russia. This partial mobilization is in name only, since poor and rural Russians have pretty much no practical legal recourse to protect themselves with if they ever served their mandatory conscription term. Russia pretty much has a limitless pool of cannon fodder. But cannon fodder alone is not enough, WW1 taught the world that. However, Russia isn’t politically or economically positioned to implement the lessons learned from WW1, and utilized in WW2, to see this through.

Unfortunately, many more Ukrainians are going to have to die now in order to see a Ukrainian victory. That victory comes from a Russian political defeat though.

Russia may be a lot larger than Ukraine, but Ukraine has more than enough men to draw upon, as long as Western economic and military support continues. That support will continue, the US and the West now realize they can destroy Russia with just money. They spent $2 trillion on Afghanistan and Iraq? Russia is worth multiples of that to them.

Day 210 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they fired a lot of missiles at us again. They started at 9:18pm and fired 7-8 missiles total. Out of the first 2 missiles 1 made in to Kharkiv and fell on some garage/warehouse between apartment buildings, thankfully with no casualties. The other missile blew up over Belgorod. Then 3 missiles were intercepted by our air defense, and then another missile also blew up over Belgorod. So out of 7-8 missiles only 1-2 got through this time.

You would think that Russia starting their mobilization should be scary, but everyone here in Ukraine is just laughing at them. This is not WWI, when weapons used now can kill everyone in a grid square it doesn’t matter if they had a hundred or a million troops in that square. A bunch of conscripts with AKs don’t mean anything, they will just die from artillery before ever seeing any of our forces.

It will be interesting to see if the current protests against mobilization will continue or just stop after a week. From what we see they don’t even fight against police, but just let people be taken away one by one. Peaceful protests are completely pointless; unless they fight back it’s over. This is basically their last chance at redemption, if they don’t rise up now, then they never will.

But the real fun stuff will start tomorrow, because allegedly they will start mobilizing people on the streets. There will be police patrols on every street, which will stop cars and take the people to recruitment offices. This is literally LPR/DPR tactics now; they will just take everyone from the streets.

This is Putins last straw. He placed 200k or so of his active military into Ukraine in the attempts of achieving his goals. His ACTIVE military got decimated. 

He knows he can’t declare a “full mobilisation” , I think that would be the tipping point where you’d start to see a civil war develop inside Russia and is basically admitting defeat. One might say this is a clever play-on-words by saying “partial” which consists of conscripts and any “military experience” , which would be just about every male over 18 in Russia due to a mandatory 1 year of military service which has to be done between the age of 18-27.

They also wanted to know the same breakdown in regards to sanctions on Russia.

I also wanted to know these answers so I did some research.

First, in regards to appropriations, the president doesn't matter as much as congress does because they approved / allocated the money to be appropriated.

However, the president does matter in term of implementation of said appropriations and in terms of implementing sanctions (as will be seen below).

&#x200B;

These appear to be the bills passed by congress appropriating money / supplies to Ukraine from 2014 through today:

* STAND for Ukraine Act
* Ukraine Freedom Support Act
* Ukraine Security Partnership Act
* Ukraine Security Cooperation Enhancement Act
* Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act
* Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act
* Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act of 2022
* Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022

Caveat: there is \~180 Billion in security aid for Ukraine prior to Biden that I am not sure who authorized or when.

&#x200B;

**Obama administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>Between 2014 and 2016, the Obama administration committed more than $600 million in security aid to Ukraine.While the Obama administration refused to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons in 2014 to fight Russian-backed separatists, it offered a range of other military and security aid including counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies, according to the Defense Department. The U.S. also pledged 230 Humvee vehicles.  
>  
>In the last year of the Obama administration, the U.S. established the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provided U.S. military equipment and training to help defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million for this initiative.  
>  
>**Sanctions**:  
>  
>Before 2014, the United States had imposed relatively few sanctions on Russia, primarily targeting members of terrorist groups and transnational criminal organizations. However, in response to Russia’s territorial aggression in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States introduced numerous sanctions on Russia, designating 95 entities and individuals involved in Russia’s malign activity in Ukraine in 2014 and an additional 132 designations and 143 designations in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These sanctions made up the vast majority of sanctions on Russia during this time, accounting for 370 of the 429 Russia-related designations from 2014 to 2016, or over 86 percent.

&#x200B;

**Trump administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>The Trump administration in 2017 agreed to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, later committing to sell $47 million in Javelins.  
>  
>In 2017 and 2018, the Trump administration approved DoD and State Department allocations per acts approved in prior years. This amounted to \~250 Million per year.  
>  
>In 2019, Congress passed the ""Ukraine Security Partnership Act"" providing for \~400 million in additional security aid:  
>  
>The $250 million Defense Department’s tranche was set to include sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection and secure communications, night vision equipment, and military medical supplies and treatment. The department previously included counter-sniper equipment, Humvees and tactical drones as well.  
>  
>The State Department funding included $141 million for a broad array of purposes, to buy American-produced weapons through the Foreign Military Financing program, but also to provide advisers and training to boost Ukraine’s NATO interoperability: English language labs, medical equipment and improvised bomb simulators. The funds could also pay for spare parts, sustainment and training for previously purchased U.S. gear.  
>  
>Trump delayed the release of this $391 million congressionally approved security assistance for Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden.  
>  
>**Sanctions**:  
>  
>During the Trump administration, the rate of new sanctions on Russia slowed but took on a broader focus, with new sanctions targeting malign cyber activity, election interference, and Russia’s support for countries like North Korea. For example, new cyber sanctions on Russia-linked entities accounted for 69 designations during the Trump administration. The Trump administration issued 273 designations from 2017 through 2020 on Russia-linked individuals and entities, of which 131, or just under 48 percent, were related to Ukraine.

&#x200B;

**Biden administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>In total, the United States has committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration in January 2021. Since 2014, the United States has committed more than $15.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.Since February 24, 2022, US security assistance committed to Ukraine as of August 24, 2022, has included the following:  
>  
>\- 8 National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems;  
>  
>\- 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)and ammunition;

>  
>\- 126 155 mm and 16 105 mm Howitzers with more than 900,000 artillery rounds;  
>  
>\- 20 120 mm mortar systems and 85,000 mortar rounds;  
>  
>\- 1,500 Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, and laser-guided rocket systems;  
>  
>\- 20 Mi-17 helicopters;  
>  
>\- hundreds of Armored Humvee Vehicles and 40 mineresistant vehicles;

>\- 200 M113 Armored Personnel Carriers;  
>  
>\-10,000+ grenade launchers and small arms;  
>  
>\-communications and intelligence equipment.  
>  
>In addition, the Biden Administration authorized third-party transfers of U.S. defense articles and equipment from several NATO and EU members to Ukraine.  
>  
>**Sanctions**:  
>  
>As of August 24, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has imposed more than 1,500 discrete sanctioning actions on over 800 targets related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, almost 1,000 foreign companies have “self-sanctioned” by shuttering or curtailing their operations in Russia, which has contributed to Moscow’s financial isolation from the global economy.

This is just a license to conscript people as needed. If they are smart (smarter than they have been so far), they'll use the conscripts to staff defenses at things like internal missile silos, where no attack is expected. That frees up real troops to be deployed. They'll also throw a lot of bodies at logistics, rather than the front line. You don't need a lot of training to load trucks. Filling e.g. medical staff shortages will be a LOT harder.

The real hit is economic, with hundreds of thousands of people not turning up to work (whether from conscription or desertion - lot of folk about to go 'long term camping'). Sure, you can mitigate costs by not paying the troops, (seems to be already happening) but you only increase desertion.

If you pick these conscripts from the poorer areas, to avoid the upset caused by angry, privileged Moscow/StP parents, you are hitting areas that have already had heavy recruitment drives. That will decimate local industry and further the 'two Russias' disparity.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 21 September 2022


- On 20 September 2022, officials from Ukraine's Russian-occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions announced they will conduct referendums on accession to the Russian Federation. These referendums follow the Russian Duma's formal recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on 21 February 2022. This urgency is likely driven by fears of imminent Ukrainian attack and an expectation of greater security after formally becoming part of Russia.

- Russian forces in Ukraine continue to experience personnel shortages. The Russia Duma voted on 20 September 2022 to amend a law which extends punishments for defaulting troops. This is likely intended to limit the number of desertions and refusals and thereby to mitigate some of the immediate pressures.

- The Russian civilian and military leadership has faced significant pressure over the last two weeks. These new measures have highly likely been brought forwards due to public criticism and mark a further development in Russia's strategy. Putin is accepting greater political risk by undermining the fiction that Russia is neither in a war nor a national crisis in the hope of generating more combat power.",False,1663739630.0,t3_xju6yn,t3_xju6yn,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

# Decision Tree for Biden If Putin Goes Nuclear

> Matthew Kroenig at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, has summarized some of the options. One answer to a limited Russian nuclear strike is to double, triple or quadruple all the measures the West has already taken against Putin’s regime, completely cutting off Russia from the Western world. Instead of caving, the West would also **send more weapons to Ukraine, and more forces, including nuclear arms, to NATO’s eastern front.**

> The problem is that Putin may not find this response frightening enough to be deterred. He’s already a pariah, and Russians are already aching under sanctions... Another problem is that a restrained response would look woefully inadequate to the Ukrainians and the rest of the world. Kyiv’s friends would lose heart. Dictators such as North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un would conclude that you can go ballistic and survive.

> So **Biden’s response must be more muscular.** He has two military options. One is to **respond in kind, by also deploying a low-yield tactical nuke for show** — in the Arctic Ocean, say, or remote Siberia. Its mushroom cloud would be meant as a Stop sign for Putin. It would also reassure Ukrainians and the world that the US will answer escalation tit for tat — that it’ll enforce the nuclear taboo.

> The problem is that this would turn the confrontation into an apocalyptic staredown, possibly leading to a series of tactical detonations... There would be a risk of Armageddon.

> The better military option is therefore a **conventional US strike on Russian forces**. The target could be **the exact base that launched the nuclear strike**. Or it could be **Russian troops in Ukraine**. 

> This would signal to Ukraine and the world that any breach of the nuclear taboo will be punished. And the message to Putin would be that he can’t escalate to de-escalate, because the West will step in to defeat him.

Russia barely trains its troops before sending them to units.  They rely on the units to train them.  So they will probably send the troops to the front asap.

We expect no tanks or artillery with them, just infantry.   

The new troops will be worthless in combat at first.  They will get training and experience over time so they will eventually get to be as good as the rest of Russia's troops - a step above worthless.

An influx of untrained,  conscripted troops will probably reduce morale of Russian units.  It will also make them harder to supply.

----------------------------

As Ukraine turns a corner and Putin's war continues to fail spectacularly, the strong-man is realizing that his perception domestically is waning. The only thing ""strong-men"" have is the perception of strength and the fear they instill. When that begins to slip, it's always the end for despots like this.

So what is one to do but what strong-men always do? Double-down on tyranny: (1) Recruit more for the meat-grinder. (2) Widen domestic assassinations, (3) Renew propaganda both domestically and abroad (more hollow threats).

Putin is desperate. As we can see with flights leaving Russia, the brain-drain has just accelerated. Any Russian with a modicum of intelligence, empathy, and foresight is *out of there*—ironically to the benefit of many of the countries for which Putin hates.

It coincided with the Belarus migrant crisis. But somehow, possibly due to the Covid situation that was getting worse in Russia between June to January. It seems to have been delayed and eventually they had to wait for the end of the Olympics to not over shadow the Chinese's Olympics.

Suddenly the amount of people sick with Covid drastically fell since the 24th of February. Which is rather strange.

In theory the Russian army was supposed to be 100% vaccinated. But the overall population only has 58% people with 1 vaccine and barely more than 50% of the population with 2 or more shots. And that's not considering that you need multiple shots to keep the immunity high enough.

Now that Russia is mobilizing people in its forces. It's quite possible that about 50% of the mobilized people aren't properly immunized against Covid.

Somehow, the reported amount of new case has been increasing in Russia since end of July.

Now imagine you're sending people that aren't properly immunized to a front where they'll have issue catching their breath in case they get sick. I doubt being in the army, they'll be able to maintain distances to not contaminate each others.

I'll further will explain why this is relevant on the world stage and Ukraine:

- Giuliani (Trump's lawyer) gave an interview at start of conflict, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Observe Sean Hannity praising Putin's manliness while denigrating Obama for wearing a bicycle helmet while, dare I say it, riding a bicycle](https://youtu.be/timvZTKr5HQ)

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO (more on this).

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow (On July 4th) and met with their government officials in a closed-door meeting.

US midterm elections are just around the corner. If you're American, please Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year.

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

Clearly it solves some problems for them, but it won't make them win the artillery duel (except perhaps through sheer numbers?), fix their broken command structure, poor morale, mediocre equipment, achieve air superiority or make their logistical issues disappear.  

In other words, it seems more like a ""reset"" to the second phase of the conflict (after the retreat of Russia from Kyiv), where Ukrainians were forced to defend against superior man and firepower. Except now the Ukrainians actually have a lot more tools at their disposal to counter the Russians, as well as their own force generating pipeline.

Let talk about all the scenarios where Putin is dumb enough to use a nuke.

Putin knows that the ONLY guaranteed outcome will be him being dead.

If it’s a small tactical nuke, he’ll only die from conventional weapons.

If it’s bigger, he’ll die along with the everyone else within 1km of him in a tactical nuclear strike.

In both of these scenarios NATO invades and Russia ceases to exist as an independent country. It won’t be troops on the ground. It will be all in the air, and the action won’t stop until Russia is not able to fight back with any weapon, nuclear or otherwise.

If it’s multiple larger nukes, Russia is dead and burning before they hit the ground and we are all screwed.

And the only people who will bear the ongoing responsibility for this are the Russians, who will have shown the world they do not have the ability to have their own country. 

At best Russia will be broken up. Otherwise they’ll all be dead anyway.

They certainly will not be allowed to have nukes ever again.

Considering that the option to terminate Ukraine, at the moment, isn't on table because a) even their internal opinion is against it b) even China would turn on them; their only option is to stop the war with the least damage possible to their economy and image, which means to gain something out of this mess that could try to explain so many deaths and money being wasted. This is only possible if Ukraine and its allies are willing to concede something and at the moment there really wasn't a real pressure to do.

What Russia really needs now is therefore something to create pressure, something that could give us an excuse to sit a table with them and help Putin not losing his face in regards to his people. This partial mobilization is the smallest step Putin can do at the moment to increase the stakes, he wants to tell us that he is willing to escalate if needed. The question is if we want to willingly believe him and respond to his plead to end this war",False,1663767546.0,t3_xju6yn,t3_xju6yn,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

* Russia would be declared a state sponsor of terrorism.
* Any non-Russian companies that do business with Russia would be given a period of time to finish up all business with Russia or face sanctions themselves.
* No new contracts with Russian businesses and any existing contracts would be suspended.
* Any companies or countries caught trying to help Russia circumvent sanctions would face sanctions themselves and for those located in the West criminal charges.
* Any products found to be of Russian origin and not declared as such will result in severe fines and possible sanctions and criminal charges.
* Any countries refusing to implement the sanctions regime will themselves face possible sanctions and severe fines.
* Only items allowed to be exported from Russia would be food or food related products under set prices and amounts.
* Only items allowed to be exported to Russia would be for humanitarian purposes (food or medicine related) with set prices and amounts.

Even just doing the above would likely do even more damage than a nuclear strike on a city or military installation as it would cause the Russian economy to collapse.  Government revenue in the billions would be gone causing it to struggle to pay employees.  Millions of job losses causing the government to struggle to try keep their economy afloat.  It would be devastating to them as their currency and stock market would both collapse.

This could be communicated to Russia in private by the heads of state of major Western countries and their allies but it would let the Russians know if they tried it they would end up with a much bigger disaster than their current war with Ukraine.",1663798047.0,1663797420.0,t3_xju6yn,t3_xju6yn,,0,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Obviously AFU is much better armed and they're defending and reclaiming their country, so they get an advantage there. Their force morale seems a lot better than AFRF soldiers.

I just don't want to see Ukraine falter if Putin decides to resort to human wave/zerg rush tactics. As far as I know (correct me if wrong), Ukrainian manpower is close to maxed out, with every adult male either in the armed forces or territorial defense.

This was a war in which one side (Ukraine) had more manpower, was closing the gap in equipment, and arguably had better intelligence (due to US/NATO help). Now the NATO cupboards are running bare, Europe is getting weary because of the lack of energy, and Russia is going to have greater manpower.

 >Agitprop (; from Russian: агитпроп, tr. agitpróp, portmanteau of agitatsiya, ""agitation"" and propaganda, ""propaganda"") refers to an intentional, vigorous promulgation of ideas. The term originated in Soviet Russia where it referred to popular media, such as literature, plays, pamphlets, films, and other art forms, with an explicitly political message in favor of communism. The term originated in Soviet Russia as a shortened name for the Department for Agitation and Propaganda (отдел агитации и пропаганды, otdel agitatsii i propagandy), which was part of the central and regional committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

It is built to travel over rail near their domestic borders and be deployed to create a massive front that will overwhelm defenses with sheer numbers and overwhelming force of firepower. 

The US built weapons for every imaginable scenario because of paranoia and admittedly unrestrained and unrestricted funds. We even thought of a way to invade Canada, literally our next door neighbor. America's weapons are designed to disrupt an ability to fight on: for example cluster bombs are war crimes and shit but they're designed to tear up runways to prevent enemy aircraft from taking off. Aircraft carriers are so the US can show up and smash an entire army before they even get there, hence the size of the fleet. 

TLDR the Ukranians are using American equipment exactly how it was designed to be used: to disrupt supply chains and altogether prevent an enemy from fighting back. Russian doctrine about how wars are waged are essentially fighting to maintain a supply line against an army who is using weapons designed to destroy that supply line.

74e8d67e0fca89433597ab99cbc76395,xju6yn,ipchopa,"MLRS (M270), the predecessor to the M142 HIMARS, has been active since 1983. The tech its built on goes back to the 1970s, but I'm sure there have been upgrades to its targeting systems since.   It saw action in the Gulf War (the first one) and is still in use in a handful of NATO countries since it fires the same guided rockets as the M142.

The reason I bring up the M270 is because it was designed and built in the same era as the Russian BM-21 Grad.  However, it's targeting system has been upgraded to be able to use the same rockets used in the M142, or the rockets already existed and the M142 was built to use those.  Either way, the tech is rockets, not necessarily in the vehicle (yes, there is tech in the tank/truck shooting the missiles, but once they rockets launch they aren't guided by the shooting vehicle any more).  So the price per M31 GMLRS is a lot more than the launch vehicle.  And that tech is expensive and has only been around since the mid 2000s.

With the USSR collapsed and split, Yeltsin shifted the Russian economy to a consumer goods based economy not a military economy (something like 20-25% of the USSR's GDP was spent on defense).  
And prior to the collapse most of the military tech companies were/are located in Ukraine.  So a lot of the components to make those rockets were never developed domestically because the companies that could make were making more money on consumer goods or were in Ukraine.

So the 1990s and early 2000s were the perfect storm for Russian military tech falling behind NATO.  The computerization and advanced communication that came around because of the Gulf War,  and the advancements of those due to the Balkans conflict (form NATO's perspective), Iraq War, Afghanistan, Libya, etc. have left Russia two or three generations behind.  They only started to try to catch up in the 2010s.

If you aren't even willing to risk the anger of Ukraine's allies by killing a few people you certainly aren't going to risk their anger by detonating a nuclear weapon. The reason they didn't execute them is Russia knows it will only escalate the conflict with the EU and NATO and Putin doesn't want more support for helping Ukraine in those countries. Now imagine how much that support would go up if Russia used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine? Imagine the anger?

So if Putin won't even risk an execution or two he certainly isn't thinking about using nukes. Just like the threat to execute foreign fighters in the first place it's an empty threat because Putin does not want to deepen western involvement in the conflict any more than they always are.

At this point I think Putin  just wants to see if partial mobilization can stop Russia losing occupied territory  and try and and keep what he's got. Now of course Ukraine and its allies aren't going to stop just because Putin wants them too but I think Putin just wants to keep what he has in the Donbass and keep the land bridge to Crimea and try and freeze the conflict which isn't going to work.",False,1663781148.0,t3_xju6yn,t1_ipcsq7e,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Hence, they could not legally call up reserves or send conscripts and any volunteers could leave once there contracts were up. This is why they kept calling the conflict in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" because legally it was not a war.

 Lots of countries have loop holes like this so they can commit some or all of there standing military to handle sudden or minor military conflicts without having to go through the full legal process of declaring war. An example would be the United States intervention in Syria, no formal war was declared by Congress but troops were still fighting there.

Russia declaring mobilization means that they are now able to call up reservists, anybody who served in the armed forces who is under 50 years old, to fight. they can also send conscripts soldiers into the conflict, a group who was previously exempt from going, though some ended up there anyway, and any volunteer/contract soldiers can have there contracts extended indefinitely until the war is over. 

Basically, Russia now legally has the ability to commit it's total manpower reserves to the war should they desire.

The actual usage would be of Russian conscripts, which Putin is technically not allowed to use outside of Russia's territory. So if parts of Ukraine suddenly get declared to be Russian territory, Putin can use conscripts in those territories probably to shore up his troops (a big reason for why the Kharkiv counter offensive was so effective was because the Russians literally had no actual forces capable of defending that huge frontline) so in **theory,** Russia would be able to use conscripts for defensive operations in the occupied territories which may allow them to free up some of their more capable professional units to continue offensive operations.

I have no idea if they would free up enough men to go for another attempt at Kyiv. I doubt it to be honest. If they weren't able to take it in the initial assault back in February, where they had the majority of their combat forces still in fresh conditions, against an opponent that was caught mostly by surprised (Ukraine hadn't even mobilized by the time Russia invaded), I find it doubtful that they would be able to get enough troops to take it now.

What this means is that Russia is trying to beef up the size of its combat forces with more specialists in order to fill the roles necessary make them effective in combat.

The problem is that a lot of the low hanging fruit has probably already been plucked. Russia has been trying to entice the most experienced veterans back into military service since they first began running into serious manpower issues with varying degrees of success.

Another problem they have is that even if they do scoop up a bunch of reservists of all different kinds of categories, Russia has never really had the resources to maintain the readiness of their reserve forces to an adequate degree. They didn't get serious about building up an active reserve until late last year, which is pretty recent as far as these things are concerned. But even for the people who haven't been out of the military all that long, it's going to take time and remedial training to shake the rust off. Time that they're probably not going to have.

Thirdly, just because individual veterans might have retained a reasonable degree of readiness, that doesn't mean you can just take a bunch of them and cobble together a formation overnight.

It still won’t help you if they hit you back harder or pull out a weapon to hurt you. It’s functionally just committing to something more than you did before. 

Russia started this war but they only [half-committed](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1497993363076915204?s=46&t=7koPRTHC8H6jG9I__ieYnw) to it. Russia did this because they expected an easy victory like in 2014 or the other times Russia has overthrown a neighbor’s government like in 1968. 

By April, it was clear that wouldn’t happen so Russia switched to its classic tactic of massive artillery bombardments and infantry attacks to grind down a stubborn opponent. This tactic worked really well in the Winter War and against Hungary. Again, however, it didn’t work as Ukraine has something that neither of those countries had, allies sending tons of weapons to replace what Ukraine had lost. 

However, Russia still assumed they could eventually grind Ukraine down as there was no way Ukraine could mount a successful offensive. Then the Kharkiv offensive happened along with the Kherson offensive. The Kherson offensive must be really galling for Russia as it’s basically running Russia’s favorite tactics against them. These two offensives made it very clear that if Russia stayed only half-committed to this war, they were going to lose. 

Now Russia had two options. They could surrender and start peace negotiations, but it would probably be the end of Putin. The other tactic would be to finally declare war and actually mobilize, hoping that fully committing to the conflict and escalating its severity might be enough to eke out a win against Ukraine. If Putin could eke put a win, or would save his skin and power, while he is done for if he surrenders or loses, which leads us to today’s declaration. 

However, it looks increasingly unlikely that fully committing to the war will be enough as Ukraine mobilized first and is arguably better equipped now than Russia was even at the start of the war. Still, it’s the only option that presents a chance of Putin turning around an incredibly bad situation, so he is going for it. It’s probably going to go as well as sending the Baltic Fleet to relieve Port Arthur, just prolonging the war and making the end even more embarrassing, but Putin wouldn’t be the world leader we all know if he didn’t take this sort of gamble.",False,1663786200.0,t3_xju6yn,t1_ipd5jd0,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Giving them a tank they are familiar with, both in operation and in maintenance, is most likely preferable to trying to come to grips with a new tank. They have the expert maintainers, the parts and experience with its capabilities.

Now at some point they will run out of available ones that can be transferred but a couple months ago a Ukranian captain outright said that a couple battalions of leopards would probably do more harm than good right now, he wanted every available T-72 he could get first.

All this is to say just because Westen tanks have not been given yet does not mean Ukriane is running out of tanks, they aren't, and it doesn't mean that there are not already plans in place for when that happens. I find despite plenty of evidence of careful planning by Ukriane's allies so many pretend like people in actual militaries couldn't possibly realize an army needs tanks when they have already ensured hundreds of replacement tanks have already been given.

As for ATCMS it is important to remember that the current GMLRS rockets put a vast amount of Russian occupied territory in range and with Ukriane's advances the amount they cannot strike grows ever smaller. Yes ATCMS would allow some deeper strikes but they won't be able to take out the bridge to Crimea and they cost more per amount of explosive delivered. I do not think they are as much as a game changer as people think they'll be. Search out former General Mark Hertling and his comments on ATCMS for Ukriane for some more depth.

Okay, okay, okay.  Chill.  Everything's going to be fine.  There's a significant distinction between tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.  (Yes, let's avoid using both.). Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to be used *on* the battlefield and, while it's a *nuclear* weapon, it's small and really wouldn't be worth using unless the enemy equipment is concentrated in a small area (2,000 ft radius, or so - 1,000 for heavily armored, really).  That said, as far as *exposed* infantry goes, you'd be looking at 2nd degree burns as far away as about ~~a quarter~~ *three quarters of a* mile from the blast.  (Edit: my bad).

The problem is fallout, and while a significant amount of research was conducted on tactical *neutron* weapons, which were much more effective at penetrating armor with lethal doses of radiation with a much smaller yield (like 1/10th to 1/15th of its counterpart) and *far* less physical destruction and fallout, they have been phased out of the US nuclear arsenal...

Considering the fact that there have been reports of Russia scrapping parts of it's Arctic icebreaking fleet, and that one of the only remaining units with truly modern Russian armor is used exclusively for military parades, I would argue that Russia cannot equip 300k troops well enough to rival Ukrainian military power at this point.

Can they get those soldiers to the front and fighting in an effective way?


Theoretically yes, they can. The problem is that it would have been tremendously easier 7 months ago before Ukraine started shooting at Russian logistics and transportation infrastructure and before thousands of parents started asking why they hadn't heard from their children in months. 


Also keep in mind that these initial troops are going to be recently retired professional soldiers and conscripts.

At that point they could have taken the cowards choice and fled to safety. But they stood and fought, because just like in 2014, they believed the principles of freedom and self determination their country now exists for were worth fighting and dying for and because they trusted their countrymen and women would stand and fight for those principles as well and that together they'd win.

And that is why they stopped Russia's initial invasion cold and it is why they are now handing the slave nation to the east a  humiliating beating.

Russia wanted a referendum that could pass for legitimate if you squinted at it like Crimea’s was. However, it is now very clear that they can’t get that.

Anything further than the threats in either scenario probably results in a full or limited nuclear exchange. Same thing if Russia targets a NATO city with a nuke (incredibly unlikely).

Peter the Great, for instance, forcefully cut beards off and built a city on death and bones, thinking probably ""oh that's what we need to prosper, duh!"" - this kind of crap has been just as plaguing as the tyranny, really, because making misinformed and misjudged decisions can be more of a harm rather than the complete lack of such decisions.

But yeah, we've pretty much spent our entire history oppressed and crushed, living in a very clear division between the higher class (now the politicians/officials) and the lower one (everyone else, basically, unless you know the right people). To be very honest, looking at the protests and attempts we've had and made since the late USSR and its fall, I'd say we're making progress and getting there, but evidently, the Russian power likes some brutality up their sleeve. More importantly, for the past 20+ years we've had a KGB cunt for the ""president"", so there's little difference between now and what we've had before. Obviously, Putin is a much worse leader than anyone else before him for one simple reason: he's a stupid fucking criminal crook and that's about it, he never cared for politics or people and he's much worse at it than anyone before him ever was, which is exactly why he's been such a disaster. Well, that's not the only reason, of course.

And while we may value things very similarly to the West and such (there's been research and charts on the matter, can't remember any now), we do have a different boiling point. Again, I think it's been going down lately, but Putin really tried and made it difficult to protest and shit, and of course the ever-present siloviki happily help as if they're not fucked just the same.

France held territories across the Pacific Islands, Africa,  South Asia and multiple allied countries in Western Europe.

 >In project management, a death march is a project which participants believe to be destined for failure, or that requires a stretch of unsustainable overwork. The project marches to its death as its members are forced by their superiors to continue the project, against their better judgment. The term originated in the field of software development, and has since spread to other fields. Death marches are usually a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling or feature scope, and often result from a lack of appropriate documentation, relevant training, or outside expertise needed to complete the project.

I've read about three 'leftist' academics, and only one of them really condemns Russia on the level that is appropriate. Slavoj Žižek, Noah Chomsky, Richard Wolff. Only Žižek really makes his position clear.

A lot of leftist analysis seems to boil down to how USA/NATO is responsible for all matter of things, and that also in this they are at fault. There is usually a short mention of 'oh, Russia also bad', etc. and then move on to more analysis of how west is bad.

I don't know about the ideas of uber-conservatives, but they have similar views in regards to Russia. Funny how leftists will quote someone like Kissinger in their analysis, and rightists will quote Chomsky or someone.

That said, those might be extremes; better to think in general sense. In that the left is more supportive of Russia, or perhaps it would be better to say they are less 'aggressive' towards Russia. I'm speaking from EU perspective. The biggest critics of Russia seem to be Christian Democrats(center-right), the biggest supporters are ultranationalist populists(far-right) and various communist parties(far-left). I don't know about the ultranationalist ideas, but for the far-left it really seems to be about some misplaced connection to USSR even though Russia is nothing like that. The simpler explanation is that both of these camps are financed by Russia which is something they've been doing forever, so maybe there's nothing ideological going on.",False,1663751688.0,t3_xju6yn,t1_ipb34yl,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Russia does not have a culture of collective agency. They simply do not believe it's possible for the people to make a difference. Because anyone who rises to the top will simply act like their predecessors did. Putin, the Soviets and the Tsars all worked hard to convince the Russian people that they couldn't do anything. Putin has doubled down on that propaganda for the last two decades, they look at democracy as a farce. Culturally they genuinely believe ""Everyone is the same"" and that other democracies work exactly like Russia does.


Conversely, the Arab Spring was building on decades of work by populist movements (ironically often funded by the Soviet Union) to teach the people of the Middle East that they do in fact have collective agency. That they have the right to pick their leaders. They also pulled from a highly educated population. Often populations that had already seen anti-colonial revolutions work in their parents' times. 


Now, I'm not saying that at the individual level this is 100% true, but it's important to recognize that a revolution is a collective level action.

People didn't die by the thousands, and certainly not by the millions.  There were negative effects, a sharp increase in thyroid cancer for one, but not so many immediate deaths.

To get to the millions dead from the side effects of nuclear bombs, rather than the massive direct explosions/shock waves, you'd need to be launching more than a few tactical nukes, probably needing to get into the high hundreds of the big bombs enough to cause a nuclear winter.  That could happen if we get a WW3 level exchange, which could happen once we get into the unknown territory of Russia using nukes in Ukraine.  


I do agree with your final conclusion though, that Putin won't risk it.  He really doesn't know what the west will do if he uses nukes on Ukraine, and the west can't really just let him do that, just as we'd have to react to pretty much any use of nukes in anger from any country.

South America is widely recognised as having some of the most progressive legislation in the world with regard to transgender rights.

Transgenderism has a long history in Hindu and Buddhist cultures/mythologies as a consequence of which trans people have long had some degree of recognition and acceptance in the likes of India and Thailand even if the legal situation and modern-day discrimination is more murky.

Even in some Islamic countries, transgenderism has been accepted for much longer than it has in the West.  Iran of all places has permitted trans people to change their legal gender for over forty years and the state pays half of the cost of surgeries etc; as a consequence, it is often a destination of choice for westerners seeking sexual reassignment surgery from renowned experts.  Change of legal gender is also possible in Pakistan and Jordan.

Japan has permitted trans people to change legal gender for the past 20 years.  China for the past 10.  In South Korea, it is possible to be recognised not only as the new gender but as *having been born* of that gender—even without undergoing surgery.

Most of Europe recognises the ability to change legal gender.

Africa is the laggard, but there are still rays of hope.  South Africa recognises change of legal gender; and the courts in Botswana have ordered the government to recognise such changes also.",1663768476.0,1663767796.0,t3_xju6yn,t1_ipbro1m,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Putin's response could be to lean in by spamming more nukes at Ukranian targets, while leveraging NATO intervention as validation for the invasion/escalation and avoiding humiliation; while NATO has to decide in very short order whether to escalate further in what could be then seen as a first strike on Russian territory given the prior limitation that it placed on responding to Russian usage. Despite the overwhelming advantage Russia would still have weeks, probably, to cause devastation before it is finally expelled from Ukrainian territory.

All in all, I think a Ukraine-restricted conventional response could well work in Putin's favour and even worse prove politically advantageous. Threatening destruction of Russia's Ukraine adventure in most circumstance is at best a neutral non-threat - they are going to lose anyway, regardless.

When we went back to Iraq to assist with ISIS it was a lot smaller scale, but people treat these very different time periods as all the same, when they are completely different. We really weren't exhausting much effort after those dates militarily.

The fact that it took another 7 years for Afghanistan to fall is remarkable. People act like it collapsed it months. It definitely collapsed quicker than expected but it wasn't like the US hosed Afghanistan's former government and said peace. They gave them a long time to try and put things together and they couldn't. Our eternal involvement there wasn't relevant geopolitically and not fair to Americans so it was inevitable we'd leave.

Mobilisation changes the stakes. Prison is better than being drafted and very possibly being maimed or dying, you have little to lose at that point. This is why Putin was so afraid of mobilising.

They could create a type of preliminary NATO membership that would be under NATO's nuclear umbrella. The only thing that would prevent tactical strikes in Ukraine would be knowing that a response would happen by NATO.

 >The M-28 or M-29 Davy Crockett Weapon System was a tactical nuclear recoilless smoothbore gun for firing the M388 nuclear projectile, armed with the W54 nuclear warhead, that was deployed by the United States during the Cold War. It was the first, and, at the time, the most important project assigned to the United States Army Weapon Command in Rock Island, Illinois. It remains one of the smallest nuclear weapon systems ever built, with a yield of 20 tonnes of TNT (84 GJ). It is named after American folk hero, soldier, and congressman Davy Crockett.

They're not in NATO. The point of NATO is to defend NATO, there is no mechanism for jumping to the defence of another in this manner. 

>How are they going to be returned if NATO is too scared to attack them because it will be a declaration of war on Russia?

Again, NATO aren't declaring war on anyone, that's not what NATO does. 

Russia is already losing to Ukraine, and more weaponry is on the way. Russia can arm as many cityfolk with pitchforks as they want, Ukraine is better equipped and trained at this point. 

>Massive sanctions that have done... what? I spoke to a friend who lives in Russia, he said the only thing that has changed in his life is that he can't get Spotify anymore.

That anecdote is lovely and all, but Russia's GDP has contracted this year, and is expected to continue to do so. Economically, the damage is being done, and their currency reserves will run dry sooner than later if they keep on with this. It's also limited their ability to produce new high tech weaponry, which is a major concern for their armed forces, and a big part of why Ukraine is getting the upper hand in the war. 

>Their military is supposedly in shambles but they are still pressing the offensive, what do you think is going to happen when Russia runs out of steam?

Russia is running out of steam, that's the problem. Since the initial offensive, it has been a pattern of Russia throwing everything at small gains, only to lose large chunks of territory rapidly. It happened with the loss in the battle of Kyiv, and now in the loss at Kharkiv. Ukraine has crossed the Oskil, and Kherson remains a concern for Russia to defend. 

Mobilisation, notionally, fixes the manpower issue for Russia, but not the logistics, training or equipment issues. Russia can keep throwing bodies at the sunflower fields, but with close to 60k dead already, and many times that incapacitated, with all the equipment losses involved in that, it's hard to see this going well for Russia from here.

> Sanctions are causing Russia serious economic pain, which is likely to grow stronger. However, generating economic pain is rarely enough to cause a shift in a country’s behaviour.
