Day 28 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

These past couple of days have been relatively quiet, we mostly hear our own artillery, sometimes hearing incoming shelling. When you just look at the horizon you can see flashes from explosions in the distance, the sky is completely black with no street illumination, so each one of them lights it up, explosions are so far away that the sound never even reaches us. If those weren’t basically flashes of death then I would go as far as to say that they look beautiful, it feels weird even typing this. 

As much as this whole situation is horrific and unimaginable, people still continue to live their normal lives, when today we looked at people’s windows in nearby buildings we saw almost pre-war number of people still living here. We are told to keep our lights turned off but what we see is almost 60-80% of all windows that were lit up before the war are still lit up today, and we don’t know how many more might just keep their lights turned off. 

This is weird as we thought that most people have left, but our own building is basically just as alive as ever, almost every apartment’s has windows that are lit up, meaning that people didn’t leave at all. More than that we see people with their kids just going for walks every day, even with infants in strollers, just around a week ago we saw a little kid on a sled with his parents as if everything was normal.

Also the change in weather has been drastic, it was reaching -10c just a week ago, but now it’s almost too hot to wear a jacket. Now we have close to +20c in the sun and +10-12c in the shadow, the snow is melting extremely fast, half of it is already gone.

Ukraine is increasing pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv. Russian forces along this axis are already facing considerable supply and morale issues.

Ukrainian forces are carrying out successful counter attacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital, and have probably retaken Makariv and Moschun. There is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin.

It is likely that successful counter attacks by Ukraine will disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their own offensive towards Kyiv.

""Syria fails plan to involve militants in the war in Ukraine on the side of Russia
March 23, 2022

On March 22, a meeting took place between the commander of the 8th Brigade in the southern Syrian province of Dera, Colonel Nasim Abu Irra, and General of the Russian Armed Forces Alexander Zhuravlev (acting commander of a Russian group in the southern Syrian provinces).

During the meeting, the Russian general made a clear request to form and provide a list of names and personal information of militants from Abu Irra and the Syrian Defense Forces, who are ready to take part in the war against Ukraine.

The Syrian colonel did not give a clear answer. Instead, he promised to get in touch after ""consulting with other members of the 8th Brigade leadership.""

To date, the Syrian government's previous promises of a systematic supply of mercenaries to the Russian army have not been fulfilled. The promised ""easy walk"" was replaced by reports of fierce fighting and heavy losses of the Russians. Most of the Syrian military is not willing to risk their lives for illusory financial means.

Many people don't know that, but since 2014 there has been a huge volunteer movement that is still helping the Ukrainian military (now especially). Ukrainian government spending has always been ""not ideal"", so many people were and are collecting donations from usual citizens and buying drones, radios - basically any equipment that is possible to buy for a normal person you can imagine. In 2014 it was mostly about getting EVERYTHING for the army. Atm our military didn't even have enough normal boots or uniform, I am not even talking about something more specific. Nowadays each platoon has a DJI copter or something better, bought by volunteers. Infantry thermal vision optics usually are also sponsored by the volunteers.   
  
If interested, you can always check such organisations as ""Come Back Alive"" (they are the biggest, I believe). For a NGO they're big enough not to be interested in any contracts under 1 mln. hryvnas.

Just a series of precision explosions, even hitting targets as they quickly start to move off from the area.

>A rare face-to-face meeting between Russian and US military officials last week led to an ""outburst"" of emotion from a normally stoic Russian general, a ""revealing moment"" that the Americans present believe hinted at larger morale problems in Russia's military, according to a closely held US military readout of what transpired.

...

>The meeting, held at the Russian ministry of defense in Moscow, is a rare instance of Russian and American defense officials sitting down in person since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The readout describes the meeting as tense, with visible signs of stress on the Russian side.

>It makes particular note of the behavior of Russian Major General Yevgeny Ilyin, deputy chief of the main directorate of international cooperation who has a long track record of dealing with American officials. In a break from typical practice, Ilyin spoke with no notes or set talking points, according to the readout.

>As the meeting was breaking up, one US defense attaché ""casually inquired"" about Ilyin's family roots in Ukraine, and the Russian general's ""stoic demeanor suddenly became flushed and agitated,"" according to the readout. The Americans reported Ilyin responded ""yes,"" and said that he was born in Dnipropetrovsk before moving with his family moving to Donetsk, where he went to school.

>But the US officials reported Ilyin then added that the current situation in Ukraine is ""tragic and I am very depressed over it"" -- and then he walked out without shaking hands, according to the readout.
The US team had the sense, according to the readout, that Ilyin stopped just short of accusing US and Ukraine of atrocities against his family. It's not clear what specifically caused them to reach that conclusion, but one of the attachés said, ""The fire in his eyes and flustered demeanor left a chill down the spine.""

>The readout said one of the attaché's jaw dropped, and both Americans reported they had never ""witnessed such an outburst by Russian counterparts at an official meeting.""

>US meetings with Russian officials are typically scripted affairs. While it's not clear from the summary what precisely led to Ilyin's reaction, the two US defense attachés who attended the meeting assessed the general's reaction as a possible sign of morale problems.

>""At the very least, it is clear that morale problems among Russian forces are not limited to front-line troops,"" the readout concludes.

China's aviation industry took a huge hit from Russian stupidity.

There is another angle, that Chinese fighter exports were being choked by Russian exports because Russian MIGs and other jets had a good reputation and nations already had logistics to fix them. Chinese jets have no reputation.

So going forward its in China's best interest to not get involved, and slide into other nations DMs who are now disillusioned with Russian weaponry's failure in Ukraine.

Russia being hesitant to use their ""good"" equipment also casts doubt on its quality if desperate Russia would rather use a Maxim from 1910 than their new stuff.

an excerpt:

>**BRUSSELS — The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — frustrated by his lack of progress in Ukraine or determined to warn Western nations against intervening in the war — unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.**

>**The Tiger Team, as the group is known, is also examining responses if Mr. Putin reaches into NATO territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. Meeting three times a week, in classified sessions, the team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighboring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades.**

>**Those contingencies are expected to be central to an extraordinary session here in Brussels on Thursday, when President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other NATO nations, who will be meeting for the first time — behind closed doors, their cellphones and aides banished — since Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.**

>**Just a month ago, such scenarios seemed more theoretical. But today, from the White House to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, a recognition has set in that Russia may turn to the most powerful weapons in its arsenal to bail itself out of a military stalemate.**

----

>**As Mr. Biden flew to Europe on Wednesday, both he and Mr. Stoltenberg warned of growing evidence that Russia was in fact preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.**

> The readout describes the meeting as tense, with visible signs of stress on the Russian side. **It makes particular note of the behavior of Russian Major General Yevgeny Ilyin, deputy chief of the main directorate of international cooperation** who has a long track record of dealing with American officials. In a break from typical practice, Ilyin spoke with no notes or set talking points, according to the readout.

> **As the meeting was breaking up, one US defense attaché ""casually inquired"" about Ilyin's family roots in Ukraine, and the Russian general's ""stoic demeanor suddenly became flushed and agitated,"" according to the readout. The Americans reported Ilyin responded ""yes,"" and said that he was born in Dnipro before moving with his family moving to Donetsk, where he went to school.**

> **But the US officials reported Ilyin then added that the current situation in Ukraine is ""tragic and I am very depressed over it"" -- and then he walked out without shaking hands, according to the readout.**

> The readout said one of the attaché's jaw dropped, and both Americans reported they had never ""witnessed such an outburst by Russian counterparts at an official meeting.""

> **The US team had the sense, according to the readout, that Ilyin stopped just short of accusing US and Ukraine of atrocities against his family.** It's not clear what specifically caused them to reach that conclusion, but one of the attachés said, ""The fire in his eyes and flustered demeanor left a chill down the spine.""

> The Russian general did not deviate in the discussions from the win-at-all-costs Russian strategy of the invasion of Ukraine, according to the readout. In this instance, the two Americans believe **they witnessed a Russian general who was ""clearly in distress over the situation but who had nowhere to project his anger except in line with Kremlin's state sponsored narrative,""** according to the readout.

> **""At the very least, it is clear that morale problems among Russian forces are not limited to front-line troops,"" the readout concludes.**

All companies that transact with it and transport it from the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will be subject to secondary sanctions. We are talking about transactions with physical gold, as well as trading it in any ""paper"" or ""electronic"" way. The bill could be passed as early as this week.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov

>On 27 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a group of 11 United States Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph located the diesel-powered, nuclear-armed Foxtrot-class submarine B-59 near Cuba. (The B-59 was one of four Foxtrot submarines sent by the USSR to the area around Cuba.) Despite being in international waters, the United States Navy started dropping signaling depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. There had been no contact from Moscow for a number of days and, although the submarine's crew had earlier been picking up U.S. civilian radio broadcasts, once B-59 began attempting to hide from its U.S. Navy pursuers, it was too deep to monitor any radio traffic. Those on board did not know whether war had broken out or not.[6][7] The captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.[8]

>**Unlike the other submarines in the flotilla, three officers on board B-59 had to agree unanimously to authorize a nuclear launch: Captain Savitsky, the political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and the chief of staff of the flotilla (and executive officer of B-59) Arkhipov. Typically, Soviet submarines armed with the ""Special Weapon"" only required the captain to get authorization from the political officer to launch a nuclear torpedo, but due to Arkhipov's position as chief of staff, B-59's captain also was required to gain his approval. An argument broke out, with only Arkhipov against the launch.[9]**

TL;DR at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis a Soviet Sub Captain who had lost contact with Moscow thought that war had broken out and authorized the launching of nuclear missiles. On that sub three men had to agree to launch, two of them did but Arkhipov, despite some extreme pressure did not. (this sub JUST HAPPENED to need three men to approve, if it was any other sub they would have launched) The sub would later surface and realize nuclear war had not broken out, but it would have with them. Arkhipov stopped the Cuban Missile Crisis from turning into a nuclear exchange, and probably saved the world in the process.",False,1648089037.0,t3_tlbh4e,t3_tlbh4e,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

*The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — frustrated by his lack of progress in Ukraine or determined to warn Western nations against intervening in the war — unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.*

[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/biden-russia-nuclear-weapons.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/biden-russia-nuclear-weapons.html)

Paywall; here are excerpts\_

  
The Tiger Team, as the group is known, is also examining responses if Mr. Putin reaches into NATO territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. Meeting three times a week, in classified sessions, the team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighboring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades.  
Those contingencies are expected to be central to an extraordinary session here in Brussels on Thursday, when President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other NATO nations, who will be meeting for the first time — behind closed doors, their cellphones and aides banished — since Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.  
Just a month ago, such scenarios seemed more theoretical. But today, from the White House to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, a recognition has set in that Russia may turn to the most powerful weapons in its arsenal to bail itself out of a military stalemate.  
NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, underscored the urgency of the preparation effort on Wednesday, telling reporters for the first time that even if the Russians employ weapons of mass destruction only inside Ukraine, they may have “dire consequences” for people in NATO nations. He appeared to be discussing the fear that chemical or radioactive clouds could drift over the border. One issue under examination is whether such collateral damage would be considered an “attack” on NATO under its charter, which might require a joint military response.  
The current team was established in a memo signed by Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, on Feb. 28, four days after the invasion began, according to the officials involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning. A previous iteration had worked for months, behind the scenes, to prepare the U.S. government for the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
(...)  
Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday that if Mr. Putin used a weapon of mass destruction — chemical, biological or nuclear — “there would be consequences” even if the weapon’s use was confined to Ukraine. Mr. Reed said radiation from a nuclear weapon, for instance, could waft into a neighboring NATO country and be considered an attack on a NATO member.  
“It’s going to be a very difficult call, but it’s a call that not just the president but the entire NATO Council will have to make,” Mr. Reed told reporters, referring to the governing body of the Western alliance.  
“The bottom line is this is a NATO decision,” Mr. Reed said. “It won’t be the president’s decision alone. I don’t think he’d want to take action unilaterally.”  
(...)  
A senior administration official said any use of a “small” tactical nuclear bomb by Russia — even inside Ukraine and not directed at a NATO member — would mean that “all bets are off” on the United States and NATO staying out of the war. But when pushed, the official declined to lay out the responses under discussion.  
The official said American and NATO intelligence communities had not seen any activity by Russian military officials that suggested preparations to use a nuclear weapon. But he said that during internal discussions, administration officials were urging caution, because there was more at stake than just Ukraine.  
(...)  
“He will get Article 5,” Mr. Pabriks said, in a reference to the NATO pledge that an attack on one alliance member is an attack on all.  
“If he gets that, basically that would also make us involved in Ukraine,” Mr. Pabriks said, adding: “He has no way out of that. So I don’t think he should be so stupid.”

I think biological can just be taken off the table. 

Chemical weapons deserve a proportional response possibly involving the direct destruction of Russian units in Ukraine.

Nuclear weapons are go time. A full scale conventional invasion of Ukraine and elimination of all Russian military units. Any nuclear response must be met with the same.

Belarus's entire military is about a third of the size of Russia's invasion force alone, and they have worse equipment, logistics, and training. Their involvement in the war would be about as tide-turning as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion has been, because they probably would not be able to send more than 10K of their worst soldiers.  The number of foreign fighters and expat reservists who have returned to Ukraine already triples that. 

Also, Belarus is constantly on the cusp of an insurgency/civil war, and Lukashanka probably does not want to let any of his military go and also give the opposition a reason to react. 

I don't hate CNN for political reasons, and they do have some excellent on the ground war correspondents, but their TV show and their website are designed to make people as *worried* as possible and to get people to keep watching and coming back to check ""did that ever end up happening?""

(Dossier fellow)

he says:

* Naryshkin (Foreign Intelligence) almost assuredly knew the devastating impact of Russian invasion, even just the announcement of the two republics.  Specifically, that Ukraine would not cave, no shadow government subservient to Kremlin would take over, and the financial/economic ramifications would be dire for Russia.  That intelligence professionals live in the real world, so he knew what Ukraine was like.  Naryshkin tried to relay, but Putin did not want to hear it.

* that this was kept so secret, that safeguards weren’t put in place, namely, financial.  Their money is abroad, and now no access, and the relevant heads of Russian financial sector can’t even remedy.

* it will likely end with Putin being removed from power.  Will end up with Russia realizing hasn’t won, though could take a long time before realization.

* goal is to grab as much land as can, so better hand in eventual negotiations. 

* Chabais (?) who is reported to have left matters.  Technocrats—bc Putin has always relied on them to help run country. 

* the “oligarchs that matter” are the ones that are the ones that are called “the princelings.”  Examples are Sevchin, Bortnikov’s son, other “juniors,” that I’ve now forgotten—these people have high positions of power now, they know what’s going, the catastrophic consequences, and are going to be key to pushing Putin out. 
EDIT:  Steele says the key to ending the conflict is to get “those around Putin” to come back to reality.  [He’s likely referring to Bortnikov and Patrushev—who are both raging conspiracy theorist, who really want to believe the reality they pretend to be true, really is.]

*sidenotes:*
There are several intelligence heads—Bortnikov, Patrushev, Naryshkin, and also Shoigu has a intelligence group.  These four are like cast members on reality tv—constantly making alliances, going behind each other’s backs, sabotaging each other.  They try to ingratiate themselves w Putin, get him to eliminate the other’s agency and let their agency absorb it.  Bortnikov and Patrushev are closest to Putin, been friends since the 90s. They gang up to sabotage Shoigu, but also undermine each other (including some bizarre poisoning Putin accusations!). Naryshkin is the odd man out—he attempts to stay above the antics.

12 days ago, Ukrainian Intelligence said that Russia would either bomb nuclear rod storage or burn down the exclusion zone forests to create a massive radioactive smoke cloud. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tcb7ru/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i0cgzz6?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Well, it looks like Russia has chosen to burn down the forests. Currently, there are forest fires in the exclusion zone, Russia destroyed the local monitoring stations, and the fires continue. To quote the IAEA: 

""Earlier today, Ukraine’s regulatory authority informed the IAEA that firefighters were trying to extinguish wildfires near the Chornobyl NPP, an area which has seen such outbreaks also in previous years. The fire brigade from the town of Chornobyl has extinguished four fires, but there are still ongoing fires. The local fire station does not currently have access to the electricity grid, the regulator said. In the meantime, the station is relying on diesel generators for power, for which fuel is required, it added. The NPP site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located, continues to have off-site power available.

The regulator informed the IAEA last week that it was closely monitoring the situation in the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone ahead of the annual “fire season” when spontaneous fires often occur in the area, still contaminated by radioactive material from the accident 36 years ago next month. Russian forces took control of the site on 24 February.

In today’s update, it said “fire events” were registered in the area of the Chornobyl NPP’s Exclusion Zone. In the Exclusion Zone, the regulator said radiation measurements are not currently being performed. It said slight increases in caesium air concentrations had been detected in Kyiv and at two NPP sites west of Chornobyl, but the regulator told the IAEA that they did not pose significant radiological concerns. The IAEA is continuing to engage with the regulator to obtain further information about the fire situation.""

> 
> **KEY FACTS**
> 
> * Along with KitKat and Nesquik, Nestle is suspending other brands it deems non-essential in Russia, the company said in a statement, but will continue to sell “essential” products such as infant food in Russia.
> 
> * The company said it would donate any profit it makes in Russia to humanitarian relief organizations, though it noted it didn’t expect to turn any profit.
> 
> * Nestle, which previously announced it would stop all advertising and investment in Russia and end “non-essential” Russian imports and exports, has pointed to not turning a profit in Russia as its reason for continuing certain Russian operations previously.

Further, it appears Russian forces are digging in on these fronts, perhaps to buy time.  If RU has a goal of taking the full coastline of Ukraine (I know Odesa will be tough and they haven't done well in Mykolaiv to date) and also possibly expanding their borders in the east for the two seperatist regions, they dont have much farther to go.

IF Russia manages to hold that territory (and one would assume they are in a rush to do so, due to economic, political, and troop loss reasons), I wonder if they then try to offer terms that allow them to keep the controlled territory?

Russia won't accept Dollar or Euros in exchange for its gas delivered to to Europa, Putin says. Instead bills will only be able to be paid in Rubles. This is, according to the stock market expert of the ARD (German public broadcaster) Anja Kohl, the first counter sanction of the Kreml. Putin is expected to test with it how far the West is willing to go.

Original text:

>!20:39 Uhr ""Die erste große Gegensanktion Putins"" !<

>!Russland wird nach Angaben von Staatschef Vladimir Putin für seine Gaslieferungen nach Europa künftig keine Zahlungen in Dollar oder Euro mehr akzeptieren. Stattdessen sollen Rechnungen nur noch in Rubel beglichen werden können. Laut ARD-Börsenexpertin Anja Kohl ist das die erste Gegensanktion des Kreml. Putin wolle damit testen, wie weit der Westen zu gehen bereit sei.!<

Comments:

This is actually devilishly clever as it achieves two things:

1. In the case countries in Europe decide to still purchase gas from Russia, their exchange into Rubles will actively undercut sanctions on the Russian central bank (like its freezed foreign currency assets) via increased demand of the Ruble, which will sort of stabilize its decline.  
EDIT (for more calrification): Rubles are difficult to get the moment due to sanctions on the Russian central bank, you either soften or even break the sanctions or will find yourself without the only means Russia accepts for its gas. Contracts may be originally in Euro and Dollar, but where will you go complaining, if they break/change this contract?
2. Divide the West, more precisely in those that require gas and those that don't. Since those that don't will loudly advocate to keep the sanctions working, those that currently plan with the gas will find themselves in between political pressure from abroad and econmoic & public pressure domestically. It is to expected that there will be little understanding (especially in Central Europe) for extended gas trades, while on the other hand instantaneous shifts away from Russian gas seem equally unlikely. Depending on communication and the length of phasing out of Russian gas (anything more than a month will probably be seen as too long) that might fracture the West's unity - possibly impacting their future ability to act in union (a net victroy for Putin).

With the Russian economy collapsing due to outside countries crippling it through sanctions (best solution short of military action) and talk of reparations being paid by Russia to rebuild Ukraine (again, totally justified), does anyone else see parralells between this and the German economy following WW1 (obviously this is not of the same scale in terms of direct military engagement)? Could the Russian people place the blame for their suffering on others instead of their government and become radicalized under someone worse than Putin? The common expression, ""history repeats itself"" is where I am coming from and I hope that this does not give rise to a modern incarnation of what Germany became under Hitler leading to WW2. 

People suffer immensely in Russia due to their own govt being idiotic, they lose the war, their economy does not recover, people get angry, strong man comes in and starts blaming everyone but themselves, people want their problems solved and those they believe caused them punished, more war and chaos ensues causing an even larger scale war.

I have a question for you that may be a bit indelicate, but as someone far removed from the conflict all I have to go on is my assumptions and what I read online, and you are someone that seems as close to the ideal demographic to ask as is possible.

The sentiment that I've gathered from that reading is that support among Ukrainians is high for the idea of ""Zelenskyy should not accept a peace deal that doesn't return the borders to their 1991 positions."". Meaning a return of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.

I'm only asking you to speak your own thoughts, not to ""speak for all Ukrainians"", but what are your opinions on that? Specifically because such a goal almost certainly involves prolonging the conflict.

I consider there being no wrong answer to this, you're involved in the conflict and I'm not. I simply want to get your perspective.

What I read would indicate that there's quite a lot of people who think ""Keep it going for as long as it takes."", but I have no way to tell if that's actually a widespread sentiment or just me drinking the internet's Kool-Aid.

South Vietnam's ARVN was large and equipped with better advanced US weapons, but suffering from poor logistics, bad leadership, and an incompetent ruler.

PAVN started small, taking Phước Long. It was stunning victory many didn't expect. Over the next few months, PAVN began to launch larger and larger attacks, famously at Ban Me Thuot, and South Vietnam collapsed faster then any one expected. 

What we are seeing now is basically the same situation. Ukraine's counter attacks have started small, at Mykolaiv, and around Kyiv, to see if Ukrainian forces are capable of offensive maneuvers. 

IF these smaller attacks are successful, it will give Ukrainians more and more confidence in larger offensive operations, and every loss on Russia's side will compound until the whole thing falls apart.

> Angela Merkel loves Russian. ""It’s a beautiful language,"" she once said. ""very soulful, a bit like music."" She says she learned Russian mainly by talking to Soviet soldiers stationed near her home in the town of Templin during East German times. In fact, 15-year-old Angela did so well in Russian at a school competition that she was awarded a trip to Moscow. While there, she bought an album by The Beatles. Her favorite Russian word is ""терпение,"" which roughly translates as ""tolerance for suffering.""
> 
> 
> Angela Merkel had been fully aware of just how brutal Vladimir Putin could be. She even admitted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had been a ""devil's project."" But why didn't she do anything to change Germany's energy dependence on Russia – and why is her party so quiet about it now?
> 
> Given her ability to speak Russian and her familiarity with Russians from growing up in East Germany, she had been considered in the circle of Western leaders as an expert on the mentality of both the country and Putin. She quickly became something of the go-to person in Europe for negotiations with the Russian leader.

Shifting away from Russian gas also requires significant infrastructure investments.

So there's millions of homes that would need to replace their gas heating, significant LNG terminal capacity to receive enough gas for industrial usage, and so on.

I mean, I think you're - the question I hear you asking is, wait, is there any way to think about this that is just not a total nightmare and the end of the world as we know it? And I can't find it. I mean, the absolute best-case scenario would be some kind of partial victory in Ukraine that would make him declare victory and at least pause for a little bit, and then maybe he will die eventually before blowing up the world, right? That's the best-case scenario.

Ukraine throws the Azov battalion under the bus. There's some evidence that some of the members are neonazis. It's as close as Russia's Nazi claims come to reality.

With Putin's increasing personal frustration over things and the domestic issues that Russia's collapsing economy is causing (or will shortly cause) he's going to be looking for a solution, ANY solution, that will end this.

And sitting unused in his inventories are these various strategic weapons. There are plenty of reasons not to use them, but those reasons have never changed in decades, meanwhile each hour gives him new reasons to consider using them.

Most people hear ""detonate a nuke"" and they IMMEDIATELY declare that NATO/US would launch a counterstrike...but there's zero reason to believe that. It doesn't fit with any game theory scenario that even slightly resembles the situation.

One scenario that will grow increasingly enticing to Putin is the idea of a demonstration detonation. He could, for example, point to Mariupol and drop a bunch of leaflets over the city ""Tomorrow at noon, do not look towards the ocean. A nuclear detonation will occur at a safe distance, the flash can cause blindness."". And then at noon the next day, with people duly informed (and panicking) a small tactical nuke, say 10 kilotons, is detonated offshore. Far enough away that even if the winds blew the radioactive particles into the city, by the time they arrive they are diluted enough that there's no effective rise in background radiation levels, but close enough that everyone in the city can see what happened.

His expectation (read: desperate gambling hope) is that the implication is ""Surrender or the next one will hit you."".

And what would NATO do if this happened? Almost nothing direct. Why? Because Mutually Assured Destruction still exists. If NATO chooses to counter-fire even a single missile at something valuable, Putin can respond in kind. Putin's already threatened nuclear weapons if NATO gets directly involved, and he's just now demonstrated a willingness to use them, even if in a non-destructive manner. My prediction would be that NATO would start handing over more capable AA systems, in the hopes of better allowing Ukraine to shoot down such munitions.

The real question is, what happens next? If Mariupol surrenders, will he provide a demonstration to Odessa? If Mariupol doesn't surrender, does he go through with it? If he does, what does NATO do? Again...no NATO nation was hit, MAD still exists.

Now, my belief is that the largest countermanding reason why this will be pushed off is that China, Russia's only real economic lifeline in the years ahead at this point, has almost certainly told them that the use of nukes will sever that lifeline. After all, a puppet state isn't useful if it's a glowing crater, and while using a nuke in this fashion does not guarantee full bombardments, it brings the world ever closer to that possibility.",False,1648093299.0,t3_tlbh4e,t1_i1vvdp4,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

this map is from a few days ago.  But it appears that there are more than a dozen battalions comprising elements of both the 35th and 36th Combined Arms Armies NW of Kyiv.

It certainly appears that sections of P02 are easily within range of Ukrainian artillery. I'm sure that Ukrainian SOF and partisans are also targeting those heavily.

Imagine if right now he demanded Russia remove its forces from Belarus' borders with a deadline for Russia to exit (something generous like 3 weeks). Putin won't leave willingly obviously, so if he hasn't launched an attack to replace Lukashenko by the ~1.5 week mark in that situation, then Lukashenko's move after is to ask for aid from the West for this purpose. They won't get it of course, not before they start fighting, but it allows the Western politicians over a week to prepare the relevant documents such that if Lukashenko really did pull the trigger, they could immediately begin sending aid packages once it became obvious this wasn't a trick.

He could potentially come out of it looking like a man that eventually did the right thing at great personal risk, make all the right speeches about increasing cooperation and relations with Ukraine as they work against their common enemy, etc.

Russia's doctrine in this situation seems like it would play out as like detonating maybe a 5-10kt bomb in a non-tactical location--basically, blow it up in an empty field as a ""gosh wow we are totally willing to use this, see?!""--and then sue for peace.

I don't think they'd bother with it anyway because:

A) the point of having the weapons is already taken

B) it would irradiate the soil and they've already not got the best track record for that

C) it would risk Article 5 via contamination, which they *really* do not want

D) the west doesn't see it that way; a 1kt weapon is not a 1mt by any stretch , but *politically* they engender the same response (1kt was the Beirut explosion in 2020, 1mt will completely destroy a large city).

E) it may fail.  It takes a *ton* of money to maintain nuclear weapons, and Russia's budget hasn't exactly matched all of this

Now: other WMDs are possible.  Bioweapons--messy and tend to work awfully, most of the money spent on them is spent on prospective defense.

This trial build will cost around 4 billion to produce and will provide enough power for .50% of the US. Terrapower believes the cost will eventually be about 1 billion per plant.

The principle of MAD is still in effect. That means large-scale strategic first strikes are out.

This doesn't imply one would be held to account for using a single tactical nuclear weapon. What would the response be? Do you really think NATO/USA would launch a single nuclear weapon in response? Two? Three? Into Ukraine, or into Russia? Is that response proportional?

If US/NATO would not immediately use a nuke in response, then what would it do? Conventional forces?

This uncertainty around this issue - tactical nuclear weapons - is what Putin is exploiting with his 'nuclear shield'. He is **not** exploiting the MAD doctrine. In fact, he's using the understood agreement about the MAD doctrine around nuclear confrontations to freeze conventional forces to start, by conflating the strategic and tactical uses of nuclear weapons.

>The October 2021 polls delivered a shock to the presidential team. According to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, Zelensky’s approval rating as president dropped from 33.3 percent in September to 24.7 percent in October, separated from Poroshenko’s approval rating by fewer than ten percentage points. The Razumkov Center’s poll demonstrates that Volodymyr Zelensky overtook Petro Poroshenko and now has the biggest “anti-rating” among Ukrainian politicians. What has happened to the once beloved leader?

&nbsp;
Then ...

>My answer: at the midpoint of his presidency, Zelensky himself has destroyed his image as an alternative politician. Here is what he did.

>First, Zelensky and his team started promoting the idea that he was “like any other businessperson in Ukraine.” This statement was repeated by everyone on the presidential team in response to the revelations of Zelensky’s offshore holdings, suddenly exposed in the Pandora Papers.

Partly because in the modern day it's actually fairly easy to make equipment that outstrips your ability to use it. When I worked on radars, there was a variety of features that we knew the hardware could physically handle, but we had no idea how to develop the algorithms to actually make those features happen in real time. The instant those algorithms are figured out though, with a simple software change those features come into existence.

As such electronic warfare is one of those areas. Sure, on the forefront of the bleeding edge, you might be able to package your systems into tighter or more elegant packages, but at the end of the day a photon's a photon. So Russian hardware might potentially be nowhere near as capable as US/NATO kit, but that doesn't mean they can't come up with some fancy math which makes their hardware capable of doing things ours can't.

As a (now) video game developer (turns out making fake missiles/radars pays better than making real ones) one historical example of this was/is volumetric clouds. In short, instead of having an artist custom sculpt out a cloud, you just define a set of volumes and the algorithm comes up with the shapes and figures out how lighting functions (for example, the cloud being back-lit, with the lights showing through the 'thin parts'). It was relatively standard stuff in movie CGI for quite a while because it looks fantastic and it didn't matter in a movie if it took 4 hours to render a single cloud for a single frame. But ~15 years ago if you'd said you wanted to implement volumetric clouds in a ~30 fps video game you'd have been laughed out of the room. And then someone came up with a much more efficient algorithm to do the same thing, and now it's a standard package you can just get and toss into your game.",False,1648091782.0,t3_tlbh4e,t1_i1uh9xo,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

I'm sorry but you have a terribly ignorant understanding of what a nuclear war between Russia and the West would entail. The world would be plunged into nuclear winter and whilst pockets of humanity could potentially survive, human civilisation would certainly collapse. Your comment that ''China would remain untouched"" really showcases how little you understand in this area. There are myriad reasons for this, but the salient point (and really the only one that needs touching upon) is that China is Russia's neighbour and it's population would certainly be annihilated purely on the basis of proximity (fallout, starvation etc.).

There have been many studies that have modelled this, and they're all fairly consistent in their assessment:

Although health care expenditure per capita is higher in the USA than in any other country, more than 37 million Americans do not have health insurance, and 41 million more have inadequate access to care. Efforts are ongoing to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would exacerbate health-care inequities. By contrast, a universal system, such as that proposed in the Medicare for All Act, has the potential to transform the availability and efficiency of American health-care services. Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017). The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households. Furthermore, we estimate that ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68 000 lives and 1·73 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736\(19\)33019-3/fulltext)",False,1648077330.0,t3_tlbh4e,t1_i1uta1l,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

She also met with Bashar al-Assad in the name of “truly caring for the Syrian people,” and has raised scepticism that the regime was behind the 2017 Khan Sheikhoun chemical weapons attack. She has supported the Syrian and Russian regimes in their bombing campaigns on multiple occasions and espouses a narrative that paints the entire armed Syrian opposition as al-Qaeda terrorists, erasing the legitimate call from Syrians for a regime change of their own, and defining the narrative as a US-driven regime-change war.
