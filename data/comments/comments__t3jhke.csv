>The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) prohibits under any circumstances the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions, as well as the assistance or encouragement of anyone to engage in prohibited activities.

...

The unexploded bomblets can remain dangerous for decades after the end of a conflict.

Truss said she would legislate to introduce new powers to prevent Russian banks from clearing payments in sterling, measures that will be applied to Russia’s largest bank Sberbank. There will be a full asset freeze on three additional Russian banks – Otkritie, Sovcombank and VEB.

Legislation will ban the Russian state from raising debt in the UK and Russian companies - more than three million in total - will be prevented from accessing UK capital markets.

There will also be an export ban further imposed across a number of key sectors including microelectronics, marine and navigation equipment.

The transport secretary Grant Shapps said he had written to all UK ports asking them not to provide access to any Russian flagged, registered, owned, controlled, chartered or operated vessels.

Truss reiterated that she had a “hit list” of oligarchs that would face further sanctions and said the UK was also looking to go further than individuals.

She said the UK would “target the families of oligarchs, the people that work for them, the people who support them and the people who enable them,” a hint at the disquiet of the use of London law firms, banks and reputation agencies.

**Becoming a member of the EU is a complex procedure which does not happen overnight.**

*Any country that satisfies the conditions for membership can apply. These conditions are known as the ‘Copenhagen criteria’*

**Must Have**

-Be ready to comply with all the EU's standards and rules

-Having the consent of the EU institutions and EU member states

-Having the consent of their citizens – as expressed through approval in their national parliaments or by referendum.

-Stable institutions guaranteeing democracy,

-The rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities

-A functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU

-The ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union

*A country wishing to join the EU submits a membership application to the Council, which asks the Commission to assess the applicant’s ability to meet the Copenhagen criteria. If the Commission’s opinion is positive, the Council must then agree upon a negotiating mandate. Negotiations are then formally opened on a subject-by-subject basis.*

*Due to the huge volume of EU rules and regulations each candidate country must adopt as national law, the negotiations take time to complete. The candidates are supported financially, administratively and technically during this pre-accession period.*

**These countries are in the process of 'transposing' (or integrating) EU legislation into national law:**

Albania

Montenegro

North Macedonia

Serbia

Turkey

**Potential candidate countries do not yet fulfil the requirements for EU membership:**

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Kosovo

*(Ukraine has not been added yet to a list)*

**Mom:** How are you doing? Why has it been so long since you’ve responded. Are you really in training exercises?

**Soldier:** Momma, I’m no longer in Crimea. I’m not in training sessions.

**Mom:** Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel?

**Soldier:** What kind of a parcel can you send me, mama?

**Mom:** What are you talking about? What happened?

**Soldier:** Mama, I’m in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us, and they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass. They call us fascists.

В Украине идет не специальная операция, а настоящая война, в которой Россия является агрессором. Сражаются не только спецназовцы, а обычные солдаты, русские сыновья и братья. Их погибло уже более пяти тысяч. Их не встречают как освободителей, а как окупантов. И правильно. В Харькове русские войска тяжелой артиллереей обстреливают и бомбят гражданские здания, убивают детей и женщин. В Киеве тоже.

English translation:

In Ukraine a special operation is not being conducted, but a real war in which Russia is the aggressor. The fighters are not just special forces, but regular soldiers, Russian sons and brothers. Over 5,000 of them have already died. They are not recieved as liberators, but as occupiers. And rightly so. In Kharkiv russian forces are using heavy artillery and bombs on civilian structures, killing children and women. In Kiev, too.

This is a disgrace to RUssia. The whole world already declared sanctions, the ruble has fallen completely, airspaces are closed. Everything is the fault of Putin and his gang of thieves.

Go to Google Maps.  

Go to Russia. 

Find a restaurant or business and write a review.   

When you write the review explain what is happening in Ukraine.

It's also very important that you translate your review to Russian and also do not give it a 1 star because you'll be more likely to be viewed as spam/reviewbombing and get your review deleted. Feel free to drop them 4-5 stars. We're not actually trying to attack restaurants there. Just trying to spread the message.

* Support Ukraine militarily, immediately. Everything but boots on the ground, meaning every advanced weapon, intelligence and cyber-capability. It has to be now. If Ukraine falls, Putin will bleed it dry to compensate for sanctions and dig in, as he has in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Victory in Ukraine is also the only way to avoid doing this all again, when Putin needs new targets to distract from the disastrous state of Russia.  

* Bankrupt Putin’s war machine by freezing and seizing Russian assets and access to markets. Kick Russia out of SWIFT and other financial networks, and every international institution.  

* Expose and seize the assets of Putin’s cronies and their companies and families in the free world. Take away their visas and send them back to live in the dictatorship they helped build.  

* Recall all ambassadors from Russia. There is no point in diplomacy or communications with a rogue dictatorship making war. Send the message that isolation will be total until all aggression ceases and Ukraine is made whole.  

* Turn off, shut down and send home every element of Putin’s global propaganda machine. Russia Today and other platforms beam lies and hate into millions of homes in the free world, while Putin maintains total control of the media in Russia.  

* Call out Putin’s lackeys in the free world. The lobbyists, the law firms, the former politicians like German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who chairs two of Putin’s strategically important energy companies. This includes the fifth columnists of all political stripes who side with a dictator for ideology or Russian cash. Why do executives and advertisers tolerate the likes of Tucker Carlson braying Putin propaganda in prime time? Donald Trump and his acolytes in Congress still can’t find a discouraging word for Putin and repeat Russian propaganda blaming NATO and President Biden even as Russian bombs fall on Ukraine. I’ve bashed every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan over Russia policy, but praising a bloodthirsty dictator to score partisan points is disgusting and un-American.

Putin sees this invasion as a liberation of a wayward Russian vassal. He seeks to bring Ukraine back into the fold, to make it another Belarus. He knows if he attacks full force and devastates Slavic cities, he will not be able to install a puppet regime and Russian troops will never be safe in Ukraine, as the population will rise in insurrection against him, and his army is not equipped to deal with that.

That's not to say he isn't stupid enough to use them to try and force a victory if his 1st strategy fails. But the calculation doesn't add up rationally, he will never gain a compliant Ukraine, he will destroy Russia's image internationally (this isn't Grozny 20+ years ago, the eyes of the world are watching) and he will suffer under the harshest sanctions for decades (essentially becoming a new North Korea) and all to gain a devastated country that he'd then have to rebuild with his shattered economy? 

I do still fear Ukraine may see select use of these weapons, but I suspect their resolve will hold, they won't actually do much to alter the chances of Russian victory in that scenario- they would make urban warfare a nightmare for Russian forces.

Russia, of all countries, is going down the only military point of no return. Despite their knowledge and military experience, they have committed the **one mistake** you shouldn't make.

In what could be considered the worst decision in recent history, Russia has decided to attack Russia ... in the winter.

They lead an offensive war in unknown territory against a morally-surperior force.

The Ukrainians, having for a long time been part of the Soviel Union, know Russia's tricks. They may be the only country Russia could face that *knows* how Russia operates, how dirty it plays. They know what to do, how to engage that enemy.

They know that the Russians wouldn't escort their troop bearing planes.

They know that the Russians, in an offensive position, rely on constant logistic support. You cut them off, Russian soldiers are stranded without food, water, fuel and ammunition, while the Ukrainians fight in their own country.

The reason why Ukraine isn't in EU is because they don't fulfil the requirements to join. And there are many ways which they fail.

Ukrainian minister of internal affairs Denis Monastyrsky demanded Russia’s immediate expulsion via Facebook. “Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,” the Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske reported. The Guardian has approached Interpol for comment.

Interpol is a supranational police force focused on information-sharing among its 195 member states, primarily through its red notice system intended to alert member nations about the cross-border movement of criminals.

In recent years it has increasingly drawn criticism for abuse of the red notice system by oppressive regimes including Russia, where anti-democratic nations using it to flag political dissidents in exile or escaping abuse rather than those proven to commit crimes.

Former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul said that Russia should be expelled from Interpol in 2018, when critics warned that doing so risked turning it into a haven for criminals.

It is unclear how the process to expel a member state from Interpol’s general secretariat could work, or whether a similar action has ever been taken before.

Currently only North Korea is the only large country that is a member of the United Nations but not part of Interpol.

Taiwan has long campaigned to be readmitted to Interpol, after it was forced to withdraw from the organisation when China became a member in 1984.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

addition: men 18-60 are no longer allowed to leave

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

If this is true, that means the current losses are:

Russia: 5300 casualties

Ukraine: 4500 casualties

Additionally, I'm sick and tired of this notion is that ""this is the Russian government's doing! The people don't want this!""

It's not true. Russian citizens, overwhelmingly, support Putin. His last election had something like 75% of the vote. Claim that's rigged? Then realize NGO's - not the Russian government - have measured his approval rating at like 68%. That may decrease some due to Ukraine - but it actually increased right after Russia invaded Ukraine the first time in 2014 and annexed Crimea.  It skyrocketed to 80%. Even anti-Putin politicians like Navalny support it. Russians overwhelmingly support Putin, and there's no data suggesting the opposite.

A few thousand people are protesting? Yeah. I said the overwhelming majority support Putin, not literally 100%. This is a country of tens of millions. There will be protestors.



The unfortunate truth is that the average Russian citizen wants this. The only way to get them to switch sides is to make things uncomfortable enough for the average citizen to get them ot change their tune.

Crypto finally has a use case, I wonder if people will do that. Interesting side story.

Edit: seems like a lot of people are missing the point. Before hyper inflation or as early within the inflation period as you can you buy any reasonable store of value that you have access to; cars, houses, gold, silver, whatever. Russia has banned holding a large amount of foreign currency and shut down markets. The point isn't that you buy crypto and then go to the store and use it, the point is you buy 1coin for x Roubles today and then sell it back for x * (hyper inflation amount) of Roubles once inflation settles; as opposed to just losing all that value.

Business are being forced to liquidate 80% of foreign currency holdings. Liquidating to crypto or any other asset as a store of value would be my first move as possible and it's easier to move/hide crypto than it is houses/cars/gold/silver.

It is with a heavy heart that we inform you that the special operation being conducted in Ukraine is actually a full scale war, with your leaders seen as the aggressors by the global community and even some of your countries political allies such as Khazakstan. This is why your country has recently experienced financial sanctions and penalties. This is not imporant though. 

What is important is the loss of life for both sides has been needless. Many thousands did not know they were entering a war and have since perished. These are your sons, many of which are still just children. There is a chance that some of you reading this may have already lost someone. If you have family in the military, please try to contact them and make sure they are safe. Our hearts weep for the pain this has caused on both sides. Please, convince your government to end this war and stop the bloodshed. Save the lives of your sons and the lives of your neighbour's (Ukraine) sons as well.

The Offensive of Russia and the New World

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era in three dimensions. And of course, in the fourth, domestic Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system – but this should be discussed separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity – the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the actual civil war, because now brothers are still shooting at each other, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies – but Ukraine as an anti-Russia will no longer exist.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together – in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, we would not only have betrayed the memory of our ancestors, but we would have been cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a drop of historical responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia – for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of an anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the pressure of the West on us, is only the second most important among them.",False,1646069093.0,t3_t3jhke,t1_hyspoc1,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

This aims to provide a short overview over these terms and maybe help understanding the differences - let me know if there is any other things i should add.

During the war with Chechnya in the 90s they didn’t really bother informing the public what the fuck was going on, to the point that the mothers of Russian soldiers were personally flying on their own to try to figure out if their sons had been captured and how to get them released after Yeltsin had just gotten wasted at a New Year’s party while the siege of Grozny had started.

He modernized many aspects, changed training and equipment, and moved aside many ossified senior officers stuck on Soviet-era doctrine inapplicable to a non-Soviet scale economy. Doing this, he pissed many, many people off, and in turn was fired in 2012.

His replacement, a man named Shoygu, is an exceptionally shrewd career officer and political survivor that has survived among the upper brass since the fall of the Soviet Union. He used the opportunity to publicly demonize Serdyukov and undo all his changes to curry favor with as many people as possible. This, in turn, leads us to the modern Russian military who poses a greater danger to its own enlisted ranks than to any enemy it's unwilling to simply annihilate through mass-bombardment of population centers.

The other side of the coin is pretty simple. It is easy to go find some Russian propaganda. Or listen to any of their recent speeches.

And they justify the Ukraine invasion by saying it is overrun with neo-nazis who are committing genocide against Russians, and suppressing a majority Russian population.

All clearly nonsense. Putin thought Ukrainians would welcome his invasion, but they are fighting tooth and nail for their freedom from Russia.

Monero is anonymous address wise on the blockchain. It may prove easier to cash out on an exchange. Even Binance has 100% KYC now too afaik know. The days of email only accounts and a VPN are long gone. Tough call if you have to use your Russian ID to even exchange..

For example during the Hong Kong democracy protests that got wall to wall coverage in the Anglo Saxon press, Vietnamese American democracy activists were raging about how racist the media was on Twitter because they got ignored. Vietnamese American democracy activists thought now was the time to start their movement and led small demonstrations in Vietnam trying to get white media sympathy. Well they got 0 coverage and were arrested and deported from Vietnam. They were silly to think that white people cared about democracy and freedom. Chinese Communist Party is evil because it challenges the status quo. Vietnamese Community Party air force personnel were being trained in the US by the US Air Force last year because their US allies now.

Vietnamese communists = good

Chinese communists = bad

Chinese mass government surveillance = dystopian nightmare

NSA mass government surveillance = let's not talk about that....

I can link you a video with academic and researchers talking about how racist the white media coverage is when it comes to China for example. Taiwan is only a tool used for a certain means, white society is not sympathetic to them. The Taiwan situation hasn't changed since 1949 and the media could have cared less. This isn't just my opinion but the opinion shared by the ROC government of Taiwan when they publicly pushed back on Anglo Saxon media talk of war and imminent invasion of Taiwan 2 years ago. Nothing has changed and yet the white media hoped on the China hating bandwagon and tried to amp things up.

Sanctions are putting pressure to end this as quickly as possible. Today Russia tried to negotiate and asked exactly for what they were asking before the war.

They have almost none on the frontline and a few kept in reserve.

 Just like they running out of paratroopers to send stupidly that now they have to rely on Belarus. The Russians are using 1970's/early 80's tactics against modern countermeasures. Which didn't take into consideration of Rocket Launchers that can penetrate tank armor. Not to mention Soviet tactics are to use armored Vehicles in conjunction with their assault. Which is why we have Armored Vehicles rolling down streets in groups becoming 20+ ton road blocks. It is also winter and not all of the ground has thawed so if they don't use the roads, than they become stuck in the mud (plenty of videos showcasing this). Which is also why we're getting all these convoy's getting lit up easily because you just have to hit the front and back vehicle and they are stuck.  

The overwhelming bulk of their soldiers are conscripts and poorly trained. Their trained soldiers have some experience as you say but they are being sent in on suicidal attacks.

So they have to ship all the ones in storage to the front now.  And that takes time/days the Russians don't have. It's also why 100-125k of (200k total) troops they have are all conscripts. 

They have *10 days* to wrap up this invasion from when they first started. Maybe an extra day or three if they really squeeze as much fuel/resources as they can from the stone. Belarus joining in now with 70k troops will probably give them that three extra days. It costs 20 billion dollars a day to run this war for Russia. And now Belarus is adding onto that bill another 10 billion a day as well. And now their cash reserve of 600 billion is worth 33% less and is most likely gonna be worth even less as time goes on.

Russia wants the country intact if possible - no sense ruling in a pile of rubble and it's 2022 and they *still* haven't repaired Crimea infrastructure from the damage they massively dealt in 2014. So if they break a power plant or whatever - it's dead. It's gone. They cannot pay for it because if they had the money to do so - they would have in Crimea already. *But they didn't.* 

But yes - at a certain point - Russia is gonna say fuck it, but then that means that they are going to face a really pissed off population that massively outnumbers them who is getting supplied by the West. And there's 40 million of them in the country. A Javelin launcher only requires a 10 minute lesson in the US army. And at best - 270k Russian troops - the bulk of whom are conscripts.

You said that that were running out of missiles. I disagreed because they haven't used much of the weapons at their disposal. You said that's because they kept them far away and need to transport them. I said there are videos of them in Belarus already, and they wouldn't keep AGMs days away from bomber bases.
