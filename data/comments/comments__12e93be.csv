> 28 March 2023. We lost a good one.

> Dmitry Paderin was 24 years old. He was an officer. A real commander. He was the 1st Motorized Rifle company commander of the 1st battalion. Senior Lieutenant with a battlefield promotion to Captain that did not have a chance to come through officially.
>
> He served in Chechnya as part of the military unit 65384. Quickly rose through the ranks.
>
> He participated in the 'special military operation' since Feb 21, 2022. He was at the front with his soldiers the entire time. 

On top of being a 24-year-old captain, another notable bit is his unit and the date. In 2014 Unit 65384 was the 17th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, the first Russian unit to take part in the fighting in Donbas. They're supposed to be the elite infiltration unit. It's therefore very interesting that he was supposedly in Ukraine since the 21st of February, three days before the full-blown invasion. 

Him being the commander of the 1st company of the 1st battalion is also notable. Russians rank their units by quality sequentially, so 1/1 is for the best soldiers with the best equipment.

Not a single western intelligence agency in the world is corroborating their claims or even references them in briefings. Downvoting won't change reality. Also, remember these are likely very conservative estimates, true KIA will likely be a bit higher. Second, don't forget those are only KIA. Casualties are likely at least 3 to 4 times higher, which would be another 160K casualties on top of the 43.5K KIA, a total of >200K which is in line with most estimates at that time.

Now to the ground vehicles, it is possible that they don't take into account trucks and the like. Also some vehicles labeled as destroyed on oryx are, sadly enough, sometimes still recovered by the Russians. This happend at Vuhledar, where a number of tanks destroyed during the disastrous assaults' were actually recovered and hauled away over time. This highlights the importance of destroying the knocked-out vehicles (and why you see so many drones dropping grenades down open hatches, effectively rendering the tanks irrecoverable). It could also just be outdated.

Overall, I put more faith in US/NATO intelligence (which is known to work together very closely with Ukraine) numbers not meant for public than I do in figures published for the public. And they do seem to paint a better picture than what is sometimes given or spouted by Russian propagandists, with Ukrainian KIA being way below 20K and Russia having no reserves left.

Are they even capable to adapt to a months old leak. 

Even the leak of the NATO SOF forces with a few hundred people in Ukraine was already known months ago. Most of the data is open source. 

How will Russia read this and think about countering it? They can't. And even if they do try, the offensive hasn't started, it could be delayed and adapted. Looks like they aimed for mid May, maybe it will be mid June now - Barbarossa all over again.

It would require vast amoumts of resources which then couldn‚Äôt be used in other areas.

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough it‚Äôs even worse from a strategic perspective. Ukraine is fighting a defensive war and if turns into an offensive war it may make it much harder for the west to justify arming Ukraine.

""More direct Western involvement would dramatically change the intensity of the conflict. Absent U.S. casualties from a Russian nuclear attack outside of Russia or Ukraine, U.S. involvement will likely remain indirect through increased arms sales and nonmilitary support. The United States could be more likely to use conventional weapons directly against Russia, although it would take care to signal that it aims to defend Ukraine and the West rather than conquer Moscow. Any Western troop deployment would not cross the border into Russia, and even the use of advanced cruise missiles, drones, and ground operations would be limited to Russian targets in Ukraine.
