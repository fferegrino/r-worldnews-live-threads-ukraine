> 28 March 2023. We lost a good one. 
>
> Dmitry Paderin was 24 years old. He was an officer. A real commander. He was the 1st Motorized Rifle company commander of the 1st battalion. Senior Lieutenant with a battlefield promotion to Captain that did not have a chance to come through officially.
>
> He served in Chechnya as part of the military unit 65384. Quickly rose through the ranks.
>
> He participated in the 'special military operation' since Feb 21, 2022. He was at the front with his soldiers the entire time. 

On top of being a 24-year-old captain, another notable bit is his unit and the date. In 2014 Unit 65384 was the 17th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, the first Russian unit to take part in the fighting in Donbas. They're supposed to be the elite infiltration unit. It's therefore very interesting that he was supposedly in Ukraine since the 21st of February, three days before the full-blown invasion. 

Him being the commander of the 1st company of the 1st battalion is also notable. Russians rank their units by quality sequentially, so 1/1 is for the best soldiers with the best equipment.

Not a single western intelligence agency in the world is corroborating their claims or even references them in briefings. Downvoting won't change reality. Also, remember these are likely very conservative estimates, true KIA will likely be a bit higher. Second, don't forget those are only KIA. Casualties are likely at least 3 to 4 times higher, which would be another 160K casualties on top of the 43.5K KIA, a total of >200K which is in line with most estimates at that time.

Now to the ground vehicles, it is possible that they don't take into account trucks and the like. Also some vehicles labeled as destroyed on oryx are, sadly enough, sometimes still recovered by the Russians. This happend at Vuhledar, where a number of tanks destroyed during the disastrous assaults' were actually recovered and hauled away over time. This highlights the importance of destroying the knocked-out vehicles (and why you see so many drones dropping grenades down open hatches, effectively rendering the tanks irrecoverable). It could also just be outdated.

Overall, I put more faith in US/NATO intelligence (which is known to work together very closely with Ukraine) numbers not meant for public than I do in figures published for the public. And they do seem to paint a better picture than what is sometimes given or spouted by Russian propagandists, with Ukrainian KIA being way below 20K and Russia having no reserves left.

Even the leak of the NATO SOF forces with a few hundred people in Ukraine was already known months ago. Most of the data is open source. 

How will Russia read this and think about countering it? They can't. And even if they do try, the offensive hasn't started, it could be delayed and adapted. Looks like they aimed for mid May, maybe it will be mid June now - Barbarossa all over again.

Tactically speaking it would massively stretch Ukraine’s logistics and they would face many of the same problems Russia faced when invading Ukraine. It would also mean Russia could fortify cities and utilize their civilians against the Ukrainians instead of vice versa. It would require vast amoumts of resources which then couldn’t be used in other areas.

If that wasn’t bad enough it’s even worse from a strategic perspective. Ukraine is fighting a defensive war and if turns into an offensive war it may make it much harder for the west to justify arming Ukraine. It also dramatically raises the odds that Russia uses nukes if they’re defending land that the entire world recognizes as Russian. It would also galvanize the Russian public and make them far more supportive of Putin and the war which would make any future Russian withdrawal from Ukraine even less likely.

NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the UN Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia, who indicated that they would veto such a measure.

The UN Charter prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The US would not follow a MAD doctrine against Russia if they struck Ukraine, though I fully agree that we would and should mount a severe and potentially proportionate response, though it definitely would not be nuclear. The US would justifiably do everything possible to end Putin's regime, apart from a nuclear response and most likely apart from direct military engagement.


I view this quote from [an article hosted on the site of the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war) as a good summary of a potential response:


""More direct Western involvement would dramatically change the intensity of the conflict. Absent U.S. casualties from a Russian nuclear attack outside of Russia or Ukraine, U.S. involvement will likely remain indirect through increased arms sales and nonmilitary support. The United States could be more likely to use conventional weapons directly against Russia, although it would take care to signal that it aims to defend Ukraine and the West rather than conquer Moscow. Any Western troop deployment would not cross the border into Russia, and even the use of advanced cruise missiles, drones, and ground operations would be limited to Russian targets in Ukraine. Non-kinetic operations such as cyberattacks would likely continue, although little would be known about those until well after the war is over.""",False,1680902475.0,t3_12e93be,t1_jfcqo43,,5,0,0,0,0,0,

The only defense Russia has right now is nuclear and the fact that Ukraine really doesn't want Russian land. The current conflict outside of Ukraine is a masterclass in how NOT to conduct a war.

He isolated Brazil from international ties. He was against Argentina and China, our top1 and 3 exporters, just because they are left wing.

He is surrounded by yes men as much as Putin, because he either fired or attacked everyone who was against him.

He denied the pandemic, lied about not getting a shot, tried to cover and minimize the Amazon forest fires, he fired top officers to cover his sons laundry scheme and left the country after the lost the elections by fear of getting arrested.

Lula would never pursuit anything with Europe nor the US. Most of his voters are against that. He only say this kinda of shit because he knows people will support him.
