**Dzhankoy, Crimea:**

*(Mais'ke / Azovs'ke is a small town located about 20km SE of Dzankhoy. It seems the reports about Dzankhoy refer to the same ammo dump as Mais'ke above. I think the town is part of Dzhankoy district and reports have been confused or something.)*

Hvardiiske is a small town with what looks like a military airstrip some 18km NW of central Simferopol. Russian media apparently reports of an attack here. I'm not sure how credible this is though and I haven't seen any clips so take it with a grain of salt.

🪖 russia made a tiny gain today, taking [a factory in Soledar](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1559226186454155265).  [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1559357456110739457), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559230740449075201.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559323314706939929.html) cover all the battles of the day.  

🪖 With the [siege of Kherson](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559264504076242945.html) underway, Ukraine sees the next [two weeks](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1558935313132781571) as critical.  While two thirds of the population have evacuated, there are still [100,000 people](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559261200919183360) remaining in Kherson.  Meanwhile, russia is building [fortified defenses in Mariupol](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559205044234457088) in anticipation of Ukrainian advances in the near future.

🍄 russia accused the UN [of blocking](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1559287056571965446) an IAEA visit to the nuclear power plant, however the UN denied this and said to the contrary it is [ready to facilitate](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559286722156003328) a trip of the IAEA to the plant.  There are several reasons why russia shells a plant it controls from psy-ops to nuclear blackmail, and the WSJ sees it as a way to [$sever the plants electrical connection$](https://twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1559052112075669504) to Ukraine.  Interestingly, the moscow-installed authorities are proposing a [cease-fire around the plant](https://twitter.com/Make_Me_Aware/status/1559327050611171329).

👉 Since the war began, the [Red Cross](https://twitter.com/ReneDuba/status/1559209117532782593) has only been able to arrange [2 brief visits](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559304209920655364) to Olenivka, where the Azov PoWs were executed, and was unable to talk with the Ukrainian prisoners without russian soldiers being present.

🛩 In Donetsk, Ukraine took down a [Ka-52 helicopter](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1559125584445411329).  It is a war though and Ukraine paid respects to its own [Yuriy Pogorely](https://twitter.com/BabakTaghvaee1/status/1559271218196500481), a fighter ace who lost his life defending Kharkiv last week.

👉 Everyone knows that russia deports Ukrainian [citizens to camps throughout russia](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559012449000558595).  For the first time, we have a report of russia sending those citizens [back to Mariupol](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559301983185534976).  Their prospects are bleak as most don’t have homes to return to, and the [winter is going to be brutal](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559240252946059266), but [they are coming home](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559101906877906945.html). 

👉 In fairly big news for Ukraine, the parliament has elected someone widely seen [as free of corruption](https://twitter.com/olex_scherba/status/1559177837231448067) as head of the Supreme Council of Justice, the only body able to fire judges in Ukraine.  This is a [big step away](https://twitter.com/VolodymyrKulyk4/status/1559213453331632130) from Ukraine’s corrupt past, and a big step towards meeting the EU’s requirements for membership.  The parliament also [elected Moroz](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559198905618894848) also seen as an anti-corruption choice.

👉 Over the weekend russian workers in the Donbas [protested](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1558387990380118016.html) that they have not been paid by russia.  On Monday they may have been [pressed into military service](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559134285705125888).  

👉 We seem to have confirmation that [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559202265864478720.html) was [not at the Wagner base](https://twitter.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1559212972563636224) when it was hit by a HIMARS rocket over the weekend.

💰🦃 Turkey is living up to its name by [negotiating with russia](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1559250767491612675) for another batch of S-400 air defense systems.  Maybe russia will throw in a [robot dog](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1559248209888923651) or two.

💰🇺🇸 JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are moving [back into trading russian bonds](https://twitter.com/justsay94731715/status/1559308322398175232) saying the trades are for those seeking to exit russian debt holdings. 

💰🇷🇸 Don’t have 400,000 for a Turkish citizenship?  Ordinary russians are finding Serbia is a great place [to evade sanctions](https://twitter.com/ivanastradner/status/1558981909526577158).  But in military matters, Serbia is abandoning the russian military base on its territory and will [train its army to NATO standards](https://twitter.com/OlgaNYC1211/status/1559335462279516162).

💰🇩🇪 Germany came out [against an EU-wide russian visa ban](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559310856646705155), however it does look like its ability to put the cork back in the bottle is [rather limited](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1558937505650581505.html).  And while russia howls against the [visa bans](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559072950917144578.html) it conveniently ignores its own [visa restrictions](https://twitter.com/GicAriana/status/1559037095586500608) on “unfriendly countries” which includes the majority of the EU.  

💰🇺🇦 Ukraine’s exports have fallen [by 24% in six months](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1559277987882848259).  And while much of that attention is focused on a 46% [decline in agriculture](https://twitter.com/ACOMRB/status/1559152477735362560), the loss of Ukraine’s [steel industry](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1558410958007050241) has been particularly painful.

🔥🇩🇪 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz attended the Nordic Summit where he obtained Norway’s assurances it would provide [as much gas as it could](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559311462702645248) to Germany during the crisis.  Norway has become Germany's [biggest gas supplier](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559312540026474498).

🔥🇷🇺 The upside of the gas crisis is that Gazprom’s pipeline flows into Europe are [down 75% year over year](https://twitter.com/BurggrabenH/status/1559156851085803522) and with Europe scrambling for alternative energy and sources of gas, its likely those numbers will never recover.  More troubles for Moscow as oil prices [hit $87.65 a barrel](https://twitter.com/Josh_Young_1/status/1559140065883955203), and falling.  Thanks to sanctions russia has to sell for well under that price.

🎁🇫🇮 Ukrainian troops are now using Finish [120mm heavy mortars](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1559259073031409666).  As is becoming more common, delivery of the weapons were not previously announced.  Finland is also committing to helping rebuild the [Chernihiv Oblast](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559246500290519041) in Ukraine after the war.

🎁🇱🇻 Six M109 Howitzers have arrived [from Latvia](https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1559270844471328769) and are already on the battlefield.   Additionally, Latvia has supplied [two Mi-17 and two Mi-2 helicopters](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1559218211958185990) to Ukraine’s Air Force.

🎁🇬🇧🇳🇿🇨🇦🇫🇮🇸🇪🇩🇰🇳🇴🇳🇱 New Zealand is sending [an additional 120 trainers](https://twitter.com/waranalysts/status/1559106437988732930) to Britain to train Ukraine soldiers.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been [changing its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 August 2022
 
- The surface vessels of Russia's Black Sea Fleet continue to pursue an extremely defensive posture, with patrols generally limited to waters within sight of the Crimean coast. This contrasts with heightened Russian naval activity in other seas, as is typical for this time of year.

- The Black Sea Fleet continues to use long-range cruise missiles to support ground offensives but is currently struggling to exercise effective sea control. It has lost its flagship, MOSKVA; a significant portion of its naval aviation combat jets; and control of Snake Island.

- The Black Fleet's currently limited effectiveness undermines Russia's overall invasion strategy, in part because the amphibious threat to Odesa has now been largely neutralised. This means Ukraine can divert resources to press Russian ground forces elsewhere.

Day 174 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was again quite a lot of shelling. We were shelled 2 times, first time at 5pm and then again at 10pm. Both times the target was the Saltivka district, again. They are always destroying that district for whatever reason, and they never hit any military targets while doing it, unless a playground counts as one.

I thought that there would be no missiles today, but they just postponed it, and did their missile strike just 30 minutes ago, at 4:35am, which is extremely late, they rarely do them that late. Weirdly enough they “only” launched 5 missiles. The weird part is that the number is uneven. One S-300 launcher carries 4 missiles, so they used 2 of them, and yet only launched 1 missile from the second one. Usually they fire the entire salvo at once, without conserving the missiles. All 5 missiles fell somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, none were aimed at the city this time.

It’s so refreshing seeing Russian bases and ammo depots in Crimea blow up, it’s even better that they are claiming that those explosions are just accidents. I guess they have a bigger threat to worry about in their army then. The Smoker of Crimea is dangerous indeed. First he sunk the Moskva singlehandedly. Then did a simultaneous smoking in different parts of an air base causing it to blow up, and now he struck again, this time by smoking at an ammo dump. They really need to do something about it, what if he decides to do a smoke break at the Crimean Bridge or the Kremlin next time?

>According to the intelligence, the Russians would come from the north, on either side of Kyiv. One force would move east of the capital through the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, while the other would flank Kyiv on the west, pushing southward from Belarus through a natural gap between the “exclusion zone” at the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant and surrounding marshland. The attack would happen in the winter so that the hard earth would make the terrain easily passable for tanks. Forming a pincer around the capital, Russian troops planned to seize Kyiv in three to four days. The Spetsnaz, their special forces, would find and remove President Volodymyr Zelensky, killing him if necessary, and install a Kremlin-friendly puppet government.

1. That Russia inherited most of the Soviet reputation as the media reports it. And Russia spent a lot of effort constantly playing this up and developing some possibly really good tank and plane systems.

2. The media in Allied countries consistently gets garbage experts on air that reinforce that Russian reputation.

The reason I say garbage experts as they are no better than some of the redditors you see in here. Anytime you see anyone refer to 'second biggest army' or 'biggest this' ignore them.

Size means nothing without force multipliers and logistics. But of course, 'experts' look at the numbers on on wikipedia or *pick your website* and then apply some basic maths.

The US isn't the one to look at when considering how threatening Russia is actually perceived in the world, EU nations are. And many of them have kept small and economic militaries. They should have been better financed but point is that the media reporting on Russia is rather different to the likely intelligence picture Gov/Militaries are getting.

The US doesn't use Russia to justify it's military spending, it uses all the different 'oppositional' nations in the world, including China, Iran, DPRK, etc. It then takes the view of being able to fight two significant adversaries at the same time and win both.

I feel sympathy for the Russian people, but it's hard to spend much emotional bandwidth on them given the greater suffering the Ukrainians are experiencing.

Regarding what you said about ""Western values"": I think many people that hold ""Western values"" feel their ideals of equality, civility, and openness have been taken advantage of by Russians. It does not help that the Russian government constantly ridicules these values and presents them as signs of weakness. The more we hear from ""average"" Russians outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the more it seems like most people in Russia agree with those views.

The list of sins we attribute to the Russian government and Russian people has gotten long.

Characterising most Russians as bad or good is pointless, reality is almost always in a large grey zone (note not a trinary or averaged middle).

Used to live in Donetsk for 14 years, before Russians came, have all my relatives there too and quite familiar with landscape.

Crimean landscape is flat steppes (except the southernmost part with mountains), but in Donbas there are more hills (again, except southern part near Mariupol) and some forests. So the terrain is clearly more favorable for recapturing Crimea (one of the reasons Kherson fell so quickly, because there is literally no natural obstacles in the region, except Dnipro itself). 

Another thing is supply: Donbas region gets it directly from across the border, while Crimea relies 100% on the operability of Crimean bridge and currently established land corridor to Mariupol and beyond. If bridge gets taken out and UAF enters Crimea, RU forces there are essentially stuck there without supply.

Also, due to 8 years of constant skirmishes the defense lines in Donbas are heavily fortified on both sides, while Crimea hasn’t been preparing for anything like that at the same time frame.

10283cb7a8bbcaa3650eb02b273d1d1b,wpk859,iklmmhj,"Hooooo boy. There's *a lot* of reasons why.

First, Russian logistics are almost entirely reliant on railways. This is to the point they don't even use pallets to move material on and off trucks and railcars, it's all done by hand. So moving their logistics beyond the rails slows them down. Mind you, this works great for them in their country, since their rail systems are built with this in mind, but it's kind of a problem when they're invading hostile territory.

Second, UA can now hit them beyond their effective artillery range thanks to HIMARs GMLRs. They have been using this capability to pound on ammo depots, fuel depots, and even trains when they get the opportunity (see what I said about how reliant their logistics are on rail). Having thousands of pieces of artillery doesn't mean much if there isn't enough ammo to go around. 

Third... Russia has not been rotating their troops, and has made bad deployment decisions. Troops who retreated from Kyiv were thrown right back into the frontlines in the Donbas, without any real rest or replenishment of personnel. This has resulted in the number of Russian Battalion Tactical Groups no longer serving as an indicator of Russia's remaining military strength- they are *that* battered. 

Forth, Russia responded to UA blaring it's Kherson counteroffensive from every rooftop by moving troops to Kherson *from* the other frontlines, leaving them with less manpower. Troops that have now been more or less cut off from the rest of their forces thanks to UA blowing up bridges.

Fifth, they are trying to replenish their losses with barely trained conscripts and prisoners. And they've essentially exhausted the pool of conscripts in the LPR/DPR. They need to take more land to expand that pool, but because of the manpower issue they have, they're having trouble taking that land. Russia is also doing everything it can to avoid an actual mobilization (which, considering their training personnel have been dying on the frontlines, probably wouldn't help all that much). 

Basically, the only thing Russia has going for it is the number of remaining artillery pieces it has and the amount of fire they can put out when they have ammo.",1660700340.0,1660700113.0,t3_wpk859,t1_iklks8o,,1,25,0,25,0,0,

They didn’t establish air superiority and relied more on WWII style tactics with utilizing air power to augment ground operations versus combined arms, where they are used to complement each other.

Ukraine, while seriously outgunned to begin with, initially utilized the same tactics that the Taliban deployed against Russia and the US. They relied initially on more nimble, light infantry with anti-armor weapons and reserved heavier, less mobile units to critical battles. This helped Ukraine at least stall out Russian forward momentum (Russia is still seeing some forward progress but it is extremely slow).

Western weapons and equipment have been vital to Ukraine as well. It is evident that they are running out of ammunition and missiles for their Russian or Soviet weapons systems. Ukraine is also heavily focused on degrading Russian supply lanes which can be just as crucial as destroying combat hardware, as well as targeting Russian leadership.

Western military doctrine allows for low level commanders to have a degree of flexibility to complete and objective, while Russian doctrine relies on a centralized command structure. Both have merit, but the problem Russia is having is that they lack enough commanders to effectively deploy units and Ukraine is effectively targeting command and control centers.

Russia, while conducting cyber warfare and propaganda, is not doing a great job at masking their radio signals or practicing effective operational security and that has resulted in key outposts and leaders being targeted and destroyed by HIMRAS, airstrikes, or missiles.

Western support for Ukraine has been absolutely crucial, but Ukraine has proven to be extremely effective at adapting to the situation and is practicing defense in depth, retreating if it is tactically prudent, and clearly capitalizing on all support from the West.",False,1660702433.0,t3_wpk859,t1_iklks8o,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

After a decade of experiments, the US Defense Department largely switched to other methods, such as projectiles which would simply smash into the weapon in space. 

It was renamed the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in 1993 with a $9 billion annual budget at present. It is working on multiple missile defense systems. The THAAD is a solid fuel rocket which hits the warhead during reentry. It has been tested but does not seem to be deployed.

The main political problem is the rural-urban conflict and the urgent need for land reform and redistribution. This conflict is connected to the mess agriculture is in.

It's also worth noting that nearly all the fighters in Afghanistan are mercenaries, and they earn a pittance. They take the job because of the collapse of agriculture. There's no point in shooting them. It makes much more sense to offer them jobs.

An obvious solution to the problem would have been to plant 5 billion trees. Or maybe 10. It would have been cheap, would greatly improve the country's hydraulic problems, soak up lots of rural unemployment and would have been impossible to be opposed politically.

It detected the plane, it had the missiles, it could shoot but was never given access. It literally says that multiple times on the wiki.

That airplane was shot down due to a huge amount of coincidences (such as being in the wrong place at the same time as an american spyplane). Its a very interesting case, not sure if this video covers all of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOtDSyFCg4o , but either way that was a major accident, that caused an international incident.
