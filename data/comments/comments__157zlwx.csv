They have been separated from their families and living for months on end in hotel rooms. They have the job of overseeing one of the largest U.S. assistance efforts since the Marshall Plan, ensuring that tens of thousands of individual pieces of American military hardware in Ukrainian hands are properly accounted for, reconstituting an embassy that was gutted on the eve of Russia’s invasion and keeping tabs on Russian war crimes — some 95,000 of which have been documented so far by the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office.

>I learned that Ukrainians have no interest in turning their victimization into an identity. …in Bucha, the Kyiv suburb that suffered some of the worst atrocities during Russia’s brief occupation in the early days of the war, I witnessed the transformation of apartment buildings dotted with patched-up bullet holes into trendy co-working spaces. As Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, told Power, “Memory will stay in memoirs but residents want to rebuild without reminders.”
>
>I learned that Ukrainians aren’t likely to trade sovereign territory for Western security assurances, much less for some kind of armistice deal with Moscow. They tried the former in the 1990s with the Budapest Memorandum, in which they surrendered the nuclear arsenal on their soil to Russia for the sake of toothless guarantees of territorial integrity. They tried the latter with the equally toothless Minsk agreements after Russia’s first invasion in 2014. The goal of Western policy should be to provide Ukraine with the military means they need to *win*, rather than to pressure Ukraine into again bargaining away its rights to sovereignty and security for the sake of assuaging our anxieties about Russian escalation.
>
>I learned that, for all the aid we’ve given Ukraine, we are the true beneficiaries in the relationship, and they the true benefactors. Ben Wallace, Britain’s usually thoughtful defense minister, suggested after this month’s NATO summit that Ukrainians should show more gratitude to their arms suppliers. That gets the relationship backward. NATO countries are paying for their long-term security in money, which is cheap, and munitions, which are replaceable. Ukrainians are counting their costs in lives and limbs lost.

>Today, it is Poland’s neighbors in Ukraine who are magnificently unreconciled to invasion. What I learned from four days under closed skies is never to take a bustling airport scene like this for granted.

>Evidence of this kind shows that China, despite Beijing’s calls for peace, is pushing right up to a red line in delivering enough nonlethal, but militarily useful, equipment to Russia to have a material impact on President Vladimir Putin’s 17-month-old war on Ukraine. The protective gear would be sufficient to equip many of the men mobilized by Russia since the invasion. Then there are drones that can be used to direct artillery fire or drop grenades, and thermal optical sights to target the enemy at night.

There is also another rail link, but this one goes from Ukraine to Romania and goes through one kilometer of Moldovan territory. See 45.4697941, 28.2140389

So given that the grain that goes to Odesa port arrives by rail, why not ship it mostly through rail into Romania and from there to many ports on the Black Sea? Russia can't attack Romania and other NATO members.

It may slow down operations versus peak export, but it's still better than nothing. I'm not suggesting to sell the grain to Europe, just change where the grain gets exported from.

For example, the port of Constanța in Romania is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe.

Edit: I guess I answered my own question lol

>Romania's Constanta port, Ukraine's main alternative route for grain since Russia's withdrawal led to the collapse of the Black Sea shipment deal, has capacity to handle extra cargoes until mid-August, the head of the port's business association said.

>It has handled roughly a third of Ukraine's grain exports since the start of the war.

""On Sunday morning, Ukraine's air force said Russian forces had targeted the Black Sea port city with 19 missiles, including four Kalibr and seven Iskander cruise missiles. Air defenses intercepted nine of these missiles, the military said in a post on social media.

Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said one person had been killed and 21 were injured, including four children. At least 44 buildings were damaged, 25 of which are architectural monuments, he added in a post to Telegram.

One person was killed and 19 were injured, according to Odesa Gov. Oleh Kiper. Six residential buildings were destroyed, and two architectural monuments were damaged, he said. The strikes ""practically destroyed the largest cathedral in the south of Ukraine,"" Odesa's military administration said on Telegram.

Russia rejected these claims in an emphatic statement on Sunday, saying the ""the most likely cause of its destruction was the fall of a Ukrainian anti-aircraft guided missile."" Moscow's Defense Ministry said its targets were ""located at a safe distance"" from the cathedral and had avoided ""facilities where the civilian population is located, as well as objects of cultural and historical heritage.""

""All targets planned to strike were destroyed,"" the ministry added.""

So half the missiles were intercepted, but RU destroyed all planned targets? Not most, not some, all. Riiiiight.  And the most likely cause of cathedral extreme damage is a falling AA missile, as opposed to you know the offensive ones RU are firing into the area? Uh no, but how amazingly convenient that such a claim also just happens to paint UA and western equipment as incompetent. RU should win a Pulitzer on this one.

The pics and video of the cathedral are pretty gnarly too. Its wrecked.

A relevant piece from last May:

>**Ukraine’s Danube ports have become a lifeline**
>
>*The country’s Black Sea trade is still largely blocked by Russia*
>
>On the night of July 30th, 2022 Oleksiy Vadatursky went to bed a happy man. The founder of Nibulon, a grain company, had just arrived at his home in Mykolaiv after inspecting work on a new export terminal at Izmail, 360km away on the Danube. He had acquired a “pair of wings”, his driver later quipped, lifted by his company’s quick progress in turning an undeveloped plot into a much-needed wartime escape route for exports.
>
>But a few hours later the 74-year-old tycoon was dead, killed along with his wife in a Russian missile attack. One missile landed a few metres away from their basement shelter with a blast so strong it left the couple’s silhouettes on the walls. “The Russians were destroying infrastructure and military facilities,” recalled Andriy, Mr Vadatursky’s son. “They destroyed whatever they thought they needed to… and that, apparently, included my father.”
>
>The younger Mr Vadatursky took the company over, committing himself to bring his father’s vision to fruition. On September 14th Nibulon’s road-and-rail export terminal became fully operational; since then it has shipped 900,000 tonnes of corn and wheat. The facility forms part of a hurried redevelopment of previously neglected Danube river ports—driven by Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea trade. The Danube ports may be remote, largely underdeveloped and relatively expensive to get to, but they offer the crucial advantage of safety: their close proximity to Romania, a member of NATO, offers protection from Russian bombardment. Before the war, Danube ports were responsible for 1.5% of Ukraine’s trade, by volume. Now they are on course to handle 20%, with plans for more.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-24-23/index.html

""Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov says F-16 training for Ukrainian pilots will begin in August.

Reznikov, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN over the weekend, added that the training will take “a minimum of 6 months” and that Ukraine still needs to add some infrastructure for the fighter jets.

The defense minister said he thought, optimistically, pilots could be operating F-16s in the skies of Ukraine by spring of next year.

Speaking to CNN’s Alex Marquardt in the Ukrainian capital, Reznikov, a lawyer turned defense official, did concede that if Ukraine had these fighter jets now they would “certainly” have helped Ukraine make more progress in the ongoing counteroffensive.

“If you have more sophisticated, more modern weaponry will be more efficient,” he said.

The training — which Reznikov said will likely be held in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as possibly in the United Kingdom or Poland — will also include intensive sessions for technicians. The defense minister said the maintenance of the jets is a ""serious task”.

He said the trainings may be split between countries, but the final plans were still being finalized.

The minister joked that the group of 11 nations that have committed to helping Ukraine train pilots on the F16s are called “Ocean’s 11,” after the popular film.""",False,1690201341.0,t3_157zlwx,t3_157zlwx,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-24-23/index.html

""The Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has said he will share a report with the United States about the use of US supplied cluster munitions in Ukraine this week.

The minister, speaking to CNN’s Alex Marquardt in Kyiv over the weekend, said he is awaiting the report which he will then pass on to the Pentagon “probably Monday or Tuesday,” meaning July 24 or 25.

Reznikov, speaking exclusively to CNN added, “we'll report about the consequences of this using [cluster munitions] so I think that next week I would have first report and I will share with my partners in Pentagon this reports. I hope that they will be more efficient than normal ammunition.""

On Thursday the White House’s John Kirby said that Ukrainian forces are using US-provided cluster munitions against Russia “appropriately” and “effectively” in combat.”

“They are using them appropriately. They’re using them effectively and they are actually having an impact on Russia’s defensive formations and Russia’s defensive maneuvering,” Kirby told reporters.

Reznikov wouldn’t offer detail before the report comes but said he expects them to be most effective ""especially against the artillery systems, especially during the counter battery fighting and also they will be efficient against the armored personnel carriers, for the infantry fighting vehicles, they will also be good against their infantry in the fields.""

The sharing of the report is part of the deal with the Pentagon to obtain the cluster munitions, called DPICMS, Reznikov said. 

The US has said the decision to provide Ukraine with DPICMs is due to a low supply of the standard unitary 155mm artillery round. The supply of clusters is “temporary,” according to US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

CNN was first to report that the US clusters had arrived in Ukraine.

Why is it controversial? Cluster munitions scatter “bomblets” across large areas, which would allow Ukrainian forces to target larger concentrations of Russian forces and equipment with fewer rounds of ammunition.

But the bomblets can also fail to explode on impact, and can pose a long-term risk to anyone who encounters them, similar to landmines.

The UK, France, Germany and other key US allies have outlawed the munitions under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but the US and Ukraine are not signatories to the ban.""",False,1690201594.0,t3_157zlwx,t3_157zlwx,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

>In the Bundeswehr, the lack of artillery ammunition has been normal for years. The troops currently have a considerable number of ready-to-use Panzerhaubitze2000 artillery systems, of which 14 have already been handed over to the Ukraine in the current year. However, the shells for this are so rare that the artillerymen on the home front are only rarely allowed to train with live shells. For example, when a minister or a state secretary stops by. Otherwise the soldiers have to be satisfied with practice ammunition.
>
>The government recently involuntarily made public how dramatic the situation is. For months after the start of the war in Ukraine, Berlin tried to keep secret the exact number of artillery shells available. Even parliamentarians were brushed off with the remark that disclosure would endanger the welfare of the state. But then, a few weeks ago, the finance department mentioned in a confidential submission to the Bundestag that the troops currently only have around 20,000 155-millimeter projectiles.
>
>The number was tantamount to an oath of disclosure, so a SPIEGEL report on the paper caused a stir internationally. Because according to NATO specifications, the Bundeswehr should actually have enough ammunition available for artillerymen to be able to hold out in intensive combat for 30 days. For that they would need at least 230,000 rounds. Officially, this rule will not apply until 2031, but the NATO strategists were still somewhat shocked at how hollow the German holdings are.

\---------

Sasha – himself a great admirer of Vladimir Putin – painted a picture of confusion around Wagner’s abortive mutiny in June, although he had already returned home when it happened.  
He said colleagues told him many commanders, wishing to remain loyal to the Russian president, refused orders to march on Rostov-on-Don, a Russian stronghold near the Ukrainian border, where Wagner seized a military base.  
Analysing the clash between Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Putin-backed Russian military - with regular troops reportedly attacking mercenary bases - Sasha was curt.  
“I’ll put it simply: I don’t like Shoigu \[the Russian defence minister\].”  
Before the Wagner rebellion on 23 June, which saw it march on Moscow, tensions had been escalating between Prigozhin and the Russian defence establishment, with the mercenary boss openly slamming their campaign.  
Having faced down “really good” Ukrainian artillery, Sasha felt gratitude to be home in one piece.  
“I sleep very well at night. Don't have any nightmares. I got back with all my limbs. I was never wounded. I was quite lucky compared to others.""  
“After what I’ve been through, things change and you have different priorities in life such as family,” he continued. “I have brothers… parents \[and\] a woman I love”.  
“That’s also why I don't want to fight anymore. I don't want to risk it all a second time,” he added.",False,1690224529.0,t3_157zlwx,t3_157zlwx,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

I don't know if he speaks Ukraininan in private, but the fact that he's speaking Ukrainian in public communication along with the fact that he's an idol and leader, has impact. 


If you ask the historian, Timothy Snyder, he says that one of the motivations for this invasion is that Russia doesn't view Ukrainians as a seperate people from Russians. Just how an invasion can prove that, I don't know, but that's also besides the point. 


All Ukrainians understand Russian, but almost no Russians speak Ukrainian. This way, using Ukrainian is a way of saying, ""yes, we are in fact different groups and you might think we belong to your group, but we have the power and tools to say that you aren't members of *our* group"". 


I think that is very, very cool. 


Ukrainian was never dead, but Russia has *many* times in history tried to remove Ukrainian from political discourse or messaging - Essentially attempting cast or transform Ukrainian into an insignificant, regional dialect. 


They attempted the opposite with ""Moldovan"" and ""Romanian"", which are *the same languages* forced into separate alphabets in an attempt to split one speech community in two, with the hope that Moldovans would eventually not identify with Romanians despite them originating from the same speech community. 


All this to say, it's very cool to see the Ukrainians beat the Russians at their own genocidal game. I root for them. 


One other succesful example I can think of is Israel, where the Israelis basically revived a language, which had been dead for almost 2000 years.

On the average, each of them are holding around 30-34g of explosive (equivalent to about 50g of TNT).

The M46 has a shaped-charge arrangement that directs a jet of energy down the bottom of the munition, as well as a (much more limited compared to the M42) anti-personnel fragmentation effect. (See the diagram here: [http://uxoinfo.com/blogcfc/client/includes/uxopages/Mulvaney\_Details.cfm?Ord\_Id=PC26](http://uxoinfo.com/blogcfc/client/includes/uxopages/Mulvaney_Details.cfm?Ord_Id=PC26))

Basically, the submunition, once deployed by the M864 round, falls with a trailer drogue ribbon to keep the submunition from tumbling so that it drops straight in on a target.   With most vehicles, one is likely to find the weakest level of protection on the roof of the vehicle - so basically, that round just might be enough for an IFV on a direct hit, or even a random engine compartment.   Self-propelled artillery would be vulnerable as well.   And as far as the tube artillery, the rounds might not be able to penetrate the artillery piece itself, but there's plenty of other things in your average artillery site that you could fill with holes and stop it from working....

So every possible decision they make is based on wrong information. There are some points to support that claim and Russia's political history supports that too.

&#x200B;

One thing is very important and needs mentioning again and again. Putin may not receive correct information from his advisors and trusted politicians.

In every form of government, the governing individual or party are faced with issues on every part of everything. As no singular human is capable of understanding all of that, they require advisors and trusted aide's. They are reliant on the provided information.

Authoritarian and absolutist governments have the potential problem of having leeches and suckers in the position of the advisors and aide's. Or wrathful cunts in the position of absolut power. Either way, the individuals bringing the bad news may as well pack their stuff on the spot and say farewell to every potential raise and improvement in position. So the flow of information is heavily compromised in those and the intelligence the people in power get is unreliable, but they don't question it.

Just like every Vatnik, Tankie and generally every other kind of idiot, everybody believes that the information they get is the right one. And it's even worse if the source is a trusted friend, colleague or alleged expert on the matters in question.

The Bakhmut general, who was 're-positioned' by Gerasimov, was allegedly only transferred after threatening Gerasimov with bringing his report directly to Putin. That suggests, if he can be trusted in this regard, that Putin is cut off from actual and reliable information and every report from outsiders could be the stone that topples the carefully constructed Jenga tower.

Ukraine being former Soviet knows how much value Russian command doesn't put on its individual soldiers' lives.  They also know the ""quality"" of medical care wounded soldiers are receiving.

For example, if one uses just Oryx's destroyed major weaponry (tanks, BMPs, self-propelled artillery), and assumes close to the same ratio as destroyed to wounded as in World War II, one gets around 280,000 wounded.  Calculation: . Oryx has documented over 7,600 destroyed Russian tanks and around 2500 BMPs. The USSR lost around 100,000 tanks, self-propelled artillery, etc. in World War II, and a standard estimate for wounded is 14 to 15 million soldiers. (For that see  Krivosheev's ""Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century."")  So, that means around 140 wounded per a loss of a system, which corresponds to around 287,000 wounded.

Now, that is an undercount of destroyed weaponry, since it involves just the visually confirmed Oryx data. On the other hand, it may be an overcount because tanks and BMPs in this war are getting destroyed sometimes by drones even when they would otherwise be just abandoned, or abandoned and then recovered. So it is possible that this is overestimating the number of likely actually wounded.

There are two potential major strategies in any conflict, deterrence and denial. Deterrence requires the capacity of responding with such overwhelming force that an opponent determines it's less costly to avoid, or abandon, a conflict rather than pursuing. Denial requires the capacity to prevent an opponent from achieving its goals in any potential conflict, thus persuading the opponent that any such conflict is futile.

Ukraine never had the capacity to deter, and the West isn't going to suddenly give Ukraine that capacity. Ukraine did have the ability to deny Russia its goals, so the West fortified Ukraine's existing potential.

F-16s will not give Ukraine a deterrence capability, in fact these jets are fatally vulnerable to the S-400. All they can do is provide Ukraine an air-based launch platform for Western weapons. An improvement that gives an extended range to existing weapons, and allows the use of new longer range weapons, but *this is not a deterrence capability*.

The West would be happy if Russia went home immediately, but the West isn't going to give F-35s, F-22s, aircraft carriers, submarines and nuclear weapons to Ukraine and those are the only assets that are powerful enough to *deter* Russia. The only option for Ukraine is denial. They've denied Russia the ability to take over the country and the ongoing counteroffensive is geared at denying Russia the ability to retain gained territory (and perhaps lose pre-conflict occupied areas.)

There's literally a term for how problematic it can be for nations to have tons of strategic resources especially like oil and minerals and how paradoxically it might impede the nation when it comes to developing.

>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, who developed selectorate theory, explains that when an autocratic country has lots of natural resources, the ruler's optimal strategy for political survival is to use that revenue to buy the loyalty of critical support groups and oppress the rest of the population by denying them civil liberties and underfunding education and infrastructure. Education, liberty, and infrastructure can make the people more productive, but they also make it easier for them to organize opposition movements. Since the ruler can obtain sufficient revenue from his country's natural resources, he has no need for a productive populace and therefore does not have to risk liberalization. By contrast, in a dictatorship with few natural resources, there may be a necessity for the ruler to liberalize his society somewhat so that the economy can be organized more efficiently, and to invest in education and healthcare to create a skilled and healthy workforce. Bueno de Mesquita cites Ghana and Taiwan as examples of countries where the rulers permitted democratization out of necessity.\[15\]

So just saying I wouldn't take it for granted that a nation with great amounts of resources have an easy path to be a thriving nation because it can also be a hindrance depending on institutions and other elements leading to the nation being hijacked by an authoritarian and rich elite that want to keep their country easy to control.",False,1690242258.0,t3_157zlwx,t1_jt8abqp,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

And it can be judged that he’s important based upon who he commanded—it was the men from the region around St Petersburg. (In Russia, you are enlisted under your region, unlike USA where go several states away to do basic training, then sent to another base across country bc stationed way over there.)

He commanded Leningrad, important bc higher class of people’s children. St Pete is Russia’s cultural capital.  Where all the artists and writers and historians and such folks live.  It’s an educated city, compared to other Russian cities. Plus, all the siloviki were originally from St Pete (Bortnikov, Putin, Naryshkin, Patrushev, Prigozhin, Peskov) and still have their connections there. The various science universities are there.  In fact, that’s where Putin “earned” his own PhD. 

So the regiment, being from the region, would have been soldiers whose parents could have had connections, they would be considered better, it’s hard to describe, but guys from St Pete would considered (amongst the MOD) to be children of Russia’s better class of people and would’ve generally tried to prevent them from encountering danger.

Bc the MOD would’ve valued a St Pete regiment more than say one from Ufa or from Omsk, they would’ve also put a more important person to command it.

That’s why I’m saying that. Whoever commands from Moscow or the St Pete regiment is considered an important person.  

None of that is to say such soldier actually are more valuable, better at their job, more skilled; or that the commander is more qualified or competent.

There is a very deep sense of learned helplessness within Russia and the people largely view politics as something they have no control over.

Ukrainian numbers [as of today](https://www.minusrus.com/en) are right at 970,000 russian casualties.  But like I said people have just started ignoring that number and using the Ukraine deaths number for casualties.  I can't even imagine how we'd figure out the true number, but it could easily be somewhere in between.

The accuracy of Ukraine's numbers varies greatly by category.  And this is to be expected. Some things are really easy to verify being destroyed - tanks you can see blow up, and Oryx numbers were around 80-85% of Ukraine's at one point. Others are hard - planes you can see get hit, but you often can't tell if it's damaged and returned to base or was destroyed; osint verified plane losses are just a fraction of what Ukraine has claimed and most OSINT now believes that Ukraine is probably counting all hits as ""destroyed"".

First of all, I wouldn't equate Trump/MAGA with being conservative. He has managed to highjack the conservative party and turn much of it into a monstrous, fascist cult. But that's not because he's a conservative, it's just because they tend to be more susceptible to his rhetoric, which also attracted most of the loons in society, who had previously been marginalized. This was exacerbated by the racist backlash over Obama becoming president, and doing a pretty good job of it.

Conservatives tend to more fearful and less flexible in their attitudes - they fear change and anything different, perceiving it as dangerous. This is not dumb, but it makes it easier to sell them on conspiracy theories and the idea that they are being victimized in some way.

Not even all Trump voters are dumb - many are just greedy, narcissistic, and amoral. They know exactly what he is doing, why he is doing it, and what the consequences will be - they just don't care, as long they acquire power and money from it.

How long does it take to train an F-16 pilot?  From ground up, because as I stated, experienced pilots were probably hot swapping jets to fly missions, so the Ukrainian AF probably had none to spare at the beginning of this phase of the war.  The answer is, about the length of this phase of the war (February of 2022 till now, maybe add a couple months from now to be safe). 

Plus the whole of last summer was the ""feeling the Russians out"" phase, which lead to calling more and more of Putin's bluffs over the next six months (remember when he threatened nuclear war if NATO tanks were sent to Ukraine?).  

But a note on F-16 survivability, they are no more rugged than the MiGs or Sukhois when hit by an SA-400.  And if a 2K12 Kub can ID and shoot down a F-117 at night, then F-16s are going to get shot down by SAMs.  On the ground, they are actually much more fragile compared to Soviet aircraft of the same generation.

But personally, I think the whole ""just now starting to train"" pilots is disinformation by NATO.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/1666/military-national-defense.aspx

Now, you can go all in on your fallacy and turn it around: since the United States has always spent gratuitously on defense, you might as well claim the polls were and always have been a big fat lie and the spending figures themselves imply that the population automatically supports them.

Or, you could consider *not* viewing a nation's national history, collective psyche and culture through the prism of ignorant platitudes and logical fallacy.

West Germany spent 3% of gdp on defense during the Cold War because its allied victors and subsequent foreign policy mentors (to put mildly) compelled it to.

Meanwhile, yes, a very strong undercurrent of anti-nationalism and anti-militarism permeated German culture, and no, you can't reverse engineer an entire history of German sociocultural sentiment by looking at how much the German government spent on defense.

They spent that much mainly because their dominant American partners pressured them to. Unsurprisingly, a disconnect can exist between national politics and public sentiment. Or are you going to infer next that France supports pension reforms using the same ""logic""? Governments often do very unpopular things, sometimes for decades at a time.

I tried to (passionately) argue for something other than the most vapid, americentric interpretation of German culture with respect to national defense. But the truth of the matter is that Americans have a very hard time ever admitting they don't know anything when it comes to global politics, especially when it pertains to countries they silently (or loudly) despise, like Germany and France. Especially when those two refused to join the coalition to invade Iraq.

However, if the U.S. only spent the required amount to meet NATO standards, as I believe it should, and reduced its defense spending by over 40%, global security would suffer.  European security would probably suffer.  Who is going to fill that gap?  Germany?  France?

You want to blame America pressuring Germany for Germany meeting its NATO commitments during the Cold War.  If that's the case, then why couldn't America pressure Germany to meet those same commitments post Cold War?

Germany and France were correct to not join the coalition to invade Iraq.  America was strategically, geopolitically, and most of all, morally wrong in committing that action.  America is a superpower, and when taken over by waves of xenophobia and a zeitgeist eager to lash out in revenge led by a Government eager to direct that zeitgeist towards countries that weren't responsible for that zeitgeist, it can make horrific, terrible, mistakes that cost hundreds of thousands of lives.  I don't believe a superpower should be allowed to exist in the world, and as I said, believe America's military should be reduced by over 40%, while still meeting their NATO commitments.

You tried to argue that Germans weren't anti-nationalist or anti-militaristic by citing historical defense spending. I explained why this was a fallacious assumption. 

> However, if the U.S. only spent the required amount to meet NATO standards, as it probably should, and reduced its defense spending by 40%, global security would suffer. European security would probably suffer. Who is going to fill that gap? Germany? 

Who knows. I would start by not electing a Russian puppet who stores classified information in his Mar-a-Lago toilet. Or physically assault the PM of Montenegro, who recently prevented a Russian coup, at a NATO meeting, to then state nobody would fight for Montenegro. Or undermine your own democracy with Kremlin help and attempt a coup in Washington. Or invite over Lavrov and Kislyak to the Oval Office and laugh about firing the head of the FBI for investigating how much of a Russian puppet you are. Or write love letters to Kim Jong-Un and salute his generals. Or extort Zelensky. Or offer Putin chunks of Ukraine.

I mean, those 4 years you might as well have spent nothing on defense at all, because your defense wasn't even capable of preventing a literal Kremlin puppet from taking control of your nuclear arsenal.

> You want to blame America pressuring Germany for Germany meeting its NATO commitments during the Cold War.

The 2% commitment was invented in 2006. The United States also stopped pressuring Germany as much as it did before the Berlin Wall fell, in fact the entire geopolitical landscape changed. I don't see your point.

> And again, the cause of whatever anti-militaristic, anti-nationalistic movements permeated within Germany during the post WWII period were self-inflicted. It wasn't America's fault that Germany had to address the guilt of their own actions.

Let's get one thing straight: given Operation Paperclip, which imported some 1500 Nazis to the United States, some of them responsible for gruesome crimes, the United States has no moral high ground. You are apparently unfamiliar with the true depth of this sickening program and the degree to which it compromised American morals, insofar they ever existed. 

And you are again completely missing the point: it doesn't matter whether German war guilt was attributable to its own actions. Or that American occupational authorities heavily encouraged it. What matters is that you stop nattering about budgets and start understanding the true reasons behind Germany's previous reticence to spend on defense unless compelled/pressured to by their former occupier.

> I don't have an americentric interpretation of German culture with respect to national defense. I have a NATO-centric one.

You haven't shown the slightest hint that you are capable of sufficiently comprehending Germany's aversion to military spending other than by couching it in stereotypical American political propaganda which was very likely originally designed to have Americans accept squalor, poverty and medical bankruptcy while detesting European social democracy.

>  That said, if there must be a Superpower in the world, would you rather it be America, or any of it's potential rivals?

I would rather have a supranational body (American fascists have invented the NWO conspiracy theory to stop this from ever happening) and failing that, I would rather have a multipolar world with the EU emerging as a sovereign entity capable of resisting American, Russian and Chinese bullying. Especially if the Americans elect another FSB mole to oversee their nuclear arsenal and complete the utter destruction of their already extremely flawed justice system and democracy.
