Day 131 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they fired their missiles from Belgorod at a new time again, this time at 2am, yesterday it was 4am, and at 3am the day before. They are now mixing it up, but for some reason they are launching way less missiles now, they fired just 2 missiles again, while the entire month before the last couple of days it was 6-8 missiles daily. Also Russia continues its war against education; yesterday they hit another school with 2 missiles, no military equipment was hurt in the process, and no casualties, but the school is done for. 

There are a couple of problems with those missiles during the night, first one is that it is almost impossible to sleep, but there’s something much worse. When they were firing their missiles at 11pm we always got the warning about launches directly from people living in Belgorod. It might have been unintentional from their side, because they love to show off their Iskander launches, but it did help us here either way. Now, when they are firing them at night, we don’t get the 3 minute warning about missiles, because everyone there is asleep. Air raid alert is usually either late, or it activates just a couple of seconds before impact.

In the past couple of days many Russian ammo depots got destroyed, one of them in Luhansk blew up just a couple of hours ago, which makes the likes of Strelkov furious, he already complained about how shit their high-command is. But the funniest thing was the response from the Russian MOD. They said that they destroyed *3 Ukrainian ammo depots on the territory of the DPR.* They are literally saying that they are hitting their own ammo stockpiles. So we can basically destroy all of their ammo depots, and Russians will take the credit for it. Well, we don’t mind, they can take credit for destroying their own ammo depots; it’s much funnier this way.",False,1656986720.0,t3_vqyp13,t3_vqyp13,,0,89,0,89,2,0,

Obviously this is due to better artillery arriving on the front, but i wonder if anyone(osint or otherwise) has done any math on exactly *how* significant these hits on ammo dumps are.

Like, do each of these explosions delay russia by a day? by more? How far back do they have to build their new depots to avoid them blowing up, and how much of a strain does that put on russian logistics? is it likely that *all* the ammo dumps close to the front are being blown up? did UA find 50%? 10%? 

It sounds like so damn much get blown up that it'll significantly hamper russian progress and hurt their defense, but i'd love to hear if that's just my feeling or actual fact.

The next defensive line in Donbas is the somewhat improvised Siversk-Soledor-Bakhmut line. Bakhmut and Soledor are well fortified as they were the supply line to Severodonetsk, but Siversk is in a lowlying area near the frontlines so it's iffy. Honestly I don't expect this one to hold forever.

After that is the big one, Slovyansk-Kramatorsk-Druzhivka-Kostyantynivika. That's the beating heart of Donetsk, it contains the De-facto capital, Kramatorsk, and it's got people and supplies a plenty. If Ukraine is winning the war, they stop the Rus here.

Because past this line is 120 KM of relatively sparesely populated land that's difficult to defend until you reach Pavlohrad, and even that's somewhat isolated, past that it's more flat sparse land until you reach Dnipro and Zaporizhhia along the Dneiper.(Not to mention a southern turn towards Zaporizhia bypasses Pavlohrad and Dnipro and would allow them to link up with the troops who have been tied down at Vasylivka-Hulyaipol line for months) The SKDK Line is the big stopping point that's critical to the entire South-East, and it's a good one.

Russia has until the end of the Summer Campaigning Season(mid September-early October depending on the weather) when the mud sets in. After that, things are bogged down for a while, and Western Aid over the winter will make offensives on any large scale impossible. If the SKDK line is holding by Canadian Thanksgiving, Ukraine has won. If not....well, it's gonna be a LONG war, and I can't say how it will end.",1656915104.0,1656914428.0,t3_vqyp13,t3_vqyp13,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

phase 1 was the initial blitz and was won by ukraine — it depended a lot on intelligence and subterfuge as well as rapid responses. 

phase 2 was the ability to allocate existing resources.   Russia lost in Kiev and areas outside of Kherson but has won in the areas adjacent to Russia, the only area where they have a distinct advantage over Ukraine because of the location of the border, logistics etc.  Kharkiv is logistically advantageous for a Russians assault but was still not taken.  This was the hugest win for the Ukrainians.  

we are now ending phase 2 timewise and enterring phase 3 which is the ability to generate new forces.  ukraine will likely have the advantage with more powerful western munitions and newly trained soldiers coming in now.  Russians are having trouble getting new soldiers and are running low on their most advanced equipment without a demonstrated ability to produce more than they are losing.  

phase 4 will follow that which is the ability to sustain the generation of new forces.

The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on July 3 that the Russian government’s inability to pay Russian firms supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine is degrading Russia’s ability to repair damaged vehicles. The GUR reported that the directors of Russian military vehicle repair centers are not accepting new Russian equipment for repair because the Russian military has not paid these centers for previous work.[7] Recently proposed Russian legislation suggests that Kremlin leadership shares GUR’s assessment. Russian legislators in the Russian State Duma submitted a bill on June 30 that would empower the Kremlin to introduce “special measures in the economic sphere” enabling the Russian government to force private Russian companies to provide supplies for Russian military operations.[8] The bill prohibits Russian businesses from refusing to fulfil Russian government procurement orders connected to Russian military operations.

Briefly, it seems that the government is unable/unwilling to pay companies for producing and repairing equipment, so the companies are refusing to do so.

Some of the key points in there which are sobering to think about are

- even though ukraine has overall numerical superiority and russian infantry are badly depleted, the sheer volume of russian artillery fires making it possible for them to advance with local superiority because ukrainian units can't concentrate without facing heavy bombardment.

-because of the high volume of volunteers and technical experts, small scale ukrainian units are very creative and egalitarian about planning - there's often a serious debate across the ranks about how best to tackle objectives and the result is creative and complicated plans which allow them to achieve dramatic successes at platoon or company level- but because of the creativity and improvisation these sorts of units can't necessarily coordinate on the scale necessary to launch larger scale counter attacks.

I think some of the key takeaways make perfect sense

- one current major weakness of the russian system are their artillery ammo depots- they need to be close enough to the front line to provide the supplies they need for volume fire and getting ukraine the weapons systems needed to target those (very explosive) depots will help take away one of Russia's major advantages- this is why HIMARS and MLRS are so important.

- western allies need to start to standardise the aid they provide to simplify logistics and training and prepare for a longer war. They also need to help Ukraine not just equip troops to get on the battlefield now, they need to help them train entire new units so their commanders have access to the resources needed to conduct major offensives.

Yes - Ukraine might eventually push back Russia. It will take years to do so. It will rey on the west continuing to not only send weapons but sanction Russia.  


The ""Russia is losing"" people are taking the optimistic view. But to me the most likely scenario is that most of the land Russia controls will still be Russian in a year, and probably in a decade unless there is just a complete collapse of the Russian government.  


We'll basically know whether Ukraine has a chance in the next couple months when the supposed offensives are supposed to start. If they cant make up ground now, its unlikely to happen any time soon.  


And frankly, being sanctioned like they are DECREASSES the odds of their government falling apart. It creates an us vs them war footing that will allow the current government to consolidate its hold and convince the citizens of Russia to accept sacrifices (see North Korea, Cuba, and Iran for examples of harsh US sanctions regimes ensuring the decades long rule of one government)

They lacked resources and couldn't keep their forces supplied and motivated to keep fighting. Not to mention the massive internal issues by the collapse of the economy and starvation. 

As such, if Ukraine keeps getting supplied, keeps their western trained troops treated in Western hospitals, given a salary with western cash, supplied with NATO ammo, helmets, boots and meal rations. Their artillery sent to EU factories for maintenance and upgrades, while the massive military complex of the US and EU are being funded to supply and arm Ukraine for the long haul.

While Russia, alone, with limited resources and having just barely begun militarizing their economy, showing signs of lacking the logistics of maintaining and replacing overused artillery equipments.   

Barely training their troops and overwhelming their national healthcare system in treating their wounded troops. Sending in military hardware which is seen as obsolete against modern anti-tank equipment of which Ukraine are being sent 140 000 of by the US.

Fighting in areas with partisan activities with attacks on troops, bombings aimed against collaborators, intel given to the Ukrainian forces of Russian military locations in occupied territories.

Russia is facing manpower shortages, caused by it's lack of political will to initiate mass mobilization. Probably acknowledging that they lack the logistics of doing such a feat in an efficient matter, and not risk draining their political capital with limited military gains.

The longer this battle goes on, the more we will see the capabilities of the Russian armed forces, and so far it's surprised us with its incapabilities and numerous weaknesses. We'll see if their artillery will stay efficient, after it has fired enough, that it no longer has it's accuracy and will need to be replaced, or be sent to the factory for repairs.

As we've seen the last 120 days have been basically the opposite, Ukraine aimed to drag the fighting out, deny the russians a decisive victory and wait for supplies from the west to arrive.

I don't expect China to donate military hardware to Russia to engage in a ''proxy war'' with the west, it's unlikely they have any interest in confronting them in such a way. 

India needs oil, it has no ideological sympathy towards Russian claims on a neighbour, they have enough with their own conflicts over land and need their hardware for themselves.

The west however having lost no soldier, and sending what can only be described as ''The tools we were to use if the russians came''. Which basically means, any use of it against the Russians means less potential danger against our own national security. A good investment and a testing ground of their own equipment and weapons against a regional military power.

What does hurt is the economy, of which the west is using the time wisely, cutting use of resources supplied by Russia and making deals in Africa and the Middle East while upgrading their infrastructure for when these supplies arrive.

Time is more on the side of Ukraine, they are given western cash to avoid collapse, western military equipment to hold their ground and defend their shores. And are training their troops in the west to face barely trained and limited supplied troops from Russia. 

The more time, the more troops, the more equipment, the more the West can cut off the Russian economy, the more attrition for russian equipment, the more bombings and fires in occupied territories and inside Russia.

Russia is bluffing, trying to look strong to have a decent hand in the peace negotiations. Unlike Russia, the EU and US has the economical might to apply their threats into reality, Russia can't replace their export market to EU, they cannot replace western produced equipment, they cant win this war. 

They can scar the land as much as they wish, kill as many civilians they can, however they will not be able to impose their will upon Ukraine and the West.

They must be utterly defeated and leaders replaced. This applies on a practical level but also a moral one. Russia has committed such atrocities that there is serious moral hazard in even speaking with these people. 

How is victory achieved? With difficulty, help and unity. And persistence and tenacity. 

But to accept defeat is to pay a vastly higher price in the next decade or so and perhaps a regressive realignment in the imperfect but broadly speaking peaceful status quo. 

Russia, sadly, needs a fundamental reawakening as a race and culture in order to join a mostly civilised world. Their youth need to organise and rise up and not accept the status quo.

Ukraine is unlikely to be able to significantly breach those boundaries - Ukraine needs to take as much as it can now that Russia is on the offensive, because once Russia goes on the defensive, Ukraine has basically no shot.

With all due respect, this won't be the case for a long long time.

Even IF Russia somehow manages to take over the entire Ukraine tomorrow while suffering no further loss, it will still take them years, decade, or likely several decades to build their military and economy back up to the pre-war relative level (compared to NATO countries).  It will then take few more years / decade(s) until they can prove to be an actual threat against NATO countries again.  Realistically, that (conquering Ukrain without any more loss) isn't going to happen, so it will take them even longer to recover.

All in all, that might well be another 50, 70 or 100+ years before NATO will have to ""deal with Russia in Western Europe"".  A lot of things might have changed by then - leaderships, directions, nature of warfare, etc - and if Russia will still be hellbent on expanding, well, it will be up to our grandchildren or greatgrandchildren's generation to deal with them.

Yes many of those troops might not be in the army any more but when it seems their army actually took that training seriously that means that those lessons are more likely to help shape the attitudes and practices of their army.

I think it's hilarious you took the time to try and tell me this.  I've spent a lot of time designing radio equipment for defense applications, though I've retired and I'm a lowly schoolteacher now. No, the far field strength of radio transmissions falls off with the inverse square of distance, as mentioned in my comment.

You're the same distance from the satellites (approximately) whether you're 1 mile or 10 miles away from the jammer; but the jammer is 1/100th as strong (and even this makes favorable assumptions for the jammer; no terrain obstruction, no attenuation from the medium, no negative multipath effects, etc).  And GPS has significant spreading and coding gain, so even the relatively weak signals on the satellite can be pulled from under a rather high noise floor.

But the other thing mentioned in my comment is tracking and phased array gain.  Military receivers both know the aspect of the incoming satellite signal and can have gain, and *also* steer nulls in directions of interference.  All these countermeasures come apart in the presence of receiver overload, which can only really happen when you're really close to the jammer.",1656963016.0,1656962835.0,t3_vqyp13,t1_ieuq27k,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Also since he keeps his head down he'd be much better with regards to easing tensions. Medvedev, after all his comments about nuking and destroying the west, doesnt seem to me to have much chance of easing tensions or giving the west much confidence. 

If anything he's more likely to lean further into escalation as a way of keeping power. 

Any Russian leader who acknowledges the loss of Crimea is going to face the same legacy as any Ukrainian leader who would try to let Russia have it. There are plenty of Russians who don't even support Putin who still consider Crimea as belonging to Russia. No Russian politician is going to want to volunteer to be the fall guy who will, like Gorbachev, go down in national history as the one who sold the country out. Possibly someone will be ""chosen"" to take the fall and the blame, and again I see Mishustin as the more likely candidate than Medvedev in that case. 

That's my take on it anyway. It's an absolute mess. Quite a few players who will want the throne but no one will want to tie their legacy to failure.

Having an ungodly amount of arty doesn’t matter if RF soldiers stop fighting, while Ukraine becomes emboldened, supply lines can be cut and intel can prove more damaging than shells with precise targeting of depots & command posts by drones.

My entire point is that this degree of unbridled optimism actually hurts Ukraine, when people make serious expectations of the war to be over soon (hint: it wont be) it hurts actual discussion about real long term planning to help Ukraine.

We need to send consistent, unending weapon shipments. 

We need to be training more Ukrainian soldiers on more advanced weapon systems, particularly aircraft.

In truth, like thousands of other young Ukrainians wanting to become involved in their country’s resistance struggle, he has never experienced real combat.

“Which is why they \[the Ukrainian army and territorial defence\] will probably tell me to fuck off,” he reasoned. “They don’t accept people with no military experience to local armed groups. They are ‘full’ already.”

Less than two weeks since the Russian assault, tens of thousands of Ukrainians have flocked to defence centres around the nation to join the armed resistance, outstripping munitions to the point where many are now being turned away.

Some people are even trying to bribe military officials in a desperate bid to be considered for duty, according to several would-be volunteers who spoke to VICE World News.""

 It’s a stark contrast to the Russian side, where the country’s Ministry of Defence admitted Wednesday that conscripts had been illegally deployed to Ukraine, and reports are emerging of soldiers being extorted and coerced into waging a war many don’t believe in.

“Basically,” Savchuk said in a message, “you need to give bribes IN ORDER to join the army \[in Ukraine\].”

We can pick any hard fought battle in a city at any time in the 20th century or 21st.  We could talk about Vicksburg in US civil war or Carthage in the Punic wars.  When the Romans sacked Carthage they were not using new 21st century artillery systems.  The claim is that Sevastopol will be different because Ukraine is receiving MLRS and M777 artillery options and perhaps Javelin.  We have good examples of a military in possession of these same weapons systems .  

I am giving Ukraine Armed Forces the benefit of the doubt and suggesting they might use the weapons with similar proficiency to the United States Marine Corps.  I have friends and co-workers in the military.  I like them and mean no disrespect.  You do not want the Marine Corps taking your home town by force.  There is no ""good way"" to take a city held by determined defenders.  There are only ""worse ways"".  

Sevastopol may be an exceptional case.  It has been a naval base for over a century.  It was ravaged by WW2 and rebuilt by Soviet engineers with defense in mind.  So differences with cities like Fallujah might be large because we should expect the damage to be much worse.  The vast majority of Fallujah's civilian population fled before the attack.  

From Wikipedia: ""Of the roughly 50,000 buildings in Fallujah, between 7,000 and 10,000 were estimated to have been destroyed in the offensive and from half to two-thirds of the remaining buildings had notable damage.""

>The battalion commander shrugged helplessly when we advised him that five days was a completely inadequate amount of time in which to train his soldiers. “This is all we have—they are needed on the front,” he replied with grim finality. A few days later, on a separate course that we were running for his medics, half of our class disappeared on the second day. “We have had casualties,” was the only explanation we received. Even in units that fall within the Ukrainian special operations command, most soldiers are sent to the front line with very little training. In one such unit, we estimated that just 20 percent had even fired a weapon before heading to combat.

>On May 3, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that allows territorial defense units—the country’s home guard—to be deployed to combat outside their home regions. These units are manned by local volunteers who typically have received very little preparation. We were soon swamped by requests for training courses. In the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, a town hall meeting to explain the new policy to local territorial defense volunteers was disrupted by wives alarmed at the prospect of their part-time soldier husbands deploying to the front.

>Every day in the current fighting, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month, around sixty to one hundred Ukrainian soldiers are killed and another five hundred wounded in combat. A more recent New York Times article puts that figure much higher—at one hundred to two hundred deaths a day. To put that in context, during the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam, one of the bloodiest periods of the war, US deaths were roughly two hundred a week—and among a force almost twice the size of the Ukrainian army.

The thesis of the article itself is that Russia spends more on its military than is commonly understood and they are likely to be able to continue such spending in the future. 

Having said that I only quoted the pertinent pasage as it pertains to real Russian defence spending, littearly nothing else. I made no claims as to Russian milattry itself, just spending. 

If you want to have a discussion on Russian military performance, or how the west would do in similar circumstances against a near-peer enemy that is a different discussion than then the one we are having. 

On that topic, I recently read an intersting article by David Johnson. A retired army Colonel who is a Ph.D. schooler at the Modern War Institute at West Point.

The people they're sending are largely for propeganda purposes and to keep Ukraine in the public eye so the international $/weapons keeps flowing. They're a token force.

I'm not suggesting they are throwing untrained people into the meat grinder, that's actually what is happening.

Just for fun, I'll bite on your point because you should be able to see how silly it is. Russia, France and the UK ostensibly spend similar amounts in real dollars on defence. Yet, Russia maintains a force that is 4 to 5 times larger with many factors more military hardware. While being able to develop their own weapon systems such as the Pantsir S-500, SU-57, T-14, hypersonic missiles etc. Also while maintaining the world's largest nuclear arsenal.

The UK has 15,000 infantry. France has 500 operational battle tanks. The entire stockpile of UK ammunition would last 1 week in Ukraine. Neither of these countries would be able to fight the war Russia is fighting. They simply don't have anywhere near the military hardware, ammunition or personnel.

This is no longer the mobile warfare that characterised the opening month - this is an artillery slugest and they are running dangerously low on 152mm caliber ammo. They are already getting outshelled [10:1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/10/ukraine-ammunition-donbas-russia/) to conserve ammo, as no one on Earth (outside Russia) produces enough of the 152mm caliber to come anywhere *close* to the requirements of this type of warfare. Ofc they are transitioning to NATO 155mm stuff, but the stuff they have been pledged is barely a fraction of what they had going into this war, for example [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Ukrainian_Ground_Forces#Field_artillery):

- field artillery: 800 pre-war, 0 pledged

- Towed artillery: 525 pre-war, <200 pledged

- Self-propelled artillery: 700pre-war, <200 pledged

- rocket artillery: 500 pre-war, <40 pledged

Once the 152mm ammo runs out, they will be relying purely on NATO stocks which clearly are inadequate. 

In terms of manpower losses, Ukraine government don't give official numbers but they must be catastrophic if they are getting 10 times the number of shells launched at them as they are firing back. This is also supported by numerous [anecdotes](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1544031169196556290).

The thing with invasions is that territory gains do not happen linearly, it's like chopping a tree - you take alot of swings which look like you aren't doing much, but as soon as it starts to fall, it happens all at once. As soon as Ukraine runs out of people and material to properly reinforce the line, the front will totally collapse into disaray.",False,1656992585.0,t3_vqyp13,t1_ietj5kz,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
