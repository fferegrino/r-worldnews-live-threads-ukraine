The London maritime market of insurers declared all sea waters of the Russian Federation a ""military zone"" (not only the Black Sea, but also the Baltic and the ports of the Far East).  
What is London Marine Insurance Market❓  
It is the largest market in the world (about a third of the insurance market share of all merchant ships in the world).  
It was there (at Lloyds) that this market originated in the 17th century and it is he who sets the rules for the whole world: model contracts, insurance premiums and much more.  
What does it mean to declare a maritime territory a ""military zone""❓  
Now, when a ship is about to enter such territory, the owner of the ship is required to notify his insurer and pay a special ""war premium"".  
Such premiums reach up to 5% of the cost of the entire vessel. For example, a typical ship costs $30 million and the insurance premium to enter the ""war zone"" reaches $1.5 million.  
That is, to justify this, the ship must be loaded with something super expensive (such as microchips or drugs).Now, not a single ship owned by companies from rich countries will simply go there - it is unprofitable.  
This news makes it virtually impossible for Russia to trade with a very large part of the world.

Rather than embrace a new identity as merely Russian (which is still a multi-ethnic state), they think in terms of Russian history, which for them means primarily the Soviet Union's history.  

Take a quick survey of where the Soviet Union's leaders fall in terms of ethnic identity:  

- Vladimir Lenin⁠—wide mix of ethnicities
- (Leon Trotsky, Lenin's chosen successor but never in power due to coup)⁠—born in Ukraine
- Josef Stalin⁠—Georgian
- (Georgy Malenkov)⁠—Russian via Macedonian immigrants, but nobody cares about Malenkov, that's like asking Americans what they think of Millard Fillmore
- Nikita Khrushchev⁠—Russian, but born in Kursk on the Ukrainian border, worked and lived in Ukraine all his life
- Leonid Brezhnev⁠—born in Ukraine
- Yuri Andropov⁠—Ukr father, Russian mother
- Konstantin Chernenko⁠—born in Siberia, but his surname is central Ukrainian
- Mikhail Gorbachev⁠—Russian father, Ukr mother

Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Gorbachev had Ukrainian wives.  Brezhnev was from Dnipropetrovsk.  Khrushchev worked and lived in Donetsk.  Andropov's father was a Don Cossack.  Gorbachev's maternal family was from Chernihiv and he married a woman from Chernihiv.  Trotsky was from western Ukraine and later worked in Odessa.  

Ukraine's an inextricable part of not just Soviet history, but Soviet leadership, especially in its last forty years.  The current Russian government has very little ideologically in common with the old Soviet government, but because Russians perceive continuity there, they have a mental block to the sovereignty of Ukraine.

The only question is how many more Ukrainians the Russian military will kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, borrow a little determination.

Day 42 of my updates from Kharkiv.

As usual most of the day was pretty quiet with some shelling from time to time and our artillery firing somewhere, but it’s somewhat difficult differentiating between incoming shelling and our artillery, they both sound similar but have different shockwaves/tremors. Around 9 pm shelling intensified again and our AA defenses started doing some work. Russians definitely become more active when it gets dark. 

Just a couple of hours ago Russia said that Ukraine is planning to blow up storage with 120 tons of chlorine around 80 km away from Kharkiv just so we can accuse Russia of doing it. What the fuck are they even thinking? Why would we need to do anything more to make them look bad, when they are doing such a great job of making themselves look like shit even without our help.

Why does Russia always think that the world wants to destroy them? Well, it does now, but nobody even cared about them until they started this war. They have been talking about Ukraine constantly for the last 8 years on their main media channels as if they had nothing else to do, we do know why they did it now, but at the time we didn’t understand it. 

On their own news channels, they talked about Ukraine more than about Russia and that always weirded us out. We never understood why they were so obsessed with us. They think that we were talking about them too, but in reality our news channels pretty much never talked about Russia, we had enough problems of our own, so we didn't have time to talk about Russia.

Update: Apparently Russia lives in the past as the place that had chlorine (Zavod ""Khimprom"") in Pervomais'kyi doesn't exist since 2011. The whole factory was literally blown up around 2013, there's only ruins there now. Are they even serious with this, is all their information that old? Their MOD literally reported this and the place that is supposed to be blown up by us doesn't even exist anymore, wtf?

The US now believes “it will be able to identify the Russian units” that carried out the atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, according to a US official familiar with the latest information. 

Identification of those involved “is an extremely high priority now” for the US intelligence community, the official said.

Collecting and analyzing streams of intelligence using all available tools and assets has been underway since the atrocities came to light, and the US is at the point of “narrowing down” responsibility the official said. 

It’s not certain the US would announce its findings publicly and a decision could be made to leave it to Ukraine, the official said. The US is also analyzing possible indicators that more than one Russian unit or group of fighters was in Bucha during the time the atrocities occurred.

From CNN’s Mia Alberti

The ""age of engagement with Russia is over,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said at a dinner with NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a statement from UK Foreign Office released ahead of the dinner.

In her remarks, Truss told her NATO counterparts that the ""NATO-Russia Founding Act is dead and it is time to cast off an outdated approach to handling Russia,” the foreign office said.

The Act, signed in 1997, rules that ""NATO and Russia do not consider one another adversaries"", according to the original document.

“The age of engagement with Russia is over. We need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defense, and deterrence"", Truss said.

Truss’s remarks come as NATO foreign ministers convene in Brussels to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

According to the statement sent to CNN, Truss underlined that NATO cannot allow ""security vacuums"" at the alliance's Eastern borders and should ""rethink"" support for countries ""caught in the web of Russian influence"" such as Georgia, Moldova, Sweden and Finland. 

The foreign secretary also urged her partners to toughen sanctions and arm Ukraine ""quickly and decisively ... to ensure Putin fails.""

Truss also said she is working with her G7 counterparts to impose more sanctions on further Russian banks, according to an op-ed published in The Telegraph on Wednesday. In the article, Truss defended increasing NATO spending and presence in Eastern Europe.

""For NATO to remain at the vanguard of global security, it must be bold. As President Eisenhower, the alliance’s first supreme commander, said: “History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid,” the Foreign Secretary wrote.",False,1649297184.0,t3_txb0ov,t3_txb0ov,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

These last few days were very rough to stomach. One one hand, I am grateful for the Russian ground withdrawal and more goodies to Ukraine. On the other, the repeated missile attacks and the massive civilian carnage in it’s wake is so hard to bear. Watched a video of a woman in Bucha in front of her demolished apartment building, and it tore me up. She has nothing, her neighbors on the first floor are probably dead under the rubble, she has nowhere to go, and is being brave for her daughter. There were dead bodies (covered) all around and not picked up yet. Now the officials say Russians took many people and transported them to camps in Russia.

On top of the human devastation, the economic and environmental abuse Russia waged on Ukraine is unfathomable. Can Russia just use that as an excuse and just withdraw completely?

The US has sent the 100 switchblade drones that they said would be provided to the Ukrainian military, and “they’ll be getting into Ukraine quickly if they aren’t already there,” said a Defense Department official.

“We’re in discussions with the Ukrainians about future usages of switchblade drones, and of course we’ll keep that option open going forward,” said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.

The small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to a company that produces the drones.

Kirby also said that the US has trained “a very small number of Ukrainian soldiers who were already in the United States and had been since the fall” on the drones before they returned to Ukraine to train others. 

“An individual could be suitably trained on how to use the switchblade drone in about two days or so,” said Kirby.

He also said that the US would “look at other suitable opportunities if needed to provide more training on the switchblades if it’s necessary.”",False,1649274572.0,t3_txb0ov,t3_txb0ov,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Poland is buying 250 Abrams tanks from the United States in a $4.75 billion deal signed Tuesday in Warsaw.  
  
Deliveries are slated to start later this year as Poland, a NATO member that borders Ukraine in the east, ramps up its defenses following Russia's invasion of its neighbor.  
  
The top-of-the-line US tanks will go to the Polish Army’s 18th Mechanized Division, which is based near the border with Ukraine.  
  
“The task of these tanks, and the consequence of the fact that the Polish authorities are developing the Polish Army, is to deter a potential aggressor. We all are aware of what is happening beyond our eastern border,” Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak said in a statement.  
The deal includes maintenance vehicles, portable bridges, training and logistics as well as ammunition, Błaszczak said.  
  
“This is a very important reinforcement of the Polish Armed Forces,” he said.  
The Defense Ministry said the deal, first agreed last July, is one of the largest in Polish history.

>While the letter acknowledges the strained ties between Washington and Ankara, it also describes U.S. sanctions and Turkey’s removal from the F-35 program because of its purchase of the Russian-made S-400s “a significant price paid.”

>The key quote: “The Administration believes that there are nonetheless compelling long-term NATO Alliance unity capability interests, as well as U.S. national security, economic, and commercial interests that are supported by appropriate U.S. defense  trade ties with Turkey.”

>Another key bit from the letter is where it highlights Turkey’s role in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: “Turkey’s support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and cooperative defense relations are an important deterrent to malign influence in the region,” it says.

>Again, the letter does NOT voice any explicit support, makes it clear this is far from a done deal and reaffirms that the USG will follow standard arms sales procedures. “The proposed sale will require a Congressional notification if the Department of State were to approve it.”

Orbán: Hungary 'will not give in' to pressure to extend EU sanctions against Russia's oil and gas

Reuters is carrying a little extra detail from Viktor Orbán’s press conference here which could be significant for the future. The Hungarian prime minister, fresh from winning his fourth consecutive election, told reporters Hungary must strengthen its alliance with Poland as it is a strategic alliance within the European Union.

Crucially, in response to a question about a disciplinary procedure flagged by the European Commission yesterday, Orban said Hungary would wait to see the EU’s letter, but “will not give in” to pressure to support an expansion of sanctions against Russia to oil and gas shipments, as that was a “red line” for Hungary.

""Statement by Alexey Miller, Head of the Management Board, Deputy Head of the Board of Directors of OAO Gazprom.
Since February 24, Russia has been conducting a special operation in Ukraine with the aim of denazification and demilitarization, as well as protecting the population of Donbass from genocide by Kyiv. Vladimir Putin called the operation a necessary measure due to security risks.
At the time of the start of the operation, they did not communicate with economists and managers, they did not calculate the risks, they did not ask the people either.
Recently, I had an unpleasant conversation with a high official, after which unknown people began to threaten me, who, apparently, are FSB officers.
I want to inform you that my experience and strength will be enough for an adequate response to such impulses addressed to me. Try, for starters, to find a more effective manager! Gazprom did everything to keep the rate at the pre-war level, and the citizens of Russia did not feel the economic consequences.
Since March 2018, I have been under sanctions from the UK and Australia, I have been banned from entering and my assets have been blocked, but despite this, I continue to develop Gazprom. Today, our company has united more than 500 thousand employees, and I am sure that the Russian people ""will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors.""
As a patriot, I will support the bright future of Russia and the development of all spheres of its life. I reject and despise the violence now carried out by the regime of my country.
I believe that I can become a worthy replacement and a successful leader for our great Motherland, choosing the path of economic development and prosperity. I ask all my associates, friends and acquaintances to support the alternative position. Our country is on the verge of default, and as a patriot, as well as an experienced economist, I cannot and do not want to allow this!

👉🆕 Mariupol's Mayor, Vadym Boichenko, claims Russian mobile crematoriums operate in the city, and that ""DPR"" separatists together with local pro-Russian collaborators have formed special units to collect all evidence of tortured and killed civilians for burning, as well as hunt down any potential eyewitnesses, with the process allegedly being coordinated by Russian-appointed ""Mayor"" Konstantin Ivashchenko. 

Boichenko says the scale of tragedy seen in Mariupol has not been seen ""since the time of the Nazi concentration camps"", that Russian forces have turned the whole city into a ""death camp"", and the reason they're not allowing aid workers, Red Cross representatives or even accepting Turkey's offer to evacuate civilians out by sea, is that it would reveal the vast numbers of civilian dead in the city

👉🆕 Ukraine's military intelligence claims Russian forces in Mariupol are preparing a large-scale provocation in Mariupol, gathering bodies of residents killed in the city to stage it to look like Ukrainian forces have used civilians as human shields

👉🆕 Kyiv officials claim today that 89 people (4 children) have been killed so far in the capital by Russian strikes, with 398 wounded (20 children)

Author: Eugene Finkel is an associate professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “Ordinary Jews: Choice and Survival during the Holocaust.”

>Genocide is unfolding before our eyes. Often called “the crime of crimes,” genocide is considered the absolute nadir of human behavior. Activists and politicians tend to apply this label to anything they deplore, even to the vaccination of children against the coronavirus. That degrades the crime, cheapening it. As a scholar of the Holocaust and a descendant of Holocaust survivors, I am well aware of the need for caution, and in the past have criticized the governments of many post-Soviet states — including Ukraine, where I was born — for misusing the term. Not now.  
>  
>Contrary to popular perceptions, shaped by the Holocaust and Rwanda, perpetrating genocide does not require large numbers of victims. The intent and logic of targeting are the key. The 1948 U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”  
>  
>This definition is not without drawbacks. An updated version might expand protected groups to include those defined by gender, age or sexual identity. The document also does not define, in absolute numbers or percentages, when killings cross the line into genocide; “in whole or in part” is open to interpretation. And proving intent is difficult, especially if orders were given orally or were camouflaged by bureaucratic jargon.  
>  
>The violence in Ukraine has none of these issues. Bucha, near Kyiv, is just one town, but the horrifying murders there are a part of a broader pattern. Deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians, especially those who self-identify as Ukrainians, with bombardment, murder and abduction have been recorded in other parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine.  
>  
>Yet massacres alone are insufficient to meet the genocide criteria; an intent to destroy a protected group is required. The inflammatory rhetoric of Russian propaganda and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself rejecting the very idea of Ukrainian statehood do not on their own constitute proof of an intent to destroy a national group. Trying to engineer regime change in Kyiv or Ukraine’s reorientation from the West toward Russia would not constitute genocide. The Russian invasion almost certainly originally aimed to achieve these goals.  
>  
>But when Russian soldiers and leaders discovered, to their astonishment, that Ukrainian citizens had no desire to be liberated from the Western yoke and instead fought back ferociously, Russian thinking shifted from colonial to genocidal.  
>  
>Though evidence of this shift is abundant, one of the most explicit examples is an article, titled “What should Russia do with Ukraine,” published on April 3 by the Russian state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti. Echoing the arguments made earlier by Putin and other Russian leaders, the article outlines a clear plan to destroy Ukrainians and Ukraine itself. After a Russian victory, it argues, Ukraine “is impossible as a nation state,” and its very name “likely cannot be retained.” The Ukrainian nationalist elite “need to be liquidated, its reeducation is impossible.” But a “substantial part of the populace” is “also guilty” and would require “reeducation” and “ideological repressions” lasting “at least a generation” and would “inevitably mean de-Ukrainization.”  
>  
>***The combination of official statements denying Ukraine and Ukrainians the right to exist, and mounting evidence of deliberate, large-scale targeting of Ukrainian civilians, leaves little room for doubt. The threshold from war crimes to genocide has been crossed*****.**

>The Russian Army might be in worse shape than imagined (and Ive probably been about as skeptical about their condition as anyone since this started). It also looks like Putin doesnt trust forces that were not sent to Ukraine in the first place.

>Why? There are signs that the Russians want to send the troops that have pulled out of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy into the Donbas quickly, including those responsible for the Bucha massacre.

>Pentagon sources are saying that the plan is to send about two-thirds of the forces that the Russians have pulled out of the north and redeploy to the south and east.

>If so, this is an army in terrible shape and running out of options. These troops have been worn down, defeated, lost much of their equipment and would under any circumstances be close to being combat ineffective.

>Combat ineffectiveness is not a science, but throughout history unit performance has degraded considerably when these factors rise: losses of personnel and equipment, time in combat operations, battlefield failure. All of these are now high for the Russian forces being redeployed

>Those troops in any rational system would be rested, re-equipped and allowed time before being sent to another stressful combat situation. That Putin is going to try and do it with these forces reveals these 4 things which show how difficult the long-war scenario is for Russia.

>1) The Russians dont trust the rest of their armed forces. If they could, they would be sending fresh troops into combat not these that have suffered such losses.

>2) They are willing to basically see the best part of their army wiped out in the first phase of the war. If for some reason they can get these troops back to other parts of Ukraine and they go into combat again, hard to see what would be left of them after a few weeks.

>3) They dont care about the morale of their own forces. This is particularly toxic. If the Russian soldiers believe that they are basically cannon fodder for the leadership, their willingness to fight will decline below what it already is.

>4) The Russians are out of ideas. If you are sending troops that have committed some of the worst crimes back into Ukraine, they will only motivate Ukrainian resistance (which has already shown itself to be effective) to even higher levels. Its a stupid idea.

>What does it mean? Russia really does not want to fight a long war and Ukraine has a real opportunity. If the Ukrainians can be resupplied and redeployed to meet the Russian redeployments, they can basically waste the only combat force the Russian government believes in.

>Thats why its so important to get help to Ukraine now. Give them the opportunity to destroy the Russian forces that will be redeployed from Kyiv and they can force Putin to take a choice he is clearly terrified to make. Fight a long war with conscripts or forces he doesnt trust.

>An interesting point worth expanding this thread on. I’ve always tried to imagine a negotiated end to this war as there will have to be one (Ukraine is not conquering Russia). Reality now though is that negotiations are meaningless until…

>We’ve had another test of arms in the Donbas. Putin is clearly trying to use military force to save something he can call a victory from the original failure. Until that contest is decided, negotiations can’t decide anything. So keep talking, yes…

>But most importantly help Ukraine to militarily succeed in the Donbas by degrading the one force the Russian government trusts. Then negotiate.

>Two things to note here. U.K. MOD map also has Russian forces almost all gone from northern Ukraine. They are also putting more stress on the time needed to reequip the withdrawn forces. Sensible. This is not easy. If the Russians send those troops quickly, it’s a sign of panic.",False,1649273565.0,t3_txb0ov,t3_txb0ov,,0,28,0,28,1,0,

For one, the still-frame they posted wasn't even a POW, it's a Ukrainian soldier holding up stuff they captured for the camera. 

Based on the striped shirts visible, it appears this was an VDV unit ambushed on their BMD-2. This vehicle holds 2 inside as the driver and gunner, while the rest ride on top. The guys on top were gunned down and you can see the BMD's track marks leading from their bodies to the side of the road where it swerved off and stopped. The BMD itself seems mostly unharmed so they didn't use any AT weapons on it.

Ukrainians claim on camera to have captured two officers alive, presumably because they had the privilege of riding inside the BMD.

The video ends with the misleading still-frame posted by NYT as the Ukrainians celebrate after restarting the BMD-2's engine.

As for the one they shot, you can see at the start of the Telegram video. If you go to the NYT update, you can get a direct link to the video, but reddit automod filters out telegram links so I can't post it here.

The one Ukrainian soldiers shot was twitching in a pool of blood and in apparent agonal breathing. 

There was also another mostly dead Russian soldier on his stomach with hands tied behind his back with an obviously fatal brain injury, but the Ukrainians didn't bother with finishing him off.

The Netherlands has detained 14 super-yachts with Russian ownership, frozen 516 million euros ($563 million) assets and blocked 155 million euros ($169 million) in transactions as part of the sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Wopke Hoekstra said Wednesday.

In a letter to the Dutch Parliament, Hoekstra explained 12 yachts were currently under construction at five shipyards in the Netherlands for “so-called Russian ‘ultimate beneficial owners.’”

While some of the owners do not appear on the European sanctions list, “due to the current export measures, these vessels are not allowed to be delivered at the moment,"" he said, adding that “the ownership structures of these yachts are under further investigation.”

In addition to those 12, Hoekstra said two yachts under maintenance at Dutch yards had been placed under stricter customs supervision, and “the relationship of one of these yachts to a person named on the European sanction lists is being investigated.”

Since the first sanctions were introduced, “almost 30,000 containers in transit to Russia/Belarus have been stopped,” at the Port of Rotterdam, and they were investigated to “determine whether they fall under the sanctions measures,” he added.

Of those investigations approximately 5,500 containers have been held on suspicion of containing luxury goods with a value of 300 euros ($350) per item. “If that is the case, these goods may not be sent to Russia/Belarus,” said Hoekstra.

Dutch customs officials have also made 3,300 checks on cargo shipments. Following investigations, nine shipments were held as they included, “parts for diesel engines, equipment for the oil industry and cryptographic goods (data security),” noted Hoekstra, adding that, “these goods are returned to the exporter and therefore not to the originally specified destination.”",False,1649247980.0,t3_txb0ov,t3_txb0ov,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

We produce more food and energy than we consume, and our defense industry is fully domestic, so I think most basic needs are covered.

I thought of 4 potential direct supply/economic leverages against the US - let me know if I’m missing something important:

1. Semiconductors - Taiwan and Korea are our allies and we made huge investments into ramping our production up. Those two nations can still lose capability to produce due to war, but that’s more like everyone getting messed up - not a leverage an unfriendly nation has over the US.

2. Rare earth metals - I know US has tons in the rockies alone, we just import it from China etc. because we don’t want to pollute at home. I think this is a slight issue since it will take a bit to get going if we lost foreign sources but (1) it’s not as essential as food or energy (2) at the end of the day, we have tons of it (the pollution will suck, and it’s be kinda shitty while the production ramps up).

3. US debt to China - not worried personally, it will hurt the Chinese economy more if they fucked with it - and it’s not ideal, but we can always take the ball and go home if they want to play hardball with USD.

4. Cheap labor - cost of goods will rise, but nothing crippling. Like if US had to shut down all the sneakers factories in China, the costs will rise, but I don’t think there is anything that US won’t be able to deal with. US has been diversifying its labor sources after all.

I’m not saying none of these 4 will hurt, but I’m think US is capable of handling those issues if needed (or is not a credible threat).

Would love to know if I’m missing any threats or am taking any of the above 4 too lightly.",1649291113.0,1649290598.0,t3_txb0ov,t3_txb0ov,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Ukraine will move forces from the north to make strategic strikes against Russian supply lines in the south and the Russian forces will fall back before they can be cut off.

Russian lines from before this invasion are heavily fortified and entrenched, so the Russian army will withdraw behind those (or into Russia).

I feel the same about Russian soldiers as I do those abused animals. I don’t hate them. I fear them, I take great care not to get bit, because that is what they do. But I DO hate the people who purposefully do that to them. Evil people turn them in to monsters for their own evil purposes.

I understand the arguments that most people make that Russia would need to either approve its own removal since it has veto power, or the UN would need to be dissolved, but this is simply false. 

It does not need to be dissolved to remove the permanent veto. The UN has since the very beginning undergone efforts to reform various aspects, and now is the time for that to happen. There are other reforms which can take place during that process which many other members have wanted to see, and by all accounts there are many reforms that have been a long time coming.

No nation should have veto power when it is unwilling to uphold its principals. No nation should sit on the security council that acts as a belligerent on the world stage antagonizing, invading, and committing genocide while using the body as a means to help enabled those acts. 

Zelenskyy is correct, Russia needs to be removed from the UN, at the very least from positions of power, but he is incorrect in stating that it needs to be dissolved to do so.

The above is a direct message to Germany and to other countries about Germany. There's no way it could be anything else. He has said it in other ways, too, but Germany's insistence on Russian gas is literally sending money to Russia that is being funneled back into the war machine to kill Ukrainians. 

History is going to show that Germany was not willing to make hard decisions. Austerity without Russian gas is not easy, and it would cripple ir stop parts of the economy. But that's the choice Germany has to make. Are they choosing economic issues or financing war crimes on a massive scale in Ukraine? 

It's uncomfortable for Russian-dependent countries like Germany because there are no ""easy"" answers; every answer is difficult. Even if they do nothing and continue to pay Russia, it is not going to be an easy road forward in the international community as long as Zelinskyy keeps the pressure on. He is 100% within his moral right to keep the pressure on. Nobody disputes that, not even Germany. The fact that Germany supported austerity for countries like Greece and Spain but insists that they cannot do it is hypocritical.

Not only does it inflict untold suffering on the innocent--and especially the most vulnerable--it has the exceptionally pernicious effect of mutilating the moral core of the aggressor increasing the cruelty and perceived necessity of horribleness on his part. It is the nature of offensive war that creates these conditions--when people justly defend their homes and inflict death and pain on the aggressors, the aggressors respond like Achilles to the death of Patroclus: The shameful mutilation of Hector's corpse.  These Russian troops are disfiguring their moral centers, their souls if you want to put it like that, with actions, and they will feel pain for it for the rest of their lives. Arnold Schwarzenegger put it effectively:

>When my father arrived in Leningrad, he was all pumped up on the lies of his government. When he left Leningrad, he was broken physically and mentally. He spent the rest of his life in pain: pain from a broken back, pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years, pain from the guilt that he felt.

Walter Duranty (25 May 1884 – 3 October 1957) was an Anglo-American propagandist who **served as Moscow bureau chief of The New York Times for fourteen years** (1922–1936) following the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War (1918–1921).In 1932, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union, eleven of which were published in June 1931. He was later criticized for his subsequent **denial of the widespread famine (1930–1933) in the USSR,\[1\] most particularly the Holodomor**. Beginning in 1990, there were calls for the Pulitzer board to revoke Duranty's prize. The Pulitzer Board declined to revoke the award and in 2003 said the articles which it examined in making the award did not contain ""clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception"".

\[…\]

**Ultimately, Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prize board, declined to revoke the award**. In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award ""there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.""\[36\]

(The Holodomor, also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 **that killed millions of Ukrainians.)**

There does come a moment where a line can be crossed, the nuclear weapons aren't held for 'fun'.

I think the strategy of slowing ratcheting up the pressure and armament is working is great.

It stretches the rubberband on what is allowable and doesn't let Russia have a clear designated line to draw. I think the strategy has completely caught them with their pants down as well.

I think they should start putting pressure on their Navy next.

Ships are slow to posture, plenty of time to state intentions and enemy to see movement to back up intention, warning fire is possible, isn't on the landmass of Ukraine, the Russian ships have also been shelling indiscriminately into cities with civilians (making them fair targets as well).

Chances seem to be increasing that this will become a hot war between NATO and Russia that escalates to World War 3. No calm nor reason remains.

What if this was the wrong approach? Putin's greatest fear is defeat by the West, but this has never been about military defeat to begin with. It has always been about the fear of revolution from within. With Ukraine as a prosperous, free and strong neighbor, and the wave of other countries following the same pattern, it would have made Russians question why they do not have liberty. Then it would only be a matter of time before they would realize that it liberty is an inalienable human right in the long run. It is inalienable as all it takes is for people to realize that they need only seize it, collectively.

So while a terrible cost to pay, Ukraine could have gone the other way: pay lip service to Putin's demands, but then flip things from within through mass civil disobedience. For historical examples, look to MLK or Gandhi. This would have been at least equally effective in eliciting NATO sanctions and gone much further in garnering support of the Russian people, who are ultimately the ones to keep Putin in power.

The siege lasted for a year without success when Olga thought of a plan to trick the Drevlians. She sent them a message: ""Why do you persist in holding out? All your cities have surrendered to me and submitted to tribute, so that the inhabitants now cultivate their fields and their lands in peace. But you had rather die of hunger, without submitting to tribute."" The Drevlians responded that they would submit to tribute, but that they were afraid she was still intent on avenging her husband. Olga answered that the murder of the messengers sent to Kiev, as well as the events of the feast night, had been enough for her. She then asked them for a small request: ""Give me three pigeons...and three sparrows from each house."" The Drevlians rejoiced at the prospect of the siege ending for so small a price, and did as she asked.  
  
Olga then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulphur bound with small pieces of cloth to each bird. At nightfall, Olga told her soldiers to set the pieces aflame and release the birds. They returned to their nests within the city, which subsequently set the city ablaze. As the Primary Chronicle tells it: ""There was not a house that was not consumed, and it was impossible to extinguish the flames, because all the houses caught fire at once."" As the people fled the burning city, Olga ordered her soldiers to catch them, killing some of them and giving the others as slaves to her followers. She left the remnant to pay tribute.

Already there's definitely impacts, this Su-35 is one example but several of the helicopters downed recently seem to not be aware that a missile is being fired in their vicinity. Not clear if it's failed systems, stolen systems, or just bad hardware in the first place.

The overpainting/blanking of tail numbers is another big indication that something is up. They're almost certainly running *much* lower on aircraft than they want to admit and either want to hide what's going where and how it's being lost, or they're flying parts planes as combat aircraft. I suspect probably it's mostly the former and therefore the same airframes are flying multiple sorties across multiple regions within a short space of time, e.g. a sortie over Kharkiv in the morning, quick ferry flight around the exterior to the East and then out of Crimea to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the afternoon. The old trick of ""convince the enemy there's more of you than there really are by moving around quickly and making a lot of noise each time you pop up"", as mastered by the SAS and British Paras, and as used in Gallipoli with a small force planting lots of Scurry's drip-pan trigger rifles.

Things do not look good for the Russian Air Force in terms of keeping their planes up, personally my assessment is that they're already out of key spares for some types, especially high-wear consumables and common combat damaged parts. They probably also have a lot of airframes that need considerable repair which takes time, a lot of beat up helicopters and Frogfoots have been recorded and they simply don't have replacements for them lined up ready to go. Even with all the spares in the world, if you've got holes in your fuselage and control surfaces on a modern aircraft, even if it's a helicopter or subsonic jet, you can't necessarily just weld a patch over them like you could in WW2. You need time to rotate them out of service, do the repairs, and bring them back into commission.

It's hard to justify the manpower, resources and time spent to surround Kyiv just to leave.  Traditionally, you would fortify, swap out for fresh troops and equipment, and/or launch another offensive with more battalions (greater force) from the north.

Kyiv, and its surrounding areas, will use the opportunity to regroup, stock up supplies, improve defenses and evacuate unnecessary personnel.  It will be measurably harder for the Russians to even repeat their original gains, much less siege the city of Kyiv.

No army in their right mind, and even Russia's, would leave the area entirely unless they have abandoned the idea occupation.  I am sure there is a lot of chest-bumping in the Kremlin about eventually taking Kyiv, but IMO, it is just to remove the taste of that humiliating defeat.

You have to ask yourself, if you're invading a country, who do you position to take the capital?  Your worst troops?  Following war doctrine, if you cut the head off the snake, the body is easier to subdue.  It's very likely they brought exactly who they thought could engage and defeat the 3+ million people there.

That force is now... gone.  It's also important to note that they are leaving to Belarus, which takes them out of the war for a few weeks minimum.  It's also important to note that, by and large, Russia is not substantially increasing their invasion force.

IMO, if they move out of Kherson and start to concentrate their forces around border with Russia, they have lost the ability to flank troop positions or cut off supply lines in the west.  They will just sit there like fish in a barrel, in an ever shrinking stretch of real estate, losing more manpower and resources.

It doesn't mean that they are about to unleash nuclear war, but they must be preparing internally for further mobilizations because they absolutely have to secure objectives in Ukraine either militarily or by treaty or they have thrown away Russia for nothing.

I've been saying this since the beginning, Russia needs an offramp. It's an illusion or even a grave error to assume that Russia will just be defeated here and go home. It's not happening, they will escalate until they get a win. Again, that doesn't mean nuclear war. It just means you need to be prepared for Russia to escalate the violence and throw it's entire conventional armed forces into this, eventually.

This isn't the traditional posturing by nations where Putin respects strength and will back off, that was needed BEFORE the invasion. What we have now is a guy who is all-in vs the western nations who are doubling down themselves because they know they are winning.

You assume that a) the current regime will fall, and b) that the next regime will want to engage with UN war crimes processes. 

I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm also not optimistic. 

It is true if they have active ICC warrants they will have severely limited travel options though.

E: sorry didn't really answer your question, even if it may have been rhetorical.

It's the point at which your military operational power, supplies, and logistics are stretched to their maximum and cannot extend any further. Much of warfare tactics from the post-Napoleonic era to the Korean war was limited by this factor. Back when wars were fought with big long established front lines and slow moving columns and brigades and divisions marching across a map. The point of war was to push your advance as far as possible while the enemy did all they could to slow it down and stop it.

I *thought* this method of fighting was over with the advent of advanced helicopters and transport planes and the immensely improved logistics systems of NATO style militaries who could operate anywhere at any place and have supplies constantly lifted in.

I was proven wrong by Russia during the course of this war which resembles less a modern war and more a 1950s era war.

Edit to add: Usually when you reach this point you then do your best to defend your new position, establish new supply depots closer to the front line, and then prepare for your next push.

To pick up some wiki disabilities of FASD:

>Cognition: Intellectual disability, confusion under pressure, poor abstract skills, difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, slower cognitive processing  
>  
>Memory: Poor short-term memory, inconsistent memory and knowledge base  
>  
>Executive functioning: Poor judgment, Information-processing disorder, poor at perceiving patterns, poor cause and effect reasoning, inconsistent at linking words to actions, poor generalization ability

It looks like the better breeding ground for propaganda to take effect

Ofc people have to be careful not to generalize it and people are ofc falling to prey to propaganda in other nations without this alcohol problem as well

But there was something off when you saw all these POW videos or heard these stupid fcking conversations when they call back home or to their officer and speak like drunk kids, a few of them might be really a bit mindless and can't really think for themselves too well. Might feel bad to kill them but that's how it is

348f140d8d6ff32d06c1df41a93314dc,txb0ov,i3o1m28,"""A video posted online on Monday and verified by The New York Times appears to show a group of Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops outside a village west of Kyiv.

“He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man says as a Russian soldier with a jacket pulled over his head, apparently wounded, is seen still breathing. A soldier then shoots the man twice. After the man keeps moving, the soldier shoots him again, and he stops. The Times is not publishing the video because of its graphic nature.

At least three other apparent Russian soldiers, including one with an obvious head wound who has his hands tied behind his back, can be seen dead near the victim. All are wearing camouflage, and three have white arm bands commonly worn by Russian troops. Equipment is scattered around them and there are blood stains near each man’s head.

The soldiers are lying in the road a few feet from a BMD-2, an infantry fighting vehicle used by Russian airborne units. Some appear to have had their jackets, shoes or helmets removed. Farther up the road, other destroyed vehicles can be seen.

The video was filmed on a road just north of the village of Dmytrivka, around seven miles southwest of Bucha, where the discovery of hundreds of corpses of people in civilian clothes in recent days has prompted accusations that Russian troops killed civilians as they retreated.

The killings appear to have been the result of a Ukrainian ambush of a Russian column that occurred on or around March 30, as Russian troops were withdrawing from small towns west of Kyiv that have been the scene of fierce fighting for weeks. Oz Katerji, a freelance journalist, posted videos and pictures of the destroyed column on Twitter on April 2 and wrote that soldiers told him that the Russians had been ambushed 48 hours earlier.

Ukraine’s Defense Ministry also tweeted about the destruction of the Russian convoy, calling it “precise work” by Ukrainian forces. “These are not even humans,” a Ukrainian soldier says in the video as he walks among the wrecked vehicles, adding that two Russian lieutenants had been taken prisoner.

The Ukrainian soldiers are identifiable by their flag patches and blue arm bands and repeat “glory to Ukraine” multiple times. Their unit is unclear, but in the video of the killing, one of the men refers to some of them as “Belgravia lads,” likely referring to a housing development called Belgravia located a few hundred yards from the incident.

A Ukrainian news agency that posted a video of the aftermath of the ambush on March 30 described it as the work of the “Georgian Legion,” a paramilitary unit of Georgian volunteers that formed to fight on behalf of Ukraine in 2014.""",False,1649273814.0,t3_txb0ov,t1_i3o0bjn,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

&#x200B;

This is the kind of thing that sounds obvious but is ignoring what the transition from A to B looks like. We need to stop using gas, but that doesn't mean we are ready to stop using gas today and that going cold turkey is a functional option. We use a ton of energy to keep society functioning, and a lot of that comes from gas. It's also needed for critical nitrogen based fertilizers, which going cold turkey on would lead to mass famine. Many homes have gas heaters, and while they need to be swapped to another system, that doesn't mean that  they already have been and turning off the gas means turning off the heat. Same thing for industries that use gas, which going cold turkey means them going offline.

&#x200B;

Basically, it's important to distinguish between ""What is the desired end state"" which is no/minimal gas use, and ""what does the transition look like if we do certain actions"". We've made major mistakes getting us to this point, but that doesn't mean we can just pretend those mistakes weren't made - we are now dealing with their ramifications now.

&#x200B;

This is not an argument that we should keep buying Russian gas. We should be weaning off of it as fast as we possibly can, through a mix of alternative gas sources and using alternatives to gas wherever possible, and where appropriate taking the hit for turning the gas off/lower to certain sectors.

Simple to say.  Harder to do.  Would you be cool with starving to death because you couldn't drive to work?  Or maybe just living in a refrigerator box somewhere near your office?  What if a fossil fuel plant was the only option available to keep the lights on, make your stove-top cook, or keep your food refrigerated?

The solution, of course, is to find alternative sources of power wherever possible.  Build infrastructure to support transportation that is not reliant on burning gasoline.

But those are projects that take years or decades to achieve.  We should do them.  This certainly makes that clear.  Though, we all knew it already.

Modern warships have tough hulls that give them some protection from guns you could fit in a zodiac, but that is mostly a side effect of building something that needs to survive in the ocean. So just running up to a ship with a machine gun won't do very much useful.

Bringing anti-tank weapons will do more, but still not much. Tanks are really, really, densely packed with things critical for its job as a tank. People, engines, guns, ammunition, etc. Anti-tank weapons mostly just worry about getting through the armor and then trusting that there is something really important on the other side that will be damaged. They don't usually have a lot of explosives meant to make a big hole or anything. Ships aren't nearly so densely packed with important bits. A small rocket hit is more likely to hit ""Spare parts room #4"" than the engine or weapons.

Many here think that we were abandoned. First, when the mutual defence/assitance  agreements failed when we were invaded. Second, when the war was getting over and we were gifted to Russians. 

That said - I've read history about this and I do think I also get the realpolitik behind it, as much as I hate the outcome, hate what it did to my country and people, and the realities behind the situation. 

The war had been going on for over 5 years by that point. Much of the continent, but especially Germany and Eastern Europe were pretty much in ruins. Millions, tens, of killed and wounded and homeless. Everybody was tired, exhausted, traumatised. And then you had the bloody Red Army in half of Europe, already there, camped in like they owned the place. IIRC, the Red Army was bigger than UK, US, and the commonwealth armies put together - fighting them would've been difficult in general, but also difficult for the men that had already been fighting a long war in Europe against the Nazis. 

So yeah. As a person from CEE, I f\*cking hate the result - who knows how our history would've been if we hadn't had to live with Russia controlling our lives for 50 years; I hate the way realpolitik just ignored our freedom to choose and I fully support us being in the EU/NATO now.

This article is a pretty good run-down on the Russian Kinzhal.

It's basically just an SRBM instead of ground-launched, it's air-dropped. Not really revolutionary. 

US Hypersonic tests going back to the 1980's were for a ramjet powered unmanned plane, intended as a demonstrator for a larger-scale manned plane. The more modern version used a scramjet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43

What Russias doing with this system is nowhere near a real hypersonic missile (in the sense of a hypersonic glide vehicle or especially with an air-breathing engine). Their Kinzhal is likely able to be intercepted with advanced air defense systems like PAC-III; and I doubt Russia will knowingly deploy this missile where they know it will go against a target defended with that type of interceptor.

It's almost like even the Russian military didn't think the invasion was going to happen because they had done the math and been like, *what, we're going to burn Ukraine to the ground and declare that a victory, of course not, this is just posturing*... and then Putin/Shoigu is like ""our determination to destroy Russia is unlimited, start the invasion!!!"" and jaws around the world hit the floor.

With that said, Ukraine may be broadcasting false strength (e.g. to deter continued Russian advances) or false weakness (e.g. to draw Russian forces in) with those numbers.

But we are not seeing a WWI style mobilisation of millions of men to the front. Primarily this is because Russia is pretending this isn't a war, and therefore not mobilising its manpower reserves.

Collateral damage is a legit concern when they're on the offensive, but the russians hold relatively few larger cities, plus the Ukrainians have shown they are thus far fairly adept at precision strikes.

Guerilla warfare isn't really that great for the occupier either, they can't possible quickly enter Ukraine to cut supply for the Donbass line because Ukraine is so fcking huge and its 100s of kilometers (and Russian ground troops seem unable to do anything outside the box). You can miss each other by 1km or be too late and all was for nothing. They still would have to take cities like Kharkiv first. 

This Donbass/Luhansk frontline held the entire time, so it must be difficult for Russians to gain any ground there, despise it being the reason they started the war with lol. 

They will keep shelling because that is what Russia can do best, destroying things from far away. 

I think UA will focus on Kherson, its the bridgehead for cutting Crimea out and then they focus on Melitopol and in the end Donbass again. The Donbas regions are probably already evacuated the most, so it will be okay to lose some ground. They don't need to risk too much, a stalemate works in their favor, as Putin loses every day more

Russia plays the same perverted game again like in Donbass with these big cities in the south, capturing them and preventing people from leaving, preventing them to work on the farms etc. making them dependent on Russian food for propaganda. Will be hard to capture when you don't want to hit civilians. So it is kind of useless having heavy weapon systems or airstrikes there, when you can better count on mobile infantry and their antitank weapons instead - destroying tanks from 2-3km away.  

Fighting may get fiercer as Russians supply lines will be shorter though, I still think Ukraine is already better prepared than Russia at this point, they keep asking for more but I don't think they would even need it to win in the end

You'd need to put a big hole in an area where the train's momentum will actually cause it to derail (e.g. a curve). Those areas are few and far between - meaning they can be easily defended.

Even if you do derail a train, all it takes is a crane to move the train over a bit. Rail crews can fix it up within a couple days in peacetime conditions - there'd be a lot more urgency in wartime. A wartime fix can likely be done in hours, not days - especially since they don't need to do a ""real"" fix since I don't think Russia cares about Positive Train Control right now. As long as the train can _kind of_ get over the rail, that's ""good enough"" (see the video above).

Belarus rail workers were sabotaging the rail lines by throwing switches as trains crossed them. This would cause ~~multi-track drifting~~ half the train to follow one track and the other half to follow another. This'll derail the train... but again, all it takes is a crane to show up and move the derailed train out of the way and everything's good again. Annoying, but not insurmountable.

Even if they placed explosives directly on locomotives... the crane just needs to come out and move the wreck out of the way of the tracks. It's _really_ hard to take out trains in meaningful ways.

Among the distressing pictures of dead bodies in Bucha, the Kyiv suburb where Russian forces are accused of carrying out atrocities against Ukrainian citizens, one in particular stood out to Anastasiia Subacheva, a makeup artist from the nearby city of Gostomel.

In it she recognized a perfectly manicured hand with red and white nail polish — one that she had seen many times holding a brush or lipstick, or spreading foundation or eye shadow during her makeup lessons.

Now, it lay lifeless on a street, covered in dirt.

“When I saw it, I felt physically like my heart started to break,” Ms. Subacheva said in a telephone call on Wednesday from the city of Kropyvnytskyi, to which she had fled with her family.

Ms. Subacheva, who has been a makeup artist in Bucha for five years, said she knew a lot of women there because she did the makeup for many of them.

The pictured woman, Iryna Filkina, 52, a heating station operator, had reached out to Ms. Subacheva in February to inquire about makeup classes. She dreamed of becoming popular and increasing the number of her Instagram followers, the makeup artist recalled.

For that, she said, Ms. Filkina wanted her help to be beautiful and fashionable. She was excited about an upcoming concert by the Ukrainian pop diva Olya Polyakova and talked during their classes about what she would wear and how she would do her makeup for the event.

“I finally understood the most important thing: You need to love yourself and live for yourself,” Ms. Subacheva recalled Ms. Filkina telling her. “Finally I will live the way I want.”

But the war put an end to those dreams.

Ms. Filkina’s daughter, Olha Shchyruk, who had fled Bucha after the war started, said she had learned on March 6 that her mother had been shot the previous day while returning from work on her bicycle.

Yet for about a month, the daughter had kept some hope that she might still be alive.

“I understand that it wasn’t possible, because she hadn’t been in touch for a month,” Ms. Shchyruk said in a message on the Telegram social media app on Wednesday. “But a child will always be waiting for her mother.”

On Friday — Ms. Filkina’s birthday — Ms. Shchyruk received a video of her mother lying dead on the ground, as well as the picture of her hand.

“Even if there was no manicure,” she said, “I would have recognized it was my mother.”

875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,txb0ov,i3lium9,"I don't think there was a plan to attack Ukraine militarily 10 years ago. The plan was to keep Ukraine tethered to Russia and slowly weave the connections so strongly that it would've been very difficult to break them off - basically make Ukraine into another Belarus. 

Ukraine was poised perfectly for this. Corrupt and ruled by oligarchs, many of whom were connected to Russia. Politicians bought by Russia as well, serving the interests of Russia, whilst also keeping their face in Ukrainian politics. 

The problem with Ukraine, unlike Belarus, has always been that they tolerate stuff for a long time, but eventually do get tired and do elect someone else (or overthrow them). People say that US/CIA backs coups and stuff and I know they have, but I think most who say that don't know anything about CEE history and don't understand the sheer willpower of some of our countries to actually want democracy, freedom etc. So I believe that Ukraine really did try back in 2000s, to pursue actual democracy. 

That's what probably started the process of military annexation - the euromaidan, which some again claim must've been American coup (which btw is also Putin's belief, because he cannot imagine that any smaller country would voluntarily choose freedom - they must be pushed by someone else, pulled by a larger entity, like he believes that Moscow has a right for sphere of influence and influencing the countries, therefore it's not possible that Ukraine made the choice themselves, but some other larger entity chose for Ukraine and Ukraine followed). The fact that Ukrainians were - despite everything, despite struggling with corruption and Russian influence and the country having areas that were more pro-Russia than on average - still not wanting to align themselves fully with Moscow. He probably thought that annexing Crimea/Donbas would break Ukraine, would make it impossible for Ukraine to start integrating with EU/NATO, but he underestimated Ukraine's resolve. 

Ukraine has, ofc, lots more to go - it still has problems with corruption etc., but it has shown that it has willingness to try and work on its problems, which is more than Russia wants it to have. So I fully believe that Putin expected Ukraine to fold and instead it has stubbornly pushed to ever so slowly make itself better and distance itself from Moscow even further. If you couple that with the rumours that he is sick, possibly dying, he may have thought ""f\*ck it"", and based on wrong intelligence as well, invade Ukraine and personally made sure that Ukraine was were he thought they should be - under Moscow's paw.",False,1649229154.0,t3_txb0ov,t1_i3kri4m,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

According to an independent expert report “Putin and Gazprom” by Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov, Gazprom became the first business structure where Putin began to systematically place his people in key positions, in a short time ousting all representatives of the old management team. The top management of Gazprom very quickly turned out to be flooded with Putin’s old acquaintances from the St.Petersburg administration.

Down at the tactical level, democracies empower individuals with real options, information and trust to make on the ground decisions.

 - His car is decorated with decals of US military special forces organizations, despite him not ever being in the US military, or ANY military, other than going to a summer camp to learn to shoot.

It is an important idea for Ukraine, it is no coincidence they risked to do the recent attack on the oil storage facility in Russia just near the border, but for Russia it is absolutely crucial to do because with no big enough nearby cities to act as territorial defence centers required for ukrainian hit and run tactics if the group is surrounded, cut off from supplies and eventually destroyed then it will just be mere days untill the structure of defence of the whole eastern part of Ukraine collapses. The only suitable cities they had are on the Black sea shore down below and by now they are all occupied and any possible support from Odessa and further to the west is cut off. There will basically be nowhere safe to run after they hit anymore. And no amount of fancy portable equipment will be able to save you if you are just spotted by a forward observer with a thermal scope with your whole position getting shelled into oblivion a few minutes later. The less they will be able to get by the time the offensive begins the less time it will take for the group to be defeated and the less lives it will cost for the russian army.

After that it would be a great time to start negotiating conditions for peace I guess. Of course involving the whole eastern part of Ukraine becoming a new independant loyal to Russia state under complete control of Donetsk and Lugansk elites and therefore becoming a new buffer zone between Russia and NATO countries instead of the former Ukraine who obviously completely failed to serve the purpose.

I believe that it was the main idea all along. At least righ after it became obvious that just running basically a full scale military parade to Kiev and expecting local authorities in each region and city to immediately not only peacefully surrender one by one but to welcome the liberating russian troops with open arms was a slight miscalculation and that is to speak mildly about the morons from the FSB who recommended the genious idea.

In the graphc linked above, the candidates are arranged by political current (not sure that the right words), top of the graphic is far left and it goes to the far right at the bottom (except jean lassale who should be next to Valérie Précresse)

A lot of people who vote in the left spectrum of french politic won't vote for macron (too much liberal for them) and some of Precresse voters will vote for Macron (to avoid far right in power)

From surveys, 30% of voter of Jean-Luc Mélenchon will vote Le Pen (while being in the left spectrum of the french politic), almost nobody from the far right will vote for Macron and some part of Precresse voters will vote for Le Pen.

This election is really uncertain because in France, voting is not mandatory and you can vote ""white"" (you vote but for no candidates)

I can repeat it multiple times and unless they're really trying, and maybe I separate out the sounds for them, they will continue to do so.

But we’ve seen a lot of discussion of people being in denial and/or naively trusting what they hear on TV, and I haven’t come across any mention of this self-protective strategy directed towards the very real possibility of phone conversations being monitored. 

I personally know people who have lived under communist governments and I have read various autobiographical accounts of living under authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Their authorities are always on the lookout for dissent, and they allocate immense resources to spying on people they consider suspicious and/or important to the social order. (A totalitarian regime expands these categories until they encompass everyone.) 

Phone-tapping and intercepting wireless communications is an obvious way to find evidence of people’s disloyalty to the regime and it was ubiquitous in the Soviet Union. Of course it continued in Russia and elsewhere after the break-up of the USSR, although probably less intensively. 

With the recent Russian crackdown on freedom of speech, everyone in Russia will be aware that they can be prosecuted or persecuted for not toeing the kremlin’s line on the invasion of Ukraine. Even if they’re too young to have personal experience of this from the past, they will have heard stories about it from family and friends. Most will have been taught from a young age to take precautions against being caught expressing a risky point of view. This is just one effect of multi-generational trauma from living through communist purges. 

Also nowadays it’s not only the police who can record private conversations and later use them as evidence of treason or defamation or however they technically term thought-crimes as being criminal. With current technology anyone can record anyone else and pass along the evidence to the police, and for many reasons, not just from being a true believer in the regime. I could write a lot about the dynamics of all the reasons but I will restrain myself. 

Furthermore, if the police even suspect someone of disloyalty, it’s no longer technically difficult for them to create convincing falsified evidence. That’s only if they would need to bother with having evidence, which usually they don’t. Suspicion or a random whim is enough, especially when you need to demonstrate your own loyalty and zeal in order to move up in the ranks. 

For these reasons absolutely **everyone** now inside Russia now has a massive incentive to pretend to be completely brainwashed by Putin’s propaganda. Any deviation from the official line could be dangerous, if not right now, then maybe later, if the crackdown intensifies. The unpredictability of the future makes people more cautious. 

Only a naive idiot living in Russia would make it possible to distinguish their thoughts from those of a true believer in Putin’s notions about the Russian World when they are speaking on a phone call with a Ukrainian!!!

> “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man says as a Russian soldier with a jacket pulled over his head, apparently wounded, is seen still breathing. A soldier then shoots the man twice. After the man keeps moving, the soldier shoots him again, and he stops.

> At least three other apparent Russian soldiers, including one with an obvious head wound who has his hands tied behind his back, can be seen dead near the victim. All are wearing camouflage, and three have white arm bands commonly worn by Russian troops. Equipment is scattered around them and there are blood stains near each man’s head.

> The soldiers are lying in the road a few feet from a BMD-2, an infantry fighting vehicle used by Russian airborne units. Some appear to have had their jackets, shoes or helmets removed. Farther up the road, other destroyed vehicles can be seen.

> The video was filmed on a road just north of the village of Dmytrivka, around seven miles southwest of Bucha, where the discovery of hundreds of corpses of people in civilian clothes in recent days has prompted accusations that Russian troops killed civilians as they retreated.

> The killings appear to have been the result of a Ukrainian ambush of a Russian column that occurred on or around March 30, as Russian troops were withdrawing from small towns west of Kyiv that have been the scene of fierce fighting for weeks. Oz Katerji, a freelance journalist, posted videos and pictures of the destroyed column on Twitter on April 2 and wrote that soldiers told him that the Russians had been ambushed 48 hours earlier.

> Ukraine’s Defense Ministry also tweeted about the destruction of the Russian convoy, calling it “precise work” by Ukrainian forces. “These are not even humans,” a Ukrainian soldier says in the video as he walks among the wrecked vehicles, adding that two Russian lieutenants had been taken prisoner.

> The Ukrainian soldiers are identifiable by their flag patches and blue arm bands and repeat “glory to Ukraine” multiple times. Their unit is unclear, but in the video of the killing, one of the men refers to some of them as “Belgravia lads,” likely referring to a housing development called Belgravia located a few hundred yards from the incident.

On 10 March, a Telegram channel associated with an alleged troll factory of billionaire businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin published a photo of Mark Bernstein, a Wikipedia editor from the Belarusian capital Minsk. Bernstein’s personal data was also made public and a photo of him bore the following caption: “This person is distributing fake anti-Russian materials.”

Bernstein was detained the very next day by officers from a Belarusian police unit known by its initials GUBOPiK. He was subsequently sentenced by a court to 15 days imprisonment for “disobeying an official”.

Russia has pretty much everything in terms of minerals and reserves. They have petrol and gas. They have space and global warming serves them a lot.

China has the manufactures. Xi Jingping just signed, over the last couple of years, a tremendous contract for gaz supplies at cheap cost over something like 30 years. From a video I saw (in french sorry) Russia is building up a network of pipelines to China instead of NordStream 2 to EU. (NordStream 2 even went bankrupt recently)
So their manufactures will have cheap energy costs and replace coal energy (plus their advance in fission and fusion energy with their Russian tokamak).
China has manpower, soldiers, and both have an extreme nationalist culture over individuality. And China is GREEDY (I lived and work there couple years), they have a history of centuries being slapped left, right, or themselves (various civil wars and revolutions) and they think their time has come.

Since Xi Jingpin arrived at his thrones, most of his effort went to develop its internal market and rely on West consumerism. (And Chinese can be extremely consumerist)
China is now in the list of the best universities and technological transfers are becoming meaningless.
Russia has a very high development potential due to their structural inequity, so both of them would benefit from a tight alliance.
They now are responsible of something like 80% of the funding in green energies, which may (or may not) lead to a tremendous head start when the world will inevitably pass the second and third gear to get fucked up.

Russia would be in the shadow of China, but it’s probably a cost they are ready to pay to fuck up NATO.

If I can make an assumption over the different analyses I saw, it would be that Taiwan might the first domino of their alliance. And NATO-minded cultures should very quickly take back their investments.

Four of his comments struck me.  The first is how we'd lose our technology in ""the first round"".  The second gatekeeps modern soldiers as being unable to read a compass.  The third is how our military has been undermined and is not battle ready.  The fourth is that we've only demonstrated usefulness in ""sandboxes"" (i.e desert warfare)

First, Afghanistan is 10x more difficult terrain than much of Europe. There are five desert regions there, but the largest borders Pakistan and has no major cities (as one would expect).  We also train in the US and not Iraq.  We train in places like Virginia, Hawaii, Washington, California, etc.  We have a pretty diverse catalog of experience.

Second, our military was very bad post WWII.  We were stuck with equipment that was 20+ years old when Vietnam began.  We had a lot of guys who planned battles in the jungle the same way they did in northern europe.  Compass reading ready or not, the conflict humiliated us to the point where we started developing the military complex we have today.  Plus, the Europeans would be fighting along side, so it's not like the fighting force would be a fish out of water.  Also LOL on the compass slight.  Dude is trying to get back at his grandkids for not helping him post pictures on the Facebook.

We also wouldn't ""lose"" our technological advancements in the first round.  We don't have a technology division we throw into the first wave, hoping they get it done before they're tested.

Putin's plan was it that all gas-buyers should pay Gazprombank, which would by rubels, and than that's that.

Scholz said Nah, we have contracts, contracts that customers have with daugther companies of Gazprom Germania and rightfully says,  the payment is indeed made in Euros...to daugther companies of Gazprom germania.

Gazprim Germania was sold by their owner Gazprom Export (Russia) to OffShore Companies on 1.4.2022 (a move that would have needed to be cleared by ministry of  economics) , before Habeck ordered the Bundesnetzagentur to seize the company. So it's a bit muddy what will happen here.

Gazprom Germania was aggregating money from all daughter companies and was supposed to transfer it not to Gazprom Bank in Luxembourg, and from there to Gazprom Export in St-Petersburg, before the sanctions

BUT Gazrprom bank could easily been hit by sanctions so Gazprom altered he route for the money and demanded buying rubels of Gazprom Germania.

Scholz' idea was that money would go to Gazprom bank, but the account will be frozen.

Russia would ""see"" that there are payments for gas, but could not withdraw the money.

Putin now demands Rubels, and Germany won't ever give up on gas. 

What could happen is that Gazprom Germania keeps paying, in Euros, to Gazprom Bank.And Gazprom Export can say ""Nah, that's breaking the contract we made literally minutes before Habeck seized control."" 

If they already have a contract to pay in rubels, technically Bundesnetzagentur can go on and buy rubels, or they can not do that and Gazprom Germania is breaking contracts, and won't longer get  Gas from Gazprom Export.

The EU is sending [1.000.000.000](https://1.000.000.000) € to Russia, every day. No matter if they help to boost ruble.

If we keep doing it in euros, Putin has to  buy rubels through chinese and american accounts, running the risk of getting the involved banks sanctioned to death.

They have a total of at most 26 of the Tu-160 (only 14 are believed to be air worthy at present and no one is really sure it's even that high).

>Their ICBMs are considered ""very"" reliable

I guess I question the maintenance of the missile, the launch system (both hardware and humanware), and the warheads themselves.  Plus there are SOME ICBM countermeasures (that we know of, how knows what else MIGHT exist).

>(not sure about their SLBM's they've had some pretty high-profile failures in tests recently - but still; a few hundred of those could make for a whole lot of people having a really really bad day for the next several years. I've heard varying things about whether Russian Subs' locations are ""known"" or whether they could be prevented from launching - it's a hellova gamble).

The subs are the real wildcard.  SLBMs can launch from close in and cause issues.  And yes there is a decent likelihood from what I've heard that there is a good deal of shadowing/known going on with the subs.  But unless you have clearance we don't have...

It won't change the fact that China still has a security council veto it can abuse, it won't change that the US still has one that lets Israel off the hook every time, and while France and Britain haven't used their veto since the end of the Cold War, the same applies to them in principle.

All the same things will happen all across Ukraine if it's occupied. The Russian military are absolute monsters and will mutder millions wirhout a second thought if need be. Surrendering to them is suicide. There is no political victory without military victory first.

Obviously, there's a political angle to London's decision here but the other big insurance markets are also in countries leaning away from Russia and what London does is a huge indicator as to their likely actions.

Insurance is all about risk. If London blocks vessels from Russian waters because it deems it a risk, it's probably not lying (several vessels have already been hit and one sunk in port by Russian forces). Now you have a whole bunch of high risk vessels and they're coming to you instead. Unless you're an absolute idiot of an insurer you realise that massively increases your own exposure and inflates the probability of a claim. Your prudent choices are to decline new applications, or instigate a similar ""Russian waters surcharge"", to cover your own exposure especially if you have some form of severe claims insurance yourself. It's not political, it's just statistics.

Some vessels may not choose to declare their journeys but:

1. Most vessels have GPS tracking on them as part of regulation. Either that shows you entered Russian waters and your insurance is void, or you turn it off and now you're breaking maritime law.

2. You just chance it and sail to Russia uninsured. Most ship operators aren't insane enough to do this and open themselves up to losses they can't afford, as it will come out of their own pockets especially if there's loss of life or negligence claims. There's even a possibility it will void *future* insurance on the vessel even out of Russian waters because the insurer can't guarantee that any damages you claim for actually occurred outside of Russian waters.

It isn't pedantry to believe that drawing excessive parallels between different historical events is no way to go about understanding history.

Britain was categorically not hell bent on destroying Ireland. There wouldn't be an Ireland if this were true.

Yeah, that just isn't what *destruction* means.

>And I’ll admit I am bias,

Bias*ed*.

>but if you read the history from the Irish side you’ll get a clear idea of what it was really like.

I'm very well aware thank you. The situations are not comparable.

>Britain conveniently don’t teach any history related to Ireland 

This is simply bullshit. It was/is part of the curriculum for millions. 

I can't remember which year given how long ago it was, but I studied Home Rule for a significant length of time, with the most focus on things like the famines, absentee landlords, Easter rising etc.

>Bloody Sunday is the perfect example, innocent protestors being gunned down in cold blood again comes under destruction in my book and 

Yes? One horrific event does not justify the claim that Britain was hell bent on destroying Ireland.

When the IRA murdered civilians, was this evidence of Ireland being hell bent on destroying Britain?

If Russia does ""first-use""; then the retaliatory strikes are technically not ""pre-emptive"" - but I think there would be a pretty strong global consensus to ""destroy and degrade Russia's ability to use weapons of mass-destruction"" and I would guess that 90% of that response would be conventional. There would still be Russia's bomber fleet, and ICBM/TBM/SRBM assets to destroy, and that would likely mean a shit-ton of nuclear strikes on mostly non-civilian targets. In very prompt, rapid succession. 

In the days, weeks, or months after; Russia's sub-fleet would probably do some retaliatory striking, to avenge their smouldering, radioactive homeland.  That's if NATO naval assets can't hunt them down and destroy them all. 

Russia has zero incentive to pursue a strategy that has that result.

If they're going to go the nuclear route, they would have a much stronger incentive to attempt a massive first-strike, to try to prevent the West from responding.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls

FULL of instances where one side believed they were being nuked and even THEN they didn't launch.  

A RATIONAL take on this situation and nukes is:  the west going Ukraine directly in the conflict you can:

A) withdraw, not have Ukraine,  but still have Russia.  Have political cover (the western nazis ganged up on us, rather than kill all our troops we withdrew.  If we nuked we would all die).

B) use nukes and have literally nothing left at all at the end.  Without knowing FOR SURE that the other side won't intercept all your warheads, that your missiles will work, your warheads will go off.

The risk reward for nukes makes no sense unless the west is planning to nuke or invade Russia directly.  Short of that they make no sense for Russia to use.

Can we pretty please stop with the assumption that the use of nukes for anything short of invading or nuking Russia is anything more than a threat.

I already demonstrated Putin putting his forces on high alert after the first round of sanctions and saying they were like an act of war.  And yet more sanctions have come and ... no nukes.  More weapons have come and ... no nukes.

Be serious.

The problem with people drawing arbitrary lines on what will get Russia involved or not is they can't decide whether Putin is rational or irrational.  If he is rational, he will not expand the war over a few jets. If he is irrational, it doesn't matter what NATO does. It's a lose-lose argument.

Also, Russia so far hasn't claimed Ukraine as their sovereign territory. So far Putin's stated goal is to install a legitimate (i.e. pro-Russian) government.

 * Exterminating civilians = war crime.

 * Executing prisoners of war without cause = war crime.

It DOES matter that one of these is more problematic/repugnant than the other, but that doesn't make the less problematic/repugnant one NOT a war crime.

The entire point of war crimes is an attempt to try and constrain behaviors that have been considered counter to the wider benefit of humanity at large. We do not allow exterminating civilians for many reasons (they generally don't have the ability to defend themselves, a civilian has very little ability to influence the war in and of themselves, etc). We do not allow the execution of prisoners of war without cause (ex: If they kill a guard in an attempt to escape, they are fair game.) because the simplest move at that point is to just always execute all the enemies soldiers. The consequence of which is that soldiers will now always fight to the death, since death is assured anyway.

That that last point is particularly important, because if you're going to die no matter what, then why NOT do the worse things that you shouldn't do? If I'm going to kill you one way or another, what's wrong with you visibly strapping a baby or two to your chest as you approach my position? What does it matter if you detonate storage tanks of deadly chemicals? It's not like I can kill you twice after all.

You know what being the good guy means?

It means doing the right thing even when it hurts you to do so. Even when every fiber of your being is SCREAMING to pull the trigger on the monster with their hands up. You don't. You cuff them and you bring them before a court. It doesn't matter if it is 110% obvious the court will sentence them to hang, a civilized society brings them before the court. A barbarian executes them where they stand without a trial.

If we throw away our willingness to obey the rules of war, then it opens the floodgates to horrors of insane magnitude. If the rules ""only hurt the good guys"" then why bother? Let's ship over high powered lasers designed to instantly and permanently blind whoever they are aimed at. Fuck the Russian animals after all, who cares if we leave ~190,000 people blind. And double damn those bastards for starting to do the same back to the Ukrainians in revenge!

Slippery slope arguments are ALMOST always a fallacy, simply because in the vast majority of cases there's no real incentivization to keep pushing down the ""slope"". But when it comes to war, every war in human history has followed the same pattern, if both parties are unwilling to restrain themselves then shit just gets worse and worse and worse. And the bulk of the time the people who pay the price for that aren't even the members of the military, but the civilians on the side.

If Russia tortures to death 5,000 Ukrainian civilians (I'm sure the number is sadly higher), should Ukraine get to raid over the border into Russia and kidnap 5,000 Russians to torture to death? Or is that too far? If they only get 4,999 then they are still morally less wrong than Russia right?

> and the evidence for those accusations is not nearly as strong as for Bucha

And THAT is the important point for WHY war crimes trials exist. To objectively and dispassionately go over the evidence to determine who did what and who deserves what as a result.

And so this incident should be investigated like any other. If it's proven to be fakery or something else is going on (perhaps the people in question engaged in perfidy and killed a Ukrainian soldier after surrendering, that's a valid excuse to execute a prisoner), then no big deal.

But if it turns out that it's not fakery and some Ukrainian soldiers straight up murdered a prisoner, then those soldiers need to be brought before a war crimes court. No exceptions.

> not to mention the difference in scale.

Irrelevant.

If someone killed my dog, should I be allowed to burn their house down without being brought before a court? Or flip it if you feel the other way is stronger. Doesn't matter, the person who killed the dog committed a crime, and the person who burned a house down committed a crime. If you want it to be more dramatic, replace dog with friend/lover/family-member/whatever.

There ARE plenty of circumstances that provide that justification, and it's entirely possible the evidence of that justification is hours, days, etc away from surfacing. Perhaps the prisoners in question killed a Ukrainian soldier after surrendering.

This is WHY a war crimes court is important. If there's proof that the Ukrainians were legally justified in doing what they did, then so be it. But if they just killed those prisoners singularly because they were angry, that is a cut and dried example of a war crime being committed. You use the courts BECAUSE they are dispassionate and take the time to consider ALL the facts.

Oh they absolutely can lose a lot.

Because it is obvious to EVERYONE that Ukraine is perfectly innocent here, that Russia is not only an unprovoked aggressor, but an undeniable monster.

If Ukraine's military starts committing war crimes AND doesn't immediately slam down on that behavior, it provides not just a PR nightmare that can be exploited to cut into that goodwill, but it also opens legal avenues to cutting off aid.

And there are people like that in every government currently supporting Ukraine. They might be few in number, but if a nation has legal mechanisms that prevent military aid from being given to entities knowingly engaging in war crimes, all it takes is one politician to stop the flow of aid.

I guess since we can't stop soldiers from massacring civilians, we shouldn't try to stop that either.

Cesium-137, Strontium-90, several isotopes of Plutonium and Uranium, and Americium-241 are all present in the soil around Chernobyl. Some of it directly ejected from the core and via the graphite shielding that made up the larger parts of ejected particles, some of it because they scraped the top soil directly around the plant and buried it in multiple locations. 

&nbsp;

None of the Plutonium isotopes have a half-life of under 14 years

None of the Uranium isotopes have a half-life under 69 years 

Cesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years

Strontium-90 has a half-life of 29 years

Americium-241 has a half life of 432 years

&nbsp;

Half-life isnt a measurement of when its safe to be around any of these. Its the amount of time it takes for the *energy* output of them to be halved. And in the case of all of these...nowhere near safe and definetly well within acute radiation sickness levels if their potential energy at start was high. For all of them, it was.

That has left Germany nearly helpless to follow allies like the United States and impose an oil and gas embargo against Russia.

And Germany's defense profile had been blunted by successive years of under-investment. That has drawn the ire of the United States and allies which have repeatedly pressed Europe's biggest economy to meet the NATO defense spending target of 2% of national output.

One of Merkel's closest aides and former defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has condemned Germany's ""historical failure"" to bolster its military over the years.

""After Georgia, Crimea, and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin,"" she tweeted, referring to incursions carried out by Russia while Merkel was in power.""

Merkel took power in 2005 after beating Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder at the polls.

Schroeder himself has been pilloried for his friendship with Putin, and his refusal to quit key posts at Russian energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom.

But her critics say that while Schroeder had started the ball rolling on Nord Stream 1, a pipeline funneling Russian gas to Germany, Merkel signed off on Nord Stream 2.

The controversial $11-billion pipeline is disputed because it bypasses Ukraine, depriving Kyiv of gas transit fees. It has been put on ice in the wake of the invasion.

Merkel ""must take her share of the blame with her eagerness to seek close economic ties to Russia"" as it led to Germany's dependency on Russian energy, Sueddeutsche daily concluded.

""We are now seeing the consequences of that terrible mistake,"" it said.

On the geopolitical front, her government's reluctance in admitting Georgia and Ukraine to the NATO fold in 2008 -- despite a push by Washington -- was now also under scrutiny.""

During the last 25 years the exports of Russia to Canada have increased at an annualized rate of 2.48%, from $334M in 1995 to $617M in 2020.”

In November 2021, the top exports of Canada to Russia were Gas Turbines (C$3.01M), Soil Preparation Machinery (C$1.8M), Commodities not elsewhere specified (C$1.6M), Chemical Analysis Instruments (C$1.48M), and Batteries (C$1.47M). In November 2021 the top imports of Canada from Russia were Nitrogenous Fertilizers (C$79.4M), Hot-Rolled Iron (C$32.6M), Processed Crustaceans (C$15.6M), Plywood (C$8.61M), and Refined Petroleum (C$7.75M).

$8mm worth of all types of refined petroleum as of Nov 2021. That’s a rounding error and way less than a single ship’s worth. Probably a few container loads of Lada-branded engine oil.

ETA: and banning crude oil imports seems like a meaningless token gesture, until you stop and think about it. With near every other country banning or cutting down on Russian oil, their only answer is to start undercutting the market (as they’re currently doing in India) to make their oil much more attractive. Capitalism being what it is, if the oil isn’t banned someone is going to bite and buy at a discount. Even in Canada.

The CAQ in Quebec went from fourth party joke to overwhelmingly dominant majority with no other party coming even close to half their support. In Alberta, the Conservatives went from perpetual government since forever to losing to the most leftist party, back to power and now looks set to lose again - this in a province where the conservatives getting over 60% of the vote is considered normal. 

Or, in France, you might recall this party that came from out of nowhere to win the Presidency and Government about five years ago led by this guy Macron, with the mainstream parties reduced to fringe status. That was neat. 

But for some reason, because people on reddit don't like LePen, they assume that such swings could never happen again. OK.",False,1649267507.0,t3_txb0ov,t1_i3n4j3x,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

 >A minority language is a language spoken by a minority of the population of a territory. Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 196 sovereign states recognized internationally (as of 2019) and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also official languages, such as Irish in Ireland or the numerous indigenous languages of Bolivia.

The Holodomor was committed by the Russian-dominated Soviet Union by redirecting, reapproriating, and destroying food meant to go to Ukraine, and it was done as a punishment for Ukrainian civil disobedience in refusal to collectivize their farms. I don't see how civil disobedience will result in anything else today, considering Russia is already destroying infrastructure and food stores. 

Belarus is an impoverished shithole terrorist state and the reason it isn't joining the invasion is because its run more by the military than Lukashenko. Their not joining the invasion is not indicative of civil disobedience working, it's indicative of rats choosing not to board a ship sinking in the docks.

Putin has wanted to take Ukraine for a long time for a few reasons. It’s a strategic area with warm water ports, it has abundant resources, and helps provide a buffer between Russia and NATO. The invasion started in 2014 and Russia faced sanctions. Not as severe as now and they were allowed to keep what they’d stolen. 

I think Putin’s plan was to continue into Ukraine but then the U.S. elected an anti-NATO president in 2016 and so Putin felt it was better to let him do his thing. After all, Ukraine is much smaller and more ill equipped than the Russian army, he thought.

And it worked. NATO got weaker, the west more divided, and it seemed like his plans was going well until Biden’s election.  That’s why he went ahead and continued his plan to take Ukraine. He knew the longer he waited the stronger NATO would get. 

The problem for Putin with him letting things play itself out is that it gave Ukraine 8 years to build up better equipment, more soldiers, and receive incredible training. They also elected Zelensky who has used the media as an amazing tool to get assistance and NATO support.

It is a difficult question with a lot of unknowns and I will concede that I don't have the answers anymore than anyone else (Putin himself doesn't even have guarantees that if he says nukes there will be nukes).

I can happily agree that we have some disagreements around the finer points here.  I think conceptually we aren't nearly as far off as I got from your initial reply.  I still think Nato involvement actually gives Putin a good political offramp.

His propaganda campaign has vilified the west completely.  It isn't a stretch to sell the people ""but the nazis would nuke us"" from where they are.  With the political powers I don't think anyone would have expected the west to do it (get involved) so I don't think it costs him much there either.  It would CERTAINLY be a better outcome for him than a Ukraine win in the current environment.  That would be a total disaster.  

I mean think about it.  A loss to Ukraine without nato forces leaves him with:

1) the same loss on the books
2) no army left at all (I believe if nato engaged directly he would end the conflict in 48 hours and withdraw), a war with Ukraine will last MUCH longer and destroy far more of his equipment.
3) a complete embarrassment.  He got beat by a ""not even a country"" full of ""nazis"".  Not several superpowers ganging up... Ukraine dogs.
4) everyone asking how ""our military"" couldn't defeat even this small army... maybe they aren't strong.  Maybe we CAN revolt.
5) ever political knife in his back.  A defeat to nato is a given. A defeat to Ukraine is incompetence and the buck stops at Putin.

I would argue Ukraine winning without support increases the odds he uses nukes... which them causes fallout issues for nato and a raft of other problems.

The only other thing I would add is:  the people who have done battle with Putin before in Russian politics all pretty much agree universally that he need to be met head on if we want him to stop.  I haven't seen one dissenting opinion from an actual Russian dissident/opposition member.  The dissent all comes from western analysts.  The same ones that have been getting Russia and the USSR wrong for decades because they just think differently. 

Finally (and this will sound insanely trivial but I do think it has a TINY bit of relevance and insight into the Russian psyche).  I used to play a strategy game.  It was very popular in Russia.  Everyone hated ""the russians"" on the server.  It was like multi-player civ but took weeks for a single game.  Every server would invariably fall into camps of Russian teams and western teams.  The Russians would always win.  They would always win by bullying their way through the server.  They would pound little opponents to dust, fake their resources, etc.  I lead a few alliances over the few years I played.  I had more luck than most with the Russian group largely because I would negotiate from a position of strength early.  Met their force with equal force.  Make the sacrifices they would make (they had NO problems having some of their players completely eradicated for a goal... the meat grinder approach).  But once they saw (and believed) you were willing to meet their force head on the tone would change.

The reason I say this is, it gave a lot of insight into the mentality that is prevalent there.  For years I would talk with some of these folks after we stopped playing (i still do, although much less now obv).  I asked why they would do x, y or z.  They would just say it was how it was done.  But they NEVER respected weakness.  Any weakness real or perceived was tested and if found to be true punished without mercy.  

Again would I bet my life on this tiny sliver of insight?  Of course not.  But I also don't think it entirely irrelevant.  Since then I have interacted with many more Russian folks in business, etc.  I have found the key ""cultural"" habits hold.  They think and manage risk very differently than Westerners.  Obviously everyone is unique, but there are different patterns.

The only final difference I noted was, it was far easier to be in their alliances.  Less bickering and fighting.  Just do what you are told.  Dissenters didn't last long, they would be evicted and burned to the ground.  Might absolutely makes right in the Russian mind.",False,1649224927.0,t3_txb0ov,t1_i3l7y0u,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Imagine going to war with China to protect Hong Kong or Xinjiang, or imagine going to war with North Korea for humanitarian reasons. You could have a single person being tortured to death. You could have fifty million. It doesn't change the end of the world consequences if the country being invaded decides to go all or nothing.

When you are dealing with a nuclear-armed dictator, you draw the line at whatever puts the dictator in a position where he feels he has nothing left to lose. People are not reliable rational actors. Putin is not a collection of people like the Soviet or Chinese ruling cadres. He is a single tyrant with near absolute power. The most powerful people below him are split up and divided so that none can stand against him alone, and all of them are subject to intervention from lower-level drones in the security forces if they try to coordinate against him. If Putin feels his mission in life is at an end, or if he feels everything else will come crashing down if he doesn't do something really big to show he is serious, he could order a launch regardless of the consequences.

The West has done many things to help Ukraine against Putin's wishes. Alone, Ukraine's cities would all look like Mariupol, surrounded and starved and bombed out. Instead, Ukraine's own soldiers got the necessary warnings to catch Russia by surprise, the necessary equipment to win their encounters, and the necessary money and logistical support to keep their country functioning in a crisis. Putin could have said that's too much, he could have launched a nuke as a warning to stop. He didn't. That means the relief effort didn't push him past his threshold yet. It doesn't mean he has no threshold. It doesn't mean he will ignore everything else the same way. He already signaled he was getting desperate when he fired missiles at international staging areas near the border with Poland.

Avoiding nuclear war isn't about giving Putin everything he wants without a fight. It's about making difficult decisions about where to draw the line, being very slow to introduce new forms of aid, and to treat each Russian retaliation as a tripwire potentially connected to a nuclear bomb. No local tragedy is worth ending the world. Every local tragedy is worth trying to influence the outcome as much as the limiting factors will allow.

Let me say- I don’t blame the Ukrainian soldiers at all. It’s not a situation where taking a POW is really feasible, and after what they’ve seen, I’d probably do the same if not worse to the fuckers. But what’s happening on the video really can’t be disputed. It’s a video of them killing a captured enemy combatant. It’s also a video of other enemy combatants who have clearly been killed execution style- face down, hands tied, bullet wound to the head.

That only works so well against North Korea because of their size and location. Russia doesn’t have that issue.
