Day 322-324 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past couple of days were all very quiet, with no missile or drone strikes. The air raid alerts continued to trigger all the time as usual, but they were either mostly uneventful, or Belgorod oblast was shelled during them. Very often air raid alert triggers when there are artillery duels happening close to the border, even though we have a specific artillery strike warning it‚Äôs barely being used recently.

We haven‚Äôt had a new massive missile strike in quite some time, our forces were predicting that the next one could happen at the end of this week, and it still might, but usually they don‚Äôt fire missiles during the weekends. The last big missile strike did happen on weekend, but it was a special occasion, because they would never miss an opportunity to bomb us on New Year‚Äôs. So I‚Äôm not sure if there will be a missile strike today or tomorrow, though there‚Äôs a good chance it will happen at the start of the next week.

It's great to see that there are finally some talks about giving us western MBTs. Of course, for now it‚Äôs just talks and it‚Äôs not officially finalized yet, but I guess we will have our confirmations after the next Ramstein meeting, it makes sense for it to be announced there since it‚Äôs happening so soon. Apparently, we are also going to get SAMP-T from Italy, which will be a great addition to our air defense as it‚Äôs basically a Patriot variant, and we definitely need more of them. We are still months away from receiving them, but we are getting a pretty significant number of new AA systems, so it will be worth the wait.

\(The statement he is referring to is a claim that Soledar has been stormed exclusively by Wagner units which contradicts the official MoD statement that it was done by the regular army units\).

> Mr Prigozhin's so-called ""silence"", however, is a very loud hint at a ""rocking boat"". And Mr Troshev's (who is employed by Prigozhin) statement could hardly have been made without the ""chief's"" permission.

> There is a fierce conflict between the ""official Defence Ministry"" and the ""unofficial army"". Or rather, between their leadership. A conflict which, in times of war, is completely unacceptable.

> Given my lack of sympathy for both sides of the conflict (both the leadership of the Defense Ministry, and the leadership of the Wagner PMC), I dare say that this aggravation is caused by the threat posed to Wagner by the new commander of the operation - the ""loyal Shoiguist"" Gerasimov.

> The head of the General Staff (who, on top of everything else, was personally lambasted by Prigozhin) has clearly been appointed to the new position with one main goal: to put an end to ""The Fronde"" directed at the Plywood Marshal, which is flourishing at the front. In the short term, as it seems to me, Shoigu (through Gerasimov) will demand the full subordination of the PMCs to the Ministry of Defense by any means necessary - up to the disbandment of Wagner units and transfer of personnel / weapons to their own structures (for example, their long-established ""pet"" PMC ""Patriot""). Along with the removal of all those whom Shoigu and Gerasimov personally deem ""hostile"" to them and a threat to Shoigu personally in terms of competition in the domestic political arena.

> And now the president has the last word. Putin (as he likes to do) must act as an arbiter. If the situation does not change and Wagner retains its status - then the intervention has taken place. If not... Prigozhin will find himself thrown out not only of the military but also the political field (for without his private army he is a nobody with no name). And - in turn - this will mean a sharp strengthening of Shoigu's own position (which is also unlikely to please many in Staryaya Square \[location of the presidential administration\] and around Putin).

> If we could detach ourselves from the backroom political intrigues of the Kremlin reptiles, the most natural way out of this situation (logical from all sides) would be for Putin personally to assume command and control of the situation. And then both sides of the conflict would remain ""on equal footing"" with him as commander-in-chief. However, for almost 11 months now the President has been stubbornly avoiding personal responsibility for the actions of the army in the war (and with good reason - the victories of his army have been ""scarce""). But now he will have to make a choice: either to let Prigozhin be ""gobbled up"", or to deal a heavy blow to Shoigu, or to take matters into his own hands.

Ukrainian troops still on edge of Soledar, a soldier tells CNN
From CNN's Scott McLean in Kyiv 

A Ukrainian soldier stationed in the eastern city of Bakhmut has told CNN that Ukrainian units are still at the edges of the nearby town of Soledar, which has been under intense attack by Russian forces for several weeks.

Paratroopers from 77th and 46th brigades ""are still on the western outskirts of Soledar,"" said Taras Berezovets, a captain in the Ukrainian Special Forces First Brigade.

However, he added, remaining in Soledar made no military sense, because it was ""completely destroyed. There is no single building which survived Russian shelling.""

The morale among front-line units remains high, he said, but added that he believed a decision to withdraw would be made in the coming days.

Now, he said, the units see their mission as holding on as long as possible and killing as many Wagner fighters as possible.

Wagner fighters, who are part of a mercenary group and not the regular Russian armed forces, have been prominent in the ground assault against Soledar. He said much of the fighting over the last two weeks had involved street fighting in Soledar between small units of four to eight fighters.  

Withdrawing from Soledar would not affect the ability of Ukrainian forces to resupply Bakhmut, which is a few kilometers to the southwest, Berezovets believed, adding that two major roads into Bakhmut remained firmly in Ukrainian hands, and Ukrainian fighter jets had been attacking Russian positions near Bakhmut during Friday.",False,1673620772.0,t3_10akkwv,t3_10akkwv,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

We fucked up insanely when we gave up all of our nukes, and then demilitarized even more to complete programs like DTRA and others. We were fools to believe this is a ‚Äúnew age‚Äù, and that ‚Äúwe have no one to fight with‚Äù. It was clearly a mistake. 

But now, with SK, and many others clearly seeking nuclear deterrence, the world is entering in to another stage of proliferation. It is entering this stage because of Russia actions, and more importantly - Western hesitance and inaction. 

With this, unfortunately for Ukraine, we lose one of the most important arguments, that Victory of Ukraine will prevent further nuclear proliferation and spread of nukes in the world. That victory for Ukraine will lead to positive example for history and the world, and will deter future agressors and tyrants from attempting to wage wars of conquest. 

Unfortunately, because of slow and careful reaction from the west - it is not the case anymore. 

More and more countries see the power of nuclear weapons, and how Russia is allowed to torture, kill, rape, genocide Ukrainians with impunity. They see that Russia, because of protection granted them by Nuclear weapons, can freely target entirety of Ukraine, escalate as much as they want, and in return - western powers are not only not punishing Russia hard enough (full embargo is not implemented, Russia is not declared terrorist state, the are not booted from UN for their heinous crimes), but are hesitant to provide Ukraine tools it needs to win, or even survive, such as planes and longer range missiles. 

While Russia is allowed to freely and always escalate and torture Ukraine, Ukraine‚Äôs aid is limited by ""concerns"" and ""fear of escalation"". A lot of people fearing Russian defeat, thinking it can result in nuclear strike. This is why all the aid is so ‚Äúgradual‚Äù and carefully considered.

They are giving them so many exists, and many are still banking and are ready for them to return on the global stage, after ‚Äúpeace‚Äù deal is struck. Disregard all they have done, disregard all the suffering they have caused, disregard that they have learned nothing. 

Many countries see this. And they do not want to share the same faith that we in Ukraine suffer. They see that this war lasts for nearly a year, and there is no end in sight. And Russia is still allowed in nearly all international organizations, and more and more people are saying that ""Ukraine must give up territory for ""peace"".

Members of Ukraine‚Äôs 46th Air Assault Brigade on Friday said they were ""hanging on"" in Soledar...

> ""We're hanging on,"" a post on the 46th Brigade's channel said. ""But we are being surrounded. Heavy fighting continues inside the city."" The post continued: ""Apparently, the Russians were able to cut off those who were near the railway station and Mine 7 and are making efforts to consolidate the encirclement.‚Äù

A Ukrainian solder in the vicinity of Soledar told CNN Friday that he believed he and his comrades had been left to surrender.

> ‚ÄúIt's easier to leave us to surrender than to put effort into a breakthrough,‚Äù the soldier, whom CNN is not naming for security reasons, said on the phone. ‚ÄúIt means more casualties ... Our units are being systematically pushed to the city center [by Russian forces] and split from each other.‚Äù

The soldier in Soledar told CNN he expected a repeat of Russia‚Äôs conquest of Mariupol early in the war, when a group of soldiers held out in the city‚Äôs steel works.

> ‚ÄúThe same happened in Mariupol,‚Äù the soldier told CNN. ‚ÄúI'm 100% sure it will be like this with us. We will be left here, the Russians will take captive whom they can. Then we might be exchanged.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWe will not be able to hide for long,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are now in basements and houses. Shooting and firefights are everywhere. Even at night.‚Äù

> ""The Russians conduct the cleansing sweep of those they surrounded in the northwest,"" of the town, he said.

The soldier added a recent Ukrainian reinforcement unit had approached the town without any equipment and had immediately come under fire.  

The exact situation in the town is difficult to ascertain. The same brigade, on fb, said that fighting was ongoing only ‚Äúon the outskirts‚Äù of the town and spoke about the battle in the past tense.

 > ‚ÄúThe fighting in Soledar was fierce and ruthless,‚Äù it said on fb.

The brigade said Russian forces focused on seizing Soledar only for a propaganda victory once they realized a months-long assault on Bakhmut would fail. 

> ‚ÄúIt took almost six months for the Russian occupiers to realize the inefficiency and futility of their attempts to storm Bakhmut. Therefore, since the beginning of the year they have shifted their combat activity to Soledar to divert media attention from the failures in the Bakhmut direction,"" the fb statement read.  ‚ÄúOur brigade withstood these extremely difficult challenges with dignity.""

> ""Fighting on the outskirts of Soledar continues,"" the statement read, a message echoed by the Ukrainian military's General Staff.

It's always the worst people who want to shout their horrible, selfish, racist opinions the loudest. 

Don't take this as a defense of Russia ‚Äî their problems are deep-rooted and authoritarian corruption has destroyed their society, and there are so many terrible people it's impossible to count them.

But you are going to make yourself crazy if all you look at is the worst humanity has to offer. Which is why I don't read that horrible crap. It's propaganda. It's a mob mentality taking over where they try to out-extreme to be the worst.

Lying is a daily aspect of life and so they lie and say the most extreme things they can because I truly believe that they believe that just by thinking it hard enough, by shit-talking loud enough, by believing it enough then they will in fact be winning, and powerful, and superior and on top of the world, instead of living a miserable life of victimhood and deprivation in a third-world country with a gas station to make some money, run by thieves. 

So I'm saying they're a terrible society populated by terrible people that needs to be studied and never forgotten, same as you are. But for slightly different and even worse reasons, that its not the horrible things they say (a given) but the horrible ways they don't seem to believe in anything except who can I fuck over to get ahead, because that's the world the thieves made when the Soviet Union collapsed. 

The Soviets had whole books full of problems, but this lot gave up any and all pretense that what they were doing was ideologically correct and just went for how much can I steal and how much power can I get so I get to tell other people what they have to do for me.

The best way to prevent the 2022 invasion would've been to park a garrison in Ukraine after 2014. The status of the territories lost in 2014 might've remained in limbo, but at least Russia would have been deterred.

Failing that, now with an invasion in our hands, there should've been a military intervention somewhere in 2022. Once the major fighting had ground to a stalemate - or once it became clear that Russia would not be able to defeat Ukraine any time soon. Or fuck it, on the first fucking day. Of course, *entirely* limited to Russian military forces in Ukrainian territory. 

Not even an ultimatum, just starting an air campaign with no advance warning, and responding to any Russian tantrum with a terse ""the bombing will continue until Russia is out of the country"", calling Putin's nuclear bluffing.  

Would there have been a risk of escalation into full on war? Obviously, and it's probably for the best that the West does not do that... but as you said, there are extremely bad geopolitical consequences to doing so. It gives nuclear states a ""get out of jail"" free card to do whatever they want. And even for countries that aren't terrible, having more and more nuclear states always increases the risk of global nuclear war. 

I understand that the current measures against Russia are already making it suffer. Its economy is taking a shit, its military is being depleted and will take decades to recover even if they won the war today. This can still effectively ""kill"" Russia. But being so cautious with Russia might be dooming us all to something even worse down the line.

Right now i see that NATO is willing to take about 0 risks and this is indicatory of not being prepared to ramp up the risk profile when it absolutely should be (last moment, no fall back situation).

If we are not willing to ""sacrifice"" (and at this point i mean this as a volunteer based action) soldiers in order to increase the risk profile for Russian military quite soon, i fear that NATOs deterrence could start to melt down. You see, military as a deterrence is mostly posture, it is entirely another thing to actually defend against invasion. Being invaded means you already lost a lot, it is never good situation no matter how many F35 you have at bay. Most important thing right now would be to force Russia into game of dilution, where each million of mobilized men they get into arms, half of them must be sent to bolster up their astoundingly risky and long border between the West. This is how Cold War worked and led to the economical demise of soviet union. 

Cold war era was different, because it was waged by the tough people from the ashes of WW2 who kept up the promise of not giving an inch. Those people would most likely ensured that Russia would not dare to enter Ukraine. Now the people who have embezzled in the Russian money and other prosperity are suddenly coming from another angle to the same problem. In order for them to create deterrence they have to toughen up and start taking risks, even the kind that might lead to personal death.

To me NATO looks a lot like organization that is counting its alliance planes and bombs, thinking that to deter war you have to create long list of those assets.

The city was captured by Wagner and Prigozhin had big political plans and hoped that capturing Soledar would help him achieve them.

Now Wagner, having their victory stolen and being humiliatingly put under command of the two guys they were shitting on for months are very demoralised.

When war reaches this point, it's two massive economies and militaries grinding against each other trying to wear each other out into complete capitulation. *Sometimes*, a country or military reaches a dramatic and critical failure point, like you just literally run out of artillery ammunition, and then everything collapses. We've seen more limited local military examples of this in this war. 

We *might* see a major critical failure point in the future. But it's unlikely. Because large militaries and economies have massive capacity to adapt, shift around resources, and kick the can down the road (shifting major problems to be tomorrow's problems). But I think this is not something to hold out hope for. It is hard to comprehend the size and scale of countries as big as Russia. They have enormous resources to shift around. If Putin wants to have this war last a long time, he probably can. That's why I say, be patient.

The good news is that this war is massively asymmetrical. As Western support continues and escalates, Ukraine will receive more modern and better equipment as Russia will be forced to retreat back to 1960s stock. I believe we'll see Russia try to play the last cards it has at its disposal (at minimum) before this war has a chance of ending. Massive mobilization is one of their last viable cards (previously unthinkable). If it goes poorly, we may see a rapid end to the conflict. If it does not, the grind will continue and just become even more devastating for both Russia and Ukraine...

The good news is The West will never allow Ukraine to be defeated. Ukraine will never allow itself to be conquered. Putin will 'never' surrender. These dynamics will keep the conflict going. But in the end, Ukraine and The West will get their way because they represent such massively larger, more capable interests.

This is clear by the fact due to low number of troops he sent to Ukraine compared to what experts would say would be needed for a full scale invasion (200k vs 700k the Soviet Union used for the invasion of Czechoslovakia), and the initial rush to the capital and the Hostomel Airport.

Used well one top of the line Western tank could be worth 10 T 72's.  On an open plain a Challenger with it's 5km firing range could devastate a Russian brigade and only have a very small risk from direct hit artillery fire.

For a good example of what Abram's and Challengers can do there are many reports from the first gulf war and the Iraq invasion in 2003.  Both were against the same sort of firepower they are going up against now but some would argue better trained and more battle hardened Iraqi troops and tank divisions.

The onesideness of those tank battles and even Iraqi tanks vs US IFV's was stark.  The Iraqis lost 3300 tanks, the allies....31.  Admittedly a lot of this was through air power as well but Western Main battle tanks used well in combined arms warfare, which the UA has shown to be very good at, are a fearsome force even in small quantities offensively and defensively.

Add to this the **length of the front** is absolutely mindblowingly huge.  Those hundreds of thousands of troops and however many serviceable tanks and IFV's Russia have left are trying to defend that entire front.  UA can move quickly within it (they basically hold the corner at Lyschansk.)

As an example to get from Kreminna to Tokmak is 220 kms on pretty good roads for UA. To defend Tokmak for Russia with troops from Kreminna it's more like a 500 kms  trip under risk of Himars attack along a lot of the route. That makes things incredibly manoeuvrable for UA and very stuck for Russia. If UA have one big defence breaking tank division made up of the Western MBT's and shift it from East to South or vice Versa quickly, Russia cannot react in time and will be pretty much helpless to stop their lines crumbling

EDIT. I should add the tank division will be being assembled somewhere equidistant between the two likely attack points, probably Dnipro under cover of increased AA capability, so it's an even shorter journey time to either front.

To use a russian parallel, 9/11 was roughly equivalent to blowing up St Basil's Cathedral in the Red Square while said square was full of people.

And thus very, very personal.

This wasn't just a US sentiment either. On 9/11 itself, I was abroad, but even then the perceived magnitude of the event wasn't all that different. It was the only thing on every channel. No soccer or action movies. No soaps for the grannies. No cartoons for the kids.

As Russia is proving, manpower is a thing that countries can typically paper over in the short-term. But running out of men is rarely the primary reason a war is lost.  

But Russia is stereotypically stuck in their past, *WWII in particular*, where there is an example of this! This is nearly always the case with this country's elites and 'intelligentsia', obsessed with their 'glory days'! It is hard to understand Russian culture and ways of thinking until you realize how obsessed they are to looking backwards and inwards on themselves for answers.

It is true that one of the driving factors of *WWII Germany's* capitulation was simply running out of guys. But that was a country that fought WWI the generation prior. And then tried to take over all of Western Europe. And then try to take over part of Africa. Then try to take over all of Eastern Europe. To say WWII Germany was stretched too thin and overcommitted would be quite the understatement! Ukraine is just fighting for Ukraine, not world domination. All their people are there. Russian, in contrast, is now challenging their supply chain and logistics of the entire Western World that have profound strategic interest and capacity to ensure that Russia does not win.

So the situations are completely different. It seems crazy to compare the situations. But if you look in Russia, that is exactly what they have done. They purposefully frame this as another crusade against the Nazis. Many have convinced themselves that this is WWII all over again. But in the end, because these situations are completely different, I would never expect this war ends due to running out of people on either side! But Russia may not see that yet.

The Abrams is not invulnerable to Russian mines or AT weapons. It can be knocked out just like a T-90 can be knocked out by the weapons widely distributed on both sides. It can't just speed through a bunch of mines or shrug-off wire-guided missiles. It is reliant on complex combined-arms warfare.

What do you envision 100 Abrams would do to ""win the whole war""? Attack in one big group?
