I'll quote only the reply to the main comment, as the reply is already quite long, but he provides some good points. If you want me to post a translation of the original comment (quite long), I can do that in a separate comment. 

>To the previous repost uv. Atomics.
>I will note the following chronology of recent events after the SCO session in Samarkand, which was very unsuccessful for Russia:

>September 19 - Patrushev's visit to China for secret talks with the head of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, as well as one of the members of their Politburo.

>September 20 - hastily, without any preliminary preparation, the occupied parts of Ukraine (KhPR, ZPR, LPR, DPR) announce referendums. Prior to this, the administrators put the brakes on the issue of referendums.

>September 21 - announcement of mobilization. It was also a hasty decision, as we now understand, made in a few hours.

>September 22 - The Chinese Foreign Ministry demands negotiations and a ceasefire from Russia and Ukraine without any preconditions.

>September 21-23 - As if by agreement, even those few countries that have maintained positive neutrality with Russia - Turkey, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam - refuse to accept the Mir card.

>September 22-23 ‚Äì A hasty exchange of members of the Ukrainian national battalions, for whom they pompously built a judicial cell, and then a scaffold for execution.

>23.09 - India announces that it will stop buying Russian oil even with the huge discounts.

>So I agree with the conclusions of uv. Atomics. During Patrushev's visit to China, Big Brother probably decided on Porukha and demanded that some important message be sent to Putin through the Secretary of the Security Council. Probably, the message is that Asia, which previously maintained a neutral attitude towards the tricks of the state grandfathers, does not intend to tolerate it any longer. Everyone was finally tired of this, especially when the Russian authorities began to shout more and more about nuclear war. I think even in China, no one wants to burn in nuclear ashes.

>Then what does the current mobilization mean? Has the Kremlin decided to disobey China now? Or is it a cosplay of the old fashion lesson from the gangs ""keep me seven! I‚Äôm not responsible for myself, here‚Äôs a knife, I‚Äôll cut everyone! to come out ""from strong positions"" to negotiate with the West on the termination of the NWO?
I think we'll find out before winter.

Day 213 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day, it feels weird having some peace and quiet after the never ending shelling and missile strikes in the past 7 months. There wasn‚Äôt even much shelling in Kharkiv oblast, though 1 missile did strike something in Krasnohrad at around 12:45pm, which is very deep inside Kharkiv oblast, not sure what they hit with it, but there were no other missile strikes today.

After most of Kharkiv oblast was liberated reports about civilians dying from mines basically everywhere just skyrocketed. There are civilian deaths from mines almost daily, sometimes multiples of them per day, and even more people get injured. It will now be extremely dangerous to stray from roads for decades, and going to any forest is pretty much forbidden now, 2 people were injured by mines while gathering mushrooms in forests just today alone.

Those Russian aircraft loses today are pretty intense, 4 planes and apparently even a Ka-52 as well. Even Russians in their telegram channels noticed and were very unhappy about it. Were they given an order to be more aggressive? Because if that‚Äôs how it will continue, then they won‚Äôt have any planes left in a couple of months, this would be great for us.

>The Russian president has rejected requests from commanders in the field that they be allowed to retreat from Kherson, a vital city in Ukraine‚Äôs south.
>
>WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has thrust himself more directly into strategic planning for the war in Ukraine in recent weeks, American officials said, including rejecting requests from his commanders on the ground that they be allowed to retreat from the vital southern city of Kherson.
>
>A withdrawal from Kherson would allow the Russian military to pull back across the Dnipro River in an orderly way, preserving its equipment and saving the lives of soldiers.
>
>But such a retreat would be another humiliating public acknowledgment of Mr. Putin‚Äôs failure in the war, and would hand a second major victory to Ukraine in one month. Kherson was the first major city to fall to the Russians in the initial invasion, and remains the only regional capital under Moscow‚Äôs control. Retaking it would be a major accomplishment for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
>
>Focused on victory at all costs, Mr. Putin has become a more public face of the war as the Russian military appears increasingly in turmoil, forcing him to announce a call-up this week that could sweep 300,000 Russian civilians into military service. This month, Moscow has demonstrated it has too few troops to continue its offensive, suffers from shortages of high-tech precision weaponry and has been unable to gain dominance of Ukraine‚Äôs skies.
>
>But American officials briefed on highly sensitive intelligence said that behind the scenes Mr. Putin is taking on an even deeper role in the war, including telling commanders that strategic decisions in the field are his to make. Although Mr. Putin has accepted some recommendations from military commanders, including the mobilization of civilians, his involvement has created tensions, American officials said.
>
>The officials said that Mr. Putin‚Äôs rejection of a military pullback from Kherson has also led to a decrease in morale among Russian troops who have been mostly cut off from their supply lines, and who appear to believe they could be left stranded against Ukrainian forces.
>
>‚ÄúThe situation in Ukraine is clearly dynamic,‚Äù Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview on Friday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early for a full assessment, but it is clear to me that the strategic initiative has shifted to the Ukrainians.‚Äù But he cautioned that there remains a ‚Äúlong road ahead.‚Äù

I remember this person talking about how governments in the Middle-East make their societies strict with stupid rules (like ‚Äúmust wear a hijab‚Äù) on purpose. They do it because it‚Äôs so outrageous and controlling that people will always protest it when they get fed up - instead of protesting the actual shit things the government does (like corruption, torture, execution of political prisoners). They hope is people will be too busy protesting about the stuff that affects them the most that the other shitty stuff the government does flies under the radar.

1. Ukrainian all-out resistance (no flowers)
2. Failure to take Kyiv quickly
3. Massive Western sanctions, including expelling from SWIFT and seizure of foreign reserves
4. A cornucopia of NATO weapons for Ukraine, including HIMARS
5. Sinking of Moskva, humiliation of Russian navy
6. Sweden and Finland joining NATO
7. EU not backing down due to energy blackmail
8. Successful counter-attacks by Ukraine
9. 50,000+ dead Russian soldiers, depleted Russian military in terms of equipment
10. Destabilization of Russian sphere of influence and CSTO
11. Talk of Russia removed from UN security council (diplomatic isolation)
12. Ukraine moving militarily to take back Crimea
13. Mobilization in Russia
14. Martial law in Russia (rumored)

My guess is Putin would have already given up on his plans to invade if he knew about the first 3 in advance.

From the language I just used my feelings on the matter should be obvious, but what's bothering me today is that it seems all the press on the subject keeps using those words for what's happening: again ""voting"" and ""referendums"" when of course neither is accurate. 

The problem is that these words are really the best words to describe what's happening if what was happening was in any way normal, but what's happening here is so far from normal that I don't think what we're describing can reasonably be called ""voting"" anymore. Nor is coercing a population with two choices: 1. check this box here or 2. run and hide for a few days and don't participate ‚Äî in any way a referendum on the people's wishes. 

Either outcome works for the Russians. It's *mostly* not openly violent because they only need to round up and shoot anyone organizing a boycott or opposition. As long as most people can't not participate and visibly check a box in front of an armed soldier they're good. If some run away so be it, as long as there aren't too many and none of them actually vote no. You throw some no votes into the mix at the end to make it look better. A weird reverse ballot-stuffing. 


So using these words at all is providing a legitimate context to what's happening that then need to be modified to say its a ""sham referendum"". But it's not a referendum at all! It's like describing a robbery at gunpoint as a retail transaction. 

The thing  is I can't really think of better words myself either, so I sympathize with the journalists and news agencies. The best I've got is ""coercions"" and that, although accurate, isn't specific. ""Astroturfing"" is good, as it's creating a fake grassroots base for opinion, but that's exotic and requires its own explanation. 

""Mass coercion to allegiance"" is the best right now I've got but kind of wordy. I like the idea of if an idea requires modification to fit the facts better that modification should be from the real thing, not something else that gets negated. Even negated using the word ""referendum"" is just, like everything they do, a flat-out lie. But even negated the word hangs around and provides cover, as the negation is never strong enough. 

This use of language is too much like how Russian propaganda works: even negated the word remains out there, eroding the truth and making facts blurrier, which is what they want. 

Maybe ""fake so-called referendums"" might be strong enough but I'm sticking with ""mass violent coercion to show support for the invasion"", wordy or not. At least it's accurate. 

I'm open to suggestions and hope we can come up with something better that the press can start using, because they absolutely should not be calling what's happening any sort of ""voting"" or ""referendum"". We need to stop using those words immediately.

""In Bourgeois terms it was a war between the allies and Germany. In Bolshevik terms it was a war between the allied and German upper classes and which of them won was a matter of indifference. I was ordered by the party to enlist, I gave my name as Petra. They were shouting for victory all over Europe, praying for victory to the same god. My task, the party's task, was to organise defeat. From defeat would spring the revolution, and the revolution would be victory for us. The party looked to the conscript peasants, most of them wearing their first good pair of boots and when the boots wore out they will be ready to listen. When the time came I was able to take 3 battalions with me out of the frontline. The best day's work I ever did, but for the moment there was nothing to be done, there were too many volunteers like me. Mostly it was mere hysteria, but there were men with better motives, men who saw the times were critical and wanted a man's part, good men wasted, unhappy men too. Unhappy with their jobs, unhappy with their wives, doubting themselves. Happy men don't volunteer, they wait their turn and thank God if their age or work delays it. The ones who got back home at the price of an arm or an eye or a leg, these were the lucky ones. Even Comrade Lenin underestimated both the anguish of that 900 mile long front and our cursed capacity for suffering. By the second winter of the war the boots had worn out but the lines still held. Their great coats fell to pieces on their backs, their rations were irregular, half of them went into action without arms led by men they didn't trust. And those they did trust? At last, they did what all the armies dreamed of doing. they began to go home. That was the beginning of the revolution.""",False,1663993119.0,t3_xmiebd,t3_xmiebd,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

By calling mobilisation, Putin has effectively tied the result of the war to his ability to hold power. As a leader, he has basically ‚Äúowned‚Äù the war. Prior to this, he could have perhaps blamed failures on other people (generals, sabotage, etc), but now any failure will be on _his_ head.

He‚Äôs done this because he believes mobilisation can achieve a favourable end to the war - Russian annexation of LNR and DPR, and a land-bridge between Crimea and Russia Proper. He‚Äôs probably expecting to achieve this with a big Stalingrad-style push, maybe in the spring. The war will almost certainly stalemate over the winter months.

The question that remains is whether or not it‚Äôs possible. Russia currently doesn‚Äôt have the resources to hold the 1,000km front line for very long, let alone make a big push. Poorly-motivated, poorly-equipped, cold, miserable conscripts may not be enough to turn the tide.

Those of you thinking about nukes, here is the facts for you: the belief is that the referendums are being carried out partially to give Putin reason to make a tactical nuclear strike in retaliation to UAF attacks in annexed locations. This won‚Äôt happen for two reasons:
- If Russia uses even just 1 nuclear weapon in retaliation to attacks on annexed ground, they will find themselves even more isolated from the global economy than North Korea. That is plain and simple fact. Not a single country will stand for nuclear warheads being used offensively, and Russia will be trade embargoed by even the penguins in Antarctica.
- Ukraine has launched attacks in Crimea, which is also annexed territory, and no nukes have been launched.

820c6e0949aaa66cc06adf875a7209b1,xmiebd,iprn9gj,"Heya! Since we're seeing a few more open-minded Russian and Russian-adjacent (i.e. relatives, etc.) posters around today, I thought it might be helpful to pause and do a full rundown of their situation as seen from outside of the Putin propaganda bubble. Am I inside other, different propaganda bubbles myself? No doubt! But mine seem to have the edge in accuracy at the moment. So let's do this one last time:

 1. So you know how Putin said Ukraine isn't a real nation or culture? Yeah, the Ukrainians disagree.

 2. Followup: the Ukrainians really, *really* don't want you there. Like, at all.

 3. Yes, they will kill you all if you come for them. No, it's not very nice, but look at it from their point of view. What did you guys do the last time someone was dumb enough to invade Russia proper?

 4. What about the whole ""we're brother cultures"" approach? I mean, yeah, that might've maybe worked if you'd given it an honest go way back before 2014. But now that you've tried to blitzkrieg their capitol, seems to me that it's just maybe a *little bit late* for that. Tiny bit. Just a tad.

 5. On a side note, the other thing you have standing in your way there is the legacy of Soviet-era stuff like the Holodomor. As far as I know, you've never really honestly contended with that old bad history. And here's where that's gonna really cost you. (Now, is it fair that you have to deal with this given all the shit that *America's* pulled over the years? Nope! I have no doubt karma comes for us all in the end and that we all pay for our sins in time. But today? *Today, it's your turn.*)

 6. Did some of the current situation come about as a result of US/NATO/Western meddling? Who knows. But I still don't think we'd be here if this wasn't what the Ukrainians really wanted. If we could just magic up fighting spirit and determination, don't you think we would've done that in Afghanistan?

 7. Speaking of which - take it from someone in a country that's recently learned the hard way - *again* - that you can't just remold things to your liking with military force alone: **just stop.** Stop hurting people. Stop making things worse for yourselves and others. At this point, it doesn't matter what you do. Your damaged pride is gonna remain damaged. The Ukrainians are gonna hate you for what you've done to them, maybe for a long time. All you're doing now is throwing lives away into a bad situation that - as far as I can see - only gets worse from here on out for everyone, one way or another.

 8. And what about Putin? Well, let's face it. Putin needs to go. Everyone knows it. He's overcommitted himself to all of this. He fully owns this debacle and he knows it. He wouldn't be pushing mobilization otherwise. Now the only question is how many people he takes with him on the long spiral down.

 9. But he's ensconced himself in power and the secret police and military establishments still seem behind him. So... right now, it looks like you're gonna have to do this the hard way. (Though looking at Russian history, are you really that surprised? I mean, shit, what else is new, right?) I don't know how to do that. I'm not a brave person, and I don't like telling people to do what I myself would be afraid of doing. The best I can think of is to maybe take a look at [this](https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/467529962c184258d08f16daec83d5da) for ideas. It's old, but I figure some of the stuff there is timeless.

 10. But let's keep it simple. You're hurting and afraid right now. I see that. **Just remember: get rid of Putin, and there's still a good chance to turn all of this around.** The sanctions can be removed. The conscripts can be pulled back. There's still time. There's still hope. Focus on that. End Putin, end the war. And maybe - just maybe - all of this goes away.

Here endeth the babble. Good luck, everyone. I honestly mean that. Fall's just begun. Suspect there's a long way yet to go before we're all out of the dark.",1664065686.0,1664056505.0,t3_xmiebd,t3_xmiebd,,0,50,0,50,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

I believe Putin knows this and purposely said that to get the western media going, he is not a madman, he is a manipulator. Russia‚Äôs nuclear deterrence Strategy is escalate to deescalate. He is using the fear of nukes as a weapon, not the nukes themselves. And I highly doubt Putin would use nukes to defend annexed territory. If Ukraine hit Moscow? Than yes but did Putin use nukes when Ukraine attacked Crimea or other Russian bases outside the Ukrainian border, no. So why would they Annex territory? Russia knows they are losing at this point, they know they are not going to get all of Ukraine and they are on the defensive at this point, trying to preserve as many gains as possible.

A) putin tries to drag this conflict for years until he ""retires"" and passes the hot potato to the next guy, who will eventually ""get bored"", they might claim, and withdraw in full. That's probably why they went ahead with the general mobilization. After all, in the kremlin's perspective, transforming this into yet another Afghanistan or another Vietnam is not as bad as straight-out losing the war to the Ukrainian army in the next couple of months. Except the russian military complex cannot sustain this war for much longer unless the West scales down significantly their assistance to Ukraine, and what I think the mobilization tells us is that putin's people are misleading him yet again, convincing him that russia has the means to sustain a prolonged war of attrition when in reality it doesn't have anything of the sort. Which leads us to option B) losing to NATO. Once putin sees the invasion collapsing beyond the point of no return, possibly already in the next few months, he might try to sell it as a loss against NATO. He has to sell that, not to the common rabble, but to the ones that matter, the military. The only way to force NATO boots into Ukraine for real is by resorting to his nuclear arsenal in some way. So he might try to target the Ukrainian forces with a low-yield nuclear weapon at that point. It's more likely that the West responds to that by deploying a strong convencional force to Ukraine than by nuking russian territory in return, because the latter would lead to a large-scale nuclear war. With NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine, putin won't risk using another nuclear weapon again, that would lead to the end of russia as we know it, and will have no other solution but to retreat and withdraw in full. But that's ""okay"", he's visibly losing to NATO after all, a coalition of 30 mighty countries, soon 32, that includes the US. No country can beat that by itself!, they argue, so the russian military might swallow that loss and leave putin, the man, unscathed. But now the nuclear taboo has been broken and future conflicts might involve nuclear weapons too because of this precedent. So, in the end, along with all the suffering of so many thousands and all the needless destruction, including the near-collapse of the russian federation, the real outcome of this war might be the opening of pandora's nuclear box.

2faf244eb3981a34f64812433725912d,xmiebd,iprtbsp,"Okay, so, help me out with any flaw in my logic here:

Putin is a psychopath, but he's not an irrational idiot like Hitler was. He's way more calculating (Even if his calculated gamble with the so called 'special operation' has turned into a total disaster).

He sees the situation right now, and sees a very real possibility that Ukraine might score a total victory because of the recent advances. A humiliating defeat like that is entirely unsurvivable in his eyes. Such a thing would mean the end of him, whether sent to the Hague, shot somewhere never to be seen again or dragged through the streets like Gaddafi. Doesn't matter.

There are only two possibilities to get out of this situation: A full-scale mobilisation to turn the tide, or the nuclear option. So he prepares for both.

I just don't see how mobilisation will solve anything since it's equipment and supplies that the Russians really lack, and I'm sure he's aware of it too. As I've said, Putin never struck me as stupid, just cold and uncaring about how his decisions impact the lives of actual people. I suspect the mobilised men will just be used to prop up the numbers and slow the Ukrainian advance so the Russian army doesn't get completely overrun before the 2nd phase of the plan.

And the 2nd phase to get out of it is simple: Do the usual sham elections and declare those occupied oblasts as Russian territory, then use a single tactical nuclear weapon at some unimportant location in the name of 'defending Russian territory', but also warn the world in advance that he's going to use it.

There would be a massive upheaval in the world about its use of course, but NATO would likely not respond with nuclear launches of their own. No reason to burn the whole world because of a single tactical nuke when things can still be negotiated.

And negotiations is exactly what he wants. He'll demand Ukraine to stop the advance and accept peace terms with annexed parts as Russian territory, or he's going to use more, but only on those specific oblasts so as not to escalate the situation into a world war. All these sham election moves are just so he can say 'officially' he's using the nukes defensively.

So Ukraine and NATO are left with two options, continue the advance and risk escalation, or stop and negotiate. And I think the west will force Ukraine to negotiate. Total isolation would follow for Russia of course, but Putin will save his ass. And that's all he cares about right now.

That's why I think that if this 'mobilisation' effort has no meaningful impact in the war, the nuclear option is very likely and shouldn't be discarded like so many in here are doing. In fact I think it's a logical deduction of the recent moves like the annexations and the rhetoric. He's laying the groundwork and he's going to use one.

7396ffbb5a3824d6040de9055b18a4b3,xmiebd,ipr7tha,"Honestly, the famous AK durability is a bit of a myth. It's not really any more or less durable than any other no-frills automatic rifle.

Compared to the original M16, which had some reliability issues (to say the least), especially around the fact that the cleaning kit supplied with it was incapable of actually cleaning it, the AK was perceived as a reliable gun, and captured examples were popular with US Special Forces in Vietnam. However, the M16A1 was easily as reliable as the AK, if not more so, with far better tolerances on the machining and a much more watertight design.

A lot of the stories about ""unbreakable"" AKs basically stem from the fact that rather than being hard to break, it's very easy to fix, and even a substantial stoppage is quite easy to clear due to the gun being quick to break down for a quick fix, to field strip, or even to fully strip to the last component.

It also has the advantage that it fires from a closed bolt, not an open bolt, i.e. the hole in the side (the ejector port) from which fired casings emerge, is sealed over in the ""resting"" state, as the reciprocating bolt is slid forwards. Many US designs of the day fired from an open bolt, i.e. on the first shot, the force of the reciprocating bolt sliding home helped to seat the cartridge and fire the round. There are many reasons why this is often preferable, including smoother operation and better heat dissipation during sustained automatic fire, as well as the gun being easier to unload (as a bullet is only chambered when the trigger is pulled, whereas on a closed bolt gun, even with the magazine removed the gun is not fully unloaded until the action is cycled to remove the bullet already chambered), but the flipside is that it means there's a large open hole in the side of the gun, into which water and mud and grime can enter, which directly accesses the most delicate and complex moving parts of the gun. Many US designs had ""flip open"" dust covers over the ejector port for protection, but this meant they could not be fired immediately and soldiers had to trade off between better ingress protection by closing the cover, or faster time to first shot fired by leaving the cover open.

The AK also had an ""accidental"" success aspect to its reliability, which was the fact that as compensation for poor manufacturing tolerance capabilities, a lot of the moving parts had large gaps, by design, between them, such as the fact that the bolt reciprocates into a void covered above by a loosely shaped stamped metal plate. This meant that if grime and grit did enter the action of the gun, it wouldn't jam up quite as easily. Basically, by being more badly made, it's accidentally better than a gun with fine tolerances and no substantial gaps around moving parts. Sure, that means the AK is ""rattlier"" and less smooth firing, but it is part of why the AK is seen as reliable.

None of these features, though, are unique to the AK. It just happens to be a common example of them.",False,1664049591.0,t3_xmiebd,t1_ipr2u75,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Deep rust on trunion, bolt face, barrel throat? Probably fucked. Won't hold gas pressure upon firing. 

Deep rust on springs or spring guide? Surprisingly not as there are old Russian army tricks to get them to shoot with a rubber band, unless it's the hammer spring. Then it's fucked. 

Dust cover? Don't even need it, it's fine. Reciever? As long as it's not pitting around the rivets it's fine. 

Gas tube? Iffy. Can operate without unless it's rusted the piston shut (think some factories might have had the foresight to chrome plate the piston heads though). Then it's time to soak in desel and hope things break apart before you need the rifle. 


Now that said, about half of the rifles in the videos released have concerning amounts of Rust near or just straight up on vital parts. No idea how bad the firing pins are but a couple of them look like solid candidates for an out of battery detonation.

Huh? They need Javelins, MANPADS, HIMARS etc. Not boats, right?

But in the extensive waterways and shorelines of Ukraine, a shallow drafted, super fast, very technically capable craft excellent for small-unit insertion was perfect.

Ukrainian Special Operation Forces (SOF) units have been training with their NATO counterparts since 2014. They are peer-capable now. 

And Ukrainian SOF units have been absolutely *owning* every single aspect of the war against Russia. 

Sabotage, intelligence, targeting of depots and command positions, destruction of critical support and supply points like rail and bridges.

Even Russian VDV and Spetznaz have been embarrassed. The Moskva sinking, Navy embarrassed. 1st GTA, Army embarrassed. Inability to establish air superiority *after 7 months!* The air forces, embarrassed. 

Well there are two *real* powers in Russia. The Leader (Putin) in Moscow who gets to run things and profit (and therefore does what he wants) but has to win... and the regional ""governors"" *meaning regional power-brokers, frequently but not *necessarily* a government official. 

These guys are frequently known as the ""Old-Guard"" or ""hardliners."" They have a vested interest in being associated with a seemingly strong Russia. A number of pro-Putin installed associates have recently had a rash of terrible accidents. It's a message *from* the hardliners *to* Putin. A ""weak"" Russia threatens their power. And they *hate* that Ukrainians trained, supplied, and equipped by the West are absolutely decimating every single aspect of Russian military ""prowess"" everywhere.

***They are *pissed* at Putin's incompetence. They don't care about his corruption as long as he either keeps up the capability of the military, or at least it's *appearance*.***

Russia has been outed as a weak paper-tiger gutted by Czar Nicholas-like corruption. The message has been sent to the hardliners and all the old Soviet associated States, the West can *own* you militarily, don't look to Moscow for strength and support, look to China, Turkey, India, EU/US/NATO.

Thus, only a few options I can see.

1. Putin pulls out a miracle out of his ass and shows he can win, is strong, and can continue to help the hardliners stay in power and make money. There's a lot of ways this can play out over the next few years, and all are bad.

2. Putin fails and ""due to his health""  has to retreat quickly from Leadership and suddenly there are major policy shifts and Russia pushes for talks to keep what they can to save face. A shitty return to a kind of status quo

3. Escalation. Limited nuclear exchange, dirty bomb/strike, WW3.

I think the hardliners are embarrassed and having lost power, prestige, influence they will get rid of or sideline Putin. This will take some time but will happen over the next year.

They had some gasps of democracy but never really avoided being under authoritarian rule in modern history. After the fall of the USSR the resources in the country basically got carved up among those in high positions as things were privatized, which created the modern Russian oligarch. The government is run more like a mafia than any modern democracy, which is why so many political or business figures tragically fall out of windows and whatnot. In may ways the country is coasting on momentum from it's USSR days, which in retrospect was shockingly much better run when it comes to effectiveness. The modern method is backroom deals, greasing of palms, gangland warfare, and authoritarian crackdowns.

( A really great book covering one of the most important periods is The Pursuit of Power Europe, 1815‚Äì1914, Richard J Evans - it's way too long, but you only need the first half of the book for the historical societal bits ).

Any country that tries to jump straight from any kind of other system of government into democracy, is going to have a huge challenge in doing so.  Democracies require a whole pile of checks and balances, and require everyone to play fair (or fair enough, on the surface at least).

Russia never had any of the pre-requisites, they immediately ran into enormous amounts of corruption in the years following the USSR's collapse, and during that time a strong powerful autocractic FSB and bunch of oligarchs looking out for themselves engineered a strong man into power, to keep themselves in power and in (corrupt) business.

There are exceptions, but you basically need to be nuked back to the stone age and then governed by a democracy for 10 years, and have a suffiicently civil society and amenable culture (Japan, Germany).

You have to understand that during a war communication with the media is really important.

Since both parts are always hiding the worse news about what's going to them it's obvious that you'll find some stories like the one you mentioned.

Thing is, Ukraine is involved in a huge counter-offensive that took Russian army off guard so in the last 2 weeks most of the news have been super optimistic for a reason.

But are we going to ignore the news we were reading 5-6 months ago? There were many ""doomers"" here and many questioning if for Ukraine a fast surrender was the best option.

Ukraine and Russian media proved to run their agenda but boy, when it comes to lying russia proved to be faar ahead of ukraine. It's not even close. So don't be surprised if people will be inclined to believe mostly to ukraine media (also supported by western media) while russians are building bullshit from scratch on daily basis.

They are the invaders, they failed and now retreating near their borders. No wonder you'll see mostly optimistic news.

Even during WWII informations were vastly manipulated to keep morale high and hide problems. But Ukraine success in this counter offensive is not a product of media. They gained a ridiculous amount of territory in a couple of weeks.

We really cannot get into Putin's head and gauge how real his threats are, but of course we can't fully dismiss them. If he was just waiting for a pretext he had plenty of chances already. Once he finds himself fully cornered, Crimea is collapsing, sure, he just might. He might also use it on his own country if there is a revolt.

The chances of someone in the chain of command countermanding the launch order is also real. Hard to gauge the probability. As Michael Scott would say it's 50-50, it'll either happen it it won't.

Now, the probability of something going wrong with the launch vehicle or the warhead is indeed high. They already used their nuclear missiles with conventional warheads during the war, and a lot of them malfunctioned. Russians are aware. The real choice they have is, do they launch just one, risk it failing, and catch all the consequences ""for nothing""?

Is Russia ever going to get anything from this war that is even close to the value of what it has cost them so far and is likely to keep costing them, in terms of damage by sanctions, loss of trust, loss of Europe as an energy customer, loss of international standing, destroyed military equipment, lost troops, failure to achieve geopolitical goals (e.g. preventing NATO expansion in the Baltic) and all the rest? Absolutely not. In that sense, Russia already lost on day 3 when it failed to take Kyiv. 

Is Russia going to see this war end with Russia in possession of more territory than they had on February 23rd?

Economically: The world and the US in particular, does much better when there is global peace.  This conflict is a net negative for the world, and the US.  And while the rest of the world is suffering more than US GDP, the economic game isn't fully played out.  

No matter which way this war turns, there's a good argument to be made for China gaining political and economic leverage over Russia.  They're relatively uninvolved, geographically next to Russia, and are large consumers of energy.    

Militarily:  It looks like Russia's military might has imploded.  While that could show the world how great american hardware (and UA determination) is, it doesn't necessarily make the world a more peaceful place.  US and European military manufacturers will now have competition from countries like China, who have shown themselves to be competent industrial powerhouses.  Does that push the world into a greater conflict soon as China begins to exert its influence into parts of the Afria Russia leaves behind?   

Climate change: If Russia remains a rogue state for an extended period of time, you can kiss all climate change targets goodbye as Russia exports natural gas, oil, to whoever wants it at very low prices.

They didn't care enough to protest the war because they cared about thousands of people dying needlessly before but now they're at risk they suddenly care about the war.

The poster pretty much said they can all go fuck themselves and it doesn't change their anger towards the Russian public for doing little to nothing to protest the war.

After thinking about they're right. Their point that these Russians probably don't deserve the plaudits we all want to give them for doing something because it was only done out of naked self interest is correct.

The West has an even stronger stomach for war and death when it‚Äôs not their soldiers and citizens dying. They get the opportunity of a lifetime to cripple or destabilize their biggest historical adversary once and for all. All it really costs them is money and supplies while Ukraine bears all of the death and destruction. They even get the benefit of seeing how all of their weapons and tactics work in a real war instead of all the insurgencies they‚Äôve been dealing with for 20 years. As an added bonus, NATO clears out all of their old Soviet equipment inventories and backfill them with modern stuff, thus upgrading NATO significantly in the process and bringing the coalition closer together.

Then you look at the largest financial contributors to the war, like the US, and wonder how they get a return on their investment. Well, someone has to supply all of the new weapons and vehicles. The US, UK, and Germany are 3 of the top 4 contributors and they stand to produce a lot of the equipment needed to both supply the war and re-arm the coalitions. US has spent about $25B and just got a nice $6.2B order for some jets from Switzerland. There will be more equipment orders to come and they haven‚Äôt even gotten into rebuilding Ukraine yet. 

That‚Äôs one hell of a deal, and one the West is taking on enthusiastically. The only trick is going to be making sure Putin does not fall too cleanly and get replaced by the next guy in line without a serious weakening of the Russian threat.

Negative.  Those highly educated folks who weren't at least neutral to the regime left at the absolute latest in March.  Typically a decade earlier.  If you had the ability to run and waited until conscription we call that taking a gamble and losing.

Very few that are left are as you describe.  The folks running are the useless rich middle class who thought they wouldn't be impacted by the war.  They are not employable, and Europe is about to hit the largest recession it's had since WWII.  The productive folks who can't run simply are trying to keep their heads down as they simply don't have any other options.

Ukraine has hugely invested in actually being *good*, with Ukrainian SOF as the poster child for the standard that the ZSU is aiming for. They've shown a hugely interesting ability to seamlessly blend Western and Eastern doctrines, and to walk the line between open and clandestine warfare on a level I'd wager hasn't been seen since the likes of MACVSOG.

Russia on the other hand, has gone all in on the ""old guard"" vision of recreating that huge, Great Patriotic Glory of the Second World War, with rose-tinted visions of massed tank columns parading through the countryside surrounded by brave infantry charging fearlessly into battle, smoke rising above them, heroic cheers of ""Za Rodinu!"" echoing through the ranks. What they have given limited thought to is that whilst this might *look* great when an artist paints it, that doesn't answer the question of whether it is actually any good. Spoiler: it isn't.

Russia's also been absolutely hobbled by the fact that Putin/FSB paranoia means that the armed forces have not been permitted to foster competent commanders, develop independent thought, a middle-management NCO corps, or a shift to goal-based rather than implementation-based orders, i.e. high command simply says ""take point X"" and the NCOs then devise their own plans based upon their closer knowledge of their troops capabilities and the situation on the ground. No, instead, their military is set up to function by rigidly following detailed plans drawn up by top commanders, who have absolutely no skill in commanding a military at all and have generally only achieved their positions through party loyalty or sheer nepotism.

As you say, the result is that whilst Russia's military has looked good on parade, and had decent results against small rebel-type forces with massively inferior equipment, at the first sign of a real battle against an actual peer, they have totally and utterly crumbled.

Those are really three of only four options that exist. I think the one you have missed would be:

- 4. The breakup of Russia, as more politically distant regions start to assert an independence in protest against being sent to a war they do not want, and with Russia lacking the forces to effectively stop these rebellions, the situation snowballs into a similar situation to 1989-1991 USSR with multiple regions declaring unilateral independence.

They got almost to Paris, reaching the Marne again. This was a quiet section defended by American and African Colonial troops who had not seen action. Together they ferociously attacked the Germans, who began retreating, this spirit spread all along their side of the Western Front.

A full length AKM is absolutely the *wrong* weapon for tank crew. You categorically do not want to be wrestling with one getting out of the cramped and burning interior of a knocked out tank, and if it's so rusted as to not fire you simply won't bother taking it.

Two takeaway points then:

1. Russia is so desperately short of automatic weapons that *anything* more appropriate than this is being used elsewhere, with tank crews being low priority. Something like the AKS-74u which was purpose designed for vehicle crews with an ultra short barrel and sidefolding stock (so can be fired from within the vehicle out of hatches) is the expected choice. Failing that even an AKMS with an underfolder stock would be better, or even a PPS-42 which Russia should have stockpiles of - even though it's an SMG and not so useful against body armoured targets, it stands a chance of being actually possible to remove from the tank in emergency situations, and it still goes bang enough for you to be able to achieve suppressive fire. The fact that the tankers are being given the wrong weapons in unfireable condition says that they're literally getting the very bottom of the barrel. Everything else is going elsewhere. Would not be surprised if support troops such as construction and engineering forces, who should be miles behind the front lines, are getting no weapon at all.

2. Russia actively expects its tank crews to die with their tank if it gives them basically zero combat capabilities once without it. For a Western army this is bonkers, the crew with training are far less replaceable than the vehicle. Given evidence of random naval ensigns being captured/killed as part of tank crews, and just graduated cadets too, it's clear that Russia views its crews as being as expendable as the vehicles. Possibly more so since they actually have combat recovery vehicles, i.e. remove dead crew, hose out the tank, weld plate over holes, repeat.

Heck, as a thought, Russia might actually view partially surviving crews as a *disadvantage* - what are they going to tell the fresh crews at base? ""Don't get in the tank, none of the countermeasures are functional and your friends will be killed by a weapon you didn't even see coming""?

Really the only reason that Hydrogen has stayed as high profile for as long as it has is that is the fallback position of the fossil fuel industry.

Pure hydrogen is also very difficult to store (needs high pressure/cryogenic temps to be dense, tiniest molecule slips *between the bonds* of most structural materials, etc) so what you actually are going to be putting in your vehicle will be LNG that will be reformed to hydrogen.

Ask the space industry, hydrogen is clean and unbelievably high energy, but is increasingly relegated to a niche upper-stage role as the juice just isn't often worth the squeeze.

Putin is an evil and corrupt guy, no doubt, but he's simply the product of a system that is somehow even more evil and corrupt than he is.

Nonetheless, I'm not sure how much Putin actually believed they would be welcome in Ukraine. In the first days of the war, there was a lot of guesswork going on regarding how they could have miscalculated so badly, and for a good while many believed that the FSB actually just told him what he wanted to hear, because they were afraid. But if there had been a genuine miscalculation, the logical next step would have been to deescalate as quickly as possible, blame the failed invasion on the FSB or military command, focus all efforts on keeping the eastern areas, and withdraw from the rest of the country. But that's not what happened.

It has also been reported that during the first few weeks, a settlement was almost reached between the two parties (No NATO membership for Ukraine, EU membership is fine, Crimea joins Russia, Donbas designated as a special demilitarized zone with its fate to be determined within 20 years through diplomacy) but apparently Putin did not want to hear of it, and he was hellbent on continuing the war.

By the numbers, they're looking over 50k soldiers dead, and 2 or 3 times that number wounded, missing, deserted or captured. Remember, they only started this war with a little 200k. Even with a conservative estimate of their losses, most of that original force is gone now.

- Georgian Civil War: 2,000
- South Ossetian War: n/a
- War in Abkhazia: 600
- Transnistria War: 14,000
- East Prigorodny conflict: n/a
- Tajikistani Civil War: 15,000
- First Chechen War: 70,500
- War of Dagestan: 5,000
- Second Chechen War: 22,000
- Russo-Georgian War: 100,000?
- Insurgency in the North Caucasus: n/a
- Russo-Ukrainian War (prior to February): 6,000
- Syria: 4,000
- Central African Republic: 1,000 mercenaries
- Ukraine (since February): 200,000?

Even assuming that all of these numbers are correct, all are still fit and healthy (none died in any of those conflicts or since), that there was no overlap in forces between conflicts so that each number above is fully distinct, we get a (massively overoptimistic) total of 440,000 Russians who might have had *some degree* of combat experience in the past 30 years.
