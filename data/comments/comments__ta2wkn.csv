Orlov: ""Putin is intent on having Ukraine without Ukrainians. It's pure genocide. The attack being waged by Russia isn't simply treacherous. It's a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.""

Orlov says Russian army has shelled evacuation corridor, mined the road and put in a check point. 200K people desperate to leave, only 2-3K able to get out daily on 21 municipal buses. The others destroyed. Russians deliberately shelling assembly points for those trying to exit

Russian soldiers also fire on private cars trying to escape the siege, Orlov says. Not at them but alongside so they are forced to return to Mariupol. ""They are shooting and bombing the humanitarian corridor. That's the situation,"" he says, calling for an immediate no-fly zone

Chernobyl

The Ukrainian atomic energy company Energoatom has said the loss of power supply at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant could lead to the release of radioactive substances into the air, which could spread into the wider environment.

Power is needed to keep 20,000 spent fuel rods cool by circulating water in the large tank in the nuclear fuel storage facility near reactors one and three. There are back-up generators able to do this for a few days.

If the main power is not brought back online then there is no risk of an explosion, but the water will begin to gradually evaporate and the vapour may well be radioactive, since it can contain material leached from inside the fuel rods.

But any such vapour should be kept within the building, according to Prof Claire Corkhill of Sheffield University, who is familiar with the plant. There is little danger of radioactive material being blown to other parts of the Ukraine or Belarus, she says.

""I don’t think this would lead to a release of radioactivity because it would take a very long time for the water to eventually evaporate. The spent fuel is kept in a modern building which should be sealed and have structural integrity.""

Prof Corkhill added that while it would be hazardous for people to enter the facility, but very little - if any - radiation is likely to leak outside.

Of wider concern though is the fact that the air conditioning of the safe confinement structure which covers Chernobyl’s reactor number four, which was the source of the nuclear disaster in 1986, won't be working either.

That would lead to condensation which would lead to corrosion of the £1 billion structure which in turn would put the decommissioning of the facility on hold for a prolonged period, if not indefinitely.",False,1646835165.0,t3_ta2wkn,t3_ta2wkn,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

"" The Importance Of Keeping Cool
The bigger concern at Chernobyl is stored nuclear waste from three other reactors at Chernobyl (the ones that didn’t melt down), which kept operating until 2000.

“There are about over 21,000 fuel assemblies stored at Chernobyl. Most of them are in a wet storage pool, but some have been transferred to a dry storage facility that started operating last year,” said Lyman in an email. “There is of course lots of other radioactive waste in various forms and storage condition throughout the exclusion zone.”

And none of those storage facilities were built to withstand artillery shells.

""In particular, Interim Storage Facility 2, or ISF-2, holds spent fuel rods from Chernobyl Reactors 1 through 3. They fuel rods are still radioactive even after their working life is over, so they’re kept in a pool of water to keep their temperature down; the water also provides some shielding against escaping radiation. After 20 years or more, the spent fuel rods can be stored in dry facilities, like the new one at Chernobyl.

Some cooling pools use electric pumps to keep the water cool.

“If active cooling is required, it is provided through electrically powered pumps,” explained Lyman in an email. “If their operation is disrupted – or if there is damage to the pool that causes the water to drain – the spent fuel could heat up and potentially reach a temperature where the zirconium cladding on the fuel rods could ignite, causing fuel damage and a radiation release.”""",False,1646826615.0,t3_ta2wkn,t3_ta2wkn,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

 ""Update on Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant:

750 kV ChNPP - Kyiv high-voltage line is currently disconnected due to the damage caused by the occupiers.

As a result, the Chernobyl station and all nuclear facilities in the Exclusion Zone are without electricity.

About 20,000 spent fuel assemblies are stored in the spent nuclear fuel storage facility-1. They need constant cooling. Which is possible only if there is electricity. If it is not there, the pumps will not cool. As a result, the temperature in the holding pools will increase.

 After that evaporation will occur, that will lead to nuclear discharge. 

The wind can transfer the radioactive cloud to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe.

In addition, there is no ventilation inside the facility.

 All personnel there will receive a dangerous dose of radiation.

The fire extinguishing system also does not work, and this is a huge risk of fire caused by shelling.

The fight still goes on making it impossible to carry out repairs and restore power.

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/asia/18spent.html

""Even without recirculating water, it should take many days for the water in a storage pool to evaporate, nuclear engineers said.""

""When the water in a storage pool disappears, the fuel rods’ uranium continues to heat the rods’ zirconium cladding. This causes the zirconium to oxidize, or rust, and even catch fire. The spent fuel rods have little radioactive iodine, which has a half-life of eight days and has mostly disappeared through radioactive decay once fission stopped when the rods left the reactor cores. But the spent fuel rods are still loaded with cesium and strontium that can start to escape if the fuel rods burn.

One factor that might determine how serious the situation becomes is whether the uranium oxide pellets in the rods stay vertical even if the cladding burns off. This is possible because pellets sometimes become fused together while in the reactor. If the pellets stay standing up, then even with the water and zirconium gone, nuclear fission will not take place, Mr. Albrecht said.

But Tokyo Electric said this week that there was a chance of “recriticality” in the storage pools — that is, the uranium in the fuel rods could resume the fission that previously took place inside the reactor, spewing out radioactive byproducts.

 Mr. Albrecht said this was very unlikely, but could happen if the stacks of pellets slumped over and became jumbled together on the floor of the storage pool.

 Plant workers would then need to add water with lots of boron because the boron absorbs neutrons and interrupts nuclear chain reactions.

If a lot of fission occurs, which may happen only in an extreme case, the uranium would melt through anything underneath it. If it encounters water as it descends, a steam explosion could then scatter the molten uranium.""",False,1646827456.0,t3_ta2wkn,t3_ta2wkn,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

#Ukraine's governing party proposes new security agreement as alternative to NATO - in sign one of Russia's demands could be met

A new security treaty - guaranteed by countries such as the US, Turkey or neighbouring countries potentially including Russia - could be an alternative to joining NATO, according to proposal by President Zelenskyy's Servant of the People Party.

Russia says Ukraine must drop its quest to join NATO before it will cease its bombardment of the country.
The idea that Russia could be a guarantor looks, given the current situation, ridiculous - but the proposal would see any state involved sign legal agreements.

""[NATO] is not ready to accept Ukraine for at least the next 15 years, and it clearly says so. We do not even have support in a completely just war from the alliance - only from individual states,"" a party spokesperson said.
""As it is impossible to join NATO in the coming years, we cannot use only the lines of the Constitution [expressing our desire to join NATO on our] course to the alliance, to defend our country. The course is politics – but not weapons, not planes, not state protection.""

While this suggests Ukraine is willing to budge on some of Russia's demands, it seems more firmly set against others.

The party said that under no circumstances will Ukraine cede its claim to Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk nor agree to any ultimatums on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""We hear Russia's demand to recognise the so-called 'DNR' and 'LNR' [and] to recognise the occupation of Crimea,"" the party said. ""It is clear that we will not do that. But we need to decide how the lives of people in these territories will be regulated within our integral state.""",False,1646830371.0,t3_ta2wkn,t3_ta2wkn,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

1. Such a dramatic softening of Putin's demands indicates how very real he knows the prospects of them losing this war on the battlefield, let alone domestically and globally, really are.
2. If Zelensky agreed, this would infuriate a lot of Ukrainians and others around the world, as it will demonstrate that the use of military might to achieve territorial goals is still considered acceptable in 2022. The civilized world will not want this precedent to be set.
3. How would this play out internationally? Things cannot go back to normal - Russia has committed too many grave war crimes for the Putin regime to ever be accepted on the global stage again.

The more I think about it, the more I think the only viable way forward now is regime change in Russia. We have to hope that the leaked FSB memos are true and that perhaps they hint at a coming high-level coup against Putin.

I realise I am effectively advocating for continued hostilities here, when it's not my life on the line. I get it. But is any kind of 'deal' with this regime really, truly, a viable option?

That as attracted the attention and energy of:

* all the EU Members,
* All the NATO members,
* most of the world countries.

That fact has mobilized the armies, the financial world, the political attention of most of the big world players, except China.

This situation (Russia-Ukraine war) is going to mobilize the attention and the money and destabilize further more the equilibrium between the ""big powers"".

China wants to take a predominent position in the world. Xi already said it very strongly and violently in several speeches.  
And right now, with this war and its consequences which will extend on several years in the near future, with all the ressources of NATO, the US, the EU, Russia ( !!!!!  ), their financial capacities, their feeding ressources - not to forget that more than 20% of the wheat, poultries, etc. come from Ukraine and Russia - and their energy ressources to be rebalanced in the near future, some countries are going to live some VERY hard times. And I'm not talking about money, but about food!

The UN reserves will need to be used.

And during all this time, there will be 1 question remaining : What about China?

Because these times of insecurities world wide, it's the perfect time for China to place their pawns on the chessboard, 

And, truth to tell, I don't like at all the idea of a world led of strongly influenced by China and their ideology.

Because with Xi, we have a Putin ++++.",False,1646818948.0,t3_ta2wkn,t3_ta2wkn,,0,16,0,16,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

During the 1930s, the West had numerous chances to take decisive action against Hitler. They did not. Poor Western leadership allowed the Nazi menace to grow to monstrous proportions. This catastrophic failure in leadership offers important lessons for decision-makers today.  
When Hitler took power in 1933, many foreign diplomats were already familiar with his violent nationalist ideology. Hitler had often announced his intention to remilitarize Germany. In his first year, he withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference.   
The Treaty of Versailles, signed after World War I, forbid Germany from developing an offensive military. Soon however, it became an open secret that Germany was rearming. In 1935, Hitler revealed that Germany had developed an air force and was expanding its army, both major violations of Versailles. France and Britain had full authority to take economic or military action against Germany. Given the early stage of Germany’s military preparations, Western pressure could have easily neutralized the military threat. Failing to act when the stakes were low was the West’s first mistake.    
In 1936, Hitler brazenly remilitarized Germany’s Rhineland border with France. Remilitarization directly threatened French national security. After World War I, the Rhineland had been left demilitarized to deter German aggression against France. With this border undefended, the French could pour into Germany. Only 3,000 Nazi troops entered the Rhineland. Hundreds of thousands of French troops stood just miles away. Germany’s generals trembled with fear, certain that a French invasion would end the Third Reich. However, facing bad economic conditions and finding few allies willing to offer support, the French government decided that military intervention was too expensive. Once again, a weak and divided West allowed the Nazi threat to increase.   
In early 1938, Hitler forced Austria into the Third Reich by threatening to invade. Immediately, unprecedented anti-Semitic violence broke out across Austria. The Western Allies responded with a collective shrug. By incorporating Austria, Hitler gained millions of new citizens and access to Austria’s ample cash reserves and industrial resources. He was now more powerful than ever.""

For **ANYONE** still suggesting that NATO ""just get in there already"".  We get it, you are frustrated, and think the world isn't doing enough.  It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  

The problem is, besides the fact that NATO is a **defensive** alliance, you really don't understand what Nuclear war would mean.
**Even a limited exchange** is enough to cause world wide famine and death.  A full scale exchange would probably end the human race.  **Including killing all the people in Ukraine.**

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Missiles in general is expensive, mainly on the seeker and the electronics which made up the guidance system and the rockets/motor. The guidance system and the rockets also made up the majority of the missile and is very delicate, making the warhead is quite cheap compared to them and one of the main reason there is a lack of decoy missile these days.Also it has to be able to destroy main battle tanks which are quite strong.  


Most other ATGM have simple guidance system like I-go-after-u-pointer or u-tow-me-to-target (quite literally)  
Javelin is one of the few manportable mussile that can go after target by themselves like a wardog. This accomplish by actually have a brain (computer) and an eye (radar) that other missile don't at the size small enough to be walk by human master like a dog they are.

What will ultimately sink him is his handling of the spike in gas prices, which has has less control over than his critics will say, but more control over than his supporters say. 

Prices were already rising before Russia’s invasion due to the spiking inflation, which was partly sue to the pandemic and also partly due to trillions in spending that he participated in.  But the current spike in oil prices is due to both the loss of Russian supply and a combination of panic buying and speculation deriving from the loss of Russian supply and general global instability due to the invasion.

Biden has not even made token statements to try and calm fears.  Releasing reserves makes no impact on prices.  Biden also can’t influence actual current supply much.  BUT

It is absolutely in Biden’s power to authorize more drilling on federal lands, in ANWR, to ease restrictions ok fracking, or to even signal a policy shift towards fracking without taking concrete actions.

All of these things would calm investor fears about long term supply and would squash some of the speculative runs happening now.  But Biden is beholden to the left of his party that would never allow such actions.  So he gives lip service to our transition to green energy (which is clearly a long term national security priority for us) but will do nothing to address the current issue.",False,1646836174.0,t3_ta2wkn,t1_hzz12ok,,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Edit: TIL Nestle actually spun off their bottled water operations as BlueTriton, Probably to avoid all their past negative coverage like this. They were targeting my area for a water rights swap a few years ago, but didn't have the rights to build a bottling plant where the source was, so they would have needed to build a second facility a few miles away and have an estimated 100 daily semi truck trips going through a town of less than 2,000.

Basically, the reactors themselves have not been operating, but their spent fuel rods still need to be cooled, and that is still occurring on-site.

This cooling is done via water-cooling in big tanks, and, as may be obvious, fuel rods cooling in water -> water gets hot 

Electricity is spent to make sure that water does not evaporate, and/or circulates more water in as needed (I'm actually not quite clear on the process here, basic tl:dr is that with electricity, fuel rods stay in cold water, without electricity, water evaporates off). Chernobyl's backup generators have (theoretically) 48hrs of runtime on existing fuel stores, assuming Russia didn't go syphon it off for their own uses (hopefully they aren't ***THAT*** dumb)

When that happens, the spent rods will no longer be kept cool, and there is concern their casings can catch on fire once enough time passes and the rods heat up enough. Fire + radioactive material = radioactive stuff going into the air.

""Many British and French political leaders had staked their hopes on appeasing Hitler to avoid war. Appeasement was a fatally flawed policy. Churchill condemned appeasement as the strategy of feeding a crocodile in the hopes it would eat you last. He recognized that Hitler was insatiable, and each meal only made the crocodile more dangerous.   
The infamous Munich Conference in late 1938 revealed the costs of appeasement. Hitler had demanded an integral part of Czechoslovakia. Britain and France should have supported the strong pro-Western democracy against Nazi aggression. Instead, they sold out the young nation by accepting Hitler’s claims. The Czechoslovaks were not even invited to Munich. The Western betrayal proved disastrous. Czechoslovakia lost its natural defenses and industrial areas, rendering the nation helpless against further German expansion. Additionally, Britain and France’s capitulation convinced other nations that Western leaders lacked the will to stop Hitler.   
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich declaring that he had obtained “peace for our time.” That peace would prove short-lived. Within a few months, Hitler had swallowed up the rest of Czechoslovakia. Then, Germany demanded territory from Lithuania and Poland. The Lithuanians gave in, the Poles did not. Hitler decided that Poland must be destroyed. On the eve of his invasion, Hitler told his generals, “our enemies are…not men of action, not masters. They are little worms. I saw them at Munich.” Appeasement had backfired, confident of Western inaction, Hitler became more belligerent.   
When World War II began, the West had a good chance to defeat Hitler. While the Germans ravaged Poland, over 100 British and French divisions largely sat idle on the Franco-German border against a far smaller German force. Some Britons advocated air raids, but these were rejected from fears that Germany would retaliate in kind. Soon, London would learn that the Nazis had no such scruples. After the war, German generals expressed amazement that the Allies never attacked en masse. One even remarked that had the Allies invaded, Germany “could only have held out for one or two weeks.”   
On May 10th 1940, time ran out for the West. Nearly 3 million German troops smashed into France and the Low Countries. Caught off-guard, the Allies were unprepared for the new age of mobile warfare and hampered by poor coordination. Within days the Low Countries had been overrun. Within weeks, France had been defeated and nearly 2 million French soldiers were taken prisoner. Much of Western Europe would suffer under Nazi occupation for the next four years. The continent would ultimately be liberated, but only after unimaginable death and destruction.  
Western leaders repeatedly squandered chances to stop Hitler before 1940. First, their governments refused to take decisive action against the Nazis. Then, they remained divided in the face of a growing threat. Finally, they undermined their own opposition to Hitler through irresolution and half-measures. These mistakes proved disastrous. Nothing excuses the evil actions of Nazi Germany, but strong Western leadership might have contained Nazi evil before it exacted such a terrible toll.""",False,1646837280.0,t3_ta2wkn,t1_hzz6g19,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I don't discount the risk of escalation.  But I think many are  discounting the risk associated with a display of a lack of mettle from the west.

For one thing, you note:

>for those of you saying Putin will never use nukes

There are definitely people who say this, but this deliberately paints with too broad a brush.  Many very well-informed folks believe it is unlikely that Putin would use nuclear weapons for acts *in Ukraine.*

Second, I believe that you say this in good faith:

>We are witnessing the result of miscalculation by an egomaniacal, narcistic, psychopath suffering from a galactic sized Napoleon complex. Not the actions of a rational being.

But please recognize that this is borderline Russian propaganda.  Putin is **not** behaving irrationally.  He dramatically misread the situation, but he is responding rationally to the pushback *based on his goals.*

The presumption that any show of mettle in the face of Putin will be the end of the world is incorrect, and it is *exactly* what Putin wants the west to think.  The reason he is bogged down is because he expected Zelensky to do what the US suggested: Run.

Moreover, I hope you appreciate that the presumption that any military pushback against Putin is virtually guaranteed to end in nuclear apocalypse does not stop here.  It applies just the same if  Putin had invaded Finland or Sweden.  Surely better to let him do so than to end the world, right?  And it applies just the same *if he attacked a NATO member-state*.  Wouldn't it be better to let Putin to overrun the Baltics than to comply with Article 5 and end the world, as you insist?  Surely NATO is not so critical.

>What do you think Hitler would have done if he had nukes while he was sitting in that bunker with the Allies bearing down on him?

What do *you* think Hitler *did* when other powers appeased him?

Please.  We can all disagree about the approach here, but don't pretend that any display of mettle here is idiotic.",1646840999.0,1646840679.0,t3_ta2wkn,t1_hzzcwk6,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

As others are saying, it's difficult because they are not wrong. Those places are difficult spots. And this conflict does have some similarities.

However, it is whataboutism. It is not a constructive argument. Instead of focusing at the topic at hand, they are changing the topic. In fact, they are actively preventing you from arguing about the current topic. 

One approach is not responding. However that lends itself to that being used more and more and stalling any discussion.  
If others read the thread, they might come to the conclusion that this person who you (and others) have ignored is correct with this question and you are just at a loss of words.

The 'correct' response is labelling it. Label it as Whataboutism and shut down that line of discussion. They will respond to you further, they will pry, but you made your point and can leave that thread hanging.  
If others see this response, many of them will read your response and understand there is no point in arguing further (especially if you word it well.) 

Now why Whataboutism is not a valid point in those discussions:   
Imagine you are watching over a school yard and a kid A punches kid B. When you try to stop him from doing it, he says ""But Kid C punched kid D and I want to do it too"".  
Do you let kid A continue?   
Or do you explain that while that did happen, it doesn't warrant further punching?  

Sure there are arguments that are valid in it, but swarming an active and developing conflict we *can* influence with questions and discussions about past conflicts we cannot is a tactic that again mostly benefits one side: the aggressor.",False,1646841712.0,t3_ta2wkn,t1_hzysffm,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Not true.

> Update on Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant: 750 kV ChNPP - Kyiv high-voltage line is currently disconnected due to the damage caused by the occupiers. As a result, the Chernobyl station and all nuclear facilities in the Exclusion Zone are without electricity.

> About 20,000 spent fuel assemblies are stored in the spent nuclear fuel storage facility-1. They need constant cooling. Which is possible only if there is electricity. If it is not there, the pumps will not cool. As a result, the temperature in the holding pools will increase.

> After that evaporation will occur, that will lead to nuclear discharge. The wind can transfer the radioactive cloud to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe. In addition, there is no ventilation inside the facility.

> All personnel there will receive a dangerous dose of radiation. The fire extinguishing system also does not work, and this is a huge risk of fire caused by shelling. The fight still goes on making it impossible to carry out repairs and restore power.

Poland has a huge historical trauma of being insufficiently supported by its allies, while being simultaneously accused of being too confrontational (WWII - Phoney War and the Danzig issue). Think Vietnam War or 9/11 sized trauma that still informs people's politics and attitudes.

That makes us extremely sensittive to perceptions of doing anything confrontational without a clear sign that the whole of NATO or at the very least US is in it too. And all the US and NATO have done so far (regarding the jet handover, the reaction to war overall is very positive) were carefully worded assurances (""it has to be Poland's sovereign decision"") immediately making every Polish person (rationally or not) think back to allies just chilling on Hitler's western border when he went to attack Poland.

I know that we are in NATO, Article 5 and yada, yada but you can look at our proposal, which was denied, as an attempt to ""share the risk"" of Putin's retaliation (it's way easier to bully Poland than US) and having our (maybe not entirely rational, but again - trauma) concerns at being left alone with a hot potato alleviated. Another factor is that some anglo (both US and UK) politicians and US media keep publicly pushing us to hand over the jets ourselves with ""green lights"" and ""sovereign decisions"".

By not doing anything we are encouraging other nuclear powers to start conflicts and wave the nuclear boogeyman around.  The more instances of that happening the higher the likelihood some does it sooner or later.

All this pathetic response does is encourage others to threaten their nukes to do whatever they want.  We are also further showing the value of nukes to countries which will drive further proliferation.

First of all the Chernobyl site has 3 offsite power supplies, 750kV, 330kV and 110kV. According to current media messages they only lost one so the site should still be on a normal offsite power supply.

>Now even if the media reporting is incorrect and they've lost all 3 offsite power supplies they still have emergency diesel generators which can provide atleast 7 days of power each.

>If those diesel generators are lost too they're on batteries which will die within hours. They have mobile diesel generators they can connect in order to keep them charged.

>If these mobile diesel generators also fail they'll be without power if the batteries die. In that case they just lose monitoring systems which means they'll have to inspect the various waste storage facilities locally.

>The spent fuel in the Chernobyl site is atleast 22 years old which means they no longer require active cooling. If all cooling were to be lost the water in the spent fuel pools will not exceed 70°C and thus will not boil off. So the facilities are safe even without power.

Putin wants to save face while exiting, Zelensky wants to maintain honor and sovereignty.

Plus they may not recover sufficiently to pull it off again. edit: the other angle behind NATO nations' behavior is telegraphing to China how far they are willing to go in retaliation to invasion, so don't dare. 

The fact that the deal is on the table at all this early shows a bit of desperation, so it may be subject to change (somewhat) as the sanctions take their toll. Maybe Zelensky has the confidence that he can hold out long enough for Russia to get financially rocked, and will renegotiate later. 

On the other hand he could potentially end the violence right now. That's nothing to scoff at. Frankly even if this goes on 10 years, the ""deal"" will look very much the same in the future.

I think that taking Snake Island was actually more important than has been discussed here before. If Ukraine maintain control of it at the end of this conflict, it would mean that Ukraine still has a claim to the waters around it, and therefore the (believed) large natural gas reserves under the sea that Russia does not want as a natural pipeline competitor to the EU, which threatens its natural gas hegemony in the region. Oddly there are very few islands in the Black Sea, and Snake Island was a key one. That 40 mile convoy that is just sitting there north of Kyiv, hasn’t entered Kyiv because it maybe has run out of fuel, but it is also a very threatening attacking lance of pawns to Kyiv, fueled or not. At a minimum Putin will settle for the territories in the east and water in Crimea, and some kind of guarantee not to join NATO, which in essence wasn’t going to happen anyway.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

The United States favored Yeltsin. The topic of American influence on Russian elections is developed in US popular culture, such as in the 2003 comedy Spinning Boris. Knowing that his voter base was pro-Western, Yeltsin lobbied President Clinton to speak praisefully of Russia's transition to democracy.

Why do you guys put up with living with a government that restricts speech/freedom of the press?

After how much you have all been through, why does anyone still believe in state sponsored news? Personally, when President Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I never forgot nor forgave it. I will never trust his political party ever again. When it became obvious that the citizens of the US had been lied to about the wars in the Middle East. A significant section of the US population fiercely fought against continuing the wars. 

I ask because many Russians point to our invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan as to justification for the war in Ukraine. And I find it hilarious that Putins propaganda uses this. Because he is essentially pointing to a very unpopular war started by a lying president backed with US propaganda. A war that was ultimately ended by the citizens of the US due to its lack of support. 

If I were Putin I’d stop pointing to these two wars because the parallels of government propaganda as well as citizen outrage are fairly close. 

How are the economic sanctions going in Russia?

Do you and everyone you know over there know that we really don’t want to fight you? I hope you all know that we have no interest in invading your country. It just seems like I hear a lot of statements out of Russia about how the United States is preparing to invade Russia. 

In middle school here in the US we learn about WW2. Quite a lot, actually. WW2 is heavily focused on in history class. One thing we learn well in these classes is the betrayal of Russia/USSR when Germany invades. We learn of the eventual victory of the USSR and the costs paid, particularly in human lives. We know very well to never ever get involved in an invasion of Russia. Each student hears about the brutal winter conditions that Germany faced when it invaded the USSR. 

So literally as a part of our public education we learn that you better not invade Russia because there is a heavy price paid for every inch of soil claimed from your country. A common phrase here is “American steel, British intelligence, and Russian blood”. 

So yeah. We really don’t want to fuck with you all.

Despite all of that, Russia must leave Ukraine to Ukrainians. Donbas and Crimea included. If Ukraine chooses to join NATO or not join NATO, honestly that is up to them. Our country, nor any other country should be forcing them one way or another. An independent country should make its choice independently.

BSL-2 laboratories maintain the same standard microbial practices as BSL-1 labs, but also includes enhanced measures due to the potential risk of the aforementioned microbes. Personnel working in BSL-2 labs are expected to take even greater care to prevent injuries such as cuts and other breaches of the skin, as well as ingestion and mucous membrane exposures.

In addition to BSL 1 expectation, the following practices are required in a BSL 2 lab setting:

Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn, including lab coats and gloves. Eye protection and face shields can also be worn, as needed.
All procedures that can cause infection from aerosols or splashes are performed within a biological safety cabinet (BSC).
An autoclave or an alternative method of decontamination is available for proper disposals.
The laboratory has self-closing, lockable doors.

Personally, I think the world would survive if the Russians were ejected from Ukraine by NATO action, whether by force or simply by diplomacy and ultimatum, and sanctioned until their state regime is replaced.

Putin does not and cannot sustain a war with NATO. NATO drawing a hard line in the sand for intervention (as happened with Sarajevo) would be perfectly reasonable. In fact the current situation in Mariupol and with the behaviour over Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia NPPs would be grounds enough, arguably.

I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this but I don't think NATO's actions will influence Putin's final decision. If he will, he will anyway. If he won't, he won't.

To operate the MIGs they would to have take those out first and there's two problems with that: 
1) Wild Weasel operations using HARMs to take out SAMs are difficult, risky and Ukrainian pilots probably have no training in them.

3. Following that, then Taiwan will be next on the chopping block. Then Belarus will be annexed by Russia, in a repeat of the Nazi Anschluss with Austria. Then there's gonna be a return of open hostilities in Korea (both North and South Korea are still formally in a stare of war), the annexation of Georgia, the neutralization of Japan.... And only then the attack on a formally NATO country, probably Poland.

4. The point being that Russia and China will never strike NATO until we they have us completely surrounded, and they will start by chipping away at periphery, hoping our inaction will lead to the dissolution of NATO altogether.

>Most of these wargames, such as RAND’s Baltic study, focus on fait accompli, an attack by the Russian government aimed at seizing terrain — then quickly digging in. This creates a dilemma for NATO: launch a costly counter-attack and risk heavy casualties and possibly a nuclear crisis or accept a Russian fait accompli and undermine faith in the credibility of the alliance. Some analysts have argued that these seizures are much more likely to be small in size, limited to one or two towns. While that scenario should, of course, be studied, the concern about the feasibility of a fait accompli in the form of a major invasion still stands.

The lyrics were written by Józef Wybicki in Reggio Emilia, Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy, between 16 and 19 July 1797, two years after the Third Partition of Poland erased the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the map. It was originally meant to boost the morale of Polish soldiers serving under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski's Polish Legions that served with Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Whether it would be NATO, or the county that is being affected directly by the radation, with collective support of surrounding nations (or an alliance) is difficult to say. If it happened I would assume that they would inform Russia of a takeover of nuclear facilities for safety and leave it as that, though it may still be viewed as an act of aggression.

 It is likely any action like this would just concern nuclear safety as opposed to overriding action against Russia. Though this is a possible concern of escalation.

 Countries have to protect themselves from threat, and if nuclear material is directly moving in to their country via airflow (similar in a sense to a dirty bomb) it would obviously provoke a response.

It's just having been born in the USSR and living next to Russia tends to give you a different outlook on them compared to people in the West that I talk to. They're all smart people but they tend to be really optimistic about NATOs engagement should Russia attack us. Sure, NATO has been a pretty substantial deterrent for Russia since they have poked NATO-hopefuls not us. But there is no precedent. Hence, I'm wondering if, say, Russia says ""give us Estonia or else you get nuked"", would Germany and France go ""the fuck you do"" and bomb the shit out of Russia or ""uhh... we don't wanna get nuked, so you can take Estonia, you're welcome, thank you very much"".

Also, I feel like a lot of people think that Russians SURELY will at some point realize their human cost and stop because of that, or that people will get sufficiently angry (that would require millions of Russians to defy Putin in an uprising) to stage a coup.

No, Russia will not stop because of human cost. WW2 taught us that. They have plenty of men to conscript. No, Russians will not get sufficiently angry due to propaganda + repressions + mindset of suffering + there's a vacuum and nothing really to replace Putin with (it was communism but that's kind of dead and democracy probably is too vague and lacking a hard-handed daddy they are used to).  


Maybe I'm too pessimistic but like I said where I'm coming from we know full well how history rhymes and what the Russian mindset is like and we remember how they have deported us, tortured and killed us.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Years ago, Putin made an interesting comment about paralysis (and troublingly apparently idolizes the will to act).

Contrary to Stalin's famous dicta, a million was not just a statistic. When glasnost briefly succeeded, it shattered the Iron Curtain.

We had no opposition, it killed by fake laws and other dirty stuff.

2. We just don't know what we can do to change government, it prepare itself to be as safe as possible. Elder people don't want to change it because of propaganda and bad 90's.

3. People in 18-40 who have internet access and abilities to read other medias try to get information from all the sides, but if you watch TV and press you just don't have another sources. Western media also lies a lot, we had an examples. So how we should choose a better lie?

There were a wars by USA but never was such sanctions and hate towards ""agressor""

He's a shameless opportunist, he backed Brexit in the referendum despite personally being pro-europe because he expected the ""leave"" side to lose and wanted to use the campaign to boost his own public image with the euro-sceptic wing of his party, when ""leave"" won he then set out to take over the party and become PM, only to be backstabbed by a key ally who publicly stated that he wasn't fit for office.
2. He then got moved to the foreign office, where he repeatedly offended foreign governments and generally pissed off a lot of our allies.
3. After leading the Tory rebellion against any kind of compromise brexit deal he orchestrated a coup to get May out as PM, with the promise he ""would get brexit done"".
4. After succesfully ousting May he basically re-packaged her Brexit deal as his own and got it through parliament, He promoted this as a big win.
5. Mere weeks later when the reality of the deal he had just pushed through became clear to everyone he basically stated that ""Britain has no obligation to adhere to treaties and international law if it doesn't want to"" and accused the EU of negotiating in bad faith. This argument still hasn't been settled is unlikely to be resolved in our lifetimes, meanwhile the cost of Brexit keeps snowballing.
6. Then Covid struck, Boris dithered at every step. He was slow to declare it an emergency, he was slow to bring in restrictions, he was constantly playing down the dangers, he refused to listen to scientific advise that didn't line up with his own ideas and beliefs. As a result Britain had one of the worst infection and death rates in Europe, and every step of the way if we had just acted sooner instead of waiting till the situation was an obvious emergency we would have saved lives, time and money.
7. His government used Covid as a gross opportunity to enrich themselves and their friends. Billions of pounds was given away in emergency contracts to party donors, former colleagues, business associates, school friends and housemates of Tory MPs, it was a truly disgusting display of corruption. A lot of these contracts were massively over inflated and failed to deliver on thier promises, further endangering the British public during a pandemic.
8. He routinely gets his friends out of trouble with the law, most recently an MP was found guilty of lobbying (illegal under British law), and he was forced to resign his post in the government, Boris led the calls to have the charges dropped and get him re-instated. This led to an outcry from the opposition and the press, but Boris didn't seem to understand why it was wrong to do this.
9. He took bribes from wealthy donors (possibly Russian oligarchs too), most recently he got Number 10 (the official residence of PM) redecorated at an astonishing cost by a shadowy donor, this is illegal under British law as it constitutes a large gift and should have been declared as such, it was not.
10. He's fathered an unknown number of illegitimate children and paid hush money to their mothers to keep the stories out of the press.
11. He once wrote a novel where the main character was transparently based on himself where he saves the world from nuclear disaster.

 >Pax Americana (Latin for ""American Peace"", modeled after Pax Romana, Pax Mongolica, and Pax Britannica; also called the Long Peace) is a term applied to the concept of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere and later in the world after the end of World War II in 1945, when the  United States became one of the world's dominant economic and military powers. In this sense, Pax Americana has come to describe the military and economic position of the United States relative to other nations. The Marshall Plan, which spent $13 billion after World War II to rebuild the economies of Western Europe, has been described by some as ""the launching of the Pax Americana"".

However, when your the victim its easy to get upset at a situation like that. From the outside, that would lead to a massive conflict which could change the death count 100x what it will currently be them fighting independently. Its a shitty situation, so NATO is doing literally everything it can to help Ukraine win independently so it doesn't cause Nato Vs Russia, which will then turn to NATO vs Russia & China, AKA a world war.

If NATO successfully enables Ukraine to fight and win on their own, then the war is kept down to an extremely small scale relatively speaking, casualties low all around, and avoid global crises. This also puts Russia in check avoiding future conflicts since their ego will drop since they couldn't defeat a single country, let alone many, as well as offer Ukraine into NATO post-war if other boxes are checked.

- Main producers that could step via LNG are Qatar and, I think, the US (not sure if I remember the countries correctly. Overseas anyways)

Chernobyl was a design flaw in the ass-end of the Soviet era by crap scientists and a government that wanted results regardless of the dangers.

Fukushima was an older reactor that did fail successfully and shut down exactly as planned, the problem was the facility was not designed for the double whammy of an Earthquake + a Tsunami, so the backups eventually failed by going beyond design tolerances. 

Both of those issues can and have been corrected from a technical means, and especially Fukushima has shown how far we've come in 30 years in dealing with radiological accidents as well as how far less dangerous such an accident would be from a more modern reactor.

 >Brilliant Pebbles was a ballistic missile defense (BMD) system proposed by Lowell Wood and Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1987, near the end of Cold War. The system would consist of thousands of small missiles, not unlike conventional heat seeking missiles, which would be placed in orbits so that hundreds would be above the Soviet Union at all times. If the Soviets launched its ICBM fleet, the pebbles would detect their rocket motors using infrared seekers and collide with them. Because the pebble strikes the ICBM before the latter could release its warheads, each pebble could destroy several warheads with one shot.
 
**[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense)** 
 
 >Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) is the United States' anti-ballistic missile system for intercepting incoming warheads in space, during the midcourse phase of ballistic trajectory flight. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) carrying nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads. The system is deployed in military bases in the states of Alaska and California; in 2018 comprising 44 interceptors and spanning 15 time zones with sensors on land, at sea, and in orbit.

 >An orc (or ork)  is a fictional humanoid monster like a goblin. Orcs were brought into modern usage by the fantasy writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, especially The Lord of the Rings. In Tolkien's works, orcs are a brutish, aggressive, ugly and malevolent race of monsters, contrasting with the benevolent Elves and serving an evil power, though they share a human sense of morality; there is a suggestion, among several somewhat contradictory origin stories, that they are a corrupted race of elves. Mythological monsters with names similar to ""orc"" can be found in the Old English poem Beowulf, in Early Modern poetry, and in Northern European folk tales and fairy tales.

 >Nuclear winter is a severe and prolonged global climatic cooling effect that is hypothesized to occur after widespread firestorms following a large-scale nuclear war. The hypothesis is based on the fact that such fires can inject soot into the stratosphere, where it can block some direct sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth. It is speculated that the resulting cooling would lead to widespread crop failure and famine.

Starmer is dishonest and several of his Labours policies are more right wing than the Torys.  He supports capitalism over workers rights and so in the eyes of the left is worse than the Status quo.  Simply put, if he wins the next election it endorses his treatment of the left, therefore we must show him that Labour cannot win in this way by voting elsewhere if at all.

 >The Suez Crisis, or the Second Arab–Israeli war, also called the Tripartite Aggression (Arabic: العدوان الثلاثي, romanized: Al-ʿUdwān aṯ-Ṯulāṯiyy) in the Arab world and the Sinai War in Israel, was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain control of the Suez Canal for the Western powers and to remove Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalised the foreign-owned Suez Canal Company, which administered the canal. After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders.
