This is very interesting, because it implies that killing deserting soldiers has a huge backlash in Russia to force him to virtually apologize and clarify he is alive. If the execution was a mock one in the first place, it implies the backlash against the first sledgehammer execution was huge or that because most of the recruits in Wagner are convicts that he fears an organizationwide mutiny. It was reported that Wagner is going to stop recruiting from prisons and the army will do it instead, it is believed that he was forbidden to keep doing and this was a way to keep his influence in check, but I wonder if it might be because Wagner is now made mostly from inmates and the danger of catastophic uprising is way bigger in a small mercenary unit than in the army where the inmates are going to be heavily outnumbered by the regular troops and other conscripts.

Whatever the case it shows huge hidden cracks in my opinion. If backlash forced the apology and sledgehammer executions to stop it implies the war is way more unpopular in Russia than reported and if it is because the fear of an uprising, how much difference is the fear of an uprising from a majority convict army to a majority conscript army? Neither of them are doing it voluntarily anyway.",1676618843.0,1676618548.0,t3_114abxs,t3_114abxs,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

Our investigation shows how goods sold by two companies belonging to the Mulliez Group – Auchan and Leroy Merlin – supply Russian armed forces on the Ukrainian front. In the case of Auchan, Le Monde's investigation reveals how the company's northern division itself organized the collection of Auchan products in Saint Petersburg for several tens of thousands of euros, just one month after the war began.

Russia may have a total population of 143m but they only have [48 million men aged 15-67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia).

Ukraine has [14 million men aged 15-67](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.1564.MA.IN?locations=UA) (2022 numbers). So they need a casualty ratio of around 3.2 Russians per Ukrainian to win the war in purely manpower terms.

* Weapon deliveries are ramping up, which will surely improve Ukraines casualty ratio
* Russia have expended their experienced military, and is using conscripts without training going forward
* Russia have expended their equipment
* Russian tactics and logistics are failing on a large scale

> [She] said that the decision to boycott the competition angered her as an athlete, because the path to the podium, which every athlete takes, is very long. 

> > ""The Russians took away the right to train normally from our athletes due to the destruction of the infrastructure. More than 350 sports facilities lie in ruins. 

>  Saladukha also added that it is cynical on the part of NOC president Vadym Gutzeit [Ukrainian sports minister] to hand Russians the ability to compete under a neutral flag and at the same time force Ukrainian athletes to sit idle [which she sees as the consequence as annoying a boycott, instead of challenging IOC].

> > ""Our flag should be seen at sports events, our national anthem should be played in stadiums during the Olympics. We need to be heard because we are fighting for our independence,"" Saladukha said.

> Nardepka said that a boycott could be an extreme measure, but now, Ukraine has not yet exhausted all possibilities to stop the plans of the International Olympic Committee, so we should focus on this.

The first is that Russia's military suddenly collapses as a fighting force (the premise of your post).   The second is that there is an internal military or paramilitary coup within Russia.   


Either of these could arise from the same precursor condition:  that the military's fighting capacity becomes recognizably impaired within the military itself.   In which case there are two possible behaviours which drive the divergent outcomes.   The first behavior is one of rats leave sinking ship, in which case the first to see it coming will save their skins and take anything that isn't nailed down that can also be used/bartered/sold later.    This means fuel, food, small arms ammunition, clothing and technical equipment will simply fall off trucks in large quantity and simply vanish, stranding units at the front.     The second behavior is one of self-preservation, where career officers determine that their careers (and likely lives) are forfeit if their underlings scamper and strand the troops.   In this case they are likely to act in significant self-preservation mode where the entire army takes what little cohesive force it has and directs it at Moscow or St. Petersburg, and we see a conflict for local or regional power between the military, the citizenry and police.   


My bet is that if there is systemic practice of ""fixing"" bad news as it goes up the chain,  officers who could detect that it's all come off the rails will likely be the last to know, and that what we will see is an implosion from lower level to higher level and the whole thing just comes unglued.

What could be plausible would be China taking over Mongolia, if they found some strategic or economic reason for doing so.  Or perhaps some other non-nuclear state in the region could be under consideration, such as a former Soviet possession.  But all of these are still rather unlikely.  

China wants Taiwan because it's a Western aligned territory just off their coast.  They believe it's a real threat to their continued existence, and that's reasonable.  Imagine how we'd feel in the US if there was a Communist ruled island ninety miles off the coast of Florida?  We'd probably try to overthrow them and place embargoes on trade with them.

But another thought occurred. 

If China wants to take Taiwan but is smart enough to learn from Russia's failure then maybe they try drawing down the ability of the US/Allies to respond to a move against Taiwan because they are distracted elsewhere.

So what if they support North Korea going after South Korea. US would be distracted and likely have to expend a lot of their weapons stocks helping to defend South Korea.

China doesn't have to be directly involved, just supporting them like the US/NATO is supporting Ukraine.

That might give them enough cover where they could go after Taiwan and we wouldn't be in the best position to directly help.

And I’d disagree with you.  First off, for a Russian, understanding Ukrainian requires a will to learn.  Second, many words mean something different in the other language. (‘False friends’ in linguistics.) Third, while many are written the same, they're pronounced different.  All this adds up to have to be *trying* to understand, in order to understand. 

The best *American* example I can give is that it’s like Boomhauer on *King of the Hill*—it’s such a strain to understand him, that all the minor characters he encounters don’t even try.  They gloss over, because it just sounds like unintelligible noise.  

It might be more accurate to compare it to Scots.  [not Scottish English, not Scottish Gaelic]
An Englishman might just tune out, bc making that leap to understand is a cognitive exercise, so have to *want* to understand, otherwise, will more likely just tune out, eyes glaze over.  Even Scots is more similar, though. 


It *is* the case that *some* make the effort, largely out of boredom.  Elsewhere I’ve read how RF POWs are allowed a library of books, most are in Ukrainian but a few in Russian.  They’re bored, have time on their hands, get the Ukrainian books and give it a try.

Edit:  This hasn’t been reported, but I suspect that Russians who are from the south (Kuban or Don regions) are the first to understand Ukrainian.  There’s a yokel-type dialect there—thoroughly mocked by Russians—that’s somewhere in between Ukrainian and Russian.  And ironically, I suspect also that Bashkir and other minorities from the rural East can also pick it up—because there’s a phenomenon that once already know a second language (Russian is their second language), the brain linguistic-to-reality links expand and weaken, and learning further languages is easier than is on the rest of the population.

Many times the simplest solution is the best one... but not always.

Russians have been inundated with the same message for 100 years—Ukrainian is the adulteration of Russian; that’s its only spoken by yokels (last 15 years, by nazis); that it’s the perversion of the pure, infallible Russian language.  Use of the language is shameful and users should be denigrated.  The message is so reinforced that hearing it makes Russians skin crawl.  They abhor it.

Russians need to know such messages themselves were evil—but not in the unintelligible evil language they don’t yet understand, as that’s pointless.   

Have you ever been on vacation, and a local spoke to you and you didn’t understand, so they repeated it, but shouted? The person thinks shouting the foreign words will make you somehow know their meaning.   Now imagine you’d also been taught since childhood that those words themselves just what ignorant people used.  Later, you learned those words were in that language were essentially the script of nazis—you would not *want* to learn it.

Basically, Russians find Ukrainian offensive.  They think is perverse and evil.  They can’t hear the message, bc the language itself offends them.  They don’t want to understand.  And no, they don’t naturally understand.  It is a different language.
