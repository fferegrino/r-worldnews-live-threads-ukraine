>#
>The aim is ""to set up the ammunition supply in Germany again independently of foreign production facilities,"" said a spokesman for the armaments company of the dpa news agency.  It was decided to build a new production facility for calibers from 20 to 35 millimeters in Germany.  Production is scheduled to start in June 2023.  Rheinmetall also referred to the considerable pent-up demand for ammunition in Germany and gaps that had arisen as a result of support from Ukraine.
>#
> In addition, Rheinmetall will be able to deliver the first batch of Gepard ammunition as early as July, the spokesman said. This is said to be up to 300,000 shots for Ukraine – provided the federal government issues a corresponding order.

Day 295 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today really wasn’t a quiet day at all, because this time the missiles from Belgorod were aimed at Kharkiv and at least 3 of them did make it through our air defense. They started launching their S-300 missiles around 1:30pm and, most likely, it was 4 missiles in total. We heard 3 pretty loud consecutive explosions, there were reports of the fourth one also happening, but we didn’t hear it personally.

As usual they aimed their missiles at something with no military value, at first our governor reported that they were firing at our infrastructure yet again, but a bit later it turned out to be just some random warehouses. Judging by the photos that were posted afterwards they were basically empty, and there were no military targets anywhere around, not even any regular vehicles, so I’m not sure what they wanted to hit there.

Kherson also continues to get shelled every single day and there are civilian casualties almost every time, because Russians are not trying to hit military targets, their goal is to kill as many civilians as possible even though it won’t help them win in any way. Apparently just today Kherson was shelled close to 20 times, it is not yet at the scale of shelling that was happening here in Kharkiv early in the war when we were getting shelled about 50-100 times per day, but it is still just horrible.

In recent months we went through 1000s of emails from Russia's biggest state broadcaster to learn how. It was a master class in constructing an alternative reality.

>
>Tucker Carlson was a favorite. “Don’t forget to take Tucker” producers wrote to a state-media journalist in the US, pointing to a clip where Tucker warned how opposing Russia and China could end the dollar’s status as a world reserve currency. They often used other clips too:

>Often the bulletins showed incredible attention to detail and knowledge of the U.S. One dug out a local news broadcast from Alabama about drivers pasting stickers on gas pumps with Biden’s face reading “I did that.” Within days, it was on Russian national news.
>
>Journalists mixed the material with more reliable broadcasts to paint a compelling picture of a world in turmoil without Russian energy. They did the same to script disinfo about US bioweapons labs in Ukraine - for that they mixed Chinese diplomats with a Roger Stone interview.
>
>Closer to home, they got help from security forces like the FSB, who passed along videos, sometimes demanding they be used without citing their source. Some undercut narratives of atrocities. Others showed terrorists caught trying to attack Russia:
>
>Other emails showed how key cooperation with Chinese state media was, VGTRK officials planned a birthday present for top Chinese propagandist Shen Haixiong a month ahead of time to get through COVID quarantines. They sent an album of Russian paintings. Here's them planning:

>In other cases, officials took out their anger at Russia's growing isolation. One crowed about a statement to Latvian threats to ban VGTRK channels, ""“Quite restrained, but tried to put ironic contempt.” They worried about being tossed from Eurovision.

(1) **Major, Army Intelligence (GRU)**

*Has been stationed both in the South and the East*

It’s unlikely that Ukraine will be defeated—that would require entire regime change in Moscow.

We [military] are controlled by businessmen who believe in the power of the deal [ie, the Kremlin].  They paid off Medvedchuk and the SBU, but only the South stood down, but the North put up a fight we were unprepared for. 

I’m now in the North, and what is being prepared here, if it starts, our losses will be huge, but there will be no result. 

Putin is to blame, who stupidly like a girl fell for [American] provocations and started a war at a time when we were not ready for it, at all.  Shoigu, Gerasimov, Goremykin, Lapin, Prigozhin are to blame. Blame everyone who convinced the top brass that we can win with a completely plundered army.


(2) **Major, Staff Officer** (General Staff)

*serves at their HQ, deep in Russian-held Ukrainian territory.*

We are losing the war. We are trying to patch up holes through mobilization, through mercenaries, but we are losing.  And that’s because we were not ready for it—[poorly trained, poor self discipline in] officers, a low level of generals. Chiefs of staff, unit commanders, formation commanders make unprofessional decisions because left option between bad choices, over and over again. [ . . . ] The level of training of officers, their motivation, has declined for 20 years.  This multiplied by wholesale theft, disregard for other units, which has always been present in the army—all this and we get the reasons for current defeats. 

Putin wanted land, he is a dinosaur from two centuries ago, but with the manners of Stalin. I realized in the summer that this war is a crime. Against our people, against our army, against Ukraine and Ukrainians. 

But we don't talk about it here. This is not a movie. Like it was in *Saving Private Ryan*, when they had heartfelt conversations before a battle. Everyone follows orders so to not be smacked, but there is anger, insomnia, exhaustion, and an internal sense of duty.

I could surrender to the Ukrainians, but would have to organize it, so they don't shoot me right away. But, if I were to organize, my own could discover, and put against a wall [ie, kill by firing squad].

We will lose the war here, within the borders of Ukraine. And we'll go home and lick our wounds, while Putin, who started all this, will be as he was, [protected], until he dies of old age. 



(3) **Colonel, commander of a motorized rifle division**

*Fighting in the East of Ukraine*


In some areas, everything is in our favor, but in general, we are losing the war. I do not see any real prospects to change this situation now.

[why?] Because we have no strategy, no goals, no strategic objectives. Because the army was not ready for this war technically, mentally, professionally. Among the commanders there are many people who have received both titles and positions thanks to acquaintances and connections. In units, in subdivisions, there is a constant shortage of ammunition, weapons, equipment, medicines, and food. Against this background, people have no motivation, no understanding of why all this is needed, how to win this war and why. Well, the main problem, as I see it, is that the vast majority of the commanding staff refuses to see problems. I'm not inclined to think that they’re all morons, it turns out that they simply don't want to really look at things. This is not how wars are won.

This war is because Putin dreamed of restoring the USSR. [ . . . ] There is no point to this war. [ . . . ] I hate this war.  But I know that war is what I can do. I would like it to end now. It won't. It's such a devastation. I don't want to be here but I can't not be.  I’ve considered suicide, but rejected that as too cowardly. 
I had considered retirement this spring, but none of my subordinates would be promoted, and under another commander, they’d all be dead in a month. 
So I’ve stayed.  For the last three months, I’ve considered switching sides, but I would need to take my entire unit, and it seems impossible for technical reasons.

>
>Trench warfare has long been a feature of the battle in eastern Ukraine, but the pace and scale of Russian construction over the past couple of months is unmatched. It shows how Russia is trying to set defensible positions against Ukrainian pressure.
>
>Among the defenses are miles-long rows of concrete pyramids known as dragon’s teeth and deep ditches called tank traps. Both are designed to slow Ukrainian vehicles and force them into preset positions where Russian forces can target them.
>
>Russia is also building miles of trenches, and pillboxes — small structures for their troops to shoot from. The fortifications could slow Ukraine’s army, but they are effective only if manned correctly.
>
>The Times analyzed satellite radar data on physical changes to the earth’s surface. That, along with high-resolution satellite imagery, reveals multiple rows of Russian defenses lining major highways just behind the Russian frontlines.
>
>One network of Russian defenses near Popasna was constructed in just 11 days. Satellite data from Popasna shows new rows of defensive structures snaking north across open fields.
>
>The success of Russia’s defensive structures depends on the quality of troops defending them. It mobilized hundreds of thousands of fresh recruits in September, but many arrived poorly trained and unequipped.

Unless Im missing something, it just seems insane to me for the Russians to attack the capital again.

A thought had occurred to me - one of the big factors in this war is the UN’s complete incompetence to deal with an invasion by a member that holds a permanent SC seat. Russia’s actions are the exact sort of thing that the UN was allegedly intended to prevent. But because Russia has a UN SC seat, it can veto any meaningful measure against itself.

Yet, why does Russia have a UN SC seat? Because it inherited it from the original owner - the Soviet Union.

This makes no sense to me. Legally, the Soviet Union was a union of socialist republics. When the union started to fall apart in the 1990s, there were 15 union republics. Russia was one. So was Ukraine. So why does Russia get the seat?

(I know the answer is that, de facto, the Soviet Union was ‘really’ just an empire ruled from Moscow, but de jure, it was a union of republics).

As it turns out, the hand-over to the Russians was pretty hurried and shoddy:

https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2022/0303/1284242-russia-ussr-un-security-council-permanent-seat/

In my opinion, it ought to be revisited, as the SC with Russia holding the veto has proven to be utterly worthless.

My suggestion: give the seat on the SC, collectively, to all of the 15 republics that existed when the Soviet Union started to break up. This would be the most fair allocation on any event.

Russia could still no doubt dominate many of these republics - like Belarus - but this would give the outside world an opportunity to peel others out of Russia’s orbit, with carrots and sticks. The beauty of this system is that the more Russia concentrates on hammering Ukraine, the more its grip loosens on the other neighbouring nations - which, under this system, would give every incentive for them to vote against Russian interests at the SC.

This would be better than simply trying to eliminate the seat Russia currently holds (there is no good way of going about doing that).",False,1671119334.0,t3_zmbkc5,t3_zmbkc5,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

It suggests that lines are purely drawn around your size, not around your action. Russia does it? We won't fight that. Smaller country does it? Not fine and we'll fuck your shit up ourselves for trying.

Of course there's probably some truth to that, maybe the west would fight in Ukraine if Russia didn't have nukes, maybe they wouldn't because the last 20 years have made intervention very unpopular, but here we are.

So acting on Belarus then suggests that if the far more dangerous enemy in the pacific does it to their island neighbour, being larger than even Russia?

Russia did not make contingency plans in case something went wrong, because that could be seen as questioning Putin's judgment. The end result is that Russia didn't take the time to examine the depth of available combat ready supplies or manpower, because - ""What could go wrong?""

Russia compensates by throwing bodies and accepting a much higher casualty rate.

As long as Russia persists, it is now a game of how fast Russia can throw bodies into the Ukraine meat-grinder, and how well that meat-grinder can hold up, and sustain a rate of Russian-killing that meets or exceeds Russia's rate of new bodies.

Russia's running out of long-range precision-strike missiles. They're running out of artillery shells.  They're already demonstrating that they're digging into much older and less-reliable supplies of everything from uniforms to rifles to tanks.  All of which makes new troops less effective than the first wave of troops.  

Meanwhile, Russia's producing (slowly) new tanks, new uniforms, new rifles; but there's a rate they can sustain, under sanctions.  Ukraine has to kill new Russians at a faster rate than Russia can supply them.  That's where the economics will act as a limit on Russia.

With long-range precision strike capability, Ukraine could make temporary impacts on that rate of equipment manufacture.  But I don't think Ukraine can pull these off at the rate they need. Which is why they need to degrade Russia's air-defenses, and start flying sorties deeper into Russian territory, to destroy Russia's manufacturing capability, to slow down their rate of supplying new troops.

Russia’s actions are the exact sort of thing that the UN was allegedly intended to prevent. But because Russia has a UN SC seat, it can veto any meaningful measure against itself. 

Yet, why does Russia have a UN SC seat? Because it inherited it from the original owner - the Soviet Union. 

This makes no sense to me. Legally, the Soviet Union was a **union** of socialist republics. When the union started to fall apart in the 1990s, there were 15 union republics. Russia was one. So was Ukraine. So why does Russia get the seat? 

(I know the answer is that, de facto, the Soviet Union was ‘really’ just an empire ruled from Moscow, but de jure, it was a union of republics).

As it turns out, the hand-over to the Russians was pretty hurried and shoddy: 

https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2022/0303/1284242-russia-ussr-un-security-council-permanent-seat/

In my opinion, it ought to be revisited, as the SC with Russia holding the veto has proven to be utterly worthless. 

My suggestion: give the seat on the SC, collectively, to *all* of the 15 republics that existed when the Soviet Union started to break up. This would be the most fair allocation on any event. 

Russia could still no doubt dominate many of these republics - like Belarus - but this would give the outside world an opportunity to peel others out of Russia’s orbit, with carrots and sticks. The beauty of this system is that the more Russia concentrates on hammering Ukraine, the more its grip loosens on the other neighbouring nations - which, under this system, would give every incentive for them to vote against Russian interests at the SC. 

This would be better than simply trying to eliminate the seat Russia currently holds (there is no good way of going about doing that).",False,1671116506.0,t3_zmbkc5,t1_j0bsffs,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

If the widely expected next mobilization hits in January a new wave of replacements may flood in before Ukraine is done killing the current one.

>Russia is the world’s third largest refining industry. It exports some 2.8 million b/d of oil products, making it the second largest exporter after the US. According to customs data, revenues from these sales totalled $70 billion last year – more than exports of natural gas and LNG combined, which speaks to the sector’s importance for the federal budget.

>It is estimated that Russia imports about 75% of the catalysts it uses for hydrocracking, hydrotreatment, and catalytic cracking – all of which are essential for producing quality transportation fuels.

>According to a recent report by Rupec, a Moscow-based firm specializing in downstream analysis, Russia imported $187 million worth of catalysts in 2020. The US accounted for one-third of Russia’s catalyst imports that year, while European countries — Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Italy and France — accounted for about half.

>What’s more, virtually all the technology for both conversion and upgrading units, as well as steam crackers used in petchems production, is licensed by US and European vendors. A list of technology partners for Taneco, one of Russia’s most advanced and ambitious refineries, reads like a who’s who among Western refining technology leaders: Chevron Lummus Global, Honeywell UOP, WorleyParsons, Axens, Foster Wheeler, GE Energy.

Currently Russia would have already assigned at least 500K people to this war considering an initial force of 190K and a mobilization of 300k and an undisclosed number of volunteers joining the fight in between and prisoners. Chances are the numbers are already way higher.

But the problem isn't that they can't feed meat to the front. But that the male in their age workforce represent around 25M of the Russian population. With already 500K to the front and we're not even talking about the 120K conscripted last November and this December. 

That's already close to 2% of the male population in working age that's either dead or invalid or about to become one of those. And we're not counting the around 700K people that left Russia (unclear how many males there are)... And that's also not considering how many males there actually are in Russia.

The reality is that Russia likely doesn't really know exactly how many Russians are actually living in Russia and even before the recent exodus. So the 25M figure may be actually lower already. So 2% is really a minimum, but the number can be much higher.

For example, a six-rocket pod in a HIMARS is much more destructive than a single ATACMs shot. And personally I think attacking Russia proper — no matter how satisfying it may be (it would very much so be this) — might backfire and focus the war effort for them. Especially if US missiles are falling. So the point is there is more than one way to look at the bigger picture. And hundreds if not thousands of Pentagon analysts know far more about this than I do, and it's their job to think of every angle. 

I personally want ATACMs for what it's worth. But I won't trivialize the decisions as being afraid of Russia. The whole dance, you may have noticed, is very complex.
