Day 423-424 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday there was a new small missile strike so it wasn’t nearly as quiet as usual here. Now most of their strikes happen at 10pm, which is most likely their new scheduled time for all kinds of attacks in our region. Previously they used to conduct their missile strikes in Kharkiv at 11pm, but in the recent weeks they started to drop their bombs and launch missiles at 10pm. Even when nothing happens, they still fly their bombers or move missile launchers at that time most days just to trigger our air raid alert.

The missile strike this time wasn’t big, they only fired about 6 missiles, one of which landed somewhere in Belgorod oblast because their S-300 missiles malfunction all the time. We heard around 5, pretty loud, explosions here in the city, they targeted civilian infrastructure as usual, and a couple of their missile missed too. They hit a vegetable processing plant and targeted a residential district in Kotliary, thankfully even though they did manage to destroy a couple of houses there were no casualties.

There was also a mysterious fire on a gas station that started at the same time as the missile strike was happening, but it wasn’t caused by it. That was the only fire that started around that time, so everyone thought that it was from the missile strike, but it looks like someone actually physically set a gas tank on fire. The timing is really weird, as it happened during a missile strike. I would guess it was a sabotage by some Russia-affiliated forces, but so far, no culprits were found so we can’t know for sure.",False,1682290792.0,t3_12w0fj3,t3_12w0fj3,,0,204,0,204,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Of course one would think they'd have learned from the blunder before. However this is not some minor error in russian military strategy that can be fixed easily. It is a fundamental flaw in the way russia conducts military operations based on top-down political, not military needs.

Moscow's forces are allegedly facing a ""catastrophic lack of medical personnel on the battlefield.""

""In order to replenish the shortage of military doctors, locals who work at medical institutions in Berdiansk, who have received civilian passports of the Russian Federation, have begun to be forced to register for military service,"" the update stated.

-----------

Russia seems to think it has way more men than it really does. They're throwing away too many recruits in these assaults. What's surprising is how little Russia cares for the lives of its own troops.

That being said, Russia has this weird system where some troops get more training than others. Ex: 1st Guards Tank Army, which isn't ""special forces"", but supposed to be ""elite"" tankers who specialize in knowing how to counteract NATO operations.

Agreed. The donbas has large and secure supply lines straight into Russia that Ukraine can't sever. They can keep supplying and fighting there indefinitely.

Crimea is another matter. If Ukraine can sever the land bridge, Kherson is really vulnerable. With limited, and indirect, supply routes and Ukraine able to harass and attack from two sides.

Actually I'd argue it's base human nature. We humans exist because we've evolved complex social structures where we rely on each other for survival. Tribalism, where we are only successful as a group and not as individuals: the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.

For the vast majority of human history you could argue communism was how humans lived because there was not concept of individualism or property ownership, it just wouldn't be called ""communism"" as this is a modern political philosophy written in direct response to Capitalism.

We are a communal species by nature, it's in our DNA. We learn and are told our social constructs, which are usually constructed to protect the few, and pacify the many.

Does it? Because anyone studying human evolutionary theory and human history, that hasn't been the case for the vast majority of it. Human history being roughly 300,000 years...and definitely not true for the vast majority of hominid existence either which is roughly 8-million years.

EO Wilson's Euspecies concept sheds light on this where evolution happens on both an individual and species level, which is reflected in every social species on Earth: Ants, Elephants, Chimpanzees, Dolphins, Whales and Humans. We are a tribe. And arguably evolution on the tribal level trumps individual adaptations.

This idea that the individual is some unique driving force is a rather new one. In fact, I'd argue it's observationally different than actual nature. Neanderthals  (homo sapien neanderthalensis) were highly more individualistic than us homo sapien sapiens, to the point that we survived and they did not.

>The world will always have people that will want more than their neighbor

Sure, but a society built to allow them to be the winner is diametrically opposed to observational human and social evolution.

And I feel you're playing with a very loose grasp of this concept both historically and etymologically. ""Neighbors"" has never really been individuals; it's been tribes. And tribes/tribalism is more the Communist/Socialist line of thought than the Capitalist one. Even the bedrock of Capitalism is tribal in nature, thus rendering you point mute as well. Capitalism's foundation was shared cost for shared benefit at it's bedrock. It's too expensive for ONE person to own a boat and it sinks, it sinks the person financially. But if that cost is spread amongst a group, the lost of one ship hurts everyone, but everyone less than if they were the soul owner.

This idea of individualism is a rather new concept, that is more the result of the decay of social structures and not one backed by nature or human history.",1682263212.0,1682262858.0,t3_12w0fj3,t1_jhee7q4,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

I'd think there is opportunity there. 

I see Russia's position as basically reactive at this point. You are right that dead mobiks don't matter to them as they weren't trained and barely equipped anyway so there is little cost if you don't value human life. The equipment is a different story and for all the vast reserves we keep hearing about we are also looking at some pretty shabby gear being deployed, suggesting real problems in that department. And the ""limitless"" Russian ammo seems to have similar problems. 

If Ukraine can avoid the traditional 20th century slugfest Russia wants to fight I do think they are are in a good position. If the modern training sticks, combining these with some innovation and improvisation to sidestep the war Russia wants I think Ukraine is in fact in a good position. Maybe not for the same reasons OP suggested, but as far as innovation and improvisation, Ukraine has shown remarkable ability, and Russia seems basically inept in their rigid doctrine of ""everything is nail, get a bigger hammer.""",False,1682278897.0,t3_12w0fj3,t1_jhfbq05,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

On the contrary; socialism can exist as the base-natural state by expanding the definition of ""us"" and eliminating the competition for natural resources. If resources are controlled collectively, and not allowed to be segmented privately, you achieve the elimination of the base-level of competition.

This is LITERALLY why most socialism exists with the elimination of a lot of private property, which is subsequently why those that benefit from the ownership and monopolization of private property focus so heavily on keeping people divided into ""tribes"".

That's where you'd be wrong, and a lot of people thus want to reform the society. The ability to make surpluses should only exist to the benefit of the tribe, as it increases the chance of the tribe to survive...without the tribe the individual doesn't matter regardless of surplus. Thus the counter argument to individualistic ownership is it's directly opposed to what makes the tribe successful; and we all have a shared interest in the success/failure of the surplus.

Every human society that has failed has been because of a mismanagement of resources, thus proving this fundamental principle.

Both capitalism and socialism exist on the same natural principle of group/tribalism success.  Where Capitalism was a response to the risk/impact of expensive concentration or resources and borne out of a response to the monopolization of said resources (monarchy essentially); thus Socialism evolved from the monopolization of resources this time from capitalism.

Essentially socialism and Capitalism are the same solution to the same problem at the bedrock principle: spreading out the cost to maximize both the impact and benefit; so is socialism. You seem hellbent on accepting one, and refuting the other which is weird to me. At the very least comes across as dishonest, or lacking nuance.

You've bought into the idea that Capitalism is the Zenith, when it's nothing more than an economic theory just like any other. All economic theories are doomed to fail if they are in direct opposition to Human nature, which is what Karl Marx argued in his analysis of the French and American revolutions. Karl Marx, of course, being only the modern philosopher to speak on socialism, when there were far more older philosophers dating back to the Ancient Greeks who also discussed it's precepts  long before capitalism existed.

Plato and Aristotle, Lao Tzu and Ibyn Al-Hazen all flirted with philosophical concepts of socialism long before we had a name for it. Later Louis Blanc, and Pierre Leroux along with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon would coin the modern interpretation (all french...as it was one of many ideas of reformation born out of the French Revolution and the eventual fall of Napoleon).

It's really good at the things you teach it.   
It's really shit on everything you forgot.

Distinguishing a thing in a combat environment is mostly an intuitive exercise. Due to the lack of factual this=that programable things that cannot be easily changed it is currently damn near impossible to build such intelligence.

Think about it like teaching a machine to see what a human is and then that human changing their shape or behavior beyond those parameters so they no longer trigger the ""I saw a human"" response.

This doesn't mean they are the best. Wagner just has the luxury of being able to employ tactics that would usually be unacceptable to any professional military. The Russian military has emulated Wagner's tactics, but only to a very slight extent in comparison. Most of these human wave attacks that have had success were carried out by proxy forces instead of the Russian military. 

The best forces Russia has today may be the ones who were able to evacuate Kherson largely under the radar last year. Possibly some of those DNR and LNR forces who have been fighting long before 2022. Russia's air defense forces have been fairly effective.

A Russian assault repelled in a significant sector? Big revenge time.

A Russian missile attack thwarted or plane which launches missiles shot down? Big revenge time.

A Russian AWACS plane hit? Big revenge time.

But more to the point, are hundreds of millions of people monitoring this conflict via OSINT, Satellite data etc.? 

You think Ukraine has been on the operational offensive since January with literally NO ONE noticing for the past 3 months because Zelenskyy said ""big revenge time""?

For much of the 8 month battle, Wagner had indeed been sending convicts, but before this winter the ratio was quite favorable for Ukraine. Ever since the fall of Soledar and a narrowing of the casualties, Wagner had been quick to reinforce this success with its professional troops, who made good progress but likely got depleted along with the prisoners. This left the VDV units, likely the battered formations which fled Kherson, to first take their place on the flanks, then as urban fighters which has only continued their attrition. Long story short, by paying their own blood to hold on to Bakhmut, Ukraine has been baiting Wagner and more recently the VDV, probably the 2 best fighting forces in the RuAF, to continually break their teeth against a strong Ukrainian defense. 

Also just as a side note, the D/LNR are basically >90% mobiks, and even the Russians aren’t stupid enough to send air defense units into Bakhmut.
