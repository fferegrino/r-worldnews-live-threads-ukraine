>(1/4) In recent days, Russia has continued to prioritise an operation attempting to encircle the Donetsk Oblast town of Avdiivka. However, Russian forces have made only marginal progress at the cost of heavy losses in armoured vehicles.  

>(2/4) Russia’s 10th Tank Regiment has likely lost a large proportion of its tanks while attempting to surround Avdiivka from the south. The regiment is part of 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support the invasion of Ukraine since August 2022.  

>(3/4) Numerous open-source accounts suggested that 3rd Army Corps has been particularly dogged by problems with ill-discipline and poor morale. Despite a likely period of training in Belarus, the formation still appears to display limited combat effectiveness.  

>(4/4) 10th Tank Regiment’s losses have likely largely been due to tactically flawed frontal assaults similar to those in other recent failed Russian armoured attacks, such as around the town of Vuhledar.

An interesting post by a Russian volunteer reveals how 🇺🇦listen to radio/cellular comms. It alleges 🇺🇦 hear almost everything and can act on it very effectively:

Quote: ""This post applies primarily to the mobilised and their relatives. There are people who will continue chatting regardless of anything, and there are also reasonable people, who simply have not encountered such things before and do not know how to behave. The post is for them.

The chatter in question falls into two categories: open radio and cellular. With radio communication, everything is simple. Everything that you say on the Baofeng radio, you can consider being known to the enemy. At the same time, do not flatter yourself, the jargon from thirty years ago is perfectly familiar to them and does not mislead them. Therefore, one should not be surprised if, after a phrase such as ""In 10 small ones, expect a box of pencils"" [pencils = privates/foot soldiers] or ""Moles are working there"" (a painful subject) [moles = sabotage groups/reconnaissance], there will be shelling. Moreover, in the second case, the moles can also beat you, and if you're lucky, then only with their legs. If you're going to speak openly, then at least assign your own names to objects and landmarks and change them regularly, at least once every two weeks. And do not talk openly about the arrival of superiors, supplies, or cooperating units.

Now about cellular communication. Unfortunately, it is also a valuable source of information for Ukrainian partners. And this applies primarily to the conversations of the military with members of their families. People, for some reason, think that if they don't talk to other military people, then no one is interested, but this is not so. It's just that partners usually publish the internal conversations between fighters, and not with families. Maybe they don't want to draw attention to it. But a lot is said when people are relaxed.

For example: ""Farewell, dear, stormtroopers have arrived, tomorrow at 6 am we will advance.” The enemy, knowing the approximate location of the phone is able to take measures to repel the attack. Reverse example: ""Honey, we are being taken out to rest the day after tomorrow."" For those who do not know yet, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a strong habit of attacking before the shift change in order to either take advantage of the tired mood of those departing, or the ignorance of the situation by the new arrivals. Usually at the end of the night and in bad weather, if they have time to prepare and plan everything. And even seemingly neutral: ""Sorry, dear, I'm very tired, I walked to the headquarters for twenty kilometers, and the road is broken"" can lead to trouble. That will be enough to measure the distance on the map, ask the Americans for satellite images, which will show either equipment or its traces,
then send local agents for additional reconnaissance, and you can expect HIMARS. The examples are based on real events, by the way.

The enemy also carefully collects any negative information regarding the supply, salaries and the implementation of social guarantees by our beloved Ministry of Defence. Lack and absence of something, delays in payments, outright cheating, red tape, etc. etc. Moreover, their informational operation centres are not pushing these issues yet, perhaps they are still collecting the primary array of information. 

And finally, there is also a thorough collection of data not only of the military personnel but also of members of their families. Why is that, I don’t know for sure, but unlikely to congratulate them on birthdays. Perhaps, scammers will call later. Group phones are of particular interest in this regard. This is when a phone with a SIM card is bought alone for a company or department, and the fighters take turns calling home. So it’s also better not to talk too much, even on personal topics, although the desire to talk about this is natural and understandable."" End of quote.

> **For surrender without decisive resistance will mean 10 years in prison**

> The [Russian] Supreme Court corrects its practice in cases of war crimes: a draft of a new resolution of the plenum of the RF Armed Forces has not yet been published [in full], but some provisions have already been published in TA.ss.

> For example, the project assumes that any capture will be attributed to voluntary surrender if the soldier did not put up decisive resistance.

> > *A serviceman in the course of hostilities must offer resolute resistance to the enemy and avoid being captured, even being separated from his military unit and in complete encirclement. It is important for the courts to take this moment into account*, the highest court emphasized.

> “This interpretation implies that any captured serviceman will, at the very least, undergo a procedural check in accordance with Articles 144-145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation,” lawyer Pavel Chikov said, commenting on the new project in his channel. “Now, surrendering is a crime—if there was still the opportunity to ‘provide resolute resistance’—giving an expectation of a punishment of up to 10 years in a penal colony. If a military man is physically unable to avoid captivity, then there is no *corpus delicti* in that.”

> The consequence for voluntary surrender is from three to ten years in prison; but, if the military subsequently ‘went over to the side of the enemy’, then the article for “Treason” is applied to him, which already threatens with 20 years in prison.

> In addition, liability is introduced for an attempt to arbitrarily leave a unit. Now a criminal case for AWOL can also be initiated in cases where a serviceman is absent from the unit for less than two days. This will take into account the period for which the soldier intended to leave the unit, and not the actual time of his absence.

I’m not sure how I feel about this. . .  Because on the one hand, it is giving the public anger—there’s many angry comments, chiefly in two camps: (1) along the lines of, “they’re saying they want to ensure death! Fight till your death! mobilizations means death, folks.” And (2) “what constitutes ‘resolute, decisive’? The term is vague and arbitrary.  And who determines whether conduct meets the standard? A commissioner who accepts bribes, no doubt.”

And this sort of legal apparatus to force unwilling participants to fight this war will help push public sentiment to oppose to mobilization, the ‘SVO’, and the Kremlin.  And enough of opposing sentiments can eventually help war to end. [every drop helps].

On the other hand, it may in fact impact willingness to surrender, which will thus render fewer POWs.  This is a problem bc Russia has taken many thousands of POWs and Civilians and uses them as bargaining chips.

> The situation in the Bakhmut area is dynamic, but the Russian military has not gained any strategic advantage in this direction in recent days, according to Sergei Cherevaty, the spokesman of the Eastern Group of Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on the air of the national news telethon.

> > *""The situation in the Bakhmut area is very dynamic. The enemy sometimes has some tactical advances, but we have already predicted those. We anticipate them and we employ countermeasures.*

> > *So, to talk about some kind of ‘strategic advantage’ [by the Russians] in the last few hours or days is impossible—the whole situation is constantly difficult. However, we use fire and other countermeasures to prevent the enemy from [ultimately] developing their attacks into success.""*

> He added that there were 14 ‘combat encounters’ with the enemy in the Bakhmut area today, with 86 invaders killed and 117 injured.

> Reference: On March 28, the Institute for the Study of War had reported that the Russian occupiers ""achieved minor successes "" in the north and south-west of Bakhmut.

4384a4aa052fecac046562fbc482e13c,124c0xu,jdzvqx7,"There’s a bit of an outrage brewing in Estonia. 

Politico published an article today regarding how Estonia is commented to be abusing the system, where states get reimbursed for the weapons they give to Ukraine. Now, I cannot say whether or not it is right or wrong to claim the expenditure for the cost of a new weapon when you donate the old one 

- primarily because I can see arguments for both it being wrong and right: wrong, because the item you gave one away wasn’t as expensive as the one you’d like to buy, but also right because that older model or item was something you already had in storage, whereas a newer updated or sophisticated model could be 2-3x of the cost of the old one - 

BUT: what makes the article or piece a lot less trustworthy and makes people especially outraged, is the fact that Estonia is accused of supplying Ukraine with older weapons (and asking for more expensive and newer weapons to be bought with EU money) which Estonia only had 4 (AFAIK) in its arsenal and which was destroyed back in either 1996 or 2004-2005 (I’ve seen both numbers) by one of our previous heads of armed forces. Certainly Estonia no longer had these weapons by the time donations were given to Ukraine, because at the very least, we had destroyed such weapons nearly 20, if not nearly 30, years ago. On top of that, Estonia was one of the first to give Ukraine weapons BEFORE the invasion started. Specifically, Estonia gave Ukraine its newly bought and expensive (honestly, I think we only had them for a year up to that point) Javelins - that happened either in January or early February before the actual invasion began. More specifically, the article claims that Estonia donated Strelas and is asking for Stingers, but our old Strelas were destroyed long before Russia went into Ukraine back in 2014 and AFAIK, we’ve never bought Stingers and don’t plan to. 

Politico’s “facts” have been countered by various security experts AND the MoD of Estonia and the permanent secretary of MoD of Estonia, but obviously these will never gain as much of an audience as Politico’s piece, which is now painting Estonia as the little nasty Eastern European schemer some would like to believe Estonia to be. 

As an Estonian, I’m not sure how I feel about the idea of asking for the price of a new weapon when we have donated some older ones (I believe we donated some older howitzers from East-Germany?), but with the “facts” being wrong, I’m not even sure I believe what Politico claims about reimbursements anymore. 

This is bound to cause some very deeeeeep political ruffles in Estonia, because the wider public will see this as an attempt from the unknown EU officials (cough - seen as quite possibly to be from France and Germany, although never mentioned to be so and obviously unverified - cough) to undermine Estonia’s reputation as a NATO/EU ally and to besmirch what Estonia has donated/given to Ukraine as money-grab to get replacement weapons without having to pay for them themselves. As a country literally next to Russia and much smaller than Ukraine, Estonia has a strong belief that Ukraine is shedding blood for Estonians as well, hence the high support for military donations AND high support amongst the public (private donations via money, material support and cars/ambulances/refugee support). Many Estonians already doubt whether Germany/France would actually help Estonia and such pieces by Politico only fuel the undercurrent in the society that larger EU nations, which sit far away from Russia, basically still don’t “get” the very existential nature of this war (or rather, the existential nature of the question that Russia should lose, because if they win, the consequences would be unseen) and that such issues need to be squabbled via private diplomatic means, not public news sources because they cleave large chasms between what is factually true and what has been reported as “true”. 

For what it’s worth, I don’t oppose public journalism doing what journalism is meant to do. But I do absolutely despise it when journalists present false facts as truth and once the piece has been allowed to go out and multiply - and alter people’s opinions and views - they never admit that they were wrong. Some even say that Politico’s piece is a win for the Russian propaganda establishment, which is… well, not good in the grand scheme of things.",False,1680006647.0,t3_124c0xu,t3_124c0xu,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Mortar and bomb the ever living shit out of the lines they plan to push through. Enough that Russian troops have to retreat to bunkers. Those can be seen built into Russia's fortifications. Once they are likely there Ukraine hits the bunkers with something heavy, JDAMs. That will force Russia to retreat, those that are still alive that is.

Then tanks and supports like Bradleys will roll up and secure that area. Anti mine crews will come in with mine clearing line charges. A long rope like thing that is launched with a small missile. The missle drags it down the road and the line charge is blown to clear the roads. That will be done until the roads look safe. Mine clearing vehicles will continue down the road for some time being followed by tanks and support vehicles.

While this is happening drones will be in the sky watching the Russian's retreat. HIMARS and mortars will be used to keep pushing them back.

If that can be kept up until the tanks and support vehicles are through then Ukraine is in a very good position.

There's this video earlier from today showing rusty 1970s Kamaz trucks and brand-new factory-fresh BRDM-2s. The fact that some factory managed to pump out these deathtraps is shocking in multiple ways. The BRDM-2 is a scout car from the 1960s with 14mm of armor at its thickest in the nose plate, and only 2mm on the sides. It's got a single ancient 14.7mm machine gun. The vehicle is literally nicknamed the Bardak, literally a brothel, figuratively a huge mess, and is notorious for being impossible to escape from on the battlefield. 

> the only way in and out of the vehicle is via the front hatches, leaving the vehicle while in combat is almost impossible, as the exiting crew members would instantly enter the line of fire of both the enemy and their own vehicle, as hatches are positioned directly in front of the turret

Off to Ukraine they go.

With a dumb shell? Quite tricky, I'd imagine. Obviously ballistic tables (or an app, probably) exists that can tell you the number of seconds it'll take from the moment you fire until impact. But unless your target is travelling along a completely straight vector at a completely fixed velocity, it's more than a little hard to figure out where you're supposed to be aiming at... 80 seconds from now. Really, that's the kind of task the [German SMArt shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMArt_155) is meant for: Aim at the general area, and the two sub-munitions will dynamically seek their targets when deployed. I seem to recall a successful concurrent hit by one of those on two jeeps with fleeing commanders from a while back.

It’s not. Based on my understanding that looks like a towed gun and my guess is the vehicle towing it was behind where the camera crew was filming.

(1) Rational actor theory - the idea that people (and states) act rationally.  Assuming that someone is acting rationally is a good assumption until it is not, and has been a bad model for behavior of the Russian Federation for awhile.

(2) The dictatorship trap - Dictatorships often work by creating a fake information sphere.  They then use the fake information sphere as a loyalty test - which is used for promotions.  (see: George Orwell, Animal Farm).  The problem is this selects for people at every level of the organizational pyramid, people that are willing to live and communicate false hood.  With those at the top of the pyramid being those most dedicated to the fake informational system.

Finally, we need to address something about how the Russian Gov. actually works.

Many people refer to the Russian governing system as a 'mafia state.'  Usually this discriptor is used for any kleptocracy.  However, the Russian Federation Gov. under Putin and United Russia is actually organized like a Mafia or quasi feudal system.

In a Mafia each ""crew"" of goons works independently of each other trying to maximize their own profit.  The only rule being that the cut to the ""boss"" always goes through.  In some crime organizations this can become so extreme that different ""crews"" can literaly go to war with each other.

In Russia, Vladimir Putin has cultivated many organizations that have overlapping and redudent functions by either taking organizations with similar jobs and blending their responsibilies together, FSB & GRU, or by creating new organizaitions that do things other organizations already do, RU Army & Wagner or Rusvagardia & Police.

These competing organizations derive their power and budget from their success.  However, Putin provides the minimum of guidance in the organizations because personalistic rule suffers from an attention budget of the dictator.  The competition between the organizations is what is intended prevent any ambitious leader from taking a shot at Putin himself.

Sufficiently large organizations are further subdivied into competing sub groups.  For instance, the initial Russian invasion force was devided into 3-4 different independent commands without an overall commander for the invasions.  Additionally, individual Russian units, whether Moblik or volunteer, are provided by, equiped, trained, and sustained by the home Oblast/Republic from the resources of the home Oblast/Republic, with glory and reward being atomized to the unit and not the military as a whole.

In short, the Russian gov. operates like a mob or feudal system where each administrator, general, spy, etc. has their own little fief they draw power and wealth from.  So, they have a strong incentive to show that they are the more 'succesful' relative to the competing organizations at the same level of the pyramid.

With 'succes' defined by the informational sphere of the dictatorial system.",1679992294.0,1679992015.0,t3_124c0xu,t1_jdz9jzu,,1,62,0,62,0,0,

Russia thought they were going to overrun Ukraine and take the whole of the Donsek and Luhansk Oblasts by mid-March.

It didn’t happen because Russian generals’ careers are dependant on the army looking strong and so they have told Putin and his cronies why they wanted to hear.

In fact, due to incompetence and corruption the Russian army isn’t very strong, and it hasn’t been for 20-30 years.

Since the Russian generals simply cannot afford to admit what’s happening, and it’s far too late for them to do anything about it, they will keep attacking to desperately look like Russia is winning, until they can’t.

I imagine there’s a lot of vodka being drunk right now.

The Ukrainian Generals have played this very well. They are helping Russia bleed itself out by killing each insufficient Russian attack as it comes.

I think most military leaders would have seen these continuous Russian attacks and thought Russia can’t be so stupid as to do this to themselves without actually having the firepower to overwhelm the  Ukrainian defended, and would have withdrawn more quickly.

Instead, Ukraine has correctly seen Russia is bluffing, and called it out.

Gerasimov hasn't been in charge long, and is likely still in the ""denial"" stage.

Equipment, weapons arrival dates + movement of formations and logistics + weather means that the earliest will be late April, with highest likelihood being in May.  And if certain factors go awry (deliveries, weather), even June.

Keep in mind Ukraine does misinformation, too.  Who remembers last year’s massive, nonstop military talk of “counteroffensive in the south! Counter offensive in the south!” Everywhere you looked, it was “counteroffensive in the south!”—So Russia moved formations from East/Northeast in anticipation—which then allowed Ukraine to pursue the East/Northeast (Kharkiv, Luhansk), leading to the massive rout.  It was all due to that information campaign.  Then Russia was weakened, and Ukraine bought time to get weapons, and then eventually did the counteroffensive in the south.

So the “spring offensive” can similarly be a distraction campaign, in order to prod Russia into doing something, but actually has something else in mind.",False,1680032959.0,t3_124c0xu,t1_je1jwe1,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

> ""Wagner,"" and later ""Redut,"" are secret units of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, created under the control of the military counterintelligence of the FSB and the operational services of the main department of the General Staff. In fact, these are not private military companies. The name PMC is a cover.

> In the world, private military companies are engaged in security activities. And ""Wagner"" and ""Redoubt"" were originally created in order to send illegal mercenaries abroad to perform very dangerous tasks. They are in the black and gray zone and do all the dirty work. However, officially they are not there. And if some difficult situation arises, Russia can immediately get out: ""This is not our army.""

[…]

> Let's just remember one episode. In February 2018, one of the Wagner groups tried to take over the ConocoPhillips refinery, which is owned by American companies. The Americans contacted the Russians several times: ""Is this your army moving forward to capture the object?"" They were officially answered: ""No, it's not us."" “Well, then they are terrorists.” US special operations forces immediately flew in and in a matter of hours defeated the Wagnerites.

> Later it became known that this group was based on the territory of military unit No. 51532 (10th separate special forces brigade of the main department of the General Staff) in Molkino, Krasnodar Territory. They were delivered to the base of the Russian Defense Ministry in Syria by military aircraft, they were given machine guns, cannons, mortars, bombs, ammunition, mines, armored personnel carriers. That is, **they armed and supplied completely at the expense of the state. And they paid through prigozhin. But this money is not his. They were withdrawn from the budget of the Ministry of Defense and other state institutions. That is, these PMCs are fully funded by the state and under state control.**

> But at the same time, these people do not go through the documents as employees of the FSB or the Ministry of Defense, so the state does not bear any responsibility for their death. Well, killed and killed. No pity. After that defeat, for half a year, coffins were sent in batches to Russia so that there would not be a big jump in statistics.

> The same is now in Ukraine. . . 

[…]

> Prigozhin was allowed to steal money from the budget, including through companies that supply food to schools. He was provided with government contracts. And the banks of Moscow were given a verbal order to help Prigozhin's Concord group of companies cash out money at zero interest so that he would have a large amount of cash. We are talking about billions of rubles every month. This process is under the control of the FSB (respectively, at the direction of Putin). If up to ten to twenty percent are taken from everyone for withdrawing money to the black cash, then Prigozhin has unheard-of privileges.

> He pays salaries to mercenaries, including killers, over the past ten years. . . .

While it may be a relatively soft target - compared to what the prepared defenses in  the Zaporizhzhia and Donestk frontline looks like it. The river is a major problem, not as an initial obstacle, but as a constant bottleneck to which supplies will have to be pushed through. The Russians struggled with this, and i'd argue they had a relatively easy way when compared to what any significant Ukrainian amphibious operation will face.   


If the Ukrainians were to attempt this, and lets say that the initial attack is very successful, they break through the defenses and are able to push through deep Russian lines, what then? it would be a race between the Russian units literally rushing to contain the breakthrough, and the Ukrainian army trying to rush logistics across a river - that will likely be under artillery fire anyway - to be able to not only sustain the breakthrough, but to secure it against eventual counter attacks. I'd argue that it would be a hell of a lot easier for the Russians to move the forces necessary to contain any potential amphibious operations from the Ukrainians, then it would be for the Ukrainians to supply said operation.   
Also lets not forget about the dam upstream, the Russians could blow it up dooming any Ukrainian unit that made it across the river to be surrounded, killed or captured.  


I genuinely don't understand why there is even a question, among some people that this is a good idea. There was a lot of hype about the Ukrainians potentially crossing the river during the Kherson counter offensive, and taking the fight all the way to Crimea, and i just couldn't understand in what world those people were living in that they genuinely believed that this was an actual possibility given the enourmous challenges that any nation would face in conducting that type of operation.",False,1680041389.0,t3_124c0xu,t1_je26hf2,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

I guess the main issue seems to be that the old stuff is being valued at the cost of the new stuff. That is understandable from the point of view of ordering new stuff.. but you did not really donate arms worth hundreds of millions as the PR says. 

For example a while ago Estonia announced a 113m € arms package to Ukraine. 

That mainly consists of up to 24x FH-70 howitzers bought from Germany for 7m € and up to 19x D-30 howitzers bought from Finland for 2m €. There was ammunition, support trucks and some Carl Gustav anti-tank weapons in that package as well, but the howitzers clearly are the majority of the package.

To take a quote from wikipedia about how they have been used in the past:

> Behind minefields were the dragon's teeth. They rested on a concrete mat between ten and thirty meters wide, sunk a meter or two into the ground (to prevent any attempt to tunnel underneath them and place explosive charges). On top of the mat were the teeth themselves, truncated pyramids of reinforced concrete about a meter in height in the front row, to two meters high in the back. They were staggered and spaced in such a manner that a tank could not drive through. Interspersed among the teeth were minefields, barbed wire, and pillboxes that were virtually impregnable by the artillery and set in such a way as to give the Germans crossing fire across the entire front. The only way to take those pillboxes was for infantry to get behind them and attack the rear entry. But behind the first row of pillboxes and dragon’s teeth, there was a second, and often a third, and sometimes a fourth.

Assuming that there are indeed the concrete mat + minefields + sunken into the ground + barbed wire + manned protection or artillery + perhaps multiple rows + those things made out of solid concrete?

Yeah, that's going to be very though to get through.

Our MoD has regularly published - granted, they were more transparent with some donations than with others - the numbers of stuff donated and due to Politico’s article, also now published the numbers of some stuff given. But I do believe the deeper issue lies probably in the value of items given vs expenditure of buying new items of similar weaponry. Basically: I think we’ve given some 100 Javelins? So it would make sense for Estonia to want back enough money to buy 100 new Javelins. But the crux seems to be that we’ve given some stuff that was older and worth less, but the government seems to want reimbursement to be the value of the items Estonia would buy now new (and cost more per unit than the old items did). 

On one hand, I can see their reasoning because it’s not like you can get a similar item for the cost of the old one, so if you’d want to keep the costs the same, you’d probably get less of the new weaponry than the numbers you donated away. But at the same time, I’d personally argue that it’s also the risk of donating older weaponry, which cost less/is not available for restocking for the same value.

But the major issue here is how you are going to get all that equipment into Ukraine right now.  Getting a tank, or a plane, or any other piece of large equipment requires that you have a fully functioning way of getting that equipment into the field of battle.

If things were optimal, you'd be able to have a port that can handle a mass offload of equipment, or the ability to send equipment by train car as close as you can to the front, then perform some last-mile transport to a position where they're ready to go.  But that's if things are *optimal*.

Right now, most of Ukraine's southern ports are threatened by a sizeable naval force in Sebastopol, as well as maritime aviation elements from the Russian air force.  The rail from Western Europe doesn't feed directly into Ukraine's rail system, because they're running at two separate gauges of track, and it will take months, if not years, to get the Ukrainian track built up to European standards.   The active warzone means that you (a) can't have huge gatherings of equipment in one place, lest the Russians get smart and drop a ballistic missile on the spot, and (b) you have to be able to guarantee that you have the resources and trucks available so the tanks and IFVs won't have to drive more than necessary to stop wear and tear.

And that's not keeping in mind the fact that the forces that are already in place need to be given food, fuel and ammunition to continue the fight at the front.   Getting the ammunition the artillery needs to sustain constant fire is bad enough.  And then part of your capacity is taken up by ferrying equipment that has broken down, disabled or captures to places where they can be fixed, then brought back to the front.  That's already a lot of things, and then we start adding tanks and IFVs into the mix, not to mention the additional fuel and ammunition, and the support equipment they're going to need to sustain themselves in an active counteroffensive.  And then lets throw in the goods and supplies that the civilian population need to sustain them on top of this already full-to-the-brim system.  This is like trying to get 5 Saint Bernard dogs constantly running in and out of your house through a single cat door, day in and day out.

The Ukrainians and NATO allies are trying to improve the situation as best they can, but the time to have done a lot of those upgrades were before the war started.  They'll get the equipment in as fast as they can, but the firehose is already ready to bust, and they need to make sure this logistical system can handle it before they trip themselves up.",1680016079.0,1680015865.0,t3_124c0xu,t1_je0blye,,2,-1,0,-1,0,0,

As the most competent IFV amongst those pledged/supplied, the Bradley will be critical to fully equipping those mechanised divisions that are beginning to only look 'mechanised' on paper.

IFVs play an extremely vital role for both sides, which is why so many are deployed (and so many have been lost).
The Marder compares well to the BMP1/BMP2, but in terms of overall capability and number available to be sent the Bradley outclasses Marder, Warrior, and the gun IFVs such as the AMX and Stryker. This is bourne out by its combat record.

Tanks are clearly necessary and gratefully received, but the Ukrainians are a lot closer to filling their requirements for heavy armour than they are for advanced precision fires, IFVs or air power. Western tanks focus overwhelmingly on the anti-tank mission (with the possible exception of Challenger 2).

At the moment both sides in the conflict are making use of tanks to plug gaps in other capabilities (indirect fires, protected mine clearance).

---------

Tanks are needed to storm fortified bunkers. But what we have right now is mostly just trench-warfare from a bunch of Russian conscripts.

That's where things like the M2 Bradley's Chaingun can really play. 900-shots of the PABM (programmable airburst munition) will have those 25mm shots explode over trenches, killing those behind cover and even reaching ""inside"" of trenches.

Or the Mk19 Automatic Grenade launcher on the Stryker, which can lob grenades into those trenches with surprising accuracy and speed.

Bradley, Stryker (lighter vehicles with the 25mm gun or grenade launchers) are more important in this kind of anti-trench warfare than a tank.

Tanks also have PABMs, but only 40 shots per battle. Tank rounds are so big that they're not as useful vs enemy infantry as a Bradley or Stryker's smaller gun is. Having hundreds of grenades, or PABMs, ready for the trenches is simply going to be more useful. Anyone can see it based on the current battlefield conditions.

Ukraine also does have certain advantages that the US isn’t used to including fighting on their home turf, higher tolerance for casualties than any post WWII American wars and the ability to utilize local units fighting in their own cities.

Certainly, within that, there is room for corruption or graft, which is why I say this has to be gotten to the bottom of, but broadly speaking, reimbursement for Estonia should be looked at in terms of military capability, not necessarily in terms of dollars and Euros spent.  If this were Spain or Portugal, I'd have a little different attitude about it, since they'll have plenty of time down the road to replenish/get reimbursed for whatever military capability they might sacrifice today for the sake of war effort.  Estonia's military capability can't be sacrificed for a few years though.

No. They selected those tanks as they require the least amount of work to be deployed on the battlefield. Only seals and other rubber parts need to be replaced.

In Armored Brigade, your commands have a random, substantial delay. For example, telling a squad to move to the left 100 meters will be delayed by 1-minute if they're within an HQ-unit's radio range, but can be delayed by as much as 5-minutes if they're far away from radio HQ. As such, your commands are compound: Carefully Advance to location A, Move to location B as quickly as possible, Move into defensive positions against location C.

Mortar fire and Artillery fire has similar delays. If you ask for fire one-at-a-time, they'll only fire one shot every 2 minutes or so (due to the innate delay + the time it takes for the mortar / artillery shell itself to reach its target). If you instead ask ""fire 5 shells"", you'll get all 5 of those shells within the same 2 minutes.

---------

""Scouting"" is also full of incomplete information in Armored Brigade. For example, if your units are ambushed and die... you never get the opportunity to see who attacked them or how they died. They just stop responding and are taken off the map.

So yeah, you can totally move-forward / pause / retreat in Armored Brigade. But its useless, because its not like they'll see / scout the enemy units or get useful information that quickly.

the problem is that you guys come into the comments with the assumption that any sort of criticism means that person loves russia or the GOP or whatever the bad side is(and yes i agree they are both bad lol)

anyway in order, your first question isnt really the own you think it is because if the US is going to be involved, and they are, and their strategy is go all in on helping Ukraine through military means then they should do that. this war started in 2014 and went full scale in 2022 and the US aid is STILL limited. i dont even understand why this is controversial here, do you not think Ukraine needs more tanks? more air defence systems? why is it taking literally years for this to happen? the US either needs to fully commit or not

i would blame both the russian government and the US government for allowing this to escalate and to continue. trump did a better job with regards to ukraine, which is what we are talking about, unless you consider the current situation where thousands have died and cities been destroyed to be better? that does not mean trump is good, it means ukraine was in a better spot during his term. would trump have done a better job if he won the election and was in charge in 2022 and putin invaded? I don't know, i mean thats a hypothetical that seems irrelevant now but ill go with no he wouldnt have done a better job

So in Afghanistan they have a different version of right from wrong.

""Wrong"" for them may be a woman running away from her duties despite her husband's abuse.

""Right"" for them is stoning that woman to death.

The person was raised their entire life to do things ""correctly"", they'd be shunned by friends, family, neighbors, religious leaders everyone if they don't do the ""right"" thing and *isn't* responsible for their actions by stoning the sinful woman to death.",False,1680053063.0,t3_124c0xu,t1_je2qwzc,,2,1,0,1,0,0,
