As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.


**In Ukraine**


👉🆕 A deputy Commander of the Azov Battalion defending Mariupol calls for the operation to break the siege on Mariupol, that it'd go down in history as a heroic feat were it to succeed, and as a great disgrace if it fails

👉🆕 Marianivka and Kolonschina, two villages directly west of Kyiv, have reportedly been liberated according to 2 volunteers of the Territorial Defence Forces, a father and son, who posted a video on social media from one of the villages

👉🆕 Kyiv's Governor, Oleksandr Pavliuk, says Bucha, Hostomel and Vorzel are still occupied by Russian troops despite the hundreds of vehicles withdrawing to Belarus, but that there's plans to dislodge them soon.

The US government is ""confident in"" the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been misinformed by his advisers about their military’s performance in Ukraine, according to a senior State Department official.

“It’s information we’re confident in,” the official said. “I think it’s information that we’re confident in now and it’s also information that probably had a degree of truth to it before the invasion.”

On Wednesday, the US revealed declassified intelligence showing that Putin has been misinformed by his own advisers.

“There’s only so much we can say about where this information is derived from,” the official said, declining to provide additional details on the intelligence. He explained it was necessary to protect sources and methods.

“Putin clearly seems to have thought that he could go into Ukraine, that his forces wouldn’t meet resistance, that they would be greeted warmly including in Russian speaking parts of Ukraine, that he would be able to take Kyiv in a matter of 48, 72 hours,” the official said.
“Every single element that he seems to have believed turns out to be wrong. So, whether his advisers weren’t giving him the full unvarnished truth, whether he wasn’t listening, you know … I think we’ve seen this every step of the way.” 

Speaking on a visit to Morocco, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""One of the Achilles' heels of autocracies is that you don't have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power.

Some excerpts:

> The young woman and her family were among several thousand residents of Mariupol who Ukrainian officials estimate have been forcibly relocated to Russia through separatist-controlled republics in eastern Ukraine. 

>She described being taken to what the Russian army called a “filtration camp” — a vast military tent with rows of men in uniforms calling up civilians one by one. Each “temporarily displaced person,” as the soldiers referred to them, was photographed from all sides and fingerprinted. Then the Ukrainians were told to turn over their phones and passwords to another officer, who entered their data into his computer, including their phone contacts. The next step was interrogation.

>”At all stages of the journey, we were treated like captives or some criminals. I felt like a sack of potatoes tossed around,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns about a relative in Russia. **“You have no will. How can you resist this? Even if you have a chance to escape, everything around is destroyed, and there is nowhere to hide.”**

[…]

> “At every stage of the way, they tell you that you have to be grateful that you are given a sandwich or evacuated somewhere else, that you have been liberated,” she said, adding, “Liberated from what?”

[…]

> The convoy was eventually taken to Taganrog, a Russian port city on the Sea of Azov. Only there were the people from Mariupol told that their final destination would be Vladimir, a town more than 600 miles to the east.

> The woman, however, was able to break away from the group in Taganrog by convincing Russian soldiers that she had a friend nearby who was willing to house her family. She said she refused to sign any documents that would help give her family official status as refugees in Russia. Many of the others in her convoy remained behind, she said.

[…]

> Not long after heading off on her own with her family, the woman said, she saw a local television report about an elderly woman from her Mariupol shelter bound for Vladimir by train and being given an intravenous drip. **The report said that Russian authorities were giving her medical care. “But she needed an IV because they bombed her house, and she and everyone else is denied the right to talk about it directly,” she said.**

[…]

> The young woman said she was taken aback when she discovered that everyday Russians, like those she met as she traveled onward to Moscow, believed these kinds of lies about the war and echoed Kremlin propaganda.

>“It’s terrible to find yourself in some kind of collective dream of people in Russia,” she said. **“I had full confidence that most of the people in Russia did not support the war.

Is Vladimir Putin open to a peace deal he can spin at home as a victory, as a way out of his ruinous invasion of Ukraine? Equities and the rouble have rallied after peace talks seemed to make some progress this week. Moscow said it would “dramatically reduce” combat operations near Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and northern Chernihiv, ostensibly to increase trust. Ukraine has offered military neutrality and a pledge not to join Nato — one of Moscow’s key demands before the war. There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical, however, that any swift end to the conflict is in prospect."" *Editorial board of Financial Times*

Speaking Thursday in Canberra, Australia, GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming said, “it increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation. It’s clear he misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people.”

Fleming said Putin overestimated the abilities of the Russian military to secure a quick victory. 

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers — short of weapons and morale — refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said without specifying when or where this took place.
“Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,” he said.

Fleming also said Britain's National Cyber Security Center has seen “sustained intent from Russia to disrupt Ukrainian government and military systems” and has seen indicators suggesting Russia’s cyber actors are looking for targets in countries that oppose the Kremlin’s actions.

Mercenaries in Ukraine: Fleming said it is “clear” that Russia is using mercenaries and foreign fighters to support its forces — including the Wagner group.

“The group works as a shadow branch of the Russian military, providing implausible deniability for riskier operations,” Fleming said, adding that Wagner is now prepared to send large number of personnel into Ukraine to fight on the Russian side. 

“They are looking at relocating forces from other conflicts and recruiting new fighters to bolster numbers,” he said, “These soldiers are likely to be used as cannon fodder to try to limit Russian military losses.",False,1648708425.0,t3_tsqyoi,t3_tsqyoi,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

You should immediately sit in their car, bring your bag with the essentials, and leave! [F word] That's all that you were supposed to do!... Did you see that their uniform is the same as mine?

[Mother] You simply didn't see how brutally they captured us! You didn't see that!

[Mother, explaining angrily] I was scared to death! My body was shaking for two days after that!

[Son, feeling upset] How was it?

[Mother] Because, they came for us early at 5:30 am, even earlier.

[Son] That was done on purpose - to prevent accusing you of betrayal by locals [F word]. They were supposed to arrest you as a criminal.

[Mother, exhaling] Oh, well... Pass my greetings to all your children. I love them. I love my sons very much [almost crying], but the mother must live here. Let everyone gets me right!

I am no expert but I live in postcomunist country so I could have some insight of the scale of corruption in todays Russia. Here is my explanation:

You are general of Russian army, Your army should have for example 10000 men. You get money from state to maintain army of 10000 men, but in reality You have only 5000 men and pocket the exceed money for Yourself. If there is some kind of control form MD You bribe the man in charge of the control, because You've got lots of money to do so. But in fact You really don't need to bribe the man, because he's is probably an old friend of Yours, and You know a lot of nasty shit he has done, so the control will be alright on the paper. So Ministry of defence is sending money for 10000 men and the control shows, that army has 10000 trained men.

Everething is okay in the time of peace. If there is some kind situation You could not solve with bribes - situation like parades or military manuevers - You hire short term consripts to cover the situation and when it's over, You release them, so You can have Your sweet 5000 men money. It doesn't matter, that maneuvers go shit with untrained conscripts, because You bribe the man who will write the final message for Ministry of defence, and he will write whatever You want. In fact You really don't need to bribe the man, because he's is probably an old friend of Yours and...

In situation like this it's not hard to imagine that not only Putin, but also Shoigu didn't know that large part of men on the manuevers on Ukraine border were untrained conscripts. Generals only did what they allways have done - they cover missing personel with short term conscripts, as they didn't know this time is different...

Russian President Vladimir Putin told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi that conditions were not yet in place for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Draghi told a news conference on Thursday when asked about a telephone call with Putin the previous day.

Draghi also said that Putin told him that current gas contracts remained in force and that European firms will continue to pay in euros and dollars, rather than in roubles.

Britain has issued further sanctions against 12 Russian citizens and two media entities, it was announced on Thursday.

The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that it is targeting ""Russian propagandists and state media who spread lies and deceit about Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine.""

The latest people sanctioned include famous Russian TV anchor Sergey Brilev and head of Sputnik International Broadcasting, Anton Anisimov.

Brilev, who is also the deputy director of state-owned Rossiya media, is accused by the UK government of actively engaging in ""propagating the Kremlin's disinformation about Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" Brilev had previously lived in the UK and will no longer be able to access any of his UK assets or continue business dealings, the government said.

The managing director of the Russian broadcast company RT, Alexey Nikolov, and CEO of Gazprom-Media Holding Aleksandr Zharov were also sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans.

The sanctions also target the media houses Rossiya Segodnya and RT-owner TV-Novosti.

Putin's war on Ukraine is based on a torrent of lies. Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin's fake news and narratives,"" Truss said Thursday.

""We will keep on going with more sanctions to ramp up the pressure on Russia and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table,"" she added.

>	Earlier this month I published my translation of her first post-war report, in which she talked to multiple senior Russian officials and found them in a state of shock and bewilderment at Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

>	This is the follow-up. Farida again talked to over a dozen elite Russians, including some with access to Putin, to see whether things have changed over the last month. They have.

>	For those of us who have hoped that Western sanctions would make a difference, it’s a difficult and disappointing read. But, I believe, a necessary one.

👉🆕 Mariupol defenders claim that they destroyed 3 tanks and killed 64 infantry yesterday, including a GRU ""Swat team"", showing pictures of trophies on social media. One Russian soldier was apparently carrying looted gold and dollars

👉🆕 A Ukrainian recon sniper of an airborne brigade reportedly shot a Russian ""Lynx"" armoured vehicle in the Mykolaiv Oblast, stopping it, and then captured a Russian officer

From CNN's Ellie Kaufman

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that ""half a dozen” shipments of security assistance for Ukraine has already “flowed into the region” from the $800 million package US President Joe Biden signed on March 16, during a briefing on Thursday.

“Those shipments are already arriving, in fact from the time he signed the order to the first shipment going on its way was like four days Jen, and there’s already been a half a dozen shipments that have flowed into the region,” Kirby said.

“I can tell you that things aren’t sitting long at these intermediate staging shipment sites before they’re getting picked up by convoys and getting taken into Ukraine, so four days is pretty quick,” he added.

Kirby estimated it will likely take “a couple of weeks” to complete shipments from the $800 million package.

“We don’t think it’s going to take very long to complete the $800 dollar package, getting it all filled out, we really don’t think that’s going to take long at all, couple of weeks probably,” he said.

The shipments are not all solely weapons. They are a mixture of “weapons systems” and then “support and sustainment items” which includes “food, body armor, helmets small arms and ammunition, medical and first aid kits,” Kirby said.

Some weapons systems, like Javelins and Stingers, have been in these first few packages to Ukraine, Kirby added.

Currently it's being artificially propped up by the Central Bank of Russia which means the CBR is steadily munching its way through their foreign currency reserves, plus possibly also their gold and whatever else they have that isn't nailed down etc to buy their currency. They can't do this indefinitely - sooner or later they'll run out of cash, true they could print more but without meaningful economic growth or access to overseas markets that will lead to hyper-inflation (see Germany in the early 1920s for what will happen). Remember Russia is shut off from using Swift so they can't sell reserves to the west and they have bond payments to make as well. 

What Putin has also done is to force exporters, especially commodity exporters like oil, to convert into roubles 80% of the foreign currency they receive on export sales. If they are receiving roubles as 100% payment that's not such a problem, however in many cases they aren't - so they will be forced to use the money they receive plus any of their own reserves to buy roubles to keep the Russian economy from tanking. How generous of them. The only snag here is that some rare metals, palladium for example, are controlled by Russia. This could have knock on effects across the globe, or at least anywhere that needs palladium, like car manufacturers. 

The good news is that Germany and other importers have told him to sod off, as per their contracts they are going to pay in whatever currency is stipulated, why should they buy roubles to prop up Putin? Speaking of whom, he is threatening to stop exports of oil etc if they don't comply although if he does that he'll be receiving even less money, who knows whether he'll carry out this threat, he's done some crazy stuff already so don't bet against it. Germany has said it'll go onto rationing if necessary but that will have a severe effect on their economy. 

Normally if you were Russia you would want payment in Euros and Dollars - they are strong currencies and underpin the rouble, but these aren't normal times and short term factors are driving their actions. 

Putin also seems to have some mad idea about replacing the US$ as the reserve currency for commodity trading - especially for oil and that China will join up with them in this scheme. In your dreams.  For one thing China holds a lot of US$ debt - about $1.1 trillion's worth and the Yuan is tied to the US$. I doubt that they are going to risk devaluing their Dollar reserves and peg the Yuan to the rouble instead to effectively save Putin's arse. Even if they did China would still need to import/export a lot of stuff to and from the US -it is the world's largest economy after all and they cannot afford to have a fluctuating currency so it needs the stability that pegging the Yuan to the US$ brings.",False,1648764070.0,t3_tsqyoi,t3_tsqyoi,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

* Gazprombank opens a ruble account AND a dollar/euro account for each foreign buyer of gas

* From there Gazprombank transfers rubles to the gas supplier

Look at the map in the video.  Mariupol is the blue patch on the coast on the bottom right.  

You can see a big white circle to the west of it, surrounded by Russian control but not in Russian control.  There is a narrow band of Russian control north of it, then another big blob of white where Russia does not control.

That strip of Russian control between the two white areas is the H-09 highway.  It is the only place in that area where there are sufficient roads for Russia to supply its forces.

If you watch the video you can see the blue advance into the white area north of the H-08 highway.  That is where the UA army is going to strike.  It is avoiding the main thrusts of the RA and moving to cut off the highway.  

It can then move through uncontrolled area to the coast and cut off that highway.  That would cut off the RA in Mariupol from the west.  

This is not an easy thing to do.  There are few roads in that area.  The RA is not there because it cannot supply into that area.  But that also means the UA would be moving cross country without supply lines.  They could be cut off just like they are trying to cutoff the Russians.

> In times of war, the United States’ most reputable journalists and media outlets have a long history of tilting toward military action. Just last year, mainstream news outlets subjected the Biden administration to a torrent of criticism over the widely popular decision to withdraw from Afghanistan—a wise move given two decades of failure to create a stable Afghan democracy and the need to rebalance U.S. military capabilities toward competition in Asia. Although coverage of the Trump presidency was broadly negative, then-U.S. President Donald Trump received fawning praise after he launched a strategically pointless missile strike on Syria in 2017.
> 
> Former U.S. President Barack Obama received wide support in the media for his decision to establish a no-fly zone during the First Libyan Civil War (which he would remember as the “worst mistake” of his presidency), and attracted significant criticism for subsequently avoiding intervention in Syria (likely informed by the disastrous consequences of the Libya intervention). And who can forget news outlets across the political spectrum that failed to challenge the George W. Bush administration’s shaky justifications for the Iraq War? One study found that over a three week period prior to the invasion, 64 percent of guests appearing on network and cable news programs supported the war, whereas only 10 percent were opposed.

Let’s goddamn do it this time. Instead of random “analysts” and other figures telling Ukraine what it needs and what it doesn’t, let’s listen to what the people actually fighting and beating Russia have to say about they require and what they don’t.

They have needed these craft for three weeks, and they could already have been seeing them in service now. This could have saved thousands of people’s lives, and have significant political implications for Putin and Russia.

Some choice quotes and excerpts:

> “Since they adopted sanctions against us, we’re going to fuck them. Now they’ll have to buy rubles on the Moscow Exchange to buy gas from us. But that's just the beginning. Now we're going to fuck them all.” 

>So tells me, with enthusiasm, a high-ranking Russian official. **He has long been a member of Putin's team, but has been considered a liberal thinker. A month ago he had a different attitude, saying with some chagrin that the most important thing was to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine, and then to figure out how to live in the new reality.**

[…]

> **The possible conclusion of a peace treaty is unlikely to change the mood of the Russian elites. ""We’ve passed the point of no return,” says a source close to the Kremlin.** “Everyone understands that there will be peace, but that this peace won't return the life we had before.”

>**Russian society, my sources tell me, has also rallied in support of Putin's actions under the pressure of propaganda and under the consequences of sanctions.** In a situation where, as it seems to them, the whole world is against Russia, its citizens ""will hate the West and consolidate.”

[…]

> “In the early days, we were losing the information war,” says a high-ranking source within a regional government. “The people had negative feelings [about the war]. There was a sharp 50/50 split in society. But then all the [state media] got together and started releasing decent content. **And then, when they [in the West] began to say that all Russians are bad, to boycott artists and athletes, everything changed. Now about 75 percent support the military operation.** That is, there’s a social consolidation happening. Calls against the war are not at all popular, it’s more of a marginal story now.”

>Gubernatorial elections are to be held in that region this year, which means that the authorities are constantly measuring public sentiment. **According to this source, the position of “let’s end this” no longer exists — people want to end it, “but on our terms.”**

[…]

> “After the Great Patriotic War [World War 2], our country immediately began to dust itself off and rebuild. And after 30 years, the country was back to normal. **These people [in the West] don't understand who they’re messed with. This causes a sharp reaction even among those who thought differently and asked questions [of the authorities]. Now they won’t ask questions for a long time. They will hate the West and consolidate in order to live their lives, especially middle-aged people. This is a very subtle thing that the West does not understand at all,”** said one of my high-ranking acquaintances excitedly, adding that he felt a couple of decades younger.

[…]

> ""When I saw what they were doing to those poor Paralympians, that was it for me... I don't care about iPhones, I can use a Chinese phone. I have a German car — let me drive a Chinese or Russian one instead. **Now I understand that the boss is right, that this whole thing had to happen one way or another. They would have imposed these sanctions anyway,""** says a high-ranking civil servant, who a month ago was saying that Russia’s imperial ambitions should be manifested in other ways, such as by growing a strong economy.

[…]

>**According to several people on different levels of power, the personal sanctions have done Putin a big favor, having helped him accomplish what he had failed to do for many years:  to turn the Russian elites into a near monolith.**

[…]

> Many older people are enthusiastic and feel an opportunity to make money and to start over, just like in the 90s. **“They think we're dumb? We're not dumb. We're Russians. It’s nothing. Now we'll mobilize, we'll work. Wait until the chickens are counted in the fall, as they say,”** says one of these people in the management of a sanctioned state company.

[…]

> The most frustrated are the 35-40-year-olds who have lost most of their recent accomplishments. **Some feel abandoned and feel resentful of their fellow citizens who have left the country and who, in their opinion, are trying to teach them from abroad how to live and how to overthrow the regime.** “I want to tell them: just shut up,” says one of my youngest sources, who is on the front lines of the state's struggle with the consequences of Western sanctions. 

[…]

> Those who manage to talk to Putin complain that he himself speaks earnestly, but does not particularly listen to what he is told, says a person who has spoken to the President within the past month. They speculate that Putin needs the peace talks in order to stall, since he still believes in the military, which says he can tear the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the Azov Sea coast from Ukraine.

> Who could change Putin's mind? **It's useless and pointless – roughly is the answer of all the people I spoke to,** when asked if the part of the Russian elite that disagrees with Putin's actions against Ukraine is trying to unite and influence him. 

>**“No one can demand anything. They can have a chat, but it's no use. He has a clear picture in his head that he is rubbing in everyone’s head.** “We wanted to be friends, they declared us their enemies, they surrounded us from all sides, they were ready to accept Ukraine into NATO and deploy missiles. They provoked us and there was no other way out,” explains a person familiar with the details of the negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine, adding that there is became objectively problematic to reach out to Putin. **His circle of contacts is as narrow as possible, even Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the head of the General Staff, Valeriy Gerasimov, aren’t let get close to him. And Putin has long had no desire to actively listen to anyone else’s views.**

Low Russian morale has been of essence to the Ukrainian side winning the war thus far, but that could change very soon.

Crimea is easily defensible by Russia and the majority there seems to support Russia, so Ukraine would be the ones facing a hostile population. Ukraine has been doing a great job at defending, but attacking takes way more force than defending and attacking a place like Crimea would be hard even for a superior attacker, this is without even taking in count the local population there.

From what I have been able to investigate, it seems the only way for Ukraine to gain Crimea is either a Russian collapse where Russia just splits into different countries or a WW3 with NATO where Russia is forced to give up Crimea as part of the terms. And the crazy part is, that even in those scenarios it seems Ukraine would have a hard time occupying Crimea again, they could do it, but even then it would be hard.",False,1648700532.0,t3_tsqyoi,t3_tsqyoi,,0,-2,0,-2,0,0,

Really? You think it would work that fast…? The tweet was made by a news site that provided no sourcing and is a site 95% of y’all didn’t know existed before the war a few weeks ago. Today we have some folks who linked a thread by a nuclear scientist who says this is highly improbable and she also lined a thread about their being no sources for this. And, people in here still believe it 100%. 

My absolute favorite though was when so many people really truly believed in their heart that Russia sent a large warship right up to shore where they knew enemies were, to chase some tiny speedboats (as if they can’t kill speedboats with missiles, cannon fire, drones, etc all from far away), and then the large ship was sunk by (famously inaccurate) MLRS fire. And despite this all having happened close to shore, no one could see it (like..it would be sinking next to shore…). All bc we had a video that was pitch black, heard MLRS fire, and saw some fire in the distance. It could have been in a field. The video was tweeted by a random person who said it was Odessa and a ship, with no geolocation. I got downvoted to shit after saying there was no way, and this was fiction. Then it turned out to not be true and meanwhile experts were LOLing that anyone believed it. 

Between Russians hilariously bad performance and a lot of commenters on here, it’s been good times every day.

The Russian forces there are getting ready to do a WW2 style pincer attack and given the numbers on their side combined with as much AirPower and artillery as they can muster I don’t Ukraine will be able to hold.

The EU had set up a budget of one billion euros, from which the member states can finance arms deliveries to Ukraine. So far, however, Germany has probably not yet used the EU pot.

In addition to a lot of protective material, there is also heavy war equipment such as mortars or heavy machine cannons of the type GAM B01 from the manufacturer Rheinmetall. According to the manufacturer's offer, the heavy weapon should cost a good one million euros per piece. But the six machine guns are more or less immediately available and do not require much training.

Plenty of high-tech material is also listed. Thales , for example, is offering to supply ""Squire"" ground radar systems. Thales also offers twelve mortars attached to trailers, according to the manufacturer these could be delivered to Ukraine as early as this week. It would also be possible to deliver thousands of night vision devices, protective vests, helmets - but also modern drones for monitoring the battlefield.

The government in Kyiv must now decide which weapons Ukraine wants. A few days ago, the Federal Government, through Economics Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock , made it clear that the Federal Security Council would very quickly give the green light for further deliveries. In the meantime, the committee, which meets in secret, no longer has to meet, instead individual deliveries can be approved in the circulation process.",False,1648710330.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2tdnv6,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Bill Browder, one of the west's leading experts on Russian corruption, estimates that an **absolutely staggering 80% of military budgets are stolen:**

> Bill Browder points to a third explanation: corruption. “My estimate,” he says, “is that 80% of the military budget is stolen by Russia’s generals, because 80% of all budgets in Russia are stolen by the officials in charge.”

>The army has been “gutted by all this corruption.” Money meant to pay soldiers has been stolen. The grunts, Mr. Browder says, survive by selling gasoline from the tanks they drive. And that was before the war in Ukraine.

It also means that there is *right now* an opportunity to apply significant pressure both on and off the battlefield to weaken that regime and actually allow for a real change.

A complete loss in Ukraine would greatly facilitate in breaking his hold over Russia.

If Russia is allowed to rebuild and fix these issues, they *will* start another war, and it will not go so poorly for Russia next time.

The only way to stop that is bigger and better weapons in Ukraine securing infrastructure and restoring their previous borders.

,tsqyoi,i2uc5el,"Sure, but the sanctions ensure Russia losses far more than Ukraine, soooo it's a nice dream, but you get exactly the opposite of what you wanted out of it.

The real question is how did Russia underpredict the damage of sanctions so severely and the answer has to be that they never thought Europe would go through with it.

The world could have stepped aside and let Russia take Ukraine, but the sanctions would still ruin them. The war in Ukraine should not be the main concern vs what will be trillions of dollars lost over decades. 

Ukraine will now get even better buildings and infrastructure as nternational support and charity roll in. They will probably join the EU and perhaps also NATO. Russia will stay sanctioned unless they pull out and pay reparations, which they won't and Russia military looks like a joke. More border countries to Russia are also likely to join NATO.

The only goal achieved here for Russia is by driving up energy and wheat prices they can fuel radicals worldwide to blame the existing leadership of nations, but realistically that's not much of a plan and they can't know how it will work out with enough certainty to ever make that a good deal. Plus even with far right people in power they would turn on Putin for their own quests of power because citizens of those countries are fairly happy to hate Russia for an extended time. The energy and food shortages will decline as Russia is replaced and then Russia is just left being the big country with a crap economy falling behind faster than ever and with a military everybody thinks is a joke.

You could ALMOST not do any worse than that. It's very likely fossil fuel prices will crash in about 10-20 years as speculation starts to work in the opposite direction they are used to, similarly to what happened when shale oil was introduced to the market and oil rich nations lost a ton of long term wealth. 

By forcing the world to develop more oil it puts the oil exporters closer to an oil price war, which only gets worse as oil demand starts getting seriously offset by electric vehicles. It only takes a small disturbance in supply and demand to start driving the price of oil down, so ALL those nations time are limited.

Russia will lose it's best chance to make money over the next 20 years and IF sanctions get lifted that fast they will be left selling their best commodities at lower prices than ever. THIS is why you don't base your economy on fossil fuels, especially now as they are being phased out.",1648732441.0,1648731749.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2u4q6o,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia is dependent on roads for movement and supply.  The attacks are just to the east of Hulialaipole which is under UA control.  Directly south of that Hulialaipole is Polohy which is under RA control.  And there is a major road connecting them.

Just south of Polohy is the H-08 major highway that runs NW to SE.

My bet is that UA is moving through the territory east of Hulialaipole which has no major roads.  Russia probably has few to no troops in the area as they would have difficulty moving and supplying there.  

If the UA can move through the area they can attack and cut off the H-08 between Polohy and Mariupol.  That could be a major blow to RA resupply in the area.  And UA does not need to take the highway, just be able to shoot vehicles on it.

If you look at this post with a detailed view of where Russian forces actually are along the roads, the UA army is heading directly towards a thin band of Russian control.

I-131 has a half-life of 8 days.  Which means, yeah, it's VERY highly radioactive.  But also means that fuel that stopped chain-reacting 36 years ago (ie. stuff that's outside the building, and buried in the soil) is not likely emitting new I-131.

What they're probably getting is high doses of Cs-137 and Sr-90.  These have a half-life of around 30 years. (so there's still a good amount in the soil outside after 36 years - that area will not be ""safe"" for another 50-60 years).

Cs-137 will emit inside the body and cause health issues, (including ARS if exposure is high), and there isn't much that can be done, except high doses of ""Prussian Blue"" (a dark-blue die that chemically binds to Cesium, and helps the body to purge it).  

Sr-90 will emit inside the body: and it acts like Calcium (chemically similar) so it will absorb into the bones and nerves causing leukemia, bone cancer, and nerve and brain damage. There's not much you can do, medically to stop or treat this.  High doses will basically kill your immune system by destroying the bone marrow, which you can replace with a transplant procedure: but the transplanted marrow will also be degraded by the radiation.

Reprendre ou non Kherson, seule ville passée sous contrôle russe : le dilemme du pouvoir ukrainien

Des manifestants ukrainiens scandent « Rentrez chez vous » en direction de véhicules militaires russes, à Kherson (Ukraine), le 20 mars 2022. HANDOUT / VIA REUTERS
Après un barrage vite passé, les premiers kilomètres de l’autoroute M14, qui relie Mykolaïv, le verrou barrant l’accès à Odessa, à Kherson, la seule ville ukrainienne passée sous contrôle russe, laissent peu de place au doute. Ce bout de territoire ukrainien soustrait par les soldats de Moscou à la souveraineté du pays n’est qu’à 70 kilomètres de Mykolaïv, mais l’espace entre les deux cités constitue un monde en soi, à mi-chemin entre la ligne de front et le no man’s land. Les villages qui se trouvent là craignent à tout moment que le feu des armes s’abatte sur eux. Alors que les forces ukrainiennes de la région ont repoussé l’armée russe vers Kherson, la question de la reprise de la ville ne semble pourtant pas une évidence.

Celle-ci, tout d’abord, n’est pas totalement coupée du monde. Des gens en sortent, même s’ils sont peu nombreux. Ils n’empruntent pas l’ex-voie rapide. Ils doivent trouver leur chemin par les petites routes, passant de village en village, où ils tombent parfois sur les traces de combats. L’autoroute est trop exposée aux tirs et souvent bloquée par des défenses antichars. « Vingt à trente personnes de Kherson, souvent à bord de voitures privées, arrivent ces temps-ci, chaque jour, dans nos locaux. Mais tous ceux qui quittent la ville ne viennent pas forcément chez nous », explique Andrii Skorokhod, responsable de la Croix-Rouge à Mykolaïv.

They didn’t need to die in Ukraine. There’s no point to it. They aren’t defending Russia, they’re defending a short, fragile man’s ego - and they died horribly, their life amounting to no more than pain for others and an undignified death. At best, they can serve as a warning to others to go no further.

However, some of his analysis is a bit silly. For example, these people aren't literally dying in hours, they are potentially experiencing mild symptoms after a month of exposure. So really, the dose required to see something like this should be about 0.5 sievert, not 5 sievert. Assuming the 10 microsieverts per hour as he cites, reaching 0.5 sieverts would take about 5.7 years which is still far more than a month, but only a tenth of the 57 years. And that is only the radiation from being around in the most dangerous spots, not when you have radioactive material directly on your skin, inhaled, and probably also eaten. There are apparently old trees and other such things that would have absorbed larger amounts of the fallout and could therefore cause a higher dose than 10 microsieverts per hour. Considering that, I would say that any soldiers experiencing radiation poisoning with immediate symptoms is unlikely, but certainly not impossible.

It is also possible that some of these troops interacted with some other materials, not just the fallout in the nearby environment. There are claims that Russia has taken radioactive material from Chernobyl for whatever reason, and if these soldiers were among those handling the material, who knows what sort of doses they may have got from that.

Edit: Wait, I am seeing Wikipedia (sourced to a book, don't know if credible) claim that the Red forest could have radiation as as high 1 röntgen per hour? That would put the dose into the 10 millisievert per hour range, not microsievert per hour. Literally a thousand times more. At even just 1 millisievert per hour, you would reach 0.5 sieverts in about 21 days. Having rates in the millisievert per hour would be in the right order of magnitude for seeing radiation poisoning effects in a month. The radiation in the general area near Chernobyl might be 10 microsieverts or less, which would be fairly safe, but if the Red Forest really has exposures in the millisievert per hour range, that certainly could make sick anyone stupid enough to go digging around there for a month.",1648724929.0,1648722784.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2tu4gf,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

France is currently holding the European Union presidency, so it's kind of Macron's responsibility to talk to Putin - something that still needs to happen despite the war. I doubt he enjoys it much. I can't imagine anyone enjoying a chat with that soulless void mascarading as a human being.  

 If nothing else, these talks are at least  a good opportunity to gather intelligence (every intelligence agency has whole teams of people dedicated to analyze every word and every gesture of that kind of talk). Moreover, it's important to maintain contact because Russia and the West are also engaged in a propaganda war where each party tries to paint itself as the reasonnable one, and the other one as ""unwilling to talk"". That's why the gesture itself is useful - we can't give Putin ammo to fuel his absurd ""the West is making me do this"" narrative (a narrative which is surprisingly popular in many countries in Asia and Africa, unfortunately).

Our economy appears great because the Fed has allowed the money printer to go brrr non-stop since Covid. But now inflation is at highs not seen since the 70s/80s.

Fianical institutions are wildly overleveraged thanks to near 0% rates. Everything in the US right now is a house of cards just waiting to come crashing down in something that will look as bad if not worse than the 2008 crash.

**Ukraine's also deeply lucky**. Each of these 4 cities became breakwaters against the Russian advance, providing fortified logistical hubs that linked together acted in tandem to withstand the idiots.

Back in 78, a communist government took over afganistan with the backing of the Soviet union. This government was heavily disliked by the people due to its repressive nature towards political opposition members and religious authorities. A group known as the mujahideen (roughly translates as freedom fighters) formed to overthrow them. This group was heavily supported by the United States through neighboring Pakistan who also had interests in keeping afganistan out of the soviets sphere of influence.

 Eventually the soviets invaded afganistan to support the communist regime. However, due to American support and the mujahideen's effective guerilla tactics, the soviets left in 89 and the communist government in Kabul fell in 1992. 

the mujahideen formed a new government but large amounts of factional in fighting lead to a new civil war. In 1994 the Taliban was formed by groups of Islamic school students funded by Pakistan. In 1996 they took Kabul and founded the Islamic emirate of afganistan.

 Those forces opposed to the Taliban, the former mujahideen and government forces, formed the northern alliance to oppose the Taliban. This group was funded by the United States, with Pakistan supporting the Taliban. The northern alliance never really controlled much of the country, and was relegated to more defensible northern regions of afganistan (hence the name).

This lasted until 2001 when the United States invaded afganistan and overthrew the Taliban, the official reason being to oust al-aqada from afganistan, to capture/kill Osama bin laden, and to punish the Taliban for supporting them.

 >The Battle of Remagen was a battle of the Allied invasion of Germany in World War II. The 18-day battle from 7 to 25 March 1945 is significant because the Allies unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine intact. They were able to hold it against German opposition and build further temporary crossings in relative safety. The presence of a bridgehead across the Rhine advanced by three weeks the Western Allies' planned crossing of the Rhine into the German interior.

But they have at least realized the magnitude of their error and are moving about as quickly as possible to fix it.

There's reports that they've got at least 3 ship-based terminals (FRSU's) under contract and are hoping to have them in place for next winter. They won't match the capacity of major on-shore terminals, but they're about the only thing that you can potentially get up and running on the timeline.

They're also going ahead with multiple actual LNG terminals (will take time to build - typical is 3-5 years - maybe they can do it faster, but it won't be for next winter), and it looks like they've signed a long-term contract with Qatar for significant LNG imports.

——

FRANKFURT, March 30 (Reuters) - Germany has activated the first stage of an emergency plan to manage gas supplies in Europe's largest economy in preparation for a possible disruption or halt in natural gas supplies from Russia. read more

Russia accounted for 55% of Germany's gas imports in 2021 and 40% in the first quarter of 2022.

Economy Minister Robert Habeck has said Germany will not achieve full independence from Russian supplies before mid-2024.

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

Moscow said last week it would draw up a mechanism by March 31 under which so-called ""unfriendly"" countries - those behind sanctions imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine - would pay for gas in roubles. That includes Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse, and other European allies.

Most now pay in euros or dollars.

Habeck, who is the minister responsible for Germany's energy security, has rejected Russia's demand, saying contracts would be honoured under current terms.

Russia's biggest German customers are Uniper (UN01.DE), RWE (RWEG.DE) and EnBW's (EBKG.DE) VNG (VNG.UL), which all have long-term gas supply contracts. They have not commented on individual preparations for any disruption.

WHAT IS GERMANY'S GAS PLAN?

Berlin's ""Emergency Plan Gas"" has three crisis levels.

The first level, which the government has triggered, is the early warning, when there are signs a supply emergency could develop. The second is alarm, when a disruption to supply or extraordinarily high demand upsets the usual balance but can still be corrected without intervention.

The third level is emergency, when market-based measures have failed to remedy shortages. At this stage, Germany's network regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, must decide how to distribute any remaining gas supplies across the country.

WHO IS AFFECTED FIRST?

If Germany does not secure enough gas, industry, which accounts for a quarter of German gas demand, will be hit first.

""This means that industrial production gets lost, that supply chains get lost,"" Leonhard Birnbaum, chief executive of German energy group E.ON (EONGn.DE), told public broadcaster ARD. ""We are certainly talking about very heavy damages.""

Private households will have priority over industry, while hospitals, care facilities and other public sector institutions with special needs would be last to be affected by a disruption.

Electricity utilities that accounted for 13% of gas consumption last year could in theory switch to coal burning plants within their portfolios. However, an ongoing coal exit programme might have to be changed under the emergency laws to ensure enough capacity is ready.

Apart from energy providers, the industries most worried about losing gas, include chemicals, where gas is used for making everything from plastics and fertiliser to fibres and solvents. In turn, carmakers depend on chemical products for products such as batteries and laquer.

F35 is too expensive to run for a general destruction vs Russian Army.

A10 is just a 30mm auto-cannon on an airplane. Its a very cheap design to run. After the AA is disabled, A10 would be superior over F35 (better loiter time, more storage for 30mm ammunition, etc. etc.)

The main problem, is that ""after F35"" has done its job, the AC-130 angel-of-death is far superior to the A10 when it comes to blowing shit up. AC-130 may be slower and more of a sitting duck than the A10, but a flying 105mm howitzer is far more powerful than a flying 30mm autocannon.

So the F35 is superior to the A10 during contested airspace (F35 stealth should prevent enemy missiles from killing it, at least in theory). AC-130 is superior with air-cover. AC-130 just carries bigger guns and more ammo, and has **hours** of loiter time.

------

US Army still likes the A10 though. I think there's a need for a 30mm cannon on a 500mph-class airplane. F35 has a smaller cannon and less ammunition (all that ""stealth"" technology takes up precious room). AC-130 flies much slower, so it takes longer to respond to calls than an A10.",1648748529.0,1648748347.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2vao29,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >A reserve currency (or anchor currency) is a foreign currency that is held in significant quantities by central banks or other monetary authorities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. The reserve currency can be used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard currency or safe-haven currency. The United Kingdom's pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.

Tanks traveling long distances in the mud end poorly. You don't want to gun the engine and are more likely to have a lot of ""hurry up and wait"" that leads to needing to dig out a tank and so forth.

Tanks traveling comparatively short distances during a battle in the mod, not significantly worse than on hard dirt. Yes, some will get stuck but some will also break down and so forth. And treads are a LOT better for mud than tires.

&#x200B;

We just more or less say/believe  ""tanks don't work in muddy seasons"" because we are thinking WW2 where dirt roads were still very common and it would be long trips through mud. Now? Just about everything is paved and you likely only go offroad to get around an obstacle or for the actual approach to a battle. So it isn't GOOD to be muddy, but it isn't THAT bad either.

Of course, what people ALSO forgot is that when you have an army of farmers with AT weapons, those roads are a REALLY good place to get blasted. But that would be true regardless of the weather.

Keep in mind that it wasn't long ago when India was completely reliant on Russian arms, and it's already gone down a lot:

[https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/fs\_2103\_at\_2020.pdf](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/fs_2103_at_2020.pdf)

*The overall decrease in Russia’s arms exports between 2011–15 and 2016–20 was almost entirely attributable to a 53 per cent drop in its arms exports to India.” This reduction has brought down “its \[Russian\] share of total Indian arms imports from 70 to 49 per cent.”*

I wouldn't say India needs to court the west though. They will court each other since the west wants to sell India increasingly more advanced defense systems to protect against China.

Russian oil? Yes, India will buy a lot of discounted crude. What we will see is a rebalancing of Russian hydrocarbons from Europe to Asia, and probably middle east hydrocarbons from Asia to Europe. Unfortunately, there is probably no other way to do this without causing a world wide recession. The world economy is still too carbon intensive atm.

India has claimed non-alignment from the cold war days. India has also frequently gone against US sanctions - Iran most recently comes to mind. India is also not just pursuing friendly relations with Russia to balance Pakistan/China - it is also pursuing friendly relations with the US and the West to balance Pakistan/China. The problem is that while the US sees China as an adversary, they have mixed views on Pakistan and are mostly seen as an ally. This complicates matters for India - even aside from the military/agriculture dependence on Russia. Its like asking your girlfriend to leave her toxic other lover and go exclusive with you - even as you court another woman.

So I can see why the US says - us or them....but India has not demanded this in interactions with the US in the past - no demands to break off relations with Pakistan etc. So, the reverse demands seem unreasonable. Additionally, there is a sense in India that Russia supported us when things were not good and even though what they're now doing is wrong, this is the time to support an old friend. Much before this conflict - almost a decade ago, former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (so not even current regime) visited Moscow and said ""[Russia has stood by India at moments of great international challenge, when our own resources were limited, and our friends were few. Beyond all the assistance that we have received, it is this last fact that Indians will never forget](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-will-never-forget-russias-friendship-pm-manmohan-singh-538430)""

India is also, in general, not a big one for trade sanctions unless the relationship is irrevocably damaged like with Pakistan - we were trading heavily with China even as we were fighting them in Ladakh.

I'm not trying to justify Russia's invasion - just providing context for India's dilemna. Although, purely from a transactional perspective, India needs to think beyond Russia at this time since they are going to be more and more dependent on China and that is our real threat in the region.",1648735709.0,1648735045.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2ugn1j,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

The shipping is only one problem. First off, shipping as much as a pipeline can transport is really hard and much more costly. There is a second problem which many are forgetting though. The gas the US delivers is not the same kind of gas as Europe uses/Russia delivers. So it needs to be converted. Most contries do not have enough facilities to convert the amount that is needed to substitute all that is needed. Building such facilities takes at least 2 years. Right now, only Spain has enough facilities but Spain has no pipeline to other European countries. That by itself also costs a few years at least.

 >Charismatic authority is a concept of leadership developed by the German sociologist Max Weber. It involves a type of organization or a type of leadership in which authority derives from the charisma of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: legal authority and traditional authority. Each of the three types forms part of Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority.

Russia currently has about 6000 nukes. These are a combination of tactical ""suitcase"" nukes as well as strategic nuclear weapons mounted on ICBMs. On top of that, not all these nukes are deployed! ~1500 nuclear weapons are deployed, [with ~1000 in reserve](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-invasion-what-nuclear-weapons-does-russia-possess-and-what-might-it-use-them-for-12554087) and then an additional ~2000 are reserved as low-yield ""tactical"" nukes (that means about 1500 are probably undergoing maintenance). So ""really"" there are only 2500 nukes, assuming all deployed nukes are strategic nukes (which is likely an overestimate, but it's hard to find good data here - and again, worst-case).

If the button gets hit, not all these nukes will launch or detonate properly. Current stats have shown a 25-60% failure rate of Russian conventional missiles. If we assume that those stats hold and Russia has 2500 active ICBMs with a 25% failure rate, then that's only 1875 nuclear explosions. (Note that Russia will fire fewer than 2500 rockets as multiple nuclear warheads can be launched on one missile.)

The issue is that Russia has more than 2500 targets. They have to hit every nuke site in the West to prevent a counterattack (as best as they can). They also have to hit every military base, every airport, and every major population center. And as scary as these nukes are... they aren't all Tsar Bomba.

As per my source above, the strategic nukes pointed at you and me have about 300-800 kiloton yields. This is very large... [but only like, 26 kilometers (16 miles) large.](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=800&lat=34.0453902&lng=-118.2525158&hob_opt=2&hob_psi=5&hob_ft=5545&ff=50&psi=20,5,1&therm=_3rd-100,_3rd-50,_2nd-50,_1st-50,_noharm-100&zm=12)

If you're within 11 km you're basically 100% dead; if you're within 11-12 km you have a 50% chance of being dead; and then from 12 km to 26 km you'll be badly wounded but you might survive (maybe). Most suburbs will be totally fine, as long as you're sufficiently far away from the nearest major city.

[Looking at this map of targets is scary, but less so when you realize that the circles/triangles are much larger than the actual blast would be.](https://i.imgur.com/Svs8wtu.jpg) Given what I just mentioned, the 500 nuke scenario is more likely given the current size of Russia's strategic arsenal. Even areas hit fairly hard (like Los Angeles) still have significant areas which will be untouched - although this is less true for other areas (sorry, NYC). If you're more than 26 km/16 miles away from the center of one of those dots/triangles (depending on the scenario) you basically only have to deal with fallout, nuclear winter, and then a slow death from starvation as the global food supply fails.

As for the country at large, eventually there will be a successor and it’s impossible to predict how they will act. The country’s political elites and citizens are starting to feel the issues with international isolation and strict Covid Zero measures. There will be some adjustments. But the facts on the ground don’t change: the United States has shown that regardless of which party is in power, they will maintain hostility to China, and that sours any possibility of reform. Geopolitically China is surrounded by US allies and that will bring them closer to Russia. Then there’s Taiwan; the Chinese believe it’s an integral part of China and a majority in Taiwan does not want to join the PRC. With the US in the picture the status quo, as rancid as it is, will last a long time.

What might happen is that whoever is in power (even Xi himself) will realise the Western decline is not as irreversible as they thought it is and tone down their actions to buy time.

Various other companies the Reddit crowd loves to bitch about aren’t actually operating there, they just leased their trademarks to companies in countries (quite a few) who are still doing business with Russia. 

Most announced that even if their franchisees and licensees pay them, they’ll just donate the money to something pro Ukraine (imagine the corruption already building itself into “Ukrainian charities” by now… that’ll be entertaining…) and not book any of it as revenue. 

Assuming they even get paid, which is unlikely. 

But you know, keeping a good face on cancel culture is important, not actually tracking the money.
 
And “to be fair” Apple probably isn’t booking the revenue anyway. 

The smartest company so far appears to be the folks running IKEA. They closed immediately but also kept paying their staff, knowing their staff isn’t involved in any of this nation-state bullshit in any way whatsoever. 

A friend of mine quickly laid off his Russian software folks the first two days realizing immediately where this was headed and made sure six months of severance also made it into their hands. Not their fault this crap is going on, but he knew the idiots in suits would soon be cutting off his way of paying them and his customers would be freaking out asking if any of those dirty evil Russians wrote any of his company’s software. 

Making things hard on normal folk just makes it easier for the propaganda to work… “See? You should have never trusted those Western capitalists… we warned you…” 

They know better I’m sure but who are they going to turn to? Their former foreign bosses who can’t pay them or do anything for them now?

To be fair, some comparative reasons are valid. 

Experience is a harsh mistress, one that traditionally does weed out some idiots and corrupt morons. The Red Army had to actually fight two major conventional wars. It couldn't rest on its laurels alone. The Soviet Union's Red Army was forged in a major civil war and then a generation later had to fight one of history's largest wars in WWII. By most accounts, from 1942-45 it fought moderately well against the Germans and Japanese. By contrast, the current crony Russia has had literally no accountability or experience in major warfare. Its generals are just idiots. 

And yet the Winter War happened. Any analysis of the USSR should always admit the horrific consequences of corruption and systemic idiocy. Anybody with a brain should know the Winter War alone demonstrated that even as a superpower, the quality of the USSR's leadership was really not all that great.

Eh. Most of those resources are spread across Siberia (which, if it were on its own would still be the largest country in the world). It's all in places that are challenging to leverage, and where people by and large do not want to live. It's too spread out, takes too long to move goods and services, too difficult to grow food locally so cities are completely dependent on shipping from elsewhere - and on roads and railroads not up to the task. 

If you wanted to expand mining near the central Siberian town of Aykhal and ship it to the port of Vladivostok, it would take 66 hours by car and require three ferries. A comparable journey in Canada (in terms of central point to major port) from Yellowknife to Vancouver would be 26 hours. Vehicles break, gas costs money, labor takes time and money, food rots. There's a reason Siberia is still largely the wilderness.

If it were economical for Russia to build great cities or bastions of industry in the arctic or the endless forests and steppes, they would do so. Even with essentially forced labor and relocation projects in the Soviet days, they couldn't build anything sustainable.

Russia did succeed in exploiting its oil resources, largely because the price of a barrel went up 2x-3x after the Berlin Wall fell. But you can see the national security hazards and feast/famine mindset of being a petrostate.

Maybe if they had the singular focus of broad-based resource development, and didn't have to worry about spending their treasure on operating a giant state security apparatus to pacify the Caucuses or other nationalist movements leftover from imperial conquests, or feel the need to lavishly fund their military to counter NATO, then they could be rich and secure. But alas, this is their lot. Every 80 years or so French or German tank army rolls from western Europe towards Moscow without much to stop them except the winter.

She first became known for the events following her 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army. She was found and arrested 19 months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes committed with members of the group. She was held in custody, and there was speculation before trial that her family's resources would enable her to avoid time in prison.

Bombs dropped on it.

The US was trying to blow it to bits so it couldn't be used.

It held together and still looked like a tank.

Damaged beyond repair, the US finally returned to retrieve the hulk.

Images of destroyed Abrams look nothing like the utter annihilation that has taken place with russian tanks.

The name ""Red Forest"" comes from the ginger-brown color of the pine trees after they died following the absorption of high levels of radiation from the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986. In the post-disaster cleanup operations, the Red Forest was bulldozed and buried in ""waste graveyards"". The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world today.

A10 has a 70s-era design for contested air space. Thick titanium armor, redundant lift (so that it can fly even as chunks of it are blown off), etc. etc.

F35 on the other hand, has enough stealth that a lot of those anti-air weapons are probably unreliable against it.

If stingers ""can't lock on"" the F35, then they can't kill the F35. So its the better plane for contested airspace. You prevent the lock-on with a combination of (minor) stealth and electronic warfare (F35's Towed Decoys, the non-stealth part of the plane is on a 100-foot rope dangling way below the F35. Most missiles would lock onto the decoys rather than the F35 itself)

The decoys are towed because the electronic-warfare capabilities emit a radar signature. So you need a physical wire to control the decoys (so that the main-F35 cockpit remains stealthy). So things like Radar (which innately emits a lot of electromagnetic radiation) are put on the decoys.

F35 doesn't have as good of stealth as B2 or F22, but its ""good enough"" that when paired with the decoys, a typical missile won't be able to hit anything but the decoys.

---------

You don't deploy a non-stealth plane (like the A10) to contested airspace in 2020. Sure, the A10 has thicker armor and other such features, but its not going to survive any of these advanced missiles today.

I know a lot of people in the cattle industry. I know very few people in that industry that use something the size of a f-350 and those are all people who haul large loads.

Truthfully the f-350 sucks. Look up the f250 and f350 death wobble problem.

Really, any vehicle with a solid front axle can have this problem but Ford seems to have a much larger percentage than anyone else does. It took until 2020 before Ford decided to do a recall and even after the ""fix"" many still have the issue. Even the older 2000s era of Fords had a lot of problems.

They're only slightly easier (at best) to train, organize and make militarily effective than raw 18 year old recruits who've never served at all.

If Russia was being invaded and you needed to know who were the best people in town to hand out guns to on short notice, (the equivalent of the Ukrainian territorial defense forces) - sure, those lists would probably be a good starting point.

Did you read the twitter thread?

They don't have full coverage to intercept all of the missiles and the fighters that are carrying dumb bombs. Stingers are only capable of intercepting things that are moving at low altitude, Ukraine are losing fighters and surface to air weaponry. The situation is only going to get worse for Ukraine. At some point Russia will gain air supremacy by default, and then stingers will do nothing because Russia will no longer need to fly at low altitude.

Even if we provided them with more S300 or Patriot systems, those aren't mobile and are vulnerable to drones and artillery. Whereas a plane can provide a high altitude, mobile deterrent that if not shooting down enemy airplanes, can provide a deterrent that will reduce the amount of ground attack runs that Russia can make on Ukrainian ground forces.

Stingers cannot provide this level of cover, not even S300 systems.

Edit: for those playing at home, shorting is agreeing to owe someone a number of shares. Imagine owing your friend a beer, but waiting until happy hour to pay them back - you are both a friend, and an expert trader shorting beer. But what if your friend was a terrible friend, and knew of a new alcohol tax coming before happy hour - that would make beer twice the cost. Now would be a great time for the terrible friend to buy everyone beer and say ""don't worry you'll just owe me one."" So your terrible friend is happy to participate in markets that allow shorting. Now what if you say ""I'm not buying you a beer now, the price is twice what I paid!"" And the terrible friend rings your beer broker who keeps your tab, and they say ""yeah nah terrible friend is right, this expensive beer is going on your tab"" well that would suck! So let's say everyone who owed beers found out beer was about to go up in price because of this new tax - well they'd all run to buy beer now at whatever price so it's not added to their tab at some.crazy high price. Now imagine if more buys meant a higher price like it does with shares...

Gonna go off of [this chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/) and work backwards. ""Severe radiation poisoning, in some cases fatal"" is 2 Sv.

That would mean in 3 weeks, 504 hours, one might need to take 3.97 - let's just say 4 - mSv per hour. If the soldiers were totally unprotected, and were kicking up dust, that means they were getting it on their clothes and breathing it in, which could affect dosage as well: 1 Sv localized to the lungs is probably a lot more dangerous than 1 Sv spread around the whole body. I'm not gonna cite a source for that, just gonna assume it. They definitely got soil on their clothes, and soldiers in the field don't usually have changes of clothing available. 

In the Red Forest, what are the radioactivity levels, especially in subsoil? I'm going to collect a bunch of sources, and try to rely on pre-2022 sources. 

* [Chernobylx says 0.1-10 mSv/hr in the red forest](https://chernobylx.com/the-red-forest-the-most-radioactive-outdoor-environment-on-the-planet/)

*[this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621180/) says Red Forest soil ranges anywhere between 37.00 and *75,000* kBq/m^2. 1 Bq is one atomic disintegration per second, and [apparently converting between Bq and Sv/hr is hard](https://people.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH/Rosenhoeft/index5.htm) and I don't want to accidentally misrepresent the facts, so all I'm going to take from this one is that the soil radioactivity levels vary a lot in the red forest.

* [the wikipedia article cites a book saying that it can be anywhere between 10 - 1000 mRoentgen, or between about 0.09 and 9 Sv.

Germany's initial blocking of arms shipments ""for bureaucratic reasons"" and statements that negotiations were the only option. 

And statements by Kuleba Ukraine's foreign minister that Ukrainian diplomats in the EU were met with ridicule when they requested aid the first day of the conflict with responses to the effect of ""you will be gone soon so why help you"". 

This all points to the notion that both the Germans and French made the assessment that Ukraine would not be able to withstand the Russian invasion and would likely collapse thus leading to the realpolitiks of not supporting Zelensky and instead just making peace with the new Ukrainian leadership and gradually normalizing relations with Russia. This in order to secure stable energy supply to the EU. 

Once the reality on the ground changed this assessment they shifted with France making statements on large investment in nuclear power instead of betting on imported gas and Germany launching their 100 billion rearmament plan and allowing transit of weapons to Ukraine, SWIFT band etc...

USA even planned to attack Brazil if we din't entered the war against the AXIS in WWII, is like attacking SWISS in WWII because they tried to be neutral and in our case was because we are close to Africa. The west always treated us with disrespect, what they are trying to gain back?

So recently there was two moments were the nations would talk about the amazon soberany and Russia used their veto to not discuss this topic because there is a lot of pression specially from france to talk about this subject.
Brazil is not too much of a friend with France too (search for lobster war) and because they want to explore amazon by french guyana..

Russia is in the BRICS, so we have some economic agreements and so far help each other developing, this not means fully alliances but we try to help each other in economic ways sometimes, This  also don't say that India and China will had to be helping each other tho.. Russia never make any movement against Brazil unlike the west and we have some trades agreements so we don't see them like enemies at all i think is like the same for India and South Africa, remembering that this not means we are actually allies.

So the reasonable thing to expect for at least SA, India and Brazil is to remain Neutral. 
Otherwise is just the old thing of ""Do what we want or you will be our enemies"", this is how the west make problems for themselves all the time, mess with a random country because of a country they dislike and bum, problems everywhere..

Russia making shit is their problem, we don't want nothing to it or have to pay higher prices in things just because the west wants, we have more problems like having a stable country in the first place, India has more deals With Russia tho, but because they were their only allies that they can buy weapons against China and were the only guys that helped India against Pakistan that USA supported at that time..

Saying that, yet i'm pro Ukraine, a country needs to defend their territory and soberany, their culture and their people, but i'm not exactly pro west just because the west support Ukraine too.",1648720812.0,1648716227.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2tjagc,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

A Hellfire Missile costs $150,000.

EDIT: And the 105mm shell has 40lbs of explosives, while a Hellfire Missile only has 100lbs of explosives. Two shells are all you need to do similar (probably more) damage than a Hellfire Missile.

The AC-130 can fire 300 shells before it comes up against the cost of that single hellfire missile the Reaper drone fired.

--------

You can't perform ""suppressive fire"" support from missiles. Missiles are just too expensive. You can instead, lay down dozens, hundreds of shells to ""supressive fire"" enemies (forcing them to take cover), while telling your ground troops to advance while the enemy is hiding/suppressed.

Look, I get that you think missiles are cool. But there are fundamental cost issues with regards to missiles.

""Guns are cool"" because the US Army wants a gun in the sky to perform the suppressive fire role. That's why they send helicopters, except Helicopters are even slower and have far less firepower than A10 or AC130.

------

Ex: Sniper is hiding in a location: You can't see him because he's hiding too well (inside a building, or behind a tree, etc. etc.) But the troops on the ground know he's there and have triangulated his position.

What is your missile / reaper drone going to do? Fire a missile blindly and hope it gets the sniper? No. That's not helpful. You literally can't afford to just waste missiles like that, not even the US Military with all of our riches.

AC130 / A10 starts to perform strafing runs at random inside of the forested area that the sniper is expected to be in. Now that's useful. The sniper is now forced to stand-up and runaway (ie: no longer hiding, and the troops on the ground will snipe them), or the sniper stays still and hides (ie: might die to the strafing runs / shells).",1648752521.0,1648751735.0,t3_tsqyoi,t1_i2vpimd,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Not that they are comparable planes in most regards. Much of what the a-10 did, that the c-130 gunship can't, was obsoleted by new technology anyway. 

We can't really use a-10's in contested airspace or where you don't have protection from AA on a modern battlefield, but when the were designed it was feasible. So the combat coverage role was reduced to a close air support in well controlled airspace with a big gun and the c-130 gunships can do that fine. Since they're a bigger plane they can bring more crew, munitions, and fuel too. There are a few other trade offs like rough landing capability, general durability too.

I like a-10's they're interesting and unique and they would certainly help Ukraine right now, if they had pilots, but the days for that plane are very numbered.

Germany is forced to buy Rubles with Euros or Dollars to create Ruble demand. Germany then pays for gas with the Ruble.This breaks the terms of the gas supply contract. 

But I don't understand why Russia would pick that fight when Russia could:

(Situation B)  Accept Germany's Euros or Dollars and buy Rubles with them on the same forex market that Germany would have to use. This doesn't void the contract and creates the same demand that Russia is after.

They don't have real war experience and they are organized much like Russia's military.

I'll give another example of the difference in spending between the US and Russia/China. The US has the largest air force in the world with the air force.

One million Btu is around 293kwh. This is total cost, including the cost for the scrubber.

West Virginia isn't poor because coal is dying, actually coal production in WV and SW Virginia is booming. Don't get me wrong, coal is dying but that isn't entirely the reason. The state commonly votes red and votes against stuff like unions which would help them. Coal in WV and SW VA is unique, it is the highest Btu producing coal in the world and because of that it is needed in steel production. Until the steel industry moves away from coal the area will have a stronger coal industry than the rest of the US. If you need sources on that just look up coal coke production and their prices.

So some of the reason for West Virginia being poor is because of the death of coal but I would put much of the reason on horrible decision making. West Virginia has always been poor, even when Coal was the leading source of energy in the world. WV tried to unionize once and hired thugs was sent in to kick them out of the area. I'm not going to tell the entire story but it ended when federal troops was sent into the area.

 >USS Reuben James (DD-245) was a four-funnel  Clemson-class destroyer made after World War I that was the first US Navy ship named for Boatswain's Mate Reuben James (c. 1776–1838), who distinguished himself fighting in the First Barbary War, and was the first sunk by hostile action in the European Theater of World War II. Reuben James was laid down on 2 April 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, launched on 4 October 1919, and commissioned on 24 September 1920, with Commander Gordon W. Hines in command.

She was noted for being torpedoed by a German U-boat in October 1941, before the U.S. had entered the war. She survived that attack, and later served in North Africa and the Mediterranean. She was named for Commodore Lawrence Kearny (1789–1868).
 
**[USS Greer (DD-145)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Greer_\(DD-145\))** 
 
 >USS Greer (DD–145) was a  Wickes-class destroyer in the United States Navy, the first ship named for Rear Admiral James A. Greer (1833–1904). In what became known as the ""Greer incident,"" she became the first US Navy ship to fire on a German ship, three months before the United States officially entered World War II. The incident led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue what became known as his ""shoot-on-sight"" order. Roosevelt publicly confirmed the ""shoot on sight"" order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war against Germany and Italy in the Battle of the Atlantic.

It does cut the mileage down from about 36-38  to 33-35 mpg when we drove it to Texas and back over Thanksgiving to see my 88 year old mother (we tent-camped with my son and family), but we were driving about 75-80  most of the way, which tends to cut into your mileage. We got lucky to find the RAV Prime in Cali (they don't sell them in Nevada, just green states), but on the way to my son's house in Central Valley California.  They sold it to us for MSRP; I hear a lot of dealers are jacking it up by 5-8k.  I think Kia or Hyundai has come out with a plug-in competitor which is comparable, so I think there will be a lot more options this year and next.

We drove to Texas and frequently (once a month or so) to California and for long hiking trips in Nevada, but we are averaging almost 50 mpg due to the electric capabiities around town.  A lot of people who drive almost all around town will only need to fill up every couple months, but we drive it more on longer trips.

The Silverado was cheaper than a 4 wheel drive Tacoma; my wife might have been OK with a Tacoma but I thought she might want to get a small trailer, given the amount of camping/backpacking we do, but she's fine with tent camping.  I don't sleep well, but then I don't sleep well at home, so I can't blame it on sleeping on the ground.

Edit:  The Prime does qualify for the full Fed $7500 but it is a tax credit, so you need to owe that much in taxes the year you buy it to qualify for the full credit when you file.

>  still getting paid to a lesser degree? Besides, it's not Russia restricting supply, it's Europe choosing not to use their capacity.

Because Russia desperately needs every dollar of hard currency it can get. Oil/gas is their primary export and the rest of their economy is in death spiral.

-----------

- Germany has 80 million people and tons of industry, and that's just one of many countries in Europe Russia has traditionally supplied gas to. This is cumulatively, a **lot** of gas. In order for Russia to somehow redirect this gas to use at home, there has to be a massive amount of stuff that can consume gas that currently is consuming none or very little relative to how much it could consume, and there has to be some sort of value gained by doing that.

- I find it very unlikely that Russia has that much idle industrial capacity *and* that said idle capacity suddenly becomes worth running with free natural gas. Producing tons of stuff you have no customers for, doesn't make you richer.

- The same is true of the rest of your examples. Are Russians going to cook 3 times as much? Heat their houses to be like a sauna? What would be the point of doing any of those things?

- There are few LNG cars, and presumably people who do have them were...using them for what they need them for before this. Not a lot of potential demand increase here.

- And to note on crypto - Russia is under heavy sanctions on tech imports, and they likely have better uses (keeping the country afloat) for whatever quantity of technology they do manage to smuggle in in the future. Hard to do much in crypto when you don't have a reliable supply of equipment to mine on.
