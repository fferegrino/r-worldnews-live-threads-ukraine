Poland and Baltic countries trigger consultations under NATO article 4
From CNN’s Brad Lendon in Hong Kong and Vasco Cotovio in Moscow
NATO member states Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have triggered NATO Article Four to launch consultations within the alliance over their security concerns. 

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine represented a “threat to the whole of Europe,” the Estonian government said in a statement on Thursday. 

""Russia's widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all NATO countries, and NATO consultations on strengthening the security of the Allies must be initiated to implement additional measures for ensuring the defense of NATO Allies,” Kallas said. “The most effective response to Russia's aggression is unity.”
Some context: Under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Agreement, the Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the allies is threatened.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO. However, Russia has demanded that NATO commits to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance, something NATO members have rejected, citing the alliance's ""open door"" policy.",False,1645689325.0,t3_t02ocp,t3_t02ocp,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

Putin lashes out with ominous threat to Ukrainians and other countries
Analysis by Jill Dougherty
Before the crack of dawn, just before explosions began in cities across Ukraine, Russian state television unexpectedly broadcast an address by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  

The two self-proclaimed ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk, in the breakaway Ukrainian region of Donbas, which he had officially recognized as independent less than two days before, had ""turned to Russia with a request for help,"" he said. To answer that call he was launching a ""special military operation."" Its purpose: to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazifiy"" Ukraine. 

Within minutes, Russian missiles began hitting targets in Ukraine. ""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he told his fellow Russians, claiming Moscow had no plans to occupy Ukraine. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he insisted.

Putin described the ""special military operation"" in limited terms, to protect people living in Donbas who, he claimed, had been subjected to ""genocide,"" a charge that Ukraine has strenuously denied. But in the next breath, he lashed out more broadly: ""NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats."" 

Then, in an extraordinary passage, he spoke directly to members of Ukraine's military, at that very moment in the crosshairs of the Russian military. Addressing them as ""dear comrades,"" he told them they had taken an ""oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and not to the anti-people junta that is robbing Ukraine and abuses those same people.""

""Don't follow its criminal orders!"" he demanded. ""I urge you to lay down your weapons and go home."" 

As he has done so many times before, Putin claimed Russia had no choice but to defend itself. With a hard-edged tone in his voice, he seemed to threaten the US, Europe and NATO which, in just a few minutes, would witness his armed forces opening fire on Ukraine, something the Kremlin had consistently dismissed as western ""hysterics."" 

""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history.

""We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made.""

Putin, who for years had criticized the West for ignoring his complaints about NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders, was finally striking back with fury. ""I hope,"" he concluded his short address, ""that I have been heard.""",False,1645694060.0,t3_t02ocp,t3_t02ocp,,0,85,0,85,0,0,

Japan's Prime Minister says Russia's invasion ""shakes foundations of international order""
From CNN's Emiko Jozuka in Tokyo 
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday condemned Russia's invasion of eastern Ukraine, saying it ""shakes the foundations of the international order.""

""We strongly criticize Russia's actions and will cooperate with the United States and the international community to respond swiftly,"" Kishida told reporters at a news conference.
Kishida added that Tokyo would continue to work with relevant ministries to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in Ukraine.

When asked about further sanctions against Moscow, Kishida told reporters he would consider future measures after communicating with other G7 nations and the international community.

Some context: Kishida on Wednesday said Japan will impose sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

Kishida said Japan will suspend the issuance of visas and freeze the assets of people involved in recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two separatist-held pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine. He did not specify names or how the sanctions would be carried out.

He also said Japan will ban imports and exports to and from Donetsk and Luhansk, and prohibit the issuance and circulation of Russian bonds in Japan.",False,1645688882.0,t3_t02ocp,t3_t02ocp,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

For a long time, non-proliferation tactics have relied on a sort-of gentlemen's agreement of ""if you don't pursue nukes and other WMD, the western world will respect and protect your sovereignty"". And, for the most part, it's worked. Of course, there are also countries who (at least superficially) pledged to non-proliferation and then fell - but those were countries that were already inviting the ire of the world (e.g. Sadaam's Iraq), and it's no surprise that they might meet an untimely end.

It's also why the western world has tried and punished actors like N Korea or Iran - they don't want to play by the rules, so fuck it, they can enjoy their nukes and their hunger until they change course.

But Ukraine voluntarily gave up its capability in exchange for recognition and sovereignty, but now Russia is challenging it, and could very well destroy it. If the western world allows that to happen *without* doing their best non-militarily to collapse Russia in return? At that point, I don't know how any head-of-state could look at the history of non-nuclear-capable countries and just dismiss the pursuit of becoming nuclear-capable out of a desire for peace. After all - when was the last time nuclear capable nations went to war? Compare that to the times that a nuclear-capable nation has ended a non-nuclear-capable nation.

If Ukraine falls to a UN-security council country that doesn't get fucked up in kind, while North Korea and Iran, among others, continues to exist despite tense circumstances and constant international opposition?

President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.

I will be monitoring the situation from the White House this evening and will continue to get regular updates from my national security team. Tomorrow, I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security. We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance.

The attacks were real, but they were not really hurtful, I'm hoping Ukraine was prepared for such an obvious air attack.
I think that Russians again follow their way of conflict - one step forward, few steps back. 
They try to create panic. They try to get Ukrainians to leave cities. But what is next? Real attack on where?

I see a lot of downvotes, do you think that if Ukraine mobilized everyone they could, only to see that no troops are actually attacking Kyiv, would that be good?

The principle of collective defence is enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.
NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.

Tgere is a large neighborhood to the west and she should drive generally west until she reaches Budharina St.  Then she goes north until she reaches the E40/M06 and heads west until Poland either through Lviv by the M10 or the M11.

If Poland closes the border and refuses refugees, she can go south to a small town called Halivka and seek sanctuary at the Church of the Archangel Michael.  If she follows the road north about 1/2 mile or 0.9 km she will come to a watershed/creek that  leads due west.  If she follows the creek west, she will cross over the Polish border and there is a cabin about 3 K to the west and 100 m south of the creek called Osada Na Granicy.  It's a B&B, I think.  From there she can get a lift to the nearest town and apply for asylum.

It's become more and more like the western democracies of Europe and North America, and has become allies with them. It is close to joining NATO, the international treaty in which nations agree to come to each other's aid in times of war. Putin, the dictator of Russia, doesn't like any of this - he doesn't want the rest of Russia, or the former constituent countries of the former Soviet Union, getting any big ideas, and he doesn't want NATO anywhere near its border. He also would very much like to have Ukraine back.

Russia's economy is not doing well and Putin's strategy for cementing his power is a show of military force and expansion. He wants Russia to think of him as an incredibly successful leader that brought them prosperity, and war often has the effect of stimulating the economy (and of providing government ""jobs"" to the masses that have been impoverished by his dictatorship, in the form of joining the armed forces).

So, tl;dr, Putin wants to cement his legacy as a great leader that brought success (and food on the table) to Russia, and is fearful that instead he'll be remembered as the guy who saw Russia's influence and power shrink as Ukraine and others around Russia gradually drift away from it (a process that began decades ago and as far as the rest of the world is concerned, has already happened).

&#x200B;

let me get this straight. here’s what other people have mentioned in other subs so can someone just confirm this real quick.  
  
russia officially invaded and declared war??

\- They entered the Ukraine as a ""peacekeeping force"" and responded to force brought about by Ukraine

there was a missile attack on an airbase in kyiv??

\- Reportedly multiple military facilities have been attacked outside the city.  
  
is this possibly going to involve other eastern europe countries and possibly china ?

\- Small chance at the moment.  China and Russia have become very close lately and China already will be purchasing oil from Russia so our economic sanctions against them will not carry as much weight

officially invaded, but as is the fashion no one declares wars anymore, in this case the euphemism is ""Special military operation"" 

>there was a missile attack on an airbase in kyiv??

Kyiv and elsewhere have been hit by something, the exact nature of the attack is unknown. 

>is this possibly going to involve other eastern europe countries and possibly china ?

Seems like initial reports suggest troops are crossing from Belarus, and there are unconfirmed and possibly spurious reports that Transnistria (breakaway state of Moldova) is involved, but those have not been confirmed and are starting to be retracted.  China is not going to get involved, they have condemned NATO expansionism but also have condemned Russian aggression as well, and affirmed Ukrainian sovereignty

The invasion began literally while the UNSC was discussing last-minute diplomatic options. If looks could kill, the Ukrainian Ambassador's would have nailed the Russian Ambassador to the wall.

Putin played the West like a fiddle, gaslighting and delaying long enough to get all of his pieces in place. The moment he gave that speech, invasion was inevitable. Coordinating a global response isn't easy when the parameters of said response keep shifting.

Russia is a bad-faith actor, but the response of global democracies has to stay measured and unified, but within international law. Otherwise, any shortcuts the ""good guys"" take can be exploited by the ""bad guys"" woth impunity.

How long does it take to build a castle out of LEGO blocks? Okay. Now how long does it take to destroy that castle?

We might see something like the US in the early years of Vietnam supporting Ukraine in a proxy war, Maybe Turkey sees some way to get some cred with the EU and ""does"" something. Nations like Poland may get involved...

&#x200B;

In a warzone, that often is the problem; as supply lines break down a lot of smaller charities struggle to actually distribute aid into effected regions/countries and get it to people in need. Large global organizations like the Red Cross/UN/Unicef have the ability and funds to actually get aid out there. Do I think the Red Cross is a great organization? No, I think it is often wasteful in fact, HOWEVER they have resources not available to smaller, local organizations in times of crisis. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying, 'Go out and donate all your money to the Red Cross.' I'm saying it is an option and may be able to provide aid when others can't. My mom worked for over a decade in war torn countries in humanitarian relief, I'm not blind to the fact that only a percentage will actually make it to its destination.

&#x200B;

I will also say, and this is true in most cases, supporting specific programs (in this case the Red Cross' Ukraine Aid fund will be far more effective then general donations with most of these large organizations.

Ukraine’s defence ministry says it has shot down five Russian planes and one helicopter in a statement posted on its Facebook page.

According to the Joint Forces Command, today, on February 24, 5 planes and a helicopter of the aggressor were shot down.

The Joint Forces give a worthy rebuff to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Military units are in their positions. The enemy is taking losses.

Stay calm and believe in the Ukrainian defenders. Together we will win! Glory To Ukraine!”

The Russian military has denied that one of its planes was shot down in fighting over Ukraine this morning.

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

*Subsequent investigations suggested that intelligence officials had cautioned then-CIA Director George Tenet before Powell’s speech about concerns surrounding much of the evidence, including the main source behind the claim that Hussein was using mobile laboratories to advance the country’s biological weapons development, a man code-named Curveball.*

*The investigation found that Tenet did not tell Powell of those warnings.*

*Tenet himself has said he did not learn of the concerns about the source until later, but Powell remained furious at him.*

*“So that’s it,” Powell said in the 2005 interview. “It’s the blot on my record.”*

***If he had known then what he found out after it was too late, he said, “I don’t think we would have had the basis to go to war.”***

I fear that the will of US populace will be split between leave it alone and send everyone.   

If you thought that the devastation piped into every American living room from Iraq and Afghanistan or even Vietnam or the gulf war was bad.  Imagine a global conflict with Russia and probably China if a gun is held to their head.  Imagine The full might and power of the us, uk and their allies against the actual full might of just Russia alone.   Ports, ships and global trade, destroyed.  The internet and all the things it supports, unusable due to infrastructure and cyber attacks. Cities destroyed on multiple continents and refugees starving in the streets.  Hundreds of thousands if not millions dead.
