Day 206 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the missile strike happened extremely early, they did it at 12pm, and they fired 7-8 missiles. From the reports 2-4 of them malfunctioned and blew up over Belgorod, this fail rate is just laughable. Only 4 missiles made it through, and all of them landed in Chuhuiv, they killed an 11 year old girl, destroyed some private houses, a gas station and some infrastructure. 

They wasted millions of dollars in missiles just to kill a child, I’ll never be able to understand the people firing those missiles at civilians, it’s completely pointless, and it doesn’t help them win the war in any way. In fact it does completely the opposite, it basically destroys any opportunity for negotiations, and it makes them even more hated. The first peace negotiations failed because of Bucha, it just showed us that they are barbarians that cannot be trusted. It doesn’t help that every recently liberated town and village looks like just another Bucha or even worse. Just imagine the amount of war crimes that will come to light once Mariupol is liberated.

Interesting movement is happening in Belgorod right now, I guess people living there are getting kinda fed up with shelling, even though it barely started. Tomorrow they are organizing an event in Belgorod, which they are saying is not a protest, but a cry for help. They are saying that they want a peaceful life in Russian villages and cities, they want the shelling to stop, and they also want compensation to the families that lost a family member in this war. They are supposedly meeting up tomorrow at 12pm, let’s see what will happen, they will probably be suppressed by the police, but it’s interesting to see if anyone shows up at all.",False,1663461511.0,t3_xgc04v,t3_xgc04v,,0,175,0,175,3,2,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 2}"

First, explaining why Putin is so against general mobilization even at the cost of Ukrainian victory and international humiliation: [80% of Russians oppose mobilization](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1570549565765586945.html).

This is self-evident anyway, but I think it's valuable because it points out the limits of a blunt tool like propaganda. Russian politicians/media has been consistently calling for mobilization claiming that it is what Russians want, but it just won't fly.

This is why Putin is so deadset against mobilization and even Kadyrov had tried to persuade individual regions to 'self-mobilize' knowing the Kremlin can't do it. Because the public support cost is extremely high. You can't repress that many people.

Another is regarding [the topic of ATACMS](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1570619239572344833.html) and why the US won't give it to Ukraine. It helpfully explains the difference between the GMLRS rockets Ukraine currently has and the ATACMS people are calling for.

The short of it is that it appears the US may be providing equipment that are 'needed' right in the moment and which provides the highest value. They do this while taking into context other considerations, e.g. training, US stockpile, risk of escalation, etc. I'm oversimplifying this enormously.

The second definition is the one most similar to the military context of the word so we'll go with that. Does Ukraine have power over Russia to take charge? The answer is a clear yes.

Russia is currently waiting for the next attack, besides some small advances over a few small villages and towns, Russia is desperately waiting for where the next attack from Ukraine will come from.

Will it be towards Mariupol, Berdiansk or Melitopol somewhere in the south?

Will a bigger force assist the ongoing actions near Kherson?

Will Ukraine try to make a major crossing of the Oskil and attack into Luhansk Oblast?

Will they try and surround Donetsk?

Russia is currently asking these questions and likely Ukraine is as well, and it's defining the current phase of the war. ""Can/Where will Ukraine attack next?"" Russia has to spread its forces out over the whole front and wait, while Ukraine seems to be massing in a few areas to keep Russia guessing.

If it's an intra-Russian battle, they could try to cover it up by saying it was against Ukrainians, but this is definitely not something they want to see happening in a city they control.

This is done to prevent street to street fighting in Kherson city which would destroy the city.

(for reference, Dugin is the guy who wrote [Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) 25 years ago, look the main topics of that book on this link and compare to what happened in the world since its release).

> Aleksandr Dugin in his article calls for mobilisation of the whole Russia to fight the Antichrist Western world

https://wartranslated.com/aleksandr-dugin-in-his-article-calls-for-mobilisation-of-the-whole-russia-to-fight-the-antichrist-western-world/

> IT BEGINS: THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE BY ALEXANDER DUGIN

> In the past few days, there have been significant changes in the balance of power in Ukraine. This needs to be considered in its entirety.

> Kyiv’s counterattacks were generally a failure in the Kherson region, but, alas, successful in the Kharkiv region. It is the situation in the Kharkiv region and the forced retreat of the allied forces that is the turning point. If we now put aside the psychological effects and the natural worries of the patriots, it should be observed that in the entire length of the SMO we have come to the point of no return.

> Everyone as one now recommends taking extraordinary measures to turn the tide, and some of these proposals are quite rational. We do not pretend to be original in any way, but we will only try to summarize the most fundamental points and recommendations and place them in the global geopolitical context.

> World War III

> We are on the verge of a third world war, which the West is obsessively pushing us towards. And this is no longer fear or expectation, this is a fact. Russia is at war with the collective West, with NATO and their allies (although, not with all – Turkey and Greece have their own position, and a number of European countries, primarily France and Italy, but not only, do not want to actively participate in the war with Russia). And yet the threat of a third world war is getting closer.

> Whether it will come to the use of nuclear weapons is an open question. But the likelihood of a nuclear Armageddon is increasing every day. It is quite clear, and many American military leaders (like the recently ex-commander of the US Armed Forces in Europe, Ben Hodges) openly proclaim this, the West will no longer be satisfied even with our complete withdrawal from the territory of the former Ukraine, they will finish us off on our soil, insisting on “unconditional surrender “(Jens Stoltenberg), “de-imperialisation” (Ben Hodges), dismemberment of Russia.

> In 1991, the West was satisfied with the collapse of the USSR and our ideological capitulation, primarily by the adoption of Western liberal ideology, political system, and economy under the leadership of Western curators. Today, for the West, the red line is the very existence of sovereign Russia – even within the borders of the Russian Federation.

> The counteroffensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region is a direct blow from the West against Russia. Everyone knows that this offensive was organised, prepared, and equipped by the military command of the United States and NATO and took place under their direct supervision. This is not only the use of NATO military equipment but also the direct participation of Western military space intelligence, mercenaries, and instructors. In the eyes of the West, this is the beginning of “our end.” Since we have slacked in the defense of the territories under our control in the Kharkiv region, we can be defeated further. This is not a small success of the Kyiv counter-offensive, this is the first tangible success of the Drang nach Osten of the NATO forces.

> Of course, one can try to attribute this to temporary “technical difficulties” and postpone the essential analysis of the situation until later. But this will only delay the realization of a fait accompli, and, consequently, will only weaken and demoralize us ourselves.

> Therefore, it is worth coldly admitting: the West has declared war on us and is already waging it. We didn’t choose this war, we didn’t want it. In 1941, we also did not want war with Nazi Germany and refused to believe in it until the very end. But in the current situation, when it is waged against us de facto, this is not of decisive importance. Now it is only important to win it, having defended the right of Russia to exist.

> End of the SMO

> The SMO as a limited operation to liberate Donbas and a number of territories of Novorossiya is completed. It gradually developed into a full-fledged war with the West, where, in fact, the terrorist Nazi Kyiv regime itself plays only a role of a tool. An attempt to besiege it and liberate a number of territories of Novorossiya controlled by the Ukrainian Nazis, while maintaining the existing geopolitical balance of forces in the world unchanged, failed as a technical operation, and to pretend that we are simply continuing the SMO further, somewhere on the periphery of public attention, is simply pointless.

> Against our will, we are now at war, and this applies to every citizen of Russia: each of us is in the crosshairs of the enemy, a terrorist, a sniper, a sabotage group.

> At the same time, the situation is such that, with all the desire, it is impossible to return everything to the initial conditions, before February 24, 2022. What happened is irreversible, and one should not even be afraid of any concessions or compromises on our part. The enemy will only accept our complete surrender, enslavement, dismemberment, and occupation. So we just don’t have a choice.

> The end of the SMO means the need for deep transformations of the entire political and social system of modern Russia – the transfer of the country to a military footing, in politics, economics, culture, and the information sphere. The SMO could remain important, but not the only content of the Russian public life. The war with the West subjugates everything.

> Ideological frontline

> Russia found itself in a state of ideological war. The values ​​advocated by the globalist West: LGBT, the legalisation of perversions, drugs, the fusion of man and machine, total mixing during uncontrolled migration, and others, are inextricably linked with its military-political hegemony and unipolar system. Western liberalism and the global military-political and economic dominance of the US and NATO are one. To fight with the West and to accept (albeit partially) its values, in the name of which it is waging a war against us, a war of annihilation, is simply absurd.

> Our own fully-fledged ideology would not just be “useful” to us today. If we don’t have it, we will lose. The West will continue to attack us from the outside, with the hands of armed and trained Ukrainian Nazis, and from within, with the hands of the fifth, still liberal column, skillfully corrupting the consciousness and corrupting the soul of the younger generation. Without our own ideology, which will clearly define who is a friend and who is an enemy, we will find ourselves in such a situation almost powerless.

> The ideology should be immediately declared in general terms, and its essence should be the complete and direct rejection of the ideology of the West, globalism, and totalitarian liberalism, with all its instrumental subspecies – including neo-Nazism, racism, and extremism.

> Mobilisation

> Mobilisation is inevitable. War concerns absolutely everyone. However, mobilisation does not mean forced sending of conscripts to the front. This can be avoided, for example, through the formation of a full-fledged Volunteer Movement, with the necessary benefits and state support.

> We should bet on veterans, on special support for the soldiers of Novorossiya. Russia has few of them, but there are supporters abroad. We must not hesitate to form anti-Nazi anti-globalist international brigades from honest people from the countries of East and West.

> But the main thing is that Russians should not be underestimated. We are a hero people. At a great price, but we won over a great enemy more than once or twice in our glorious history. We will win this time too, but only if the war against the West becomes a people’s war. It is people’s wars that we win, wars in which a nation-giant is awakening.

> Mobilisation involves a complete change in information policy. Peacetime norms (in fact, blind copying of Western entertainment programs and strategies that only corrupt society) must be abolished. Television and the media in general should become patriotic tools for wartime mobilisation. All concerts are for the frontline, the very being in the rears is also for the frontline. This is already gradually beginning, but so far it affects only a tiny part of the channels. And it should be everywhere.

> Culture, information, education, enlightenment, politics, the social sphere – everything must work unanimously for the war, that is, for the Victory.

> Economy

> Any sovereign state can issue as much national currency as it needs. If it is truly sovereign. A war with the West makes it meaningless to continue economic games according to its rules. The wartime economy cannot but be sovereign. To win, you should spend as much money as you need. It is only necessary to ensure that emissions are concentrated in a special circuit designed for strategic purposes. Corruption in such circumstances should be equated with a war crime.

> War and comfort are incompatible things. The comfort as a goal, as a life guide, should be abandoned. Only peoples who are ready for hardships are able to win real fully-fledged wars.

> In such situations, a new layer of economists always appears, whose goal is to save the state. This is of primary importance. Dogmas, schools, methods, and approaches are secondary.

> You can call such an economy a mobilisation economy, or you can simply call it a military one.",False,1663467686.0,t3_xgc04v,t3_xgc04v,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Who knows how the Eastern Front will stop, but it seems Russia's Eastern Front is supposed to reach a defensive line, the problem is that apparently Ukraine is simultaneously attacking the defensive line before it can be set up, if breached all of Russia's Eastern front will collapse and have to retreat to pre February borders.

Now, this is a big if, but if Ukraine had also been building divisions in the South and they launch an offensive at the same time towards Mariupol and and Melitopol and succeed it will break all the invasion force minus Kherson. While Kherson has the best Russian divisions if it becomes an isolated salient where Russia was pushed back to pre-invasion positions almost everywhere else, I dont see the Kherson forces winning.

We could be looking forward to the repeal of the invasion by the onset of winter. But this scenario is very optimistic and requires Ukraine doing everything right and Russia doing everything wrong.

As it is, right now it is isolated.

Ruzzia can't get to it or their plains will be blown out of the sky. Transnistria itself has no access to the Black Sea, and it is surrounded by land from all sides, either by Ukraine or Moldova.

There are numerous reports that the few Ruzzian soldiers that are still there are abandoning ship, so how long they will survive there, who knows, they are definitely not receiving any more supplies from Ruzzia.

Moldova doesn't really have an army that can do much.

Romania will never operate outside the borders of NATO or outside a larger NATO operation, especially when Transnistria isn't a threat to Moldova (I'm Romanian if that is worth anything when I say this).

Transnistria was a useful tool for Ruzzia, as it was traditionally a way to stir the pot, create conflict and tension out of thin air.

That is no longer the case, and we can see that they've been reluctant doing anything other than breathe. Remember, they even staged a fake attack in Transnistria at the beginning of the war, to maybe push them to open a second front, but that failed miserably.

Actually, for all that the absurd stuff people are going on about with fears of escalation...hoo boy I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for this...tinfoil hat on...

>!Escalation with NATO IS actually Putin's only way out.  But he needs to manage it with diplomatic back channels.  He communicates with someone like Biden a backroom deal for NATO to come in as RU pulls out as peacekeepers, giving Russia a face-saving but without actually firing on NATO, basically a war with zero casualties or fighting--then RU can fuck off back to its own borders without looking like total ass internally.  Think it sounds crazy?  It is, but, read up on the politicking around the Cuban missile crisis.  Any other way this ends, Putin's a dead man; at least like this he's only extremely unpopular and gets to retire in disgrace.  THAT BEING SAID, Putin doesn't have the mental/political flexibility to do this kind of thing.  Kruschev or Gorbachev could've, but not Putin, he's too entrenched like Brezhnev or the corruptest of the old tsars.!<

>!The only other way out he has really is to pull back, blow up a nuke on Russian soil where there's nothing around, go ""myah!  I'm dangerous!  See!?"" and then sue for peace from a position of something even loosely resembling strength.  This is more risky since there's a really good chance it'll just fizzle, and he's irradiated his own territory for nothing (fizzles are notoriously dirty).  Also a good chance everyone internationally takes it as a reason to just say ""fuck it"" and vaporize him.  It's also against a lot of treaties to open-air test.!<

...ok tinfoil hat off.  Aaaaanyways, ATACMS stockpiles are basically to be disposed of anyway.  In some cases it's cheaper to just ship it overseas rather than dispose of it stateside.  Concerns over escalation are stupid; ATACMS range is pretty short, all things considered (300km, compare that to a Tomahawk's 1500 or the 660km of the longer-range Kalibrs), and Ukraine already has weapons that can do that (Topols and their own domestic weapons), just not many of them.

Besides which Russia can't really escalate anymore.  Chemical weapons are of little use on an actual battlefield.  Bioweapons are usually way more dangerous to your own troops than anyone else.  Nuclear weapons would be basically a death sentence to Russia itself.  And they're already committing every war crime they can.",False,1663468618.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iovduok,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The political standpoint has been picked apart, and that's to say: we're assuming that Putin would need some way to convince the Russian people that it's necessary for the survival of the Russian state or their ""way of life"".  That implies that Russians are pretty much ""on the fence"" about supporting this war (they're happy to support genocide, until it inconveniences them* personally: and by them*; I mean, urban elites who currently aren't sacrificing their sons and daughters on putin's war-altar).  

This ignores the fact that the regime has a very powerful lock on public narratives via their control over what is broadcast on national newsmedia.

It also implies that Putin needs some kind of ""excuse"" (like unfair western involvement, Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil using NATO weapons, etc) - to use as a lever to drive that narrative.  

The Russian government can do extrajudicial executions with impunity, and we see this constantly with how many Gazprom execs keep falling out of 3rd story windows, and etc. Russian people seem dumb enough to watch a story like that, and take it at face value. (""What an unfortunate accident!"").  

In that light, I'm not so sure Putin needs some kind of bullshit narrative to justify general mobilization. I suspect the REAL limiting factor is: they could easily recruit something like 4 million troops.  But they do not have the resources to train, equip, and supply them. At least: Not in the next 12 months. 

So I still believe that the most likely take on all these relative unknowns is: If Ukraine can push Russia out, and/or get them to back down and retreat, in the next 6-12 months, there is fuck-all Russia could do about it. It all depends on whether Ukraine can pull that off, but time is of the essence.  If Russia is able to re-constitute its forces, they'll be back, a year, two years, etc down the road.  But they'd be up against a much tougher Ukrainian defense, and it's not clear Russia would accomplish anything.

The other wild-card is: will Russia also need to commit significant forces to defending its territorial integrity in various renewed conflicts across their empire.  So that will also be a huge challenge - one they may not even be able to meet.  

However: If Ukraine CAN'T make much more progress over the next 6-12 months, they may end up losing that territory permanently, because by THAT time, Russia could reinforce those occupied positions.

So this is likely what Russia needs to do: Run out the clock until they can rebuild their forces enough to defend what they've taken.  And based on the last week or so, I think it's looking pretty grim for Russia's chance of pulling this off.

The conventional firepower available to NATO over russia is so overwhelming that it's not even funny. 

>The only response would be to ensure russia is unable to launch more of them and the only way to achieve that in short time is combined strikes with nuclear weapons ourselves

Unless you can support this, there is no validity to this being ""the only way"".

That can be done with conventional weaponry. Doing it with nukes is called a [First Strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_strike_(nuclear_strategy)). And that's where MAD comes into play.

 This would leave russia with the conundrum that their only shot is not a small nuke, but a First Strike of their own. 

>Anything less then that and you are giving carte blance to all nuclear rogue states to use it in a limited capacity

A conventional response can be sufficiently devastating. As long as the gains of the offender are nulified, and various cost (aka russian shit getting blown up as a bonus) are imposed on the offender, this is more than sufficient reason to discourage use by other parties.

>MAD IS MAD for a reason

And that reason is to protect nuclear states and thier allies against such attacks. Not to punish the violation of the nuclear taboo. 

>No Nato wont send troops into ukraine to drive russia out if they use a nuke. No commander would put hundreds of thousands of troops at risk if nukes become a viable strategy in active combat

There is zero reason for NATO to put its troops there. The  ability to wreck up russian shit from a distance is plentiful.

Look, nobody is fine with russia using nukes. They probably won't. If by some unlikely miracle they do, no matter the size of the nuke, not only NATO, but the entire world would go and stomp russia into the ground.

Bottom line is: nuclear usage comes with strings attached. Conventional retaliation in this case does not. NATO can fuck up every major russian unit or installation in Ukraine within 48 hours if it really wants to, without a single infantryman crossing the border.

If Russia used one of those in Ukraine, NATO would probably retaliate by destroying russian nuke launch capabilities using conventional cruise missiles (read: hundreds of Tomahawks) and cripple their submarines (HAAWC). Russia has literally zero air defenses, so almost none of those would be intercepted. 

The reason Putin hasn't used nukes yet is not because he isn't sufficiently evil to do so. He is.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites, and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

> Allies play a vital role in any war. Today, Russia does not have many of them, but they do exist. First of all, we are talking about those countries that reject the unipolar liberal Western order. That is, the supporters of multipolarity, such as China, Iran, North Korea, Serbia, Syria, Central African Republic, Mali, and also, to a certain extent, India, Turkey, a number of Islamic, African and Latin American countries (primarily Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela).

> In working with them, it is necessary to mobilise all available resources, not only professional but also people’s diplomacy. And for this, again, an ideology is needed. We must convince the allies that we have decided to break with globalism and Western hegemony irreversibly and are ready to go all the way in building a multipolar world. Here we must be consistent and resolute. The time for halftones and compromises is over. The war of the West against Russia is dividing humanity into different sides of the barricades.

> Spiritual Factor

> The central moment of the world confrontation that has begun is the spiritual, religious aspect. Russia found itself in a state of war with a God-fighting anti-religious civilization that overthrows the very foundations of spiritual and moral values: God, the Church, family, sex, human. With all the differences between Orthodoxy, traditional Islam, Judaism, Hinduism or Buddhism, all religions and cultures built on them recognise divine truth, the high spiritual and moral dignity of a person, honor traditions and institutions: the state, family, community. The modern West has abolished all this, replacing it with virtual reality, extreme individualism, the destruction of sex, universal surveillance, a totalitarian “cancel culture”, and a post-truth society.

> Open Satanism and outright racism flourish in Ukraine, and the West only supports this.

> We are dealing with what the Orthodox elders call “the civilization of the Antichrist.” Therefore, the role of Russia is to unite believers of different faiths in this decisive battle.

> You should not wait until the ultimate enemy destroys your house, kills your husband, son or daughter … At some point it will be too late. God forbid we live to such a moment.

> The offensive of the enemy in the Kharkiv region is exactly that, that very thing. The beginning of a fully-fledged war of the West against us.

> The West is demonstrating its intention to start a war of annihilation against us – a third world war. We must gather all our deepest national potential to repel this attack.

Perhaps you are thinking of the Nuremberg trials of leading nazis?  However, the only defendant in those trials that was strictly a propagandist was Hans Fritzsche (a popular radio commentator and head of the propaganda ministry): he was indicted on three counts (conspiring to commit crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against humanity) but he was acquitted on all three charges.  From Wikipedia:

> According to journalist and author William L. Shirer, it was unclear to the attendees why he was charged. Shirer remarked that ""no-one in the courtroom, including Fritzsche, seemed to know why he was there – he was too small a fry – unless it were as a ghost for Goebbels"". According to the IMT prosecution, he ""incited and encouraged the commission of War Crimes by deliberately falsifying news to arouse in the German People those passions which led them to the commission of atrocities"". Fritzsche was acquitted because the court was ""not prepared to hold that [his broadcasts] were intended to incite the German people to commit atrocities on conquered peoples"".",False,1663404745.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iormdf5,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

Granted, even that excuse is a stretch. Afghanistan **also** took place decades after the last major Soviet War (WWII, although maybe the Sino-Soviet border wars makes sense and invalidates this point?), **also** had a population that was somewhat Russophobic (though less so- Afghanistan was run by a Communist Party with the help of Soviet-trained officers and Ukraine had already gone skittish over the Crimea annexation) and armed by a West that saw it as a cause celebre, **and lost more men in six months than the Soviets lost in TEN YEARS.**

I'd argue that's more difficult than it sounds as the losses are already enormous, by any measure. Even if we discount the numbers given by Ukraine, the losses counted by Oryx are higher than several European countries combined. 

Now, russia surely has stored equipment, but from all the numbers circulated around and the fact that they are already fielding second rate vehicles, those can hardly replace what is lost, not to mention any new losses in the next 6-12 months. And I for one have zero confidence in russia being able to actually produce tanks and IFV's in required numbers.

Also, the attempts to switch the economy to war footing, beyond the political fallout might not even be possible. To build stuff you need brains, materials and machines. They *might* have the first two, but the sanctions make it hard or impossible to get the machines, even from China. Even ignoring high tech components that were directly imported.

All this time Ukraine has the entire western MIC at its disposal.

There's also the training and doctine factors. Even with some 6 months of training, russian conscripts would certainly be inferior to Ukrainians in morale, training and leadership.

What I want to underline is that, even ignoring the social/political fallout from mobilization, it would only produce a large number of low quality, low morale, badly trained, badly led, badly equipped and probably undersuplied troops.

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,xgc04v,ioshz7c,"> Anyone saying that NATO would respond to nukes with conventional weapons is either insane or a Russian troll. 

You say that because you have been conditioned to think that a nuclear strike *must* include a nuclear response or else the world order breaks or something. But what you have clearly not considered is that the only reason why this line of thinking exists, is because of the overarching principle of *proportional response*. And in most cases, the only type of proportional response to nuclear strikes is another nuclear strike, precisely because they are so powerful. 

But if you actually look at this case, a nuclear response would not be the best response at all because NATO is so incredibly powerful compared to Russia, that they can deliver a *proportional response* without resorting to nuclear weapons.

In the scenario that Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon inside of Ukraine, the most likely response would be NATO launching a large scale offensive using *air power only* and simply wipe out the Russian army in Ukraine. This will accomplish a few things: First, it will effectively end the Ukrainian conflict taking away any logical or tactical reason for Russia to engage further. Secondly, it will humiliate Putin deeply for his domestic audience as the true weakness of Russia is exposed, and lastly: it will prevent any type of ""rally around the flag"" effect that will shore up political support for Putin because Russian soil itself is never threatened.

Additionally, Russia employing nuclear weapons would very likely induce heavy responses from both China and India, who would suddenly see a risk of this previously ""far away"" conflict for themselves. Right now India and China are the only reason why the Russian economy isn't fully imploding and them employing sanctions would effectively further undermine the Putin regime. The whole narrative in Russia is ""we don't need Europe, we have China"".

All in all, actions must be directed in a way to prevent escalation but to undermine Putin. Going for a conventional kinetic response that does not directly threaten Russia will attain the best possible result. It would effectively end the Russo-Ukrainian war, there would be a high chance of the Putin regime going under and further support for hostile actions or nuclear launches inside of Russia would be absolutely zero. 

Most of all, going for a proportionate conventional response does not preclude the possibility of more escalation later. And considering the disproportionate effects of nuclear war, not reaching for nuclear weapons out of some simplistic and conditioned thinking like you are displaying, is much preferable to the alternative.",1663420450.0,1663419268.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iosg3fz,,2,18,0,18,0,0,

No because there is a principal that extends wider than just the current conflict of deterring escalation by making use of nuclear weapons wholly unacceptable.

You need to consider that the same principal would also be assumed to apply to Indian, Pakistani, Iranian or North Korean usage.

The single rods proposed are very very heavy. Until a very powerful and affordable launch option 
 exists the US won't be having any ""rods from god"" up there.  
Better still once you have a satellite up there with multiple impactors.. lets be conservative and say 10. That's suddenly a lot more mass you have to keep up in a stable orbit.  

For it to work you need to be somewhat ""over the target"". These things won't be in geosynchronos orbit as that's 35km out and frankly parking a weapon above a country gives them absolute right to shoot it down for even being there. 
 
So the realistic option is low earth orbit. About 2km up and these arnt stationary. They orbit every 2 hours. You can slightly adjust trajectory but the amount you can do that is impacted by the mass. So really you need a constellation if these things. So how happy is the world to have these flying over 10times a day? These arnt nukes.. nukes would be better as a nuke only blows if you want it to. These are like mini nukes that will always blow. 

If one is shot down, its impactors will land randomly.

The concept you are talking about is called kinetic bombardment (commonly nicknamed ""rods from god"") and was first proposed during the cold war as project Thor.  According to the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment#2003_United_States_Air_Force_proposal), it was last proposed again, by the US Air Force, in 2003 but there is NOTHING there, or anywhere else I could find on the Internet, to suggest that they've actually gone ahead and implemented it.  

While actually launching them into orbit might be possible and even affordable (at US military spending levels) using someone like SpaceX, it'd still be difficult and that isn't even the hardest part.  Even if you have the capability to get them into space, you still need to design control systems that can survive the heat of re-entry (remember, one of the reasons you use Tungsten for these is that they aren't going to be slowing down like normal spaceships coming back to Earth so even the control surfaces and computers have to be able to survive much hotter temperatures than normal spacecraft do) while keeping the rod on target.  

Of course, you can't just put this crap up into space and hope it works the first time you need it so you'd need to be able to test it.  I think EVERYONE would notice a nuclear weapon level explosion if it happened somewhere on earth and that says nothing for what would happen if their first test happened to fail (as is known to happen often enough with new, as yet untested, space technology) and the thing struck somewhere near human habitation and/or in some other country's territory...

One of those responses would be to use the B52s which are trailing the submarines to sink them, and the ones which are circling over Estonia to wipe out the sub bases, all with conventionally-armed cruise missiles and depth charges. The same goes for the mobile launchers.

In the 60s through the 80s conventional weapons were not accurate or fast enough to do this job, but they are now.

That is simply not true. If the kinetic response is proportional or greater, then it can certainly act as a deterrent. The overarching principle is always tit-for-tat, or proportionality. The conventional logic is that because nuclear weapons are so powerful, the only proportionate response is another nuclear weapon.

However, that simply is not the case in the considered scenario. A tactical nuke on Ukraine does not threaten the existence of the USA or NATO. It would, aside from the psychological effect, only achieve limited battlefield results. Destroying all Russian assets in Ukraine through conventional means would absolutely be more destructive than a tactical nuke and be an even greater than proportional response in terms of force.

As long as the cost of using nuclear a weapon outweigh the benefits, a sufficient deterrent exists - and that cost does not have to be the ultimate cost.

> You need to consider that the same principal would also be assumed to apply to Indian, Pakistani, Iranian or North Korean usage.

It doesn't, because they are not Russia. North Korea cannot induce MAD, but Russia can because they have huge numbers of large warheads and secondary strike capability. 

> Like it or not a direct nuclear response up to and including strategic decapitation followed by a demand for complete capitulation backed by further escalation is the only correct response if we want to continue to keep the genie in the bottle at least until we establish some common consensus on global disarmament.

That response is the *opposite* of keeping the genie in the bottle because the *only* response from Russia after that would be more nuclear war. That's the problem with this type of reasoning, it's circular logic. It seeks to discourage nuclear war by engaging in nuclear war. It's fucking for virginity. The only response from Russia if NATO launches a nuclear retaliation as you suggest is to shoot back with their secondary strike capacity. It will bring about the very result you're trying to avoid.

Fact is a tactical nuclear strike by Russia on Ukraine does not threaten the existence of NATO countries. It would not be a proportional response from NATO to attack Russia outright with nuclear capability, it would in fact be a huge escalation when looked at it realistically, because NATO would then be the one threatening Russia's existence when Russia did not threaten NATO's existence.

Actually, it just shows that if you are the country with the most nukes on the planet and additionally have extensive secondary strike capacity, then the immediate response to your use of a tactical nuke on a non-nuclear nation that doesn't threaten the existence of your main nuclear armed adversaries is not a full MAD style scenario.

> No matter how badly Russia would be stomped ""conventionally"", or how China and India would turn on Russia, it would still signal the world that limited nuclear usage is now an option since it didn't lead to a catastrophic global war

This reasoning is so simplistic that it hurts. Clearly if the result of Russia using a nuke would be a proportionate kinetic response and their full exclusion from the world economy, then that would be a huge warning for anyone who would like to try it in the future. If the result of a using a nuke would be having your literal shit kicked in and then your economy imploded even by your allies, then that kind doesn't suggest a great outcome for the next person that tries.

Additionally, your logic comes down to ""If one bad actor uses a nuke, we must engage into a destructive nuclear conflict or else others in the future might engage in a destructive nuclear conflict"". IE, you are arguing that we should invite a certain type of negative outcome, so that we can discourage that negative outcome from happening in the future.

Yes, because the alternative is being destroyed themselves.

>  My point was once you use a nuke it's extremely easy to use another as you have internally justified the first already.

And that point is based on faulty logic. The first nuke was a ""We want to win the war in Ukraine"" type of nuke, the second nuke will be ""We are all going to die"" type of nuke. 

>  Any response by NATO would be just what putler needs to drop another and another and so on... conventional weapons are not a proportional response to nuclear warfare. 

That again is the same conditioned response that has no underlying reasoning. A proportionate response is by definition showing an equal measure of force. The point of a tactical nuke on Russia's part would be to degrade and destroy Ukrainian units, so the destruction and degradation of Russian units would absolutely be an equal response. Additionally, there is a psychological component to the use of nuclear warfare because it represents power. That component would also have to be equaled which is why a large scale aviation offensive would be needed. NATO must bring its force to bear and demonstrate it can take out Russian units in Ukraine in a visible manner. Effectively ending the war in Ukraine in a week would show equal and greater power than the use of a nuclear weapon, as evidenced by the result.

 >A nuclear weapon (also known as an atom bomb, atomic bomb, nuclear bomb or nuclear warhead, and colloquially as an A-bomb or nuke) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb), producing a nuclear explosion. Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (""atomic"") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ).

No, because there are many nations who would not be concerned about proportional or even greater responses against their own armed forces especially if it was not on their own territory. That is rarely a negative issue for demagogues. It would not be a deterrent.

> A tactical nuke on Ukraine does not threaten the existence of the USA or NATO. It would, aside from the psychological effect, only achieve limited battlefield results.

Of course it does. You simply do not grasp the significance for future world peace of treating nuclear weapon usage as a tactical or local issue. It would open a pandora's box for future weapons proliferation amongst small nations. 

>That response is the opposite of keeping the genie in the bottle because the only response from Russia after that would be more nuclear war

You do not understand the meaning of the word deterrent. The purpose is to prevent nuclear weapon use in the first case and the only way to do that is to make sure it is clearly understood to invoke a terminal response. 

What you are proposing simply would not deter the use of nuclear weapons; it would normalise their use on battlefields and would lead inevitable to proliferation and in short order to global nuclear holocaust. It would achieve nothing.

The key point I'm making with this line of argument - and this kind of goes beyond the immediate military aid - is that the ONLY viable economic future for Ukraine is tied to the EU. Not the US. Not the UK. 

The EU. 

The EU is going to have a huge amount of influence on how this conflict ends.

Hungary is part of NATO. Yet, Orbán and his lackeys keep delaying sanctions against Russia, they do not share the values of either the EU or NATO, our media is full of unabashed, undiluted russian propaganda, and influential politicians have, on more than one occassion, expressed anti-ukrainian sentiments on public television. Also, a few months ago it was revealed that russian intelligence had had access to the entire computer infrastructure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, potentially leaking NATO intel to Russia. It also was found out that foreign ministter Szíjártó and Orbán knew of the breach, but did absolutely nothing to remedy it or to prevent Russia from gaining access. In fact, it has been speculated that when Szíjártó received the Order of Friendship from Lavrov, he already knew the russians had infiltrated the system.

All these considered, NATO at this point sees Hungary as a fifth column for russia at worst, and as a potential security liability at best. Since the US is not known for being unprepared, I believe they already have a plan for the worst case scenario, should the Ukraine war escalate to NATO countries, because there is growing concern that Orbán might even let russian troops in without putting up any fight, justifying it by claims of wanting to keep civilians safe. I do believe that in order to prevent that, NATO military would probably order Orbán and his gang to be ""forcibly removed from office"" using lethal force, if required. Then they could proceed to install a temporary government until the situation stabilizes and the threat of world war is averted. Anyone who thinks I'm exaggerating should think again. Any situation in which the war escalates into a NATO member state risks nuclear exchange between nuclear capable superpowers, with unprecedented consequences. In such a situation, no military alliance would ever risk being stabbed in the back by a fifth column. It's no coincidence that Hungary did not receive a single cent of monetary support from the latest NATO bill. We are literally the only NATO country who did not receive any of it.

If that ever happens (At this point I'm kind of hoping for it, because there is literally no other way we will ever be rid of that mass murdering piece of shit Orbán), he will be in no shape to come back to power.

> He is sanctioned by Putin to shift the Overton window to the right and make Putin seem more ""centrist and reasonable.""

Now you are focusing solely on the shifting of the overton window, but the emphasis in your statement lies in the fact that he is 1) sanctioned and 2) there to make Putin look more reasonable.

Neither of this is true. His statements do not make Putin ""reasonable"", they make Putin look incompetent. The main narrative of his statements is the undermining of the authority of the Kremlin and military regime. The, in his mind, logical conclusion of needing mobilization is a secondary effect. You point solely to the secondary effect while totally ignoring the primary - which is assaulting the authority of the regime. From the perspective of the Kremlin, any good he does in shifting the overton window is negated by the harm he is doing in undermining their authority.

You are painting him to be one of the ""controlled opposition"" guys, but that is complete nonsense. Controlled opposition happens in controlled circumstances, such as on Russian TV where the ""dissenter"" is surrounded by loyalists who can ridicule him and create a false consensus towards the regime. Controlled opposition also does not attack the authority of the government, which is a sin and taboo in fascist states, they find reasons around that, they blame NATO for interfering unjustly or allude to mistakes in vague terms. But Girkin is taking on the whole military establishment and is not mincing words, using his own platform and position.

The reason he gets away with it is not because he is controlled opposition, it's because his platform does not reach Putin's core audience and because he has his own status as a war hero in Russian military circles. He commands respect in a way that is not easily assailable, and as long as his audience remains limited to milbloggers and does not reach the general public, he does not form a sufficient large enough threat to the regime to act on it. 

So while I agree that his words can have the ultimate effect shifting the overton window, I do not believe he is sanctioned at all nor does he play the role of making Putin reasonable. He is shaming the regime, he is assaulting their authority and their competence which are cardinal sins in a fascist state. He gets away with it because of his own position and his limited audience.

That is rarely a negative issue for demagogues. It would not be a deterrent.

You are consistently applying generalizations to what is a unique situation. A proportional response means different things in different circumstances. In this particular case, taking out most of Russian's military in Ukraine would absolutely be a large deterrent as it would humiliate Putin severely and undermine his regime. 

Striking back on the other hand would create a rally around the flag effect that would only strengthen his position to engage in further nuclear warfare.

> Of course it does. You simply do not grasp the significance for future world peace of treating nuclear weapon usage as a tactical or local issue. It would open a pandora's box for future weapons proliferation amongst small nations. 

Please condescend more. I fully understand the situation, it's just that I don't engage in your oversimplification and generalization of the response. As long as the response is appropriate in the sense that the entity that engages in nuclear warfare is severely punished for it and the negatives far outweigh the positives, then you do not open pandora's box.

And again, you are ignoring that it's your solution that would be opening pandora's box as it would invite total nuclear warfare. Your logic dictates that in order to prevent nuclear war, we must engage in nuclear war. It does not make any sense.

> You do not understand the meaning of the word deterrent.

I like that you follow up this sentiment with a demonstration of your own lack of understanding of the word deterrent:

> The purpose is to prevent nuclear weapon use in the first case and the only way to do that is to make sure it is clearly understood to invoke a terminal response. 

Deterrents come in many forms, including nuclear and non-nuclear. The point of a deterrent is to, well, *deter* the adversary into engaging into unwanted behaviour. This goes far beyond nuclear doctrine and includes any type of behaviour on the international stage. And such deterrents will absolutely be mixed, with the best example being the enactment of economic sanctions for warlike behaviour. 

Nuclear deterrent specifically applies to the situation where nuclear (super) powers threaten each others existence. It does not mean that if any nuclear weapons are used anywhere on the planet, *therefore* a nuclear retaliation is warranted. A core tenet of the nuclear doctrines of both Russia and the USA is that of existential threat and self-preservation. In order for a nuclear response to be warranted, those conditions must be met. 

That is what deterrent means, not your reductive and absolutist opinion.

> What you are proposing simply would not deter the use of nuclear weapons; it would normalise their use on battlefields and would lead inevitable to proliferation and in short order to global nuclear holocaust. It would achieve nothing.

That is an unsubstantiated assumption on your part. You are reasoning from your own conclusion, rather than creating an argument to create such a conclusion. Clearly if the costs of a nuclear attack disproportionally outweigh the benefits for Russia - then surely that acts as a warning and deterrent for anyone that would follow. You just seem to think that the only fitting deterrent for the use of nuclear weapons must be other nuclear weapons, but that is a narrow line of thinking which only exists in the specific context of superpowers threatening each others existence.

In this particular case, having your entire conventional army destroyed in a matter of days would present a huge humiliation for Putin and likely topple his regime. Especially after he put all of Russia's citizens lives in danger through the use of nuclear weapons. You seem to think that for some reason this is not a deterrent, but it clearly this would be one of the worst possible outcomes for his regime. 

> Engineering the end the world does threaten the existence of NATO countries

No, it doesn't. A tactical nuclear weapon on Ukrainian soil does not threaten the existence of NATO countries. There would be no destroyed cities, no loss of life, no loss of military assets in Europe because of that. The only argument here is nuclear fallout, which while serious, is not an existential threat. Fact is, if you read the nuclear doctrine of both the US and Russia you will see that these revolve mostly around the concepts of existential threats to their own nation or population. Of course they leave themselves wiggle room on paper, but ultimately the core concept is one of self-preservation. It's simple: you nuke us, we nuke you. That concept is challenged when a tactical nuclear weapon is employed under battlefield conditions in a non-aligned country. 


It's very simple, your proposed course of action would create an existential threat for Russia, as a response to a non-existential threat to NATO. You are the one escalating in this scenario, and you would be giving Russia every reason it needs under their own nuclear doctrine to engage in full out nuclear war. It is illogical and fully based on generalized thinking and ultimately reasons from a conclusion (nuclear=nuclear) and is based on almost willfully ignoring that other, less destructive means, would still substantially deter the Putin regime from employing such tactics.",False,1663432725.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iot6zem,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

US = 19.5 combined

EU = 13.72 combined

Germany & France = 2.8 combined

Yes Europe pulling its aid would hurt, but Ukraine would still have enough weapons and money to keep fighting.  It would just hurt the civilians in destroyed areas.

And you seem to be missing something incredibly obvious in your ""bigger picture"".  Ukraine's leadership would literally rather die for principle than take the pragmatic stance.  Zelensky had Russian Spetznaz hit squads coming after him personally (back when they still had a terrifying reputation), and an offer from the US for a plane ride out.  He didn't even fucking leave Kyiv for a safer part of Ukraine.  This was before the mass graves, before the confirmed reports of rape, torture and murder, which appear to have only hardened both his and the rest of the country's resolve.  

Considering the only reason Europe is in this mess in the first place is because they made a faustian bargain with Russia for cheap energy, why wouldn't Ukrainian leadership simply decide to buy their way back into Europe's good graces and establish an economic relationship based on their own natural resources once the war is over?  

Furthermore why would Ukraine decide to settle when they're winning?  They just routed the Russians in the either Kharkhiv oblast.  They have every reason to believe they can win this war in its entirety as long as the weapons keep flowing, which they will at least until January 20, 2025 because of lend-lease.",False,1663472016.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iovn6zm,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

> While Putin is not all powerful, his opponents can easily fall out of a window or get an unexplained heart attack with absolutely zero political cost to Putin. 

Like this one. It's so simplistic it's almost naïeve. You think there are not networks of allegiances inside of Russia that Putin must account for and that he can just pick off people at will? Every action has a cost and may elicit an unintended or negative reaction. Putin, like any dictator, only holds power because his constituency allows him to keep power. This means, he has to funnel wealth, power and influence to a certain set of people so that they keep supporting him. Even inside his own in-crowd there will be networks, friendships, allegiances and circles of influence that cooperate or compete with each other. His trick is finding a balancing act to keep them both happy and afraid enough to keep supporting him. 

If he decides someone has to go, he has to act within the confines of that system. The offense such people have given must be large enough, depending on their own position he must perhaps have tried less drastic measures first, he must consider the impact of their death both short and long term. Fear is a powerful motivator but does not create real loyalty and alienating a certain faction against you may come back to haunt you in a few years. Additionally, even though they are lawless, there must be rules, customs and etiquette to create a form of predictability. There is no point participating in a system if you cannot reasonably modulate your behaviour to fit within the system. Wanton killings for small offenses would make it highly undesirable for anyone to participate, which goes against Putin's interest.

So yes, there is always a cost for Putin and it's not so simple. If he acts outside of the confines or the rules of the system they all live in, he will feel the impact of that. Killing off someone like Girkin would certainly alienate a type of faction whose support he needs and run counter to their own internal mores. Girkin is respected by many and has ""rightfully"" gained his position and status and from that position he has ""earned"" the right to be critical (up to a point). Killing him while he acts within the confines of his earned position and status, would absolutely be an issue for Putin because it would undermine the etiquette and rules they all live under.

If Girkin however ""oversteps"", then it would be different. For instance, if he were to assail Putin directly (which he does not), or he would find a large audience for such words - then suddenly he would be seen as directly challenging Putin and Putin would be validated to take him out. So as long as does not do that and stays within the confines of his status and position, he can say what he does now.",False,1663425431.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iosrxhy,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

No. There is not any real media opposition to Putin left withing Russia.

Yes, putin can and does arrest or quietly kills whomever he wants with zero repercussions.

I know these facts are tough to swallow, but Putin spent 20 years turning Russia into a totalitarian police state with total media control.

It's people who deny this who are simplistic and reductive.

Girkin can die of a heart attack tommorow or drug overdose, or whatever.  Putin can even give him a.state funeral, and no one will blink.


Putin already issued a formal warning to Z propoganda that was a little too loose:

Echoing the words of the other as a supposedly clever device is such a tired trope. If you want to argue, argue on your own basis. Worst part is, I didn't even restate my opinion, I was commenting on the flow of the discussion, not repeating my argumentation. You on the other hand in your last comment were only repeating yourself without adding anything new. So you trying to throw my own words back at me, doesn't even make sense.

Honestly I feel disappointed in you. You started off reasonably well but it took only three comments for you to reduce yourself to a ""I know what you are but what am I"" type of response. I really thought you could do better than that.",1663434178.0,1663433142.0,t3_xgc04v,t1_iot9fyt,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
