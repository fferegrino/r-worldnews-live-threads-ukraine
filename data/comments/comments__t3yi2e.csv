These are the top developments of the past few hours:

‘Dozens’ of people have died in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv after heavy bombardment by Russian forces in the past 24 hours, according to local officials. Footage shows Grad missiles raining down on the city.

The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Russia has assembled a military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for 40 miles, according to satellite images taken by a US company. A major assault on the Ukrainian capital has been expected for days.

The invasion has fallen behind schedule thanks to fierce Ukrainian resistance, and multiple equipment and logistics failures, according to a classified US briefing. The US also expects a “long and bloody battle” for Kyiv, US senator Chris Murphy said.

British prime minister Boris Johnson will fly to Nato’s border with Russia on Tuesday to meet leaders of Poland and Estonia, and British troops.

Disney has called off all upcoming theatrical releases in Russia, including Pixar film Turning Red, as international businesses continue to withdraw from Russia. Warner Bros and Sony are pulling The Batman and Morbius respectively.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN read aloud a text message exchange said to be between a Russian solider in Ukraine and his mother shortly before he was killed.

The US will expel 12 members of Russia’s UN mission, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security.

In general, be wary of heavy advertising. Verified YT accounts and news orgs are good too.

Video:

1. Make sure the time of day is correct
1. If there is a curfew, you shouldn't see people/vehicles running around
1. If there is a blackout, you shouldn't see a bunch of lights
1. Check the weather! Is it sunny? Cloudy? Snowing?
1. There may be other cameras in nearly the same location. See if you can match up things like birds flying by between them.

Audio:

1. Listen for time of day cues (In Kyiv, crows start around 5:30-6 am, the church bells first ring at 6am and every 15 minutes after)
1. Again, check the weather. You may be able to hear rain/snow.
1. Air raid sirens can be a confirmation. They do a test in the mornings, but a real warning will very likely have something posted in the live feed and on the Kyiv Independent twitter within a few minutes.
1. Edit to add: If you're hearing a bunch of gunfire/explosions and there are no reports about it in the live feed from decent sources, you're probably listening to faked or looped audio.",1646109940.0,1646109449.0,t3_t3yi2e,t3_t3yi2e,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

The initial plan was to stage some kind of false flag, declare war and race to Kyiv with VDV and motorized elements. Multiple problems occurred ,however.

1. US Intelligence spoiled the party and they no longer had surprise or the ability to stage a Georgian style false flag 
2. The UA was able to prepare and equip for a Russian invasion well ahead of time
3. Russians failed to adapt to the new reality on the ground and simply altered the original plan still hoping for a Ukrainian collapse.

It explains the bizarre use of VDV and light motorized units on the first day. These units were probably never expected to see significant resistance . Those aren't men the Russians would just throw away.  Now that they've failed to deliver the original blow they've reverted to a traditional military approach. Instead days, they'll be fighting weeks. The sign that this wasn't the original plan is the fact that this equipment (like the TOS-1) is just now making it into theater despite the intense build up. Common sense dictates these would have been some of the first assets used if Russia planned a conventional conflict.


Just my layman's theory of what happened based on a lot of reading and thinking. It's interesting that they seemingly decided the US calling them out early on didn't deserve a significant deviation from the original plan.",1646113584.0,1646113505.0,t3_t3yi2e,t3_t3yi2e,,0,72,0,72,0,0,

""This contrasts with debates within the Obama administration. Obama was against quickly arming the Ukrainians for fear of agitating Russia, and perhaps because the Ukrainian army was undisciplined. (And once so-called defensive weapons were approved for Ukraine, the transfers were slow.)

Biden was in the camp urging Obama to increase weapons transfers. Now, many Obama-era officials who took the hawkish position in advocating for sending weapons to Ukraine are in positions of power. As Biden explained in 2015, “Believe me, helping Ukraine in its defense and deterrence against Russian aggression is critical, is critical to checking further aggression down the road.”

Some background:
Kazakhstan just went through a very violent coup (the current leader ordered protestors shot in the streets). During the coup Russia sent CSTO peacekeeping forces to secure uranium mining and processing facilities (one of the country's most important industries). During this time I think Putin calculated that the new leader in Kazakhstan was just another Russian proxy. However, what really happened was that the Russian proxy leader was overthrown by a Chinese proxy leader.

Recently Russia made a request to Kazakhstan to supply forces to help with it's invasion of Ukraine. Kazakhstan didn't just refuse, they refused, blocked Russian media outlets in their country and openly stated that they don't see the LDR/DPR as separate countries. I cant imagine this made Putin very happy

Over the last few days I've noticed some interesting developments

1: Russia has announced it's relocating troops from the far east of the country to an area on the eastern border of Kazakhstan (and northern border of Georgia).
2: Reports are coming in that Kazakhstan has tested emergency sirens in Alamaty, a city on the western side of the country (same side as Russian troops)

I'm thinking Putin could be making a move on Kazakhstan to force their compliance. The new government there is probably unstable and the main protests during the coup were in Kazakhstan. Maybe Putin thinks he can march 1000 troops and 100 tanks in and take the country with little resistance? Georgia has been very quiet and is sticking with the 'keep my head down' tactic in hopes that Russia will ignore them. If Russia is going to ignore Georgia for now whats the logic for having troops on the border?

If Putin could take Kazakhstan easily, he could turn around and pitch to Russians back home that he liberated the country from a dictator that violently put down protests. Maybe he could even get them to be convinced that 'the costs are worth the wars''?

On the other hand if Kazakhstan folds and gives him troops/support for Ukraine that would work in his favor too

There is one part though that resonated, and it leads me to believe that the person managing the MFA account didn't read beyond the headline.

Assuming they're driving single file, [like in the picture here](https://twitter.com/evanhill/status/1498453745352519681/photo/2), there's ~50 vehicles.

Let's then figure out how long that distance right there is. 

[Thankfully Google Maps is a thing, and you can measure the distance between two points!](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/50.9203915,29.8874643/50.9197115,29.9010255/@50.9196956,29.8911653,729m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0) So we got 1km long. 

40 miles is about 64km. That means, if you were to use exactly the same spacing, you're talking about around 3,200 vehicles. But realistically, as the other images show, they're not all spaced that close together and since this picture is a bend, you're vehicles are going slower and closing the gap.

[So take this picture for example.](https://twitter.com/evanhill/status/1498453745352519681/photo/1) 

I can't find the location, but if I use my sausage finger to try to figure out the amount of vehicles that can fit total in that road, it's about 45 total vehicles that can fit assuming you no meaningful distance between each. But instead, you have about 7 total vehicles which means the spacing is around 6-7 vehicles rather than the one in the first picture. So that means the density is 1/7th to be conservative.

That puts us between 500 and 3200 vehicles. Midpoint of 1850.

Ever since the end of World War 2 there was a global order based on openess , liberal freedoms, free trade and this has allowed the western world to prosper unlike anything before World War 2. If we allow authoritarians, such as Russia or China to set the international tone, that order will crumble. The west has become so fat and gluttonous on the prosperity since then it seems like we have become unwilling to defend it from aggressors.  Russia is about to take over Ukraine. In a few more years China may invade Taiwan. What next? Is that what we are supposed to allow the world to descend into? The territorial wars of the 19th and early 20th century?

If we do that, the global order we have created crumbles. Furthermore, no one will trust the west. What will allying with western nations mean if they can just dump you when things get tough?

Furthermore, what about proliferation? Ukraine gave up a nuclear arsenal after the USSR fell and now they are about to lose their nation. If you are Iran or North Korea watching this unfold you now have absolutely no reason not to pursue and maintain a nuclear arsenal. Other nations may begin feeling the same way.

Ukraine isnt all thats at stake here. The entire global order is. If we arent willing to defend it, militarily if need be, then it will disappear. 

Its ironic we also worry about provocation and how some moves might cause tension with some nations and so forth but those nations dont worry.

Did China worry about provoking western allied nations in the pacific when they build up artificial islands, then claimed the water around them as Chinese territory and kicked out other nations fishing boats forcing those nations to take China to maritime court, where China lost but they just ignored the ruling? No. Did Russia care about provoking anyone when it invaded Crimea in 2014? No.

1) if the US intel agencies have a good read on Putin's every move and thought, they must also have the connections to be back channeling somewhere at very high levels of RU government and military. This is not the USSR where people are loyal to an idea. Putins entire rise was based off the idea that everything has its price. I am very curious if there is any active plotting.

2) Is there any prescedent in a country effectivly deputizing its military to another country. For example, Poland is very concerned about the heavy artillery en route to flatten Kyiv, is it possible that Poland could temporarly give sovereignty over its missile and air force to Ukraine? It would be Polish troops but operating as soliders of Ukraine. I know this happened in Korea, Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Afghanistan during the cold war. Maybe it is an option here. It doesnt seem that big of aj escalation if the EU is giving Ukraine EU warplanes and weapons already...

3) if/when Putin is toppled, the EU and US need to create a marshall plan for the rebuilding and continued development of democratic institutions for first Ukraine but more importantly, Belarus and Russia. This is to ensure that those countries can stabilize and prevent the growth of Putin like gangsters from the rubble and ensure their integration into the sphere of liberal democracy. Same with the 'stans to ensure they do not fall into Xi's orbit. One of the biggest mistakes the west made after the fall of USSR was to not do more to help the former soviet states pivot towards rule of law and democracy.",False,1646109101.0,t3_t3yi2e,t3_t3yi2e,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

* In the entire history of nukes, only two have ever been used in aggression. Both times it was the US against Japan.
* [Vasily Arkhipov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov) a Russian was around during the Cuban Missle Crisis and he prevented a nuke of getting launched.
* [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) a Russian was given the order to launch nukes from a glitch and he refused.
* Historically, it takes multiple people in the Nuclear Chain of Command to launch a nuke.

Why does this matter? We know Russia or the USSR has never launched a nukes an attack. We know of two times where a nuke could have been launched and a cooler Russian head prevailed. Therefore Russia has a history of cooler heads prevailing. 

""But Champ! If this is true, why didn't a cooler head stop the invasion?"" It's one thing to be the voice of reason out of hundreds of thousands, it's a whole other thing being the voice of reason when it comes to less than 10 people. Also, one of those options doesn't end life on the world as we know it.

""But Putin could have one loyal Sub Commander that has orders to launch a nuke if Putin dies or gets taken out of power!"" This is possible and speculation. I don't have any proof this is false, and you don't have any proof this is true. I'd like to believe that at least one person in the Nuclear Chain of Command who will be the voice of reason.

""But Putin can just make a phone call and no one can stop him!"" Unlikely. Historically reason you want to make launching a nuke difficult is so launching one can't be hacked or social engineered.",False,1646108471.0,t3_t3yi2e,t3_t3yi2e,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

You're right. There's a lot of hypocrisy coming out of the west, especially the United States. The big difference though, in my opinion, is that the West is trying, through their actions. There are measurable ways in which the humanitarian and social policies have transformed societies, albeit slowly. People are able to feel and be who they really are without fear of social ridicule, for the most part, and they're definitely not getting killed by the government for it. There's been a lot of progress made in employment equity, mental health, and personal freedom.

Public sentiment on things often pointed out has finally shifted the other way in the last 5-10 years along with support, both political and financial. Away from Israel, from warmongering, from China, from greed, from might is right, from wealth is power. Change, progress, the growth of our collective mindset, it happens slowly, over time, like aging. Too slowly to recognize from one day to another, but just look at an old photograph. 

Unlike Russia, Western countries are barely recognizable from where they were 20 years ago. There were a lot of missteps and mistakes, there still are, and people and governments are still not taking responsibility or being held accountable. But even though they may not always admit to a mistake, they never claim to be infallible, or demand outright to not be questioned, and they are DOING better. Because, in my opinion, trying, practicing, is the whole point - you can't shit on someone when they start learning to play piano because they can't play Beethoven. I mean you can, but then you're an asshole, even more so if you can't play it yourself. Thankfully, most people don't want to be assholes. But to those who delight in mistakes, ridicule progress, and rub people's noses in their failures we can say: I can't play Beethoven yet, but I'm committed to learning. And in that way maybe inspire them to come to an understanding that change is possible, both in ourselves and in other people.",False,1646111911.0,t3_t3yi2e,t3_t3yi2e,,0,-6,0,-6,1,0,

If Ukraine continues to be subject to war crimes, an intervention is really the only *moral, strategic, and winning* option.

1.	NATO’s credibility as a vanguard power, as a defender of human rights, will be annihilated. They will be slowly isolated. They are a defender of human rights, with nukes.
2.	If the people who hold launch authority are convinced they have an off-ramp better than nuclear Armageddon, they will take it.
3.	Evil wins if they say “We have nuclear weapons.”

The West has credibility in issuance of pardon: they will see to it that those who prevent such acts from taking place are expressly forgiven, because while Putin may not have a future, there are many who will.

It may not toe the line, but I speak for people, more than a few, when I say: *we will live life being held hostage by crazy people, if we do not act.* A precedent will be laid. Non nuclear powers will *run* to produce their own nuclear weapons. NPT won’t be worth the paper it’s written on.

When Ukrane starts winning, and pushing back, Putin just needs to press the button and then this whole planet is gone right? There's nothing stopping him. And at this point, he's running out of things to lose. Ukraine is destroying his army, the rest of the world is sanctioning him to shit and banning exports. He's legit got nothing to lose. 

I'm sure there's another answer. But in my eyes.

But if the entire convoy does get destroyed, there's only one reason, NATO. This produces a better outcome for Putin since he can claim he's no longer the aggressor, it was NATO behind it all!

I read an essay a while ago. Can't remember the name. Basic gist was; Japan went to war in WW2 for resources and economic reasons, essentially. Decades of prep, arguably over half a century of prepping for war. Got destroyed, massive deaths, incredible suffering, total devastation (not just Japan).

After the war they tried the economic approach, and within a decade and a bit had accomplished most if not all the resource objectives that the millitary had originally been trying to secure. With no war crimes or nukes or any of that. Became a major international player like they had wanted, *in spite* of still recovering from the war.

It's minimizing to say that he's like a spoiled child trying desperately to get everything he wants because he's certainly more calculating than that,  but the mindset isn't too far off.

This might be controversial, but I think the limit should be a a couple of dozen or so low yield strategic nukes, just enough to devastate but not destroy an enemy's cities for deterent purposes.  It should be noted at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the US went overkill on nukes, as in they had tens of thousands of them, today the stocks are around 20% of that number - still too much but we have come a long ways.  

A lot of our post-nuclear war analysis comes from those Cold War numbers, and there isn't a scientific consensus on how a nuclear winter would actually work since the Earth has never actually experienced one.

1. The outburst on live TV at his high-ranking subordinate, who is shown quivering in fear. But metadata analysis showed that was a pre-recorded segment, not live at all. So why show it?

2. The convenient leaks from the meeting at the Urals, which report him as becoming increasingly unhinged, which are reminiscent of scenes ripped straight from the movie Downfall, only to be distributed widely over social media. 

3. The photo of his two top generals looking grave and dismayed at the nuclear alerts. Then the subsequent, highly publicized firing of one of them.

After the fall of the USSR we probably thought things will be better. Companies invested in Russia, Finland financed public projects in Vyborg and St Petersburg. 

Probably the plan was more thinking along the lines: incorporate them into the western economy, and they will have more to gain by working with us than against us. This is probably also one reason why Germany opted for natural gas from Russia instead of more self-sustaining sources of energy. Involve them, and they will gain more by being friends.

Obviously Russia would still have more to gain from being friendly and doing trade like any normal country. But their dictator has a weak ego and gets aroused by violence. They have already lost.

And this saddens me. Things were quite normal with Russia for a while - lots of tourism both ways, trade, investments. All gone and the trust may be impossible to repair. It would take absolutely sweeping changes in Russia for relations to start healing.

My thinking is that China would really like that to continue, and a large European conflict could lead to increased militarism and vigilance amongst western countries, as well as Japan, South Korea and potentially Taiwan. Would not surprise me if they’re trying to keep this thing reasonably distant from themselves unless/until they can really turn it to their advantage. In the meantime, flying under the radar gives them time to continue building regional power. India is really China’s rival in the region, and they have economic ties with Russia that could negatively affect them as this continues.

I could be completely and utterly wrong though, I am no expert.

Can a dictatorship theoretically not just maintain, but also raise a strong army with little capital investment? Sure. Skimp on salaries and conscript the populace--that assures low morale. Give them second or third-hand equipment. Rely on 20-year old ammunition stockpiles and do nothing to replenish them (and, oh, since we're limited on ammo, then live fire training is reserved only for weapons qualification).

Armies require thinking meat sacks. Low pay makes the meat sack less willing to sac its meat, so to speak. Poor training, rations, and equipment ensures the meat sack is lethal, but only in a nominal sense, and not for any sustained period of time. Long story short, keep the meat sacks happy and well supplied, and they'll perform. Until we see robot armies on the battlefield, the truth is that troop morale is one of the most vital cornerstones to success.

Now, when there are so many troops that you can afford to lose them in droves, the calculus changes a little. Throw enough meat at a problem and eventually you might actually win. But, at what cost? Is the civilian population willing to bear that cost? Are you able to survive a pissed off population?

So, how do sanctions fit in here? The Russian economy is going to have to focus somewhere to maintain balance, and it can't focus everywhere. Too much focus on the military, by trying to maintain a balance of salary and decent equipment and training means it's going to have to sacrifice somewhere else, domestically. With drastic measures they might be able to keep one population happy, but certainly not everyone.

Still have lots of old military hardware in store. Losing 20 fighter jets when it was estimated to have 4000+ is kind of hardly scratching the surface. 

But Russia before this war already face financial challenges to renew its military to latest and best. For example, it cannot build enough of its best T14 tanks. 

With the devaluation in Ruble and cutoff from technology stacks (eg computer chips manufacturered by TSMC), it will get more challenging.

One possible explanation is corruption has gripped the arm forces. If this were true, with financial instabilities, it might get worse.

Closet historian here.  You asked for history buffs, so I might be somewhere on the low end able to answer.

My take is going to be dependant on how caged Putin ends up feeling and when his new reality sets in.  Leaders of this magnitude tend to have an idealist viewpoint and when that viewpoint is challenged, and albeit proved to be in a situation impossible to overcome.  Some leaders in history, but very few, fought to its finality (think every option is on the table).  Mostly everyone (the vast vast majority) just gave up (suicide).

In all cases, albeit except in super rare cases, someone in Putin's situation did not win the war or even acquire a stalemate.

Wars come and go based off economics.  Religious belief or idealistic belief, at least in history was always the scapegoat.    Russia economically was most likely at a breaking point, which is why this war ever happened in the first place.  That's my viewpoint, I'm cool with being wrong.",False,1646109556.0,t3_t3yi2e,t1_hyvfzm6,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The predictable thing would have been the Russia actually being competent with Ukraine suppressed by weekend's end and China taking advantage of the West's distraction to attempt to seize Taiwan (win or lose) due to the nonstop saber rattling in the past few years.

Instead this is the biggest upset seen in ENTIRE modern era.  Russia turns out to be a paper tiger only backed by nuclear weapons stopping this international image disaster from becoming a nation ending existential crises with a by far superior NATO (which most thought was just slightly ahead instead of a chasm of a power difference) to the west and a frenemy to the east in China that sure as hell would not mind munching on the Russian far east.

If it had been the original scenario above, it would have been a icy ""alliance"" of convenience between the two major authoritarian powers and this war would have sparked the start of a new cold war.

Now we have a unpredictable powderkeg where Russia is too weak militarily to ever be taken seriously by NATO again beyond the threat of nuclear weapons which Putin will absolutely leverage to its remaining usefulness.  China or more accurately Xi is likely on the fence waiting for how this plays out because of this unprecedented united front never seen since the end of WW2.  

If he wanted to seize Taiwan in the chaos, he lost his chance with Putin's fuck up not helped that China has a horrible public image and the West and their Asian allies have had some intent to breakaway from China.  Xi now has a choice to go down with the sinking ship and throw its hat with Putin and be isolated to oblivion as well or play it cool with the West (while also keep trying to erode away the West's unity).  This erosion that Xi and Putin have been doing for years if not decades have left their mark but again this is a unprecedented level of unified action that neither had counted on; thinking that we were weak because we were democratic and love arguing with one another.

How this plays out from here on out or if this chapter of humanity will end in nuclear hellfire with Putin's deathgrip on the nuclear launch, is unknown and will have to be decided by the powers that be.

For issue of Ukraine itself, it will drag on.  Maybe a week more, maybe a month, maybe a year but you can sure as hell count on many more dead Russians and Putin beginning scorched earth policies because if he can not have it, no one will.  How much the West can skirt around to assist the Ukraine especially throwing back at Putin how much he cheated and skirted around his own many dirty misadventures, we shall see and see how much Putin can and will attempt to back up his partially toothless threats and how much the Russian people and oligarchs will tolerate his death ride to hell.",False,1646110496.0,t3_t3yi2e,t1_hyvfzm6,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

2) Not that I'm aware of and it would be extremely dangerous, because it would be NATO personnel stepping in in all but name

3) Assuming it does happen I agree. If his regime does fall over this, Putin will have successfully managed to fully place a third superpower in the global scene except it will be the EU, and turning Russia in its sphere of influence will be a massive blow to China's ambitions.

2) NATO countries getting involved with active military would mean NATO was at war with Russia. Not going to happen unless they are attacked directly.

3) This could work in eastern Europe, but getting involved in central Asia, especially with NATO expansion, would provoke China and potentially spark subsequent conflicts in Asia.

I feel that if Putin steps down, it will have been on his own accord. You may be right though, and it may happen, but it's a few too many steps ahead. Any situation where the Russians are fired upon from nato craft or fired on from nato country for any reason will be considered act of war, so whatever the ramifications are for that.

Not every country in the world has endless resources to shower on its military-industrial complex. Most countries have very mild defense budgets in comparison to the United States, which spends more than the next 11 top spenders combined. The US military's stated goal is to be able to wage multiple simultaneous wars on multiple continents. Most other countries do not devote that level of spending to their militaries, investing only enough to make it so that their neighbors can't just waltz in and take them over. 

And the most expensive part of a military is the air force, where a single plane can cost more than an entire company of tanks. Consequently, most nations don't have a terribly large air force, and what they do have will largely be defensive in nature, designed to maintain air superiority over their territory rather than ground-strike craft to attack columns of enemy material.

Other countries having nuclear weapons. If they get backed into the corner that much, they are more likely to concede land/military might - what you call ""rotting away"" - to alleviate sanctions, or choose live with them. They are not likely to just nuke everyone when the risk is getting nuked themselves.

&#x200B;

Best case scenario is that Russia gives up on Ukraine and goes home after the resistance is deemed to have cost them too dearly. Over time they will have to cut back on their military or relinquish land/fuel/money etc to alleviate sanctions. This is **very unlikely** however given that Russia is not likely to just ""give up"", their army is still overwhelmingly larger than Ukraine's.

The most likely scenario is that in a few more weeks/months, Russia will take control of Ukraine, instigating a puppet government. They will then be able to pressure their neighbors into loosening their sanctions and will be able to claim that they ""left Ukraine alone"" by leaving and funding the new government. A bit like how Hong Kong is meant to be independent from China, but their elected officials are appointed by Beijing and non-compliance is illegal.

From NATO's perspective, they're not going to risk nuclear holocaust for the honor of a smouldering crater, but they WILL create economic conditions that cripple Russia's ability to rebuild its military so they can't do this again.

I saw on some news channels (slavic) the other day that the general consensus and feeling is that foreigners are leaving and taking their money with them

Including nurses teachers etc

There's an overall feeling of betrayal that these folks are leaving Ukraine in the dust. 

Another channel addressed (again slavic)the viral tweet stating that they didn't give a shit about their skin colour but that they enjoyed their great education system and cheap housing to just leave their jobs and infrastructure hanging. (Similar sentiment but this one directly addressed the tweet) 

Personally, I'd dip too, but I think it's important to really change the lense and view. We are almost perpetuating the imperialist idea by trying to make another people adhere to a western standard. 

Those Africans no doubt felt singled out, persecuted and racially profiled. The reality is the people are angry because alot of them no longer have a home to return to, but those foreigners do.

Ghost of Kyiv. Russia lost some planes, maybe 3, maybe 5. Maybe it was by one dude, maybe by their entire air force. Hard to verify. The story is great and unites people.  When the whole ""the airplane fought back against the terrorists"" story came out for flight 93, what was the line, ""Let's Roll"", I was convinced we shot it down, but so what. It's a good story that they fought back and it's a sickening idea that we had to shoot it down to keep it from hitting the Whitehouse. So I learned to believe it, and to tell the truth, 20 years later it seems even more believable (that the passengers fought back) than it did at the time. Good story, they died heroes, probably true, doesn't harm anyone if it isn't, so why not. So here we got a Red Baron and that's nice. Maybe it was actually two pilots. Maybe 5. Until he goes public and gets an endorsement deal and it turns out his younger brother actually did the shooting and never got the credit for anything in life, including this, it's not an issue.

For the island, the audio made it pretty clear the ""go fuck yourselves"" was followed by massive guns and shit. Russia wasn't exactly telling us their latest info and they were presumed capture or dead, probably dead. So they ended up captured. It's not really a false story, just a guess that wasn't quite right.

There will be more of this. We aren't watching a scripted story where the real truth is up to JK Rowling. We're watching real life and people are taking in facts and drawing conclusions. 

Is the dress blue and yellow or black and white or whatever. Yanni laurel. That's going to happen in war.

Understand the flow of information good and bad. Something happens, someone reports it, someone repeats it, it gets twisted a bit.

I've seen so many spots events in slow motion instant replay from 7 different angles and we still can't tell exactly what happened. This is war and we don't have anything that precise to go off of.

These are the top developments of the past few hours:

‘Dozens’ of people have died in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv after heavy bombardment by Russian forces in the past 24 hours, according to local officials. Footage shows Grad missiles raining down on the city.

The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Russia has assembled a military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for 40 miles, according to satellite images taken by a US company. A major assault on the Ukrainian capital has been expected for days.

The invasion has fallen behind schedule thanks to fierce Ukrainian resistance, and multiple equipment and logistics failures, according to a classified US briefing. The US also expects a “long and bloody battle” for Kyiv, US senator Chris Murphy said.

British prime minister Boris Johnson will fly to Nato’s border with Russia on Tuesday to meet leaders of Poland and Estonia, and British troops.

Disney has called off all upcoming theatrical releases in Russia, including Pixar film Turning Red, as international businesses continue to withdraw from Russia. Warner Bros and Sony are pulling The Batman and Morbius respectively.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN read aloud a text message exchange said to be between a Russian solider in Ukraine and his mother shortly before he was killed.

The US will expel 12 members of Russia’s UN mission, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security.
