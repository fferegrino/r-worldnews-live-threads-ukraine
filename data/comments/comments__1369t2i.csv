Russian Railways has said rail deliveries to the Black Sea port of Taman will be restricted until further notice.

Although the company did not give a reason for the restrictions, it came after Russian officials said a fuel depot had caught fire near a crucial bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea. 

In the early hours of this morning, flames and black smoke billowed over large tanks labelled ""flammable"". 

Taman's oil transhipment hub lies across the Kerch Strait from Crimea and has the capacity to handle 20 million tonnes of crude oil, oil products and liquefied petroleum gas a year.

The Crimean Bridge carrying road and rail traffic across the Kerch Strait was damaged in an attack last October, and has yet to be fully restored.

What I think has happened; 

1. The attack is not believable and actually has bad optics for Russia. Even staunch prominent russian milbloggers aren't 100% on board. So I really don't think it's a planned false flag.


2. It's highly unlikely that Ukraine was able to fly two drones from Ukraine to Moscow and reach the Kremlin. It's silly to think that's the case. A country who has been preparing for a strike on Moscow for close to a decade, let's two drones get that close? If that IS the case, Russia really REALLY is a paper tiger.


3. What I think has happened. Russian / Ukrainian partisans operating inside Russia has launched the drones. This matches their civilian level capabilities in terms of explosive power. Russia is left with a choice, which is supported by the time they took to report these attacks. Do they admit dissent is growing inside Russia to their general population? No. Russia is a very authoritarian state with strict measures around the war. Their other option; Blame Ukraine and the west. Drums up a bit of support. Justifies further barbarism to their population. Downside being it's still bad optics to the few fanatics, the general population won't care.

The 4th of May is an extremely important day in the Netherlands, almost sacred. Its the day where we remember all our war deaths since WW2 (but espescially WW2).

One rightwing politician who is leading in the polls and won last provincial elections said on Twitter that she won't come to meet Zelensky because on the 4th May we remember 'our death'. An awful tweet that got a lot of attention.

On behalf of the Dutch (forgive me this arrogance) I want to emphasis she isn't representing the Netherlands with this statement. We are actually very proud to receive President Zelensky, especially on this day. Yes, the 4th of May is sacred, but that President Zelensky is here makes the day even more special. We remember 'our deaths' so horrors like previous wars don't happen again. And at the moment they are happening again, among others in Ukraine. Zelensky, president of a country in war, a war that is not just fought for Ukraine but also for Europe, the Netherlands, could not have chosen a better day to be here.

Fortunately the politician in question is receiving a lot of backlash, also of people usually supporting her, with confidence I can say that the Netherlands is proud to support Ukraine and Zelensky. And remember 'our deaths' so we know why we have to support Ukraine all the way!

Moscow claims Ukraine struck the Kremlin. The truth is likely worse. A very good writing  by The Atlantic.

&#x200B;

>Here‚Äôs what we know: Early this morning, two drones struck inside the Kremlin (which is actually a walled complex that surrounds several government buildings and ancient churches and palaces). The New York Times has verified three videos, two of which appear to show ‚Äúa drone flying toward and exploding over the Kremlin Senate,‚Äù which houses the president‚Äôs executive office, and the other showing the dome of the Senate building on fire.That‚Äôs as much as we know.  
>  
>The Russians, of course, are blaming the Ukrainians, and claiming that the strike was an attempt to kill Russian President Vladimir Putin, who at the time was at his compound in the Moscow suburb of Novo-Ogarevo, Russian officials said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied this charge and specifically denied targeting Putin: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt attack Putin or Moscow,‚Äù he said during his visit to Finland. ‚ÄúWe fight on our territory.‚ÄùBut who would (or could) launch such an attack? I see four possibilities in ascending order of likelihood‚Äîwith the caveat that I am drawing on jumbled and partial information, so treat this as a preliminary and tentative list.  
>  
>**First**, it is possible that the Ukrainians or some Ukrainian team in Moscow could have used drones. But it is unlikely, because it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. An attack on the Kremlin might be an obvious symbolic move, but a demonstrative strike on an empty building at night would be a waste of already strained Ukrainian intelligence resources, and would likely annoy the Americans and NATO in the bargain. (Also, as one former U.S. defense official noted, the Ukrainians are pretty good at tracking Putin, and if reports of the event are accurate, they likely knew he wasn‚Äôt in the building.)  
>  
>**A second possibility** is that Russian intelligence and military authorities got wind of a plot by some group to strike the Kremlin, and then let it happen as a way to goad Putin into using even more force in Ukraine. My friend Nick Gvosdev, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, reminded me today that Russian spooks are not exactly averse to such cold-blooded moves: In 2002, terrorists took hostages at a theater in downtown Moscow, and he noted that there have been accusations over the years that the intelligence services knew it was coming and yet let it happen, as a means of strengthening possible demands for more power to deal with such events.Still, this seems like an overly complicated explanation. The Russian army needs more ‚Äúcannon meat,‚Äù to use the Russian expression, but even the Defense Ministry probably realizes that their campaigns to dragoon more men are reaching their limit.  
>  
>The intelligence services have been in hot water ever since they misled Putin about the chances of success in Ukraine, and they might want to use a bomb hitting the Kremlin to press their claims for more resources and power‚Äîbut they also run the risk that a drone strike in the heart of the city would look like yet more evidence of their incompetence.  
>  
>**It is also possible** that the strike on the Kremlin came from Russian dissidents, especially if it was done with some sort of crude, jerry-rigged device. Again, unlikely but not impossible, especially with social anger rising over waves of conscription that were supposed to take place out in the Russian boondocks and never touch Moscow and St. Petersburg.  
>  
>In this case, the intelligence services would have every incentive to blame Kyiv, because the only thing worse for them than failing to stop a hit from a Ukrainian commando team would be an assassination attempt by Russians right under their noses. Russia is already functionally a fascist state, and a plot to bomb the Kremlin and kill the president might well be the spur for the kind of iron-fisted mass repression Putin and his advisers have avoided until now.  
>  
>**But the most disturbing possibility** is that this is a Russian government put-up job from start to finish. There are several reasons this makes more sense than other explanations.First, an attack on the Kremlin would give Putin the rationalization he‚Äôs been seeking for some kind of dramatic and murderous action that might not make much military sense, but that would destabilize Ukraine and unsettle the world on the eve of a major Ukrainian counteroffensive.  
>  
>The Russians, I believe, are dreading this coming operation, and want to change the narrative at home and abroad. I have no idea what Putin has up his sleeve, but even on his better days, he is prone to strategically idiotic moves. He might try to drag Belarus into the war, he could make more nuclear threats, or he could even order redoubled efforts to kill Zelensky.  
>  
>In any case, faking a drone attack would fit into the long-standing Russian affinity for ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù operations. Though conspiracy theorists in the United States often trumpet unfounded claims of false flags, professional intelligence services do conduct such operations, and Moscow has been particularly fond of them all the way back to the Soviet period. The series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999, for example, that became the pretext for escalation in Chechnya, were almost certainly orchestrated by the secret services (a possibility so disturbing that I and other Russia experts were loath to accept it‚Äîbut which is now, in my view, undeniable).  
>  
>And in the past year, the Russians warned that the Ukrainians were going to unleash a ‚Äúdirty bomb,‚Äù a ludicrous claim that even led China to give the Kremlin some stink eye for playing around with nuclear threats.This drone strike looks like the same play, only without nuclear materials. A terrorist attack in the capital would be a pretext for the Russians to warn the world that this time, they‚Äôre really going to take the gloves off. Ukrainian officials are worried that this is exactly the Russian plan. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, told the BBC that the incident indicated Russia could be ""preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation"" in Ukraine.  
>  
>That‚Äôs a pretty chilling possibility, considering that the Russian campaign plan at this point already consists of indiscriminate war crimes.""Something is happening‚Äù over the skies of the Russian Federation, Podolyak said, ‚Äúbut definitely without Ukraine‚Äôs drones over the Kremlin.‚Äù At this point, I agree, but we‚Äôll soon know more‚Äîand we should brace for what‚Äôs coming from Russia‚Äôs desperate dictator.",False,1683152387.0,t3_1369t2i,t3_1369t2i,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

Expect minor gains and variable operations, it will take time to shape the battlespace for success and find where that success can be achieved.

It will likely slowly start to unfold with a bit of push-pull initially and then at some point it will expand if Ukraine can get the results it wants from these initial stages.

Optimistically there is room for a range of successes depending on Russia's ability to hold or react to potential breakthroughs.

I'm still thinking mid-late May, more biased towards late May.

If we start seeing larger scale shaping operations, it's a good indicator but also keep in mind such Ops can be quite long, a month and sometimes longer. We've seen a little of this but nothing significant in scale, at least from what I've seen.

Best case scenario for Russia is if it internally collapses and splits along the ethnic or administrative boundaries.

Until Russia is a big one state with own view on the state of world affairs, it won't be playing along the common rules.

It could just be a good propaganda reason for Putin's absence at the parade. This comes with admitting Russian air defense sucks after Putin already made a big deal of needing to improve. It's very inconsistent with the past year of Russian propaganda, but more consistent with propaganda Russia used prior to 2021. 

Prior to 2021, Russia would prepare the population for big changes through propaganda. In 2021 Russia did not prepare the population for this invasion, which was unusual. There is some propaganda going around Russia now, seemingly to prepare the population in the event Ukraine's counter offensives are successful. Please don't read too much into this... unless the propaganda shifts a lot more than it has thus far.

Edit: Even if Russian propaganda shifts to begin admitting more failures, it could all be justification for further mobilization. I doubt Russia will declare war, and somewhat doubt they would announce further mobilization. More likely just examples to point out in case the stealth mobilization that is already occuring gets questioned, or to keep it from being questioned in the first place.

My early memories of observing war date to the first gulf war.  When the air war started there were reports about Saddam Hussein having deep bunkers impenetrable to normal bombs.  American engineers scrambled to fix that shortage.  The first bunker buster bombs were designed, manufactured, deployed, and dropped before the ground war started a few weeks later.  I have repeatedly heard it cited as a reason Hussein was willing to surrender 4 days after the ground war started.  

I have never heard it as controversial.  Only as ""wow look what we were able to do"" or as an extension of ""fortification does not work"".  I remember remarks about radar tracking pieces of concrete flying into the stratosphere after the munitions stored in the bunkers exploded.  These stories are not told with even a remote hint of remorse.  In contrast there are talks about deplete uranium.  We bombed Baghdad's water treatment plant.  Scared and dehydrated Iraqi soldiers scrambling to surrender gives people a moment of pause.  Americans see plenty of room to empathize with soldiers who are drafted into an army.  

I have not looked specifically but I think state department policy is to defer to the US Air Force.  I have heard Air Force generals insisting that they will commit to nothing.   It will entirely depend on circumstance.  It is not likely the first thing they will do because suppression of air defense and damaging communication networks would usually take priority.

This pathetic symbolism is what a dictator with no morals does to try to create support while he‚Äôs burying his own country in the name of delusions.

If you believe this is real then you‚Äôve never known reality.

It's actually incredible how well the information warfare has worked on this to convince people over here that Russia has no motive, when they have at several different clear and obvious motives (and opportunities).  
  
The simplest explanation IMO is that it was meant to ""bring the war to European soil.""  It was supposed to shake the resolve of european leaders heading into the winter without Russian gas.  It was supposed to be a massive headline which made cold EU citizens think twice about continuing to support Ukraine.  
  
When that didn't work, Russia started pushing the idea that the US blew up the pipeline, which was not delivering any gas, to prevent it from delivering gas.  Which it already was not doing.  Ostensibly so that the EU would buy American gas.  Which they were already doing.  Even if they got one major european power to believe this nonsense, it would have created a crack for them to exploit.  Good thing european leaders are smarter than redditors.  
  
Another motivation for Russia could be domestic propaganda.  ""Look at how the Americans attacked Russian infrastructure!""  
  
Or As you say, to send a message to the Oligarchs to get in line.  
  
Or it's possible that whatever they were actually planning failed and the explosives went off accidentally/too early.  
  
Or maybe the goal was to frame Ukraine thinking it would make EU leaders withdraw support. 
  
The point is that blowing up a pipeline in the Baltic sea is very on brand for Russia - it's a big, visible, blunt and clumsy way of doing whatever it is they were hoping to accomplish.  Meanwhile, it is not on-brand at all for the US, which tends to go about industrial sabotage much more deliberately.

Especially because it had a self sustaining profitable agriculture base.  But, because of the economic dominance of the US, their government took out loans denominated in USD.  The repayment of the USD denominated loans eventually triggered multiple currency collapses.  Destroying the economy of a rising power.

Worse, the Argentinian Gov. eventually issued loans under US Law on the bond markets in NY.  This has caused Argentina to lose a significant amount of national sovereignty to US judges sitting in the federal courts of NY City.

Not if the point of the attack is symbolic. The drones did not have enough explosives to damage the building in a significant way. If those ‚Äúfireworks‚Äù were the only explosives they had available, then yeah, that would be what they used. Partisans have used far less in the past.

The first Rammstein defense meeting took place on 26 April 2022, two full months after the invasion had begun and after Ukraine had won the battle for Kyiv and forced Russia to retreat from the north.
