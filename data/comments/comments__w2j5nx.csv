>Six months into the war the Russian account with 150k followers finally starts figuring things out.

Translated text:

>Judging by the number of UAF planes claimed by our Ministry of Defence to be shot down in the sky of Ukraine by fighters and air defence, it can be said with confidence that on 24 February in the enemy's aerodromes a near-zero number of functioning aircraft was destroyed, which in turn once again confirms the assumption that Ukrainians were well aware of the day and the hour of the SMO.

>And here a number of mainly rhetorical questions arises, to which the answers I hope have already been found.

>1. How, and from whom did Ukrainians find about the time ""X""? Was the data obtained with technical means of intelligence, or were they obtained with a thousand year old methods? Was this source of information blocked?

>2. If we knew they knew, why weren't the objective adjusted?

>3. If we didn't know they knew, then why we didn't know?

>4. If the enemy aircraft was secured from the strike in advance, does this mean that the rest of the troops and weapons, including air defence systems, were also moved to pre-prepared positions in the same way?

>5. In such case, what the Air-Radar missiles fire at?
 
>6. What was the real effectiveness of the first strike?

>Answers to these and other rhetorical questions, and more importantly conclusions made from them, is the key to our victory.

LOL.

🪖 On Monday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  This doesn’t mean nothing happened and [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1549190506927759361), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549070573883514882.html) and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549232768885850113.html) will be happy to lead you through the weeds.

🍄 Thanks to HIMARS, Ukraine, in their [daily briefing with the US](https://twitter.com/GeneralStaffUA/status/1549104740692279299), believes that the defensive lines are now “controlled” (meaning they think it will be very difficult for russia to advance anywhere in the country).  The US Secretary of Defense also had [some very good news](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1549108361706225665), which we will find out about sometime in the near future.  There is little doubt HIMARS is having an [impact](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549084047309152257.html) on russia’s ability to prosecute the war especially with explosions [like these](https://twitter.com/Mike_Eckel/status/1548923111168282624)!

🔥 It was kind of expected, but Gazprom [declared “Force Majeure”](https://twitter.com/SolomonPhoenix_/status/1549077095396941826) (meaning circumstances beyond its control) to break the gas delivery contracts in Europe.  The Nord pipeline apparently will not be resuming operations.  This is exceptionally bad news for Germany who is scrambling to get its reserves up before the winter.

💰 putin admitted that Moscow faces [colossal difficulties](https://twitter.com/drogon_dracarys/status/1549030236834111489) accessing high-tech goods.  Also, russia fined Google’s bankrupt russian subsidiary [$382 million USD](https://twitter.com/CGSDemocracy/status/1549212590760345600) for not removing content banned in russia.

👉 On Monday, in an attempt to shoot down HIMARS rockets, russia [shot down its own SU-34](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1548962354595069958) (possibly [a rare](https://twitter.com/vcdgf555/status/1549014699710115840) one) over [Alchevsk](https://twitter.com/muya_gichigi_ll/status/1548981314547851265), proving that russia’s air defense systems are perfectly [adequate to shoot down russian aircraft](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549064887900463110.html), but need some work to take out HIMARS missles.

👉 russia [bombed Odessa](https://twitter.com/Archer83Able/status/1549143662264832008) on [Monday](https://twitter.com/by_Ukraine/status/1549156139438428161), and I’m mentioning this here because grain corridors are never going to be a thing while russia can arbitrarily bomb the city and threaten ships docking to pick up goods.  In the [meantime](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1549136677905596420) russia keeps [stealing Ukrainian grain](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1549165214284775426).  

👉 Armenia and  Azerbaijan made the news today.  Both of these nations are being courted by the west and russia alike.  Armenia made the news because the heads of intelligence of russia, Iran and the U.S. all [made an appearance](https://twitter.com/NeilPHauer/status/1549146298120544258) in the past week.   Azerbaijan made the news because the [EU made a deal](https://twitter.com/spriteer_774400/status/1549009515835686913) to more than [double the amount](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1549063461174661121) of gas it buys by 2027.  As an aside, Azerbaijan’s gas [flows through pipelines](https://twitter.com/enifti/status/1548991834453680130) controlled by Armenia and Turkey.

👉 Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska [arrived in the US](https://twitter.com/AP/status/1549174718565056513) for a high profile trip at the invitation of First Lady Jill Biden whom she will meet with today. 

👉 Baykar stated it [will not sell](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1549112658229608449) any of its Bayraktar drones to russia.

👉 In the Kherson area, soon to be under siege by Ukraine, russia has moved its troops and ammunition to the more [densely populated areas](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1549091826962862080) of town.  

👉 The first [US Abrams tanks arrived](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549060917849198593.html) in Poland.  These top of the line tanks are what is allowing Poland to send so many of its older tanks to Ukraine.

👉 Ukraine attacked an area near the [Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1549052085005561862).  Reportedly [a base](https://twitter.com/GirkinGirkin/status/1549050061971042309) with a large number of russians was stationed at the strike zone.

👉 You too [can afford a Lada](https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1548992984946974720) if you let your loved one get killed in Ukraine fighting for glorious russia!  Some restrictions might apply, not [every family](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1549018515285368832) with deceased loved ones will be eligible, but you might get a household appliance anyway!

📡 Under the radar: I can’t find very much information on this but 9 russian occupiers in Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear reactor in Europe are [hospitalized and some killed](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1549136934085312519) after an “incident”.   Ukraine is the first nation in the world with a peaceful Nuclear program [to face military hostilities](https://twitter.com/djysrv/status/1547573249361424384).

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been [shrinking its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: [a stalemate](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288) that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 July 2022
 
- Russia continues to commit what are nominally six separate armies to its Donbas offensive. At full strength, before the invasion, these formations were established for around 150,000 personnel. In recent weeks, Russia has often operated with company-sized groupings of around 100 personnel when undertaking offensive operations in any one sector at a time.

- Russia has struggled to sustain effective offensive combat power since the start of the invasion and this problem is likely becoming increasingly acute. As well as dealing with severe under-manning, Russian planners face a dilemma between deploying reserves to the Donbas or defending against Ukrainian counterattacks in the southwestern Kherson sector.

- Russia's stated immediate policy objective is to seize all of Donetsk Oblast. While Russia may still make further territorial gains, their operational tempo and rate of advance is likely to be very slow without a significant operational pause for reorganisation and refit.

Day 146 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was yet again a pretty quiet day, Kharkiv itself wasn’t shelled at all, and missiles weren’t fired at the city either. Though at around 11:50pm Derhachi was shelled, people living there counted something like 14 explosions. We heard it from Kharkiv as well, even though I am 5km away from that town, and most likely even farther away from the place that was shelled, that shelling was still very loud here.

The usual missile launch happened at 1:10am this time, and they didn’t fire just 2 missiles this time, they fired at least 6-7 of them. But they didn’t target Kharkiv this time. Most, if not all, of them were aimed at Chuhuiv again. I’m really not sure what are they targeting there, but they have been shelling it relentlessly for the past couple of days, most of their previous missiles hit civilian infrastructure.

I’m not sure what missiles they were using this time, some people said that they were Iskanders, but they stopped firing 6+ Iskanders at a time since about a month ago, and started conserving them. They have been firing 4 Iskanders per day at most, and recently reduced that number even further, to 2 per day. And also a shot down missile that was found after yesterday’s missile strike turned out to be an S-300 missile, so it’s possible that at least some of today’s missiles were the same ones as well.",False,1658285774.0,t3_w2j5nx,t3_w2j5nx,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

Despite continued sporadic skirmishes, by 2015, it seemed that the conflict had largely stabilized. A violent and confused hybrid of insurrection and foreign invasion, had led to the creation of the self-proclaimed pseudo-states of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR, respectively). Together, they controlled roughly 30% of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and had a combined population of approximately 2 to 2.3 million people. This was a status quo that not only encouraged criminalization, but was based on it. Industrial-scale smuggling of everything from coal to narcotics helped sustain the internationally unrecognized pseudo-states of Donbas; gangsters became militiamen; and money-laundering networks meanwhile bypassed sanctions.  
>  
>Furthermore, although Ukraine and Russia were effectively in a state of undeclared war over Donbas, their criminals continued to cooperate across enemy lines, taking full advantage of the inability of law enforcement to do the same. It was not just that crime in Donbas affected Ukraine, Russia and the rest of Europe – although it undoubtedly did – but also that addressing its underworld dimension would have been an essential but tragically under-recognized aspect of any resolution of the conflict.

“We are pulling all of the US troops that are there doing training out. Tomorrow, Russia is going to invade Ukraine. If US troops are present, the invasion will be World War III. I will not be the President who starts World War III. I will, however, be the President that finishes it if Russia attacks any of the countries that the US has mutual-defense agreements with.” 



Vladimir Putin didn’t count on that move. It has been his intention from day-1 to draw ‘the west’ in to the conflict in some capacity, to paint his unprovoked invasion of a neighboring country as a grand east vs. west battle for the soul of the planet, as a battle to end ‘US hegemony’. He thought, if he could successfully spin his invasion that way, that he would draw in every country that would like to see US global influence diminished in on his side.



It didn’t work. China abstained at the UN vote. Iran abstained. India abstained. The only countries that supported his narrative were the countries that had no choice, his puppets Syria and Belarus and Eritrea.


But he hasn’t stopped trying. Vladimir Putin is trying desperately to incite actions that he can paint as ‘the west’ engaging in the grand battle for global hegemony that he desperately hopes for, hence the voices calling for drastic escalation on the part of the US.



Joe didn’t take the bait the first time, or the second, or the forty-third. Joe has been walking the tightrope perfectly. Ukraine will win. The US, and others, will help, but the win will be Ukraines alone. Russia will have invaded a neighbor and have been repulsed. This isn’t World War III.

1ea2036547303e8737400988889daaf8,w2j5nx,igr3sbh,"That New York Times article has some interesting points but when the author presents a source in a completely distorted way it calls into question whether the entire article should be taken seriously at all:

From the article:

> Today, for all the protestations to the contrary, the conventional wisdom in the West is that Ukraine will not be able to win back the areas occupied by Russian troops.

However [the article the author themselves links](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/white-house-ukraine-projection/index.html) to support that statement does not say that at all:

> A US military official and a source familiar with Western intelligence agreed it was unlikely that Ukraine would be able to mass the force necessary to reclaim all of the territory lost to Russia during the fighting -- especially this year, as Zelensky said on Monday was his goal. A substantial counteroffensive might be possible with more weapons and training, the sources said, but Russia may also have an opportunity to replenish its force in that time, so there are no guarantees.

> ""Much hinges on whether Ukraine can retake territory at least to February 23 lines,"" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at the Center for Naval Analyses. ""The prospect is there, but it's contingent. If Ukraine can get that far, then it can likely take the rest. But if it can't, then it may have to reconsider how best to attain victory.""

Neither of those examples say what the author stated. It says that they were unlikely to take back all the lost territory especially by the *end of the year,* the author phrases it like the analysis is that they won't be able to take back any newly taken Russian territory ever. It also says that a counter offensive might be possible but there were no guarantees of success, well it's a war so of course, but regardless the author completely mischaracterizes what was actually stated.

And that assessment comes from one military US official, an unnamed source and one analyst that works for the navy, the author chooses to call that ""the conventional wisdom in the West"" which is a real stretch given the sourcing and is directly contradicted in the same article where some other analysts and officials believe widespread Ukrainian success is possible, once gain from the same CNN article the New York Times author uses as a source:

> And not everyone in the administration is as worried -- some believe Ukrainian forces could again defy expectations, as they did in the early days of the war when they repelled a Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

The author totally misrepresents the actual details of the source to lend credence to their chosen narrative. I always find it interesting to check the source authors themselves give, the amount of times I have found the source either doesn't quite say what they claim or even says the exact opposite is way too high. I get this is an op-ed and therefore is more of an opinion than a strictly news item would be but it still makes me question the assumptions and rationale of the rest. I wonder what I might find going through the rest of the sources if I had the time.

Edit: Not taking issue with you posting it, I really appreciate these summaries and reading others views is almost always a good thing, but just wanted to point out the flaws in case people think that what the author claims is true. When their own sources disagree with them it's hard to take it seriously, even for an op-ed the Times should do more vetting.",1658219831.0,1658218260.0,t3_w2j5nx,t1_igqhwhj,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Whilst the ZPU is basically just a glorified heavy machine gun usually used against ground targets, the ZU-23 is definitely still a potent anti-air weapon, however it's usually used against helicopters/rotorcraft and low-flying subsonic fixed-wing aircraft. You could hit something like an Su-25 at low level with it, but most modern jets are flying too high and too fast for a cannon on the ground to be much of a threat. There have been several reported helicopter kills with ZU-23s and possibly some ground attack aircraft too. Fighters, not really. You can also use them against APCs and IFVs so they're not totally worthless anyway.

As for hitting drones - the big ones like a Bayraktar, yes, possibly, small ones, no. This is not the stupidest weapon to use but flak's effect is as much psychological as anything else, and it worked well in e.g. WW2 because the gunner was shooting at massed bomber formations, an area target, rather than a specific aircraft. Dare I say it, most drones are likely too small to even be able to effectively see let alone hit with a flak cannon, and the fact they operate alone makes the probability of a hit much lower too.

Saying that, none of the ZU family are really ""flak"" cannons as they're fast firing and rely on penetration damage not proximity explosions like traditional flak.

As /u/korolov points out, they work best against big formations of planes, so when (not really if, when) you miss the target you were shooting at, hopefully you hit his friend.

But today we have RADAR and guided missiles. For farther away planes, a missile can be guided to the target (or guide itself).

I think that you are trying to paint yourself in a position that you are the only one who wants to see Ukraine get long-range weapons.  That is not true, and that is not what most of us disagreed with you on your suggestion.

You put forth an overly complex, unrealistic technological ""solution"" to get said weapons into the hands of Ukrainian defenders more quickly.  That is something that would need time to develop and would drag things out even more, perhaps even ruining the effectiveness of the weapons.

Ukraine has acted responsibly and efficiently with the weapons and training that have been provided.  There is no need to add a technological element that would not make a difference. 

One of the key terms I just used was ""training.""  All of these new weapons Ukraine receives require time and training.

Just getting weapons to Ukraine more quickly will not make a difference if they cannot use and maintain them properly.

The best way to permanently disable a bridge is in it's foundations, particularly pillars and bank foundations and you need a lot of bang to do it.

This is why I'm always saying that the various bridges to Crimea are a non-factor. Sure you can blow a hole and make them unusable for a time but a decent, small Engineering team can bridge that in mere hours unless the destruction is wide and in several places.

The best idea is to keep hitting it and keep expanding the gap. Artillery isn't great at it; Engineer teams with explosives and knowledge do wonders but are far more difficult and require proximity to use.

A series of Air Strikes are also a solid option but that has its own risks and Ukraine is light on planes.

Germany currently has about 800 Fuchs. Only about 60% of all Fuchs are actual APCs, designed to carry troops. The others are all different specialised versions for specific tasks (including, but not limited to detecting NBC-warfare, firefighting, or weather observation). In total the Bundeswehr has almost 20 different versions.

Also only about a third of all Fuchs APC are the updated A8 variant, with the rest being variants from the 90s to 70s.

And that even ignores the question of how many Fuchs are currently actually service ready and not down for maintance, as well as the increased need the Bundeswehr itself has, in order to increase NATO presence in the Baltics.

There simply is no way to send a meaningful number of (working) Fuchs APC in the short term as demanded by the CDU/CSU. In large parts due the policies by those very parties over the last decades. Something they certainly do know, but dont care about, as it is easy to demand things from the opposition bench, when you know that they are impossible to deliver.


Lastly, while there is nothing wrong the Fuchs APC, they are far from what anyone would consider a ""game changer"".

Anyway the New York Times coverage of the war has often been questionable to say the least. Not pro Russian necessarily but it's almost like in an effort not to appear overly pro Ukanian they give space to writers that have viewpoints that claim to be ""telling like it is"" without the rose colored pro Ukanian glasses they feel other wear when in reality they are in fact simply presenting things with worst possible slant against the Ukranian side. I think in some cases the writer is trying to present what they feel is a tempering of over enthusiasm for the Ukranian's but in this case I feel the author is simply pro Russian but trying to hide it by framing it as ""Putin thinks he's winning"" while inserting the view that he will win, it's clearly an effort to portray supporting Ukraine as useless because a Russian victory is inevitable.

And although I really hope Ukraine wins and reclaims all their territory lost since 2014 it is of course possible they don't however I wouldn't take this essentially pro Russian article as evidence they won't because of the writers misrepresentation of their own sources.

The M270 is fully tracked for off-road capabilities and has plate armour that whilst not on the level of a tank or IFV will see off small-arms fire and also likely protect the crew from the shrapnel and compression of an indirect hit. Go anywhere, bit tougher.

HiMARS is based upon a soft-skin 5-ton truck chassis and whilst there are armoured-cab variants the standard is still a soft vehicle, and the running gear and tyres are still unprotected. A wheeled truck is vulnerable to small arms fire, grenades, and indirect counter-battery fire. Given that it's wheeled and on a longer chassis, it's not capable of the same terrain traversal although it is much faster and more manoeuvrable on a road or open terrain.

That difference is what I wanted to capture. M270 is bigger, meaner, harder hitting with 2x the fire rate, and capable of operating in a ""hotter"" area, though it's physically more visible and slower.

“Under the influence of enemy jamming, when you cannot see where you are, there are no GPS satellites, the radio channel is almost dead, there is no video signal - under such circumstances it is simply impossible to fly, but you have to!” Hadzhinov tells the interviewer. “You will not find how to do this either in the manufacturer's instructions or in YouTube.”

That fourth drone lasted over a month, which Hadzhinov says is unusual. Fortunately benefactors are sending a steady stream of replacements. (You can donate to Aerorozvidka here).

Jamming systems rely on a line-of-sight to the target, so part of the skill is in staying low and avoiding being seen. Another aspect is in noting when jammers are turned on and off – for example, they may inactivated to prevent interference with Russian drone operations – and knowing when to fly. And of course the jammers themselves can be located and targeted from the signals they emit.""

It would be set automatically to explode before it reached it's target to release a hail of shrapnel. As in the computer would determine the distance to target and the shell would be set to explode to give the optimal chance of hitting the drone. The shells in world war two needed to be manually set as they were being loaded. In this case the targeting computer could instantly change the fuse setting on a round by round basis just before it left the barrel to account for a moving target.

Even this kind of computer controlled fusing isn't a new concept but designing a dedicated round for a system to defeat low flying drones certainly is a new development. A big difference is that these smaller low flying drones are so fragile that the warhead fragments don't need to be big at all to take it out, that means the shell can release a large cloud of very small fragments well in advance of the target making for a large area of effect that would greatly increase the chances of a successful kill. That would make it less effective against helicopters or larger aircraft because you'd probably have to set the fuse to go off when it struck a larger better protected target like that to damage it. That also means you probably need a direct hit instead of just detonating nearby. So it's a round that's less effective against traditional aircraft and more effective against smaller drones.

A dedicated, cost effective munition for lower flying drones is definitely new.
