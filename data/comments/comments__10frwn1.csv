Day 329-330 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was relatively quiet during the last 2 days, we had no missile or drone strikes in Kharkiv, but they continue to shell and send S-300 missiles at Kupiansk every day. Just a couple of hours ago, at around 10pm, there was an air raid alert and people living in Kupiansk reported that center of the town was hit yet again. Also, the tragedy that happened near Kyiv yesterday can‚Äôt really be called quiet either, a helicopter crash is just horrible, hopefully something like that won‚Äôt happen again.

All those new announcements about more military aid are really exciting, but I wonder why do them right before the next Ramstein meeting starts instead of during it? I guess everything that is getting announced right now is already approved and doesn‚Äôt have to be discussed with anyone. It will be interesting to see what we will get out of the meeting, most likely more new tanks will be approved, but I wonder what else could also be announced.

The new US military package that was just announced seems amazing, that‚Äôs almost 1000 vehicles in just the last 2 packages, it‚Äôs an enormous amount of armor to get in a single month. Well, obviously we‚Äôre not getting them all immediately, but the amount is still staggering. I hope the rumors about us getting GLSDBs are not just rumors, because the 160km range would be really helpful. They are HIMARS ammo, so technically they still might be included in this package, but in that case, we won‚Äôt know about it until later.

> Russia's strategy previously appeared to hope that Western aid would dissipate over time. It now seems that Russia is girding itself for a long war even with continued aid to Ukraine. Thus, Western aid shouldn't just be focused on helping Ukraine sustain the war, but to win it.

> Tanks and APCs/IFVs will be critical for Kyiv to retake the rest of its territory, but they may not be enough. Kyiv needs to have superior combined arms capability to breakthrough prepared defensive positions. Hopefully, this change in thinking will extend to other capabilities.

> Russia's leadership clearly believes it will win this war and has a greater ability to sustain it. Putin's rule doesn't appear to be particularly threatened, so this war will very likely be decided on the battlefield and Ukraine needs to have superior capabilities.

> There is little reason to believe there are prospects for negotiations as long as the Kremlin believes the military situation favors it, which it clearly does right now. Strengthening Ukrainian military capabilities (equipment and training) is the best option for ending this war.

Denis Kireev was a former banker who participated in the first round of negotiations with Russia. It was then reported that he was shot while being detained on suspicion of treason. Later it came out that Kireev had been a double-agent working for the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine all along. He was killed due to a ""misunderstanding"". He was buried with full military honors. Zelensky posthumously awarded him with a medal for ""exceptional duty in defense of state sovereignty and state security."" 

> According to Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine‚Äôs military intelligence agency, Mr. Kiryeyev had passed on information from his Russian contacts that helped Ukrainian forces successfully defend their capital city last February. ‚ÄúIf it were not for Mr. Kiryeyev, most likely Kyiv would have been taken,‚Äù the general said.

> Gen. Budanov appealed to Mr. Kiryeyev‚Äôs patriotism and asked him to use his financial and security contacts to try to infiltrate Russia‚Äôs military intelligence. 

> ‚ÄúHe received information about everything,‚Äù the general said. ‚ÄúThe world of special services and the world of finance are always connected, like the world of crime, at least in our countries.‚Äù

> In fall 2021, as U.S. military and spy agencies began warning of the Russian threat, Mr. Kiryeyev learned from his sources that Moscow was readying to invade, Gen. Budanov said, and became the first to sound the alarm in Ukraine.

> Mr. Kiryeyev‚Äôs tip (*about the planned VDV landing at Hostomel*) gave Ukraine a precious few hours to shift troops to counter the Russian assault, Gen. Budanov said. After a fierce battle with the Russians, the airport was damaged beyond use by the invading forces.

> Photos of Mr. Kiryeyev seated at the negotiating table on Feb. 28 surprised many who knew him, including his wife, who had remained abroad. He hadn‚Äôt told her.

> ‚ÄúAfter his appearance there, his connection with the special services became obvious to everyone,‚Äù Gen. Budanov said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the situation then was critical, and we had to take risks.‚Äù

> On the night before the negotiations in Belarus, Mr. Kiryeyev received a phone call from the office of Oleksandr Poklad, the counterintelligence chief at the SBU.

> Mr. Kiryeyev drove to a Kyiv train station with his personal security crew and military-intelligence agents for his trip to Belarus. Several minivans with SBU agents pulled up and ordered the military-intelligence agents and Mr. Kiryeyev‚Äôs bodyguards to surrender their weapons. Mr. Kiryeyev was directed to a minivan.

An 80year old man is fighting.  Why?  Bc as a child, the Russians ripped his Ukrainian family apart, imprisoning, splitting from each other, deporting deep into Russia, into Siberia.  Why? Because the Russians learned his father was [–£–ü–ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army). He was five, sister was ten in 1947:

> ‚ÄúWhen my parents were taken away, my sister and I were sneaked out the window and hidden with relatives, then at my grandmother's. But at the beginning of the fall of 1952, two men in blue pants [most likely from the [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD)) came and took my sister and me to the district center. In Vysotsk, we were kept in some kind of cells, and for some reason our clothes were steamed.‚Äù Then they took him to Rivne. ‚ÄúI remembered how the column was led to the train, how the dogs barked. I was wearing a very long coat, because my sister had put on our mother's coat, which was left over, and I was wearing my sister's coat. I got caught and fell... Then in Kyiv, we were stuffed into prison wagons.‚Äù

> They traveled in these cages almost across the country. ‚ÄúWe were dropped off in Chelyabinsk or Sverdlovsk. There we washed in a cold bath together with the women [prisoners]. From there to Omsk, where we were first put in a local prison. When I was taken to the cell, I cried because my sister and I were separated for the first time. It was very scary. Some man picked me up by the arms, took me to the bunk beds and showed me a spot: ‚ÄòYou will be here with me.‚Äô As it turned out later, he was a thief. He took good care of me. When we were taken out for a walk in the bitter cold, he took a hat and felt boots from someone and dressed me. I walked in grown men's clothes with him holding his hand, and armed guards walked along the towers.

> Soon an incredible meeting happened. ‚ÄúLater, we were sent from the prison to the settlement in the district of the 6th brick factory, where we later lived, there were many people on the bus. The bus left. And suddenly everyone heard a woman's voice: ‚ÄòHey! Excuse me, turn around!‚Äô Someone was calling my sister. As soon as she turned around, a shout rang out: ‚ÄòMy daughter!‚Äô  It was our mother. She recognized my sister by the fur collar of her coat.‚Äù

They stayed in Omsk.  He learned Russian, then actually went into the military (initially, something similar to the Army Corps of Engineers), joined the Communist Party, changed his surname (which had precluded acceptance into the prestigious military schools) and went into aviation, after being accepted [Kharkiv‚Äôs Aviation Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aerospace_University_‚Äì_Kharkiv_Aviation_Institute).

> He served in various aviation units. He started as an aviation technician. In 1981, he became the deputy chief engineer of the Central Asian District. The last position before Ukraine gained independence was Dep Chief Engineer for aviation equipment and armament of the Western operational-strategic group of troops [East Germany]. While in Germany, he finally left the party [Communist Party]. He went to the commander and put the report on the table. It was like a bolt of lightning for him‚Äîin the evening, they held a meeting. ‚ÄúThe punishment was returning me to the Union within 24 hours.‚Äù In response, he demanded: ""I will only go to Ukraine"" and announced a hunger strike. ‚ÄúStarved for two days. In the end, I was offered to go to Lviv as the commander of a transport aviation regiment. It was a demotion, because I was already a colonel then.‚Äù But he agreed. ‚ÄúOur regiment was one of the first to swear allegiance to the Ukrainian people.‚Äù

> After that, he worked in the [Ukrainian] Ministry of Defense. ...He made his way from the senior officer of the aviation equipment operation department ... to the head of the central administration of aviation equipment and armaments. **This is the position of Lieutenant General.**

Obviously, he eventually retired. But hardly.

> ‚Äú. . . I became a participant in hostilities during the Revolution of Dignity.‚Äù On January 19, 2014, he received two gunshot wounds, which is why he was included in the lists of victims who, according to the law, were given the status of combatants. ‚ÄúI got it in 2018. But it did not satisfy me. How could I say that I was a combatant if I was not at the front? I am an officer. Boys are dying, and why should I protect my life? I would never go to a staff job. Therefore, I decided that I should be where I can be useful.‚Äù

Since he is still able to hold a weapon in his hands, he joined the ranks. But it was not so easy either. He turned to *Right Sector* and *Svoboda*, and to friends and acquaintances. ‚ÄúI heard everywhere: ‚ÄòHow old are you??‚Äô‚Äù


In 2018, he told [Stepan Khmara](http://museum.khpg.org/en/1142682953) he wanted to fight but no one would accept him due to his age.  ""Go to the [OUN battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists),"" he was told. 

> ‚ÄúAfter a month of training in Pavlograd, I proved for another month in Yuryivka near Mariupol that I could be a useful fighter. In the end, at a meeting of the chiefs of staff, I was allowed to go directly to the ATO zone.‚Äù For three months, he took part in hostilities in Vodyan. 

He‚Äôs seen combat in this war, too‚Äî**he serves as a regular volunteer, a soldier, not as a Lt General.**

> ‚ÄúAt first we fought in Kharkiv Oblast, near Izyum.‚Äù They crossed the Siversky Donets in rubber boats. There they spent five days in the trenches, then back. Mines and rockets were constantly flying overhead. As volunteers, the unit could abandon, but there was no one who was afraid.

> ‚ÄúAfter the deoccupation of Izyum, we were transferred to Soledar... 

> ‚ÄúOur battalion has now been taken out for re-formation, why? Because we suffered big losses in two months. Five were killed, 10-15 were wounded of various degrees and 15 were contused. All were sent for treatment. There are 20 combat-ready fighters left out of 60.‚Äù

>Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 January 2023

>Russia is likely considering deploying a small number of its new T-14 Armata main battle tanks in Ukraine.

>In late December 2022, imagery showed T-14s on a training area in southern Russia: the site has been associated with pre-deployment activity for the Ukraine operation.

>This followed pro-government Russia media outlets claiming T-14s were being prepared for deployment. However, it is unclear whether Russia has yet moved the type into Ukraine.

>Any T-14 deployment is likely to be a high-risk decision for Russia. Eleven years in development, the programme has been dogged with delays, reduction in planned fleet size, and reports of manufacturing problems.

>An additional challenge for Russia is adjusting its logistics chain to handle T-14 because it is larger and heavier than other Russian tanks.

>If Russia deploys T-14, it will likely primarily be for propaganda purposes. Production is probably only in the low tens, while commanders are unlikely to trust the vehicle in combat.",False,1674113126.0,t3_10frwn1,t3_10frwn1,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

> The adversary launched 4x missile attacks, including 2x on the civilian infrastructure of Matviivka (Zaporizhzhia oblast), and 15x air strikes. 

Only 4x missiles after the air raid alert earlier today. The ""Russia is almost out of missiles"" crowd gets a new slither of hope. 

> Bakhmut axis: Verkhn‚Äôokam‚Äôyans‚Äôke, Spirne, Bilohorivka, **Soledar**, Krasna Hora, Bakhmut, **Klishchiivka**, Kurdyumivka, Zalizne, and Vesele (Donetsk oblast) were shelled. 

Soledar and Klishchiivka being listed here means Ukrainian forces are counter-attacking. Wagner reported taking Klishchiivka earlier today. Klishchiivka is to the south of Bakhmut what Soledar was to the north. 

> Lyman axis: the enemy employed all available firepower for shelling of the vicinities of Novojehorivka, Ploschanka, Nevs‚Äôke, **Chervonopopivka**, **Kreminna**, and Serebryanske forestry (Luhansk oblast).

Russia is shelling almost every town along the strategic Kreminna - Svatove highway, meaning Ukrainian forces are operating all alongside it. Ukrainians are likely on the outskirts of Kreminna. 

> Novopavlivka axis: the adversary fired tanks and all types of artillery at the vicinities of settlements of Mykil‚Äôs‚Äôki Dachi, Vuhledar, Zolota Nyva, Velyka Novosilka, and Neskuchne (Donetsk oblast).

Greatly intensified Russian activity on the Vuhledar axis may imply another impending Russian attack. 

> The adversary continues to suffer significant casualties. In particular, a local hospital in Novosvitlivka (Luhansk oblast) has more than 200x wounded from among the recently forcibly mobilized residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk oblast.

> In the meantime, Ukrainian missile and artillery troops hit 6x command posts, 
7x concentrations of the enemy, and 1x ammunition depot of the occupiers.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,10frwn1,j4z4kot,"Last year, in the first two weeks of the war, in-person negotiations were taking place. Ukraine was putting forth a good faith effort, sending a team which had members representing different factions‚Äîgovernment, military, and the private sector.  Those representing the private sector were kept quiet, as they are often referred as ‚Äúback channels‚Äù and tend to be people who have contacts in Russia.  Ukraine used bankers, oligarchs and businessmen in this role. 
One of these was Denis Kiriev, who was a Ukrainian businessman who managed large assets owned by Russian-sympathists (Yanukovych-linked people who had fled).

Budanov‚Äîthe head of UA Military Intelligence‚Äîhad secretly recruited Kiriev back in 2021, to find out what the Russians are up to.  That was secret.

But Budanov *also* placed him on the negotiation team, and was sent to Belarus to negotiate with the military and government representatives.  In this capacity, he just looked like a businessman with Russian contacts who might have sway in negotiations. 

A week after the Gomel dead-end negotiations, he was arrested by the SBU.  A couple hours after that, he was discovered dead, shot in the back of the head, lying on the sidewalk. 

Reports surfaced that he was a traitor.

But then, strangely, several days later, Zelensky awarded him ‚Äúhero,‚Äù and buried him with honors.

Reports *then* surfaced he wasn‚Äôt a traitor after all, it was a mistake; that he‚Äôd died in an operation; that the SBU had traitors; and even that he was a double agent.

It‚Äôs all very mysterious. 

Today, the WSJ published [Budanov‚Äôs account](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/01/19/7385495/?_x_tr_sl=uk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp), ‚Äúif it hadn‚Äôt been for Kiriev, Kyiv would‚Äôve been taken.‚Äù  Kiriev learned Russia‚Äôs plans, told Budanov, and they were prepared.

> In 2021, Kireev, who was at the crossroads of Russian and Ukrainian business and security, caught Budanov's attention. When Russia began massing troops on the border with Ukraine in the spring of 2021, Budanov summoned Kireev to the GUR HQ in Kyiv and asked him to use his connections to infiltrate Russian military intelligence. 

> According to WSJ sources, the banker traveled from Kharkiv to Russia and then reported to Budanov.

> In the fall of 2021, when U.S. military and intelligence agencies began warning of a Russian threat, Kireev learned from his sources that Moscow was preparing for an invasion, Budanov said, and became the first to sound the alarm in Ukraine.

> On February 18, Kireev refused to go skiing with his family to the French Alps.

> **On the afternoon of February 23, Kireev relayed new intelligence to Budanov: Russian President Vladimir Putin had just ordered an early morning invasion. According to the head of the GUR, Kireev also knew the main point of impact.** [emphasis in original]

> At 8 o'clock in the morning on February 24, Russian combat helicopters landed at Antonov airport near Kyiv. The Kremlin planned to capture the airport in order to transfer troops and equipment there to storm the capital.

> According to Budanov, Kireev's tip gave Ukraine several precious hours to redeploy troops to counter the Russian attack. After a fierce battle with the Russians, the airport was damaged and could not be used by the occupying forces.

> When Russia's plans for a quick strike were foiled, the parties agreed to negotiate a ceasefire in Belarus. Since Kireev was familiar with two members of the Russian delegation, Budanov offered him to take part in the negotiations, and he agreed. 

> > ""After he appeared there, his connection with the special services became obvious to everyone. Unfortunately, the situation was critical then, and we had to take risks,"" Budanov said.

> After returning from Belarus, Kireev met with Budanov for several hours. Kireev, according to a member of his security service, was aware that he was in danger and left the meeting in a silent mood.

> A few days later, a friend visited Kireev at his house on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. Holding a large-caliber hunting rifle, Kireev said he had already fired it at some Russian operatives who had come to his home a few nights earlier.

> When Russia and Ukraine agreed on the second round of talks, scheduled for March 3, Budanov again insisted that Kireev take part in them.

> According to Budanov, on the night before the negotiations in Belarus, Kireev got a call from the office of the head of counterintelligence of the SBU, Oleksandr Poklad. Poklad, who is responsible for the detention of intelligence and security officials suspected of working for Russia, wanted to meet. Poklad himself has refused to comment [to WSJ], as did the SBU spokesman, citing the law on state secrets.

> Kireev arrived at the Kyiv railway station with his personal security and military intelligence agents [GUR] for the trip to Belarus. He told his security that he might be arrested on the way. ""Don't interfere,"" he said, according to a member of his bodyguard.

> The group went to the center of Kyiv and stopped near St. Sophia Cathedral. Several minibuses with SBU agents drove up and ordered the military intelligence officers [GUR] and Kireev's bodyguards to lay down their weapons. Kireev was taken to a minibus. His bodyguards remained lying on the street while the minibus drove away.

> About 90 minutes later, military intelligence agents were called to the scene, where they found Kireyev's body.

>
>2/10 Ukraine decides on the future of Ukraine. This is called sovereignty; self-determination.
>
>3/10 üá∑üá∫ has so far shown no interest in an end to the war in which a sovereign üá∫üá¶ continues to exist. üá∑üá∫ insists without concession on fixing the conquered and annexed areas. A bad war seems better for üá∑üá∫ than a peace ending imperial dreams.
>
>4/10 According to official üá∑üá∫ statements, üá∑üá∫ denies the statehood and identity of Ukraine. Moscow is not concerned with secure coexistence with a sovereign and independent Ukraine, but with its end.
>
>5/10 The situation in the occupied and annexed areas shows what a üá∑üá∫ victory could mean for Ukraine: surrender üá∫üá¶ freedom, identity, culture, self-determination; repression, human rights violations (see Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izyum).
>
>6/10 Arms deliveries and negotiations are not mutually exclusive. They complement each other. Arms deliveries can allow the üá∫üá¶ to change the military situation and thus facilitate negotiations. Arms shipments can shorten the war and suffering.
>
>7/10 The demand for political approaches is correct and necessary. But cheap, if not backed up with practical suggestions. I have yet to hear any practical proposal on how to get Russia to engage in serious negotiations without military pressure.
>
>8/10 Arms shipments may allow üá∫üá¶ to militarily force RUS to the negotiating table to end this war. Because political requests to come to the negotiating table, to stop the war, or to withdraw from üá∫üá¶ have so far not been followed by üá∑üá∫ .
>
>9/10 Arms shipments enabled üá∫üá¶ to liberate about half of the maximum territory Russia occupied since 24.2. Stopping arms deliveries would mean leaving the üá∫üá¶ population to the Russian terror regime of occupation (see 5/10)
>
>10/10 The situation is worrying. Deliveries of weapons are to be weighed up, üá∑üá∫ reactions to be considered. But a long war of attrition or üá∑üá∫ victory would threaten Europe even more directly. üá∑üá∫ was able to learn that war is worthwhile & continue to enforce his imperial goals with war

Funding will be drawn from the 2023 Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act passed in December.

>This new funding comes in addition to significant USAID assistance to Ukraine‚Äôs energy sector since the start of the Russian Federation‚Äôs full-scale invasion. USAID has already delivered 1,548 generators to 22 oblasts across Ukraine, with many more on the way. These generators ensure electricity and heating for schools, hospitals, accommodation centers for internally-displaced persons, district heating companies, and water systems if and when power is knocked out by Russia‚Äôs air strikes. USAID has invested $55 million in Ukraine‚Äôs heating infrastructure to help the Ukrainian people get through winter.

&nbsp;

There are a lot of European customers for these tanks.

&nbsp;

* A lot of Europe had reduced the size of their armed forces and are now reconsidering those decisions due to Russias aggression towards Ukraine. They will now almost all be going rounds with themselves on wether to increase their stocks of MBT's.

&nbsp;

* A lot of those who do have Leopard 2's, have aging Leopard 2's like the Leopard 2A4's. They would anyways be in the pipeline either for upgrades or for replacing their old ones with the new Leopard 2A7's. 

&nbsp;

* One such example is Norway who are currently field testing the 2 candidates it has narrowed down to for new MBT to replace its 2A4's. The decision stands between Germany's Leopard 2A7 and the South Korean K2 Black Panther. Norway recently procured South Korean K9 Thunder 155mm Artillery wagons, and the decision for MBT is imminent and could be made within the year. 

&nbsp;

This all means that countries now wishing to send their old Leopard 2's to Ukraine and are getting stalled by Germany may well factor this into their next purchases from Germany.

I wanted to clarify that I mistakenly wrote he‚Äôd gather 70-80,000.  The [original source](https://telegra-ph.translate.goog/CHto-gotovyat-VS-RF-i-zachem-Gerasimova-naznachili-komandovat-gruppirovkoj-01-16?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) *actually* reports 700,000 Russian troops‚Äîclearly a massive difference.

Specifically, the relevant section of the publication:

> The first thing Gerasimov did, even before his appointment, was to transfer army units from Bakhmut to Soledar‚Äîit was with their forces that Russia broke through the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in that area, using part of the stock of shells accumulated by Surovikin (note, we wrote that the ‚Äòshell starvation‚Äô in the RF Armed Forces is artificial‚Äî it is caused by the accumulation of ammo for offensive operations).
> Second, he forced the PMCs to coordinate with the army. The mercenaries fought urban battles in Soledar after breaking through the defenses outside the city.

> Immediately after the appointment, according to several of our sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Gerasimov checked the level of readiness of the Russian group located in the West of Belarus (Lutsk direction), then set about checking the units stationed in the Belgorod region (Kharkiv direction).

> Valery Gerasimov, according to his colleagues and subordinates, thinks big‚Äîin big numbers and with big plans. The events of autumn and early winter testify that he received everything necessary for the implementation of these plans. [Independent Russian and Belarusian news have been reported the large accumulation of Russian troops in Belarus.]
**The size of the groupings has increased to more than 700,000 people**, and, up to 200,000 additional more are waiting for orders, running around the saunas and massage parlors in the distant Russian rear. Ammo for artillery has been accumulated for active combat operations in several directions during the last month. Technical equipment, at the very least, has been scraped together.

> Valery Gerasimov will need some more time (several weeks) to sort out the recently received situational issues. After that, he will begin to implement his plans.^2

_______


^1 ^(... that the original invasion plans [landing at Gostomel, PMCs seize entrances of Kyiv, seizure of Odessa-to-Dniester via Transnistria] had been drawn up by Gerasimov.  He was livid last year that his plans had been so poorly executed, and almost none of his targeted seizures were captured.

Also F-16s will be a high value target, which will tempt Russia into expending a few more of their SRBMs like Iskander, which they have depleted down to strategic levels or below.

Edit 2: In the Q&A part the deputy press secretary reiterated that Abrams are far more difficult to sustain than a Leopard 2. And it's up to German to make the decision on those. It's up to other nations to announce what they'll be doing.


Edit 3: Reiterated that Crimea is Ukraine and Ukraine can use its weapons how it sees fit to retake its occupied territory.

Edit 4: When asked about whether Austin's goal is to push allies to give Leopard 2s to Ukraine, the response was that the goal is to get Ukraine what it needs, and more than just Germany has tanks.

Edit 5: We can ""expect"" armored vehicles (taken together probably more strykers) and air defense in the next aid package. But nothing definite. She also said something to a French reporter about F-16s, but I missed what the answer was exactly. I think just more 'I won't get ahead of tomorrow's aid package.'

Edit 6: Europeans are doing their own training of Ukrainians. The US is focusing on Bradleys. Long-range capability question was avoided, she focused on long-range defensive capabilities, rather than offensive. No update on Wagner Group's claims in Bakhmut, Ukrainians and Russians are both fighting very hard, blocks and kilometers is how it's happening ""Grinding fight.""

Edit 7: Unrelated, but amusing question about what the DOD is trying to get from new studies of UFOs. And the US ""welcomes"" more commitment from partners on giving PATRIOT batteries. And that the US isn't training Ukrainians with the assumption they'll get more batteries.

Edit 8: 500-600 Ukrainians are being trained in Grafenberg in combined arms operations. And clarification, nothing is on/off the table regarding long-range offensive weapons, expect more tomorrow.

Reiterated the US isn't dictating Ukraine's operations. It's their right to retake their sovereign territory, including Crimea. The US would continue offering support if Ukraine began the liberation of Crimea.",1674156783.0,1674155068.0,t3_10frwn1,t1_j51f5f8,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

If the CDU were still in power, perhaps they would have had an easier time taking an independent leadership role. But the SPD has historically been even further on the pacifist side, and so have the Greens. 

Hence their current stance really isn't a surprise. What the Brits do or don't do is fairly inconsequential. They are an isolated island far in Europe's west. They could give away every single last Challenger tank and it would make zero difference to their security outlook.

Meanwhile, where is everyone else? France, Spain, Italy? And what is the big deal with the US, if all of this was oh-so-easy, they could send Abrams, right? (they probably will, eventually)",False,1674127549.0,t3_10frwn1,t1_j4znluo,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Leopard probably has a lot of top secret components. If Russia captures one and examines it thoroughly that will make the tank much less effective for Germany but also for everyone that bought one from Germany. Hell just using it in the field could allow some of those systems to be discovered and reverse engineered. To induce buyers Germany may have even promised not to allow it to be sent to non NATO so the buyer could be sure that what they were buying would remain top secret for as long as possible. Allowing a shipment might put Germany in breach of such an agreement. 

It takes a lot of time and training to learn a new tank, a lot of logistics are involved in keeping that new tank running. Small anti-tank arms have been shown to be very effective. So the potential gain for Ukraine may be small and the downsides for Germany may be large. German generals may think their (and the Allie‚Äôs) time and money is better spent on sending mortar rounds or precision missiles.  

I dunno, I‚Äôm not a general.   I think Ukraine wants nice tanks because their successes recently have been using the ‚ÄúThunder run‚Äù tactic. For which a tank is pretty useful.  That works well against an Ill equipped, I‚Äôll prepared, low morale enemy.  Which seems to accurately describe Russia. But it is a high risk tactic that is no longer a surprise, and has some pretty obvious counter measures. I would guess Germany believes that by the time the tank crews arrive and trained on the new equipment and logistics are hashed out that the thunder runs (and the tanks) won‚Äôt be particularly useful anymore. 

That being said the Ukrainians want them and have been very creative in their tactics and ingenuity so it is possible that they have a plan for late use tanks.  As the Russians lose precision ammunition that they can‚Äôt replace and their air power dwindles, as they field higher numbers of less competent troops with less sophisticated weapons, tanks may find a renewed strategic role in the war.  At the current stage many analysts are pronouncing the Tank as being somewhat obsolete, in comparison to the effectiveness of current anti-tank technologies.

Finally if they don‚Äôt think the leopard will perform well in the modern anti-tank environment, they might not want the bad press involved in its quick annihilation.  They do still want to sell these to third parties. Remember how quickly Russia‚Äôs fancy new tanks were destroyed? That isn‚Äôt the kind of press an arms manufacturer wants.

Ultimately I do think they should give leopards and they should also pressure the US to send some while their at it Abrams. Two birds one stone. But again. I am not a general so‚Ä¶ my opinion on the matter is probably shite.",1674134409.0,1674133687.0,t3_10frwn1,t1_j4zronm,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Even if Ramstien goes perfectly and the Germans free the leopards, combined I‚Äôd be very surprised if more than a hundred are ready to be transferred right now.

We don't know, which is the answer to just about any 'how much does Russia have?' question. Russia hoarded masses of Soviet shit, and then lost masses to corruption and poor maintenance. It's unlikely that Russia even knows how many tanks it has, or even how many are still combat worthy.

We can guess, and I would *guess* about 7500 remaining, of which about 5000 could be dragged back to combat readiness.

Western inteligence can probably put accurate numbers on it, but isn't public information.

The question of ""how many tanks Russia has left"" needs a lot of digging in. T90's are in operation in the Kremmina front but they are used safely. They are combat ready, but not that combat active. But the most important thing is all those tanks in storage. Many can be restored to combat readiness but, how many of them are we talking about and how equipped are they? A T62 pulled from storage can be reffited with better optics, can have the older cannon and stabilizer system, or the better one designed a few years later. Some destroyed russian tanks didn't have reactive armor. This way the numbers will be better but the tanks will perform worse.

The response to the question of how many tanks Ukraine needs first we need to know exactly what will be given to them. Leopards are likely but they have so many iterations that they can be superior to average Russian tanks or not.

[German article here](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/ruestungsindustrie-kann-leopard-2-panzer-doch-schneller-liefern-18609177.html). 
In that same article they also claim that ~29 tanks could be delivered more quickly if they are diverted from Czech and Slovak customers. These customers would have to agree to that and considering these are replacements for tanks given to Ukraine already (Ring swap of Leo for T-72 who then got sent to UA) approval might not be automatic. 

Machine translated the most important part: 

>The industry is now saying that delivery is possible as early as October or November - but only if ""all stops are pulled out"", one Leopard 2 per week could be delivered from the third quarter onwards.

>The F.A.Z. has learned that Germany is currently considering supplying Ukraine with 29 more Leopard 2s in addition to these ten to 15 tanks. These are actually intended for Slovakia and the Czech Republic and are to be delivered this year. However, the governments in Prague and Bratislava would still have to agree to such a reallocation. Slovakia and the Czech Republic could then receive about three tanks per month from current production from the beginning of 2024 instead of delivery this year.

These would be Leopard 2A4s. 

Opinion: Deliveries from the German Army itself would probably not happen for the following reasons: 

- The Army variant is the latest upgraded variant which is not the same as in use by other countries that allegedly wanted to donate. It uses a different gun, different armor scheme, different electronics and optics. It would require different training and maintenance chains. 

- The Army does not have enough of the latest version anyway and its stocks of lower versions are currently being upgraded to the latest version. 

- The Germany army is currently shouldering the main load of NATO deployments in Europe and is therefore not interested in surrendering tanks that they need for that and of which they have too little of in their own opinion.

No.  Just opinions on Reddit.  

>why various nations are reluctant to send certain equipment to Ukraine?

There are multiple risks.  

The one that is most overlooked is moral and morale.  The Russians invaded Ukraine with a vastly larger quantity of equipment.  Most of the equipment was Soviet design on both sides.  There are many proposals for why that occured.  The truth will be a composite of many things.  A significant component is the lack of will to fight in Russian soldiers and the fact that Ukrainian soldiers were fighting for their homes.  Reddit is consistently undervaluing the impact of unarmed Ukrainians.  Also the effect of lightly armed Partisans get overlooked.  Expensive hardware is not the exclusive lever as the MIC wants us to believe.  

When Russian conscripts see NATO tanks they no longer face the moral problem.  We know that Russians are hostile invaders attacking their neighbor either way.  The Russian troops see themselves as fighting slavic people inside the former USSR.  If Germany and Britain increase Ukraine's tank count by 2% you would expect much more than 2% increase in combat effectiveness because they are better tanks.  However, if Russian tankers suddenly fight harder and increase their effectiveness 10% there is no gain and potentially a slip.  

Secondly, you win a war when the enemy feels that they have lost.  Note there are also ideas like ""no one ever wins a war"" or ""winning a war is like winning an earthquake"".  Disregarding that the victory condition is still largely a mental one.  There is no alternative for Ukraine except some notion of overrunning Moscow.  Even then that only ends the war if Russians mentally accept the loss of their capital as an end.  A war isolated in Ukraine ends when Russians realize that continuing to fight in Ukraine is a useless waste of life and material resources.  A few German tanks showing up and then getting destroyed gives Moscow a battlefield victory to latch onto.  That gives Russians hope.  

The NATO tanks (or any weapon perceived as a superweapon) can have the inverse effect within Ukraine.  There is defeat risk but not just that.  Suppose fancy pants weapons show up and then do nothing much.  The war slogs on at basically the same snail pace as it was.  That could generate a sense of despair.  In this context German and NATO moves are very good tactics.  ""Ukraine *might* get fancy pants but we are not sure yet. Lets have more conferences""... ""Lets start a really long training process"".  It leaves Ukraine with hope.  Hope and perseverance may do more damage to Russia's military than a few extra tanks.

>Many observers did not expect the Challenger 1.  The Rheinmetall group brings him into play, which according to the circles would buy and upgrade a high double-digit number of British tanks from [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman).  The vehicles could be handed over to Ukraine later this year, a person familiar with the proceedings said.
>#
>‚Ä¶
>#
>In addition to the Challenger, Rheinmetall offers the delivery of Leopard 1 and Leopard 2, the standard weapon of the Bundeswehr.  From the older Leopard 1 model, 20 main battle tanks could be reequipped and sold this year and another 80 within 20 months.
>#
>The Flensburg armaments company FFG also has Leopard 1 in stock and could retrofit them for the Ukraine.  It is unclear to what extent Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) - the main manufacturer of the Leopard 2 - could participate in a possible delivery.  The company has so far remained silent on the matter.
>
>With the Leopard 1 and the Challenger, the combat effectiveness of the Ukraine would be significantly increased, since these are superior to the Russian main battle tanks.  In addition, another 100 Leopard 2 battle tanks could be added if the federal government gives its approval.  To this end, several countries, including Finland, Spain and Poland, want to hand over battle tanks from their own stocks to Ukraine.  
>

The US has roughly 4500 M2s and M3s in service and an additional 2000 in storage.

More HIMARS is a given request at this point, and we should probably be opening up to the idea of sending them longer range variants.

I wasn't really expecting any announcements, but you never know what might be happening behind the scenes.

On the F-16 question, I went to the C-Span replay to check it:

>Again, we are providing them with what we think they are capable of operating, maintaining, and sustaining. The F-16 is a very complicated system. We have been very careful in assessing what they need on the battlefield right now, and I think you'll see that in the next package.

Not F-16s in the next package, I assume! It's basically the same answer as for the Abrams - these systems are backed up by a complicated logistical and maintenance structure, and it's very difficult to try to transfer the entire technological ""package"" over to Ukraine while they are in the middle of a hot war.

A tank missing just one critical component could prevent that tank from having been mobilized to Ukraine.  Some tanks have different broken components and can be cannibalized for parts.  Pessimistic 5 tanks could become 4 working tanks.  Optimistic that whole field is mostly rusted out junk and Russia has to build almost everything except the hull new.  Reality will be somewhere in between.  Even if they are in the worst condition the hulls existence still means Russian industry does not need to manufacture new tank hulls.  

There are limits to supply and logistics.  If Russia sent more tanks toward Kyiv in March then more tanks would be parked in Ukrainian farm fields with no fuel.  Russia would be in a stronger strategic position now if they had donated fewer tanks to Ukraine last year.

We don't know what software and physical changes are required here.

Once you start messing with the planes software they're going to want to do a shit ton of testing to make sure the changes aren't screwing something else up, it's a common problem in software development. Then they need to do extensive testing to make sure the weapon can release properly from the internal weapons bays without hitting anything and get a good seperation from the plane. This is not a given, they have had issues with some weapons separating cleanly. So that's a lot of simulation work followed by a lot of real world testing.

So while I'm sure they're not trying to give them a deal it is not nearly as simple as it might sound to validate a new weapon system, refits like this are almost always expensive.

After all, we are sending weapons and have disconnected from Russian gas.  We also support sanctions.  

One could even say, if one is cynical, that he only represents the German people.  According to polls, Germany is very divided  about support for Ukraine and some think we have already send enough or to much.  

That is why the support of the AfD is also increasing.  The government is seen by some as warmonger and people are unhappy about the high prices.

The Greens and FDP were pro-Ukraine from day one of the invasion, but are falling or not rising further in polls for many other reasons.  (Germans seem to be more interested in domestic politics than foreign politics. See the last Bundestag election, where foreign politics didn't even mentioned in the whole election campaign).  

The FDP is falling in the polls because they are seen as the brakes in government (Ukraine is almost the only thing they and the Greens agree on). They hold the Ministry of Finance and absolutely want to comply with the debt brake. The transport minister also has some problems

The Greens have problems because they are currently doing exactly the opposite of what they actually wanted to do (from anti-war/army to pro-war/army, open more coal-fired power plants, export weapons to Saudi Arabia, etc.)

CDU is more pro Ukraine than SPD, but it is questionable how much (the Prime Minister of Saxony, who is from the CDU, is demanding that Nord Stream 1 should be repaired) and just do the usual thing, demanding more, because they are in the opposition and doesn‚Äôt need to do anything.

The SPD also has some huge problems, (400,000 new apartments per year will probably never be built and Olaf Scholz doesn't talk much, to explain his politics/plans)  as I said:

The Germans are currently more worried about other things or will decide in the next election more on domestic issues than on foreign policy (unless WW3 happens).  They are very divided on arms deliveries, which was partly cited as an argument for starting arms deliveries slowly.

The fact that when this war broke out, rather than immediately drive a wedge into Russia and take the lead, Germany had to be dragged along. You can argue semantics as to how long the dragging needed to be done, but it was done. Germany was slower to respond, slower to act, and slower to find solutions.

>	The British PM‚Äôs high standing owes much to the staunch support his country continues to offer Ukraine as it battles against Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion. The UK recently unveiled a new USD 1.2 billion military support package, bringing the total since the start of the war to USD 2.8 billion. This makes Britain Ukraine‚Äôs second-largest military partner after the United States.
Nor is it just a matter of quantity. Crucially, Britain first began delivering anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in January 2022. This was some weeks prior to the outbreak of hostilities at a time when many other Western nations remained deeply reluctant to arm the country despite mounting evidence of Russian preparations for a major offensive.
The British decision to provide Kyiv with NLAW anti-tank missiles was an important landmark that changed perceptions of the looming Russian threat and encouraged other nations to follow suit. While this initial wave of military support ultimately failed to deter Moscow, the defensive weapons provided in early 2022 would go on to play a vital role during the first month of the war as Ukraine defeated Putin‚Äôs troops in the Battle for Kyiv.

I say midwifed, because Germany didn't cause this war. Germany did not tell Putin to invade Ukraine. Germany simply looked out for Germany's own interests. It was a large contributor to the decision flows that led to gas dependence. It was a factor in Putin's choice.

In the world of conjecture: if Ukraine urgently needs both MBTs and IFVs, delivered concurrently, in a 1:2 ratio. And Europe can scrounge up 150 Leopards and 40 Marders in a certain timeframe.

Ukraine is launching \~20 strikes a day against Russia, they are likely flying more aircraft than that, but lets say 40 full fuel load flights of an SU-25 equivalent, that's 146,400L , approximately 1.6 fully loaded 767-300, enough fuel to move 77 Abrams their full range of 426km on road.  


In 2018 Ukraine was flying 7.8 million people per year, which is 21,520 per day, which would take the seats of 99 Boeing 767-300 or equivalent seating of other plane types to move each day. Lets say only half of that was outgoing or intra-country, and each plane was only loaded to 50% fuel, that's still the equivalent of 25 fully fueled 767 flights.  


This would be enough to fuel Ukraine's air force, and send 1,120 Abrams tanks on a 426km road march every day.

German defence industry has said they will need 9 months before they can deliver Leopard 2s at a pace of 3-6 per month. Rheinmetall only has 22 in storage. KMW has none. FGG has 150 but 50 of those are already earmarked for delivery to other countries who sent T-72s to UA and those 50 are probably the most ready ones. 

So we are talking about a timeframe of 9 months at the least until German leopards can arrive. They can't really take them from the German Army because that variant is not compatible with the Leopards around Europe (different gun, different electronics, optics, armor scheme) and because the German Army is currently leading the NATO reaction force and needs every tank they have. 

Other nations might be willing to donate Leopards but Spain already said they are out. Good luck getting Greece or Turkey onboard. So that leaves a host of smaller nations that can probably at best donate 10-12 each. 

I highly doubt that this is enough to deliver 300 Leopard 2s in the next three months. In fact, I am almost certain that it will not be enough. 

However, the Abrams can be delivered now. Training can start now. Spare parts are there in Europe by the boatload, as are maintenance facilities.
