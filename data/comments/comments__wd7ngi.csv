Day 159 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled from an MLRS in the morning, like always they targeted a residential district, and it was Saltivka again. They shelled a bus stop when people were standing there, killing one person and injuring another. They really love shelling bus stops, just a couple of days ago they shelled one in Mykolaiv and killed 5 people with their pets. Do they still not understand that this only makes the resistance stronger, not weaker?

So far there was no today’s missile strike yet, but it will probably happen soon, either at 3:30am or 4am, it almost always happens either at the start or in the middle of the hour. And very rarely they mix it up and fire their missiles at other times like 2:10am, which is what they did yesterday. The missile strike from yesterday was aimed at Merefa, no idea what was targeted, but this is not the first time they targeted it.

Also today Russian MOD also said that they destroyed 2 HIMARS and showed a [video of some guided munition hitting a second floor of some building.](https://mobile.twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1554095299991375872) Yes, there were totally 2 big missile trucks on the second floor of a building, you see, they are high mobility, of course they can climb some stairs. What? Have you never seen trucks climbing stairs? They bragged about this everywhere in their news, but even Russians in the comments were asking “Where HIMARS?” and “Why would there be a HIMARS on the second floor of a building?”

They are so scared of it, that they just have to say that they destroyed some of them, though that really won’t help them even if they say that every HIMARS was destroyed. Just saying that they were destroyed won’t stop their ammo dumps from exploding, and it will also make Russians question their claims since they can’t back them up with evidence.",False,1659398854.0,t3_wd7ngi,t3_wd7ngi,,0,144,0,144,4,0,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_3': 1}"

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 1 August 2022
 

- Over the last four days, Russia has continued to attempt tactical assaults on the Bakhmut axis, northeast of Donetsk, only managing to make slow progress. As briefed by the Ukrainian authorities last week, Russia is likely reallocating a significant number of its forces from the northern Donbas sector to southern Ukraine.

- Russia is probably adjusting the operational design of its Donbas offensive after failing to make a decisive operational breakthrough under the plan it had been following since April. It has likely identified its Zaporizhzhia front as a vulnerable area in need of reinforcement.

🪖 It was a fairly busy weekend and Ukraine [made several advances](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1553418233985859584).    [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1553940042330116096), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553702953168834562.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553915320510857217.html) go over all the map changes.

🪖 Over the weekend Ukraine [destroyed](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1553661473213276160) several [railroads](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1553482328944558083) used by russians to [supply their troops](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1553330859830296578).  One of the railways had a train on it [at the time of destruction](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553771448820547585.html) resulting in an estimated 80 dead russians and 200 wounded.  

🚧 In Kherson, we are seeing some [signs of an evacuation](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553680084862730241.html) (ordered or not), but also signs the russians are digging in and preparing to defend.  Of course russia has set up several pontoon bridges and [ferries](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1553849163288289287), and is attempting to [repair the damaged bridges](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553700858889732096.html), however the logistical capacity to move materials remains substantially impaired.  If you’re wondering why everything seems so slow right now, that’s because  Ukraine [is deliberately, methodically](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553653161273040896.html) moving slow.

👉 As expected, the thin veneer of an [excuse russia offered](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553795835355332609.html) for the execution of the Azov prisoners of war continued [to fall apart](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553346547739410432.html) over the weekend with one commenter noting the [mere location of the camp](https://twitter.com/FischerThomasC/status/1553495298462388224), so close to the front, was a violation of russia’s obligation under the Geneva conventions. There also appears to be a consensus forming that a russian [thermobaric weapon](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1553627423815745537) was used.

👉 The Red Cross, was refused permission to visit the prison camp and has [renewed its appeal](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553401834802388994.html).

🥷 In a suspected russian covert attack, a munition storage [warehouse in Bulgaria exploded](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553689519496593459.html) early Sunday morning.   The owner says the storage facility’s alarm system registered a breach minutes before the explosion.  The ammunition was intended for delivery to Ukraine.

👉 Ukrainian President Zelensky has ordered the [mandatory evacuation of all civilians](https://twitter.com/Jerusalem_Post/status/1553470132101545986) in Ukrainian controlled territories in the Donbas.   There are several reasons for this order.  [As you can see](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1553562638055096320), russians can only take a city they have leveled to the foundations.  Any civilians captured by russians are subject to rape, torture, concentration camps, illegal conscription into the russian army, and forced migration to far-flung russian lands.   Also, Ukraine has lost the ability to provide [heat and electricity in the area](https://twitter.com/iaponomarenko/status/1553698103458500608) and other essential services.

👉 russia appears to be shelling occupied Donetsk with [petal mines](https://twitter.com/hulme_edward/status/1553652347586449409).  Ukraine doesn’t use these, but russia has used them in previous wars.  This isn’t the first time russia has shelled its own territory in Donetsk as it’s been the victim of [incendiary rounds several times](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550935708432568321.html) during the course of the war.  

👉 The Ukrainian controlled city of Mykolaiv, near the front-lines in Kherson experienced [the heaviest shelling](https://twitter.com/ukrpravda_news/status/1553756129343201280) of the war to-date.   Included in the barrage was a targeted missile attack on Ukrainian self-made grain billionaire [Olexii Vadatursky](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553695078228566016.html).  Both Mr. Vadatursky and his wife died in the attack.

👉 Correction: Last week, at russia’s expense, I poked fun at their ever changing objectives by referencing a quote by russian general shoygu who spoke of a return to the USSR.  That quote was taken out of context as he was [referring to discussions](https://twitter.com/leonidragozin/status/1553475718792843264) at the time of the disintegration of the USSR.

⚓ In things you just can’t make up, russia celebrated its “navy day” by conducting a [false-flag attack](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553734493751713792.html) on their fleet [headquarters in Sevastopol](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553626644954447872.html).  But in the festive spirit proudly [distributed posters](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1553757879592800257) showing the, now sunk, Moskva and the US aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush.  putin also signed a decree defining the US as the russian navy’s [main threat](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1553745379832877058).

🇮🇹🎁 Despite Italy’s recent political turmoil, and its suspected [breaking of sanctions](https://twitter.com/federicofubini/status/1553646563863498754), it appears that Italy has provided [another round](https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1553647959501414401) of (undisclosed) military aid to Ukraine.

🇦🇿🎁 Azerbaijan supplied Ukraine with [32 high-precision guided bombs](https://twitter.com/UkrWarReport/status/1553284261393977345) for Su-25 aircraft.

🇱🇹🎁 Lithuania reports it will [provide Ukraine](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1553505973922213888) with 10 more M113 armored personnel carriers and packages of explosives and smoke grenades.  Lithuania also offered training for Ukrainian mechanics and sappers.

👉  In the last five months, the US has accepted [100,000 Ukrainian refugees](https://twitter.com/CarlosAMoreno/status/1553836295637438466).

💰 The [slow-rot of russia’s economy](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552707024751939585.html) continues.

💰 S&P [downgraded Ukraine’s credit rating](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1553308880515612672) from CCC+ to CC as a default becomes a ‘virtual certainty’.

🔥🇱🇻 russia shut down [Latvia’s gas](https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1553337539804659712).  Maybe coincidence but today Latvia is suspending its agreement with russia on travel of [residents in the border areas](https://twitter.com/Sergey_Hodor/status/1553816392536842240).   Fun fact, Latvia required russians entering its country to sign a statement [condemning putin’s war](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1553168791550541824).

🌾 The first 16 grain ships from Ukraine will arrive in Turkey for inspection on [August the third](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1553658357596262402) with the first ship departing port as early as [today](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1553695526616449025).

***What does this mean for the war?***

***How does this impact things in the short term?***

*These are complex questions but from a holistic perspective we can deduce a few things.*

1. Russia is fearful of losing territory in the South.

2. Troops will be spread over a wider front and theatres.

3. Ukraine has a logistical advantage due to interior rather than exterior lines of supply.

The crux of this is that by Russia shifting to a wider theatre effort, Ukraine gains an advantage in the long term.

But it also means advances in the South and South West will be slower for Ukraine.

The flip side is advances by Russia in the East will be slower.

And with a more spread out front, the advantage offensively shifts to the force with interior (shorter) lines of supply, so Ukraine.

This *seems* to be an effort by Russia to hold what it already has. This is likely a shift in mentality and approach to the war and is a good indicator that the tide has turned.

Basically, the fact that Russia has redeployed forces for defensive work is a very strong indicator that they cannot mount more large scale offensives and have adopted a more defensive posture.

The question becomes how Ukraine adapts to this. Early indications are of slow incremental, but effective advances. This is a big tell of Ukrainian priorities - centred on force preservation and effective zone control.

This is good. This is classic modern warfighting. Your people are your capability and preserving them is an expontential force multiplier long-term (all those new recruits not dying but surviving and getting battlefield experience makes the force stronger).

BUT there is likely to be a slowing of terrain control change for a period of time. We don't know how long this will last or where it will centre.

The offensive gets harder now without the right multiplying, combined arms elements.

My big thing to watch is the Ukrainian armour and manoeuvre element deployment. They (with appropriate support of fires and infantry) can exploit enemy defensive weaknesses. But the true x factor in this equation is partisan activity.

So if Russia is smart, expect a concentration of some force around Melitopol (strong partisan activity). But it's also possibly an area of opportunity for Ukraine as well.

So I've said a lot but have not provided a definitive answer... I'm sorry but the information we have from OSINT just isn't comprehensive enough for hard predictions. BUT there is some interesting food for thought above and many strategic implications to Russia's redeployment of troops.

I'm hopeful but this will likely be an incremental war based on all available information. I hope for a Russian collapse but do not expect one in the medium term.

SLAVA UKRAYINI!

Sincerely, an Aussie.

>So, it is clear that Russia has deployed these radar corner reflectors at both locations, making a 'phantom' bridge appear next to the real ones on satellite-based radar. 

&nbsp;

>These radar reflectors, though, would likely not be successful in confusing a HIMARS rocket strike as the munitions are not radar-guided, making the recently discovered ‘phantom bridge’ of radar reflectors a somewhat confusing addition. Although, we should note that HIMARS does use a radar-like proximity fusing system. But it seems very unlikely that would be impacted by the radar reflectors considering the GMLRS guidance concept that relies on GPS and INS to execute its pinpoint attacks.

I was about to respond to you in the other thread.  

All these numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt.  And it's common sense.  Just use your heads, people.  They know the complement of the train and they report that.  That's fair enough, but they really need to state ""*up to X amount*"".  The explosion isn't going to hit every single train car.  Four cars at the absolute most, not all equally damaged.  A missile cannot destroy 40 train cars unless they're stacked on top of each other.  

When it is reported that UA has killed ~50 troops at an ammo depot, that's based on either an estimate of the number of people who work on site or a result of intel before the fact about the number of people who are on site.  It's not a body count.  Not even Russia would have that information the same day.  Meaning this is not derived from Russian intel, either.  They'd be shifting through rubble for a week and still have an inexact number.  In reality that estimate could be higher or lower, and if it's at night, it's almost certainly half what it's operating complement is.  Nor is an entire site destroyed from a missile.  Just look at Russian missiles landing in the center of a major metropolitan area and causing single, double, or triple-digit (or zero) casualties depending on where exactly it hit and what time of day.  

Just a reminder to anyone reposting this information that these are estimates and sometimes they've *already* been misreported.  Everybody has an obligation not to report estimates as factual.  It denigrates the credibility of the thread.",False,1659326767.0,t3_wd7ngi,t1_iiguqgl,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Ukrainian pilots have been training with US pilots since they separated from the Soviet Union.

>In Ukraine, [the exchange program] took the form of swapping ideas in classrooms, flying together, and helping Ukrainian pilots develop their own culture of self-improvement. ...[T]he focus was always on building bonds with Ukraine’s Air Force and helping Ukraine’s airmen be the best they could be.

>“I’ve hosted Ukrainians at my house and I’ve been to several Ukrainians’ homes, too,” Swertfager said. “And it’s not just me, this is what the relationship is about.”

>When the 144th first started training with the Ukrainian Air Force, the country had just split off from the Soviet Union and was slowly shifting away from Soviet organization and doctrine to a more Western style of fighting, the colonel said. But some of the old ways of doing things still pop up in amusing ways. For example, Armey said that when U.S. pilots intercept other aircraft behaving suspiciously in American airspace, they often dump flares as a low-risk warning shot to get the intruder’s attention. Ukrainian pilots take ‘warning shot’ a bit more literally, a risky strategy high above the ground.

>“They’ll ask, ‘have you ever tried a warning shot with the gun? You should try it,’” Armey said. “I don’t think we’re ever going to try that.”",False,1659403584.0,t3_wd7ngi,t1_iikpixb,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Cries in /r/factorio and /r/openttd

The amount of internal screaming I'm doing right now... I mean... good grief. Good job on Ukraine attacking this rail line. But holy shit. There's a lot of video games out there where you play around with train lines and their designs.

Single-track is half the cost (you build one track instead of two tracks), but then you need to coordinate two-way traffic across that track (IE: if someone is on the track, you don't go. You wait for them to pass. You pull into a waiting bay and wait. They pass, and now its your turn to use the track to go there).

This is different from the common 2-way tracks in USA / Europe, where you have one line going north, and a 2nd line going south. Where both trains can travel at the same time. The tradeoff is great when you're pathing to rarely used track (they said only 2 passenger trains a day before the war), since you get half-cost tracks but you get grossly lowered throughput (far, far less than half). Its pretty much only used if you have a rarely used (only a few times a day) rail line.

----------

So yes, those passing loops are important. They are obviously a predictable location where trains will be stopped for many minutes for HIMARS-oclock. Good job on Ukraine for figuring this out. Clearly got some intelligent railroad engineers and knowledge over there.

To fix this vulnerability, the Russians would have to build a 2nd line all the way across the entire length of track (ie: upgrade to a ""normal"" 2-way track, one track for each direction). Aka: this vulnerability ain't getting fixed. Ever.",1659375602.0,1659375201.0,t3_wd7ngi,t1_iiiy1d1,,1,28,0,28,0,0,

>It looks like RU may have 10\~15BTGs on the west side of the Dnipro. At full strength that is upwards of 12,000 men

Their BTGs were under-strength *before* the invasion. At this point I would genuinely be surprised if they're more than 65% manned.

Doesn't mean I don't want to see them stomped though, but I think what we'll see over the next while is very slow Ukrainian advances on 2 fronts as they degrade Russian capability while avoid decisive (and casualty heavy) battles...

There's was an Italian suggestion about Ukraine gaining Crimea and Donbas back under their rule but autonomous with plans to later deal with their future together with Russia and Lavrov made a lot of angry noises and said it was very insulting. Besides that there's been talks about how the war will end with negotiations which is a reality unless people expected Moscow to be seized (most likely Crimea won't be possible to take but maybe sieged).

One of the biggest thorns about western treatment of Russia has been trying to solve things diplomatically when it's clear Russia or especially Putin really isn't interesting and a lot of weird appeasing statements that probed around this topic. A lot of these minor attempts or suggestions ended up just making people angry but hey, maybe there's was this slim chance Russia would've bitten so I wouldn't say it was a complete waste.

Besides that anything that gets close to giving up land is taken pretty seriously and often viewed very negatively as the more common stance is that Ukraine will get the full support to decide themselves. I do think other supporting countries in NATO have made some statements that if Ukraine wanted to make a deal they'd support that too which is probably a way to guard against the idea that Ukraine is forced to die for them for a goal they don't want to fight for.

But if something new has popped up that I've missed or you've got your own analysis I'd love to hear it.

It just makes sense for China to attack when the US Navy has its temporary weakness due to its long-planned upgrade cycle.

You're comparing a country whose fleet barely has one aircraft carrier to a country that has more aircraft carriers than all other countries together, several times over?

China has the ability to move 2500 soldier at once by sea. They're not going to invade even an abandoned island with that capacity.

Taiwan is practically impossible to invade by sea due to the nature of their shore, geography is on their side. Taiwan has the high ground practically all around.

And, again, before China invades, they need to prepare an invasion, they can't just wake up one morning and say ""today we invade, call the guys!"" By the time China is ready to invade, all the might of the US's navy, Japan, Australia, Korea, probably some UK and other NATO allies, will be waiting. It's likely the Chinese ships won't make it a few miles out of their waters before they become submarines.

Let's say China does decide to invade.

400 to 500 million Chinese people eat food that is imported. That's right. China can't produce enough food to feed it's own people, it has to import enough food for 400-500 million each year. And that amount increases because they keep clearing fields to build more shitty cities nobody wants to live in.

Do you know where this food comes from? The US, Australia, India, Europe.

Would you look at that, the west feeds China.

Do you think China wants to invade Taiwan so much that it is willing to starve 400-500 million people?

Do you know why China isn't helping Ruzzia, even though they have that strategic partnership with ""no limits?"" Because they are scared shitless of sanctions.

That's why they send no money to Ruzzia, no tech, no supplies, etc.

A country scared of sanctions is not a country that is invading anyone soon.

yeah, sure, China likes to act tough, but when they need to act you'll find China pretending they are busy. Talk is cheap, it costs them nothing. Actions are a different matter.",1659385016.0,1659383546.0,t3_wd7ngi,t1_iijmlnj,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

https://www.aerosociety.com/news/ukraine-time-to-fast-track-front-line-fighter-pilot-training/

>Q: How long is a western fighter pilots' training? And how short/abridged do you think a conversion course for Ukrainian pilots could be?

>A: Conversion to a front line combat aircraft for a new pilot would usually take about six months to become limited combat ready. However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks. If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-

>Q: What would be the best type to send them? MiG-29s from Poland/Slovakia would require minimal training, but give them parity, whereas surplus F-16s/18/F-15s could give them the edge? Could the UK's Tranche 1 Typhoons even be donated to give them overmatch - given they are set to be disposed of in a couple of years anyway? Or even surplus A-10s to take on Russian tanks?



>A: The more familiar the type the easier the conversion. However, Western types are fairly user-friendly (especially the F- series) and relatively simple to grasp the basics. The stick, throttle and handling basics are simple transferable skills. Using the radar, avionics, weapons and defensive aids is the area of focus and teaching the basics of employment of those shouldn't take too long to achieve a level capable of matching or even overmatching the apparent poor Russian proficiency.",False,1659399101.0,t3_wd7ngi,t1_iikmflj,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

We're probably looking at numbers in the dozens at most especially in the early phases of a deployment.  Think more something like the old Flying Tigers.  Given that F-16s have been a backbone fighter in a lot of air forces, it's not hard to believe they could get several dozen retired F-16 pilots.    


And yes, logistics is always an issue with this stuff, as well as training up the crews that keep these planes flying.  I suspect that getting combat trained pilots takes longer than ground crew, but like I said, we've had almost 6 months of possible prep time, so it's quite possible they've been able to put together ground crews and foreign volunteer pilots for a squadron or two of F-16s at this point.

There's a degree of mass shooting that an M777 can support but the USA's tactical strategy was never to saturate such a large area like the Russians do.

-------

USA cannot supply that number of guns because we never designed our army to have that huge number of guns. That's just the facts.

Vietnam is a really bad example.  We gave them weapons systems and then cut off the ammunition supply.  

We heard this excuse with training before.  On reddit it sounded like using an M777 was equivalent to brain surgery or piloting the space shuttle.  Veteran Ukrainian artillery crews had no difficulty picking it up.  In interviews our trainers said they spent the day learning things from the Ukrainian crews.  M777 was designed specifically with ease of use in mind.  It achieved that and cut the crew size too.  

Lets reframe the conversation.  A tool which is hard to use is a flawed tool.  It may have other merits but a tendency toward difficulty still implies lower quality.  Is there really a reason to judge Lockheed harshly in the case of HIMARS and M31 rockets?   

There are multiple potential follow up questions.  Why can't we build a rocket launcher that has a normal tractor-trailer engine recognisable by mechanics who work on commercial trucks?  Why cant we make precision guided rockets fly to the GPS coordinates entered into a normal laptop? Why not produce user friendly software so that you can just type in the coordinates?  

I, of course, have never fired a HIMARS nor looked in a cab.  I have a hunch that what you would see is remarkably similar to any other truck plus a pretty normal work station in the passenger seat.  

I trust engineers and designers at Lockheed to avoid building pieces of crap.  I do not trust politicians (including generals) to give us a straight story on why they implement a policy.

Same surprise happens when people have a leaky faucet or the toilet locks in flush so that it keeps draining.  It may only be a gallon per minute but if it goes for a month you have a bill for 43,000 gallons.  ""It is bigger than the house! How could it fit down the drain?""  A steady flow builds to an immense quantity.  

The US military (or any army) bulks up ammunition at depots over an extended period.  Then it makes sense to have a lot of hardware to use all the ammunition quickly.  In Ukraine the big war is already happening.  Now the question is how fast does ammunition flow in.

It all just magically works? Maybe doctors and nurses work for free too?  The Euros pay for their HC via VAT, which is a very regressive tax on the poor. In the US we have a very progressive income tax system, they don't, in the US the bottom 50% earners pay no income taxes.  So what you want to do is fire all the private sector people, rehire them to goverment positions, start charging poor people 25% on all their purchases so they can get the same healthcare they now get for free in some states.  How is this a good thing?  I'm not saying what we have is good, I'm just saying you are missing some of the major fucking details.
