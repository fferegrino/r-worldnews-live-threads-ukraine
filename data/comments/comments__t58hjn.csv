The introduction of martial law would give the authorities sweeping powers to limit freedom of movement and freedom of speech. Martial law has been introduced in modern Russia.


Tatyana Stanovaya, a prominent Russian political analyst and founder of R.Politik on Wednesday evening tweeted that introducing a martial law would be a “logical scenario.”


“The proclamation of martial law will allow the authorities to introduce military censorship, to increase the secrecy of the state’s activities and the actions of local bodies.”

With the introduction of martial law, the powers of elected bodies, local authorities and officials are automatically extended.

The last time an unscheduled meeting of the Federation Council was called, the body approved President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country, two days prior to the country’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th.

The Federation Council said it will officially discuss on Friday a package of anti-crisis measures in response to Western sanctions.

Over 6,500 Russians have so far been detained across Russia during anti-war protests, according to the independent monitoring site OVD-Info.

Russia has also seen a widespread crackdown on its independent media since the start of the war. Yesterday, Russia’s prosecutor general ordered the country’s media watchdog to block the liberal Ekho Moskvy radio station and the last remaining opposition television channel Dozhd TV.


The Duma is also set to meet on Friday to discuss a new law that would punish “spreading disinformation about the armed forces of the Russian Federation in any military conflicts” with up to 15 years in prison.

Barnes:

A Western intelligence report said senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, according to senior Biden administration officials and a European official.

The report indicates that senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions before the invasion started last week. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing on Feb. 4 before the opening ceremony of the Olympics. Moscow and Beijing issued a 5,000-word statement at the time declaring that their partnership had “no limits,” denouncing NATO enlargement and asserting that they would establish a new global order with true “democracy.”

The intelligence on the exchange between the Chinese and Russian officials was classified. It was collected by a Western intelligence service and considered credible by officials reviewing it. Senior officials in the United States and allied governments passed it around as they discussed when Mr. Putin might attack Ukraine.

However, different intelligence services had varying interpretations, and it is not clear how widely the information was shared.

“We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power,” Kirby said. “We’d certainly like to see Moscow reciprocate by taking the temperature down on rhetoric about nuclear posture.”


Kirby also confirmed that US and allied weapons are continuing to be delivered to the Ukrainians. “Security assistance continues to flow, not just from the United States but from many of our allies and partners, and as recently as even just the last 24 hours,” Kirby said. “We are making every effort to get as much security assistance as we can to the Ukrainians, as fast as we can.”


On the stalling of the vast Russian military column that was heading towards Kyiv, Kirby offered three explanations, that the Russians are regrouping and reassessing their tactics, they are having logistics and supply difficulties and thirdly, Ukrainian resistance.

Stinger missiles can be used to shoot down aircraft. During the Cold War, the U.S. government secretly supplied Afghan resistance fighters with stingers to shoot down Russian helicopters over Afghanistan.

Germany announced last weekend that they are sending 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, as well.

5,800 sounds high to me, but, even if we are talking about half that figure, these are far greater losses than the Russian military has sustained in previous conflicts under Putin's leadership. Russia lost more than 3,000 troops during the 2nd Chechen War but over several years.

Not to mention, the farther the Russian military pushes into Ukraine, the more exposed its supply lines will become and the easier it will be for insurgents to target isolated Russian units. It seems many of Russia's casualties have come from supply convoys that were ambushed.

The standard of living for everyday Russians will decrease significantly, and while they couldn’t speak up in 2014, the impact now will be much more tangible and widespread, to the point I expect actual violent protests.

Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov was sanctioned by the European Union on Monday. Two days later, Forbes has learned from three sources in the yacht industry that one of his prized possessions—the 512-foot yacht Dilbar, valued at nearly $600 million—has been seized by German authorities in the northern city of Hamburg.

The ship has been in the Hamburg shipyards of German shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October for a refitting job. Sources who spoke to Forbes said that the German government froze the asset and that, likely as a result, Blohm+Voss employees who had been working on the yacht didn’t show up to work on Wednesday. Representatives for Blohm+Voss and Usmanov didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Usmanov purchased Dilbar in 2016 for a reported cost of $600 million from German shipbuilder Lürssen, which custom-built it for him over 52 months. The firm calls it “one of the most complex and challenging yachts ever built, in terms of both dimensions and technology.” At 15,917 tons, it’s the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, and is typically manned by a crew of 96 people. Dilbar boasts the largest swimming pool ever installed on a yacht as well as two helicopter pads, a sauna, a beauty salon, and a gym. Its plush interiors have more than 1,000 sofa cushions and it can host up to 24 people in 12 suites.

I feel like everyone of sober mind is in agreement that a direct shooting war is to be avoided, but I also just don't see how the current equilibrium doesn't lead to line-stepping and escalation. If the US can provide the Ukrainians with Stingers, why not Patriot missiles? If bombs, why not jets? If land weaponry, why not Harpoon anti-ship missiles or TLAM? If TB-2 drones, why not predators? If intelligence, why not GPS targeting data? We haven't done it yet. We're obviously at war with Russia, but the pretense that we're not seems necessary to avoid escalation. Put another way, it seems as if we cannot be so involved that Russia loses the war quickly, because of the danger that Russia will respond to losing a conventional war by starting a nuclear one. 

But, are we willing to allow Ukraine to lose the war? It feels like not. So, what exactly is the deal here? We provide enough support that Ukraine doesn't lose, but not enough support that Russia loses (at least any time in the foreseeable future)? Producing an endless bloody quagmire and hoping that internal Russian political forces will bring about withdrawal? 

It's so odd. Russia begrudgingly accepts that we're going to support Ukraine because they can't stop us, just so long as we let them think that they might win? So if they get closer to winning, we'll help Ukraine more, but never so much that Russia's overall military viability is threatened. We're assessing what, how embarrassing of a defeat Russia will suffer? We're allowed to help Ukrainians kill Russians, but only if the technology used is from before 2000 and not too expensive?

Either Russia will stall out as things are, or they'll eventually make progress, probably by a higher intensity of destruction of cities, civilians, and civilian infrastructure. There's no way that the combination of Russian progress and Russian atrocity doesn't result in stronger desire to help, which means we'll end up sending more stuff but only once Russia is in a better position and less threatened by it.

It's among the weirdest things I've ever witnessed in international relations. It's as though Russia didn't think the Western support would be enough, so they established that the status quo level of support and intervention didn't bother them.

It's not hard to understand India's position:

1.	⁠India borders China and Pakistan and has been through 4 wars with Pakistan and 1 war with China. There are constant incursions into Indian territory on a monthly basis from both Pakistan and China.
2.	⁠For decades, the US favored Pakistan and armed them against India. During the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, the US threatened India with nukes.
3.	⁠India previously bought arms from the US, but the US refused to sell parts and ammunition for those weapons right in the middle of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, when India needed them most.
4.	⁠India was under US sanctions for years after developing nuclear weapons.

Like any other government, the Indian government has a responsibility to protect its citizens. Given US hostility towards India, it had no choice but to buy them from Russia. This has created a relationship of dependence, where India needs to maintain a non-enemy status with Russia in order to service and maintain those weapons.

That said, India realizes that an over-dependence on Russia is not good. Since the early 2000's, they have been building their own defense industry to reduce their dependence on Russia. They have also diversified into buying arms from France, Israel, and other countries. But all of these things take time, for a country as huge as India.

While it's unfortunate that India was forced to abstain from the vote, keep in mind that:

1.	⁠The Indian PM has twice called Putin, asking him to withdraw his forces from Ukraine immediately.
2.	⁠India has sent medicines and other humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, despite Russian pressure.
3.	⁠Most recently, India's State Bank sanctioned Russia by refusing to accept transactions from Russian banks.

How long have you been following the crisis today(minutes? Hours?)? How about the past week?

What have you not done in your personal life by attending to this? It is a very important issue to follow, to be sure, but it is also mentally and emotionally taxing. If you’re overwhelmed emotionally, you won’t be at your best in participating here or in your personal life.

How do you feel in this moment? Are you tense? Anxious? Angry? Despairing at human cruelty? These are all valid reactions to what’s going on, but you need to take care of yourself, for your own benefit and to not fall into emotional reasoning on what’s going on. The world just voted to condemn Russia’s actions - you do not need to personally witness every new tragedy to be a responsible global citizen.

Have you ever considered meditation or hypnosis?

For those who haven’t, here’s a basic breathing exercise:

Sit or lay down in a comfortable position. Don’t focus on it being dignified - the only requirement is that you feel comfortable. Close your eyes.

Take a deep breath inward through your nose for five seconds. Focus on the feeling of drawing the air in - how does the breath feel in your nose? In your lungs? Can you feel your heart beat faster?

Follow this with a slow out-breath of ten seconds through your mouth. How does your body feel as you do this?

Repeat this breathing for at least a minute (conveniently four complete in and out breaths). If you can go longer, so much the better!

If you can or find it beneficial, imagine that you are drawing strength and peace into your body with each breath in, and purging your doubts, pains, fears, and anxieties as you breathe out. The world may not change as you do - but you can choose how you react to what’s going on in the world.

Note what’s going through your mind and why as you do this. Instead of clinging to individual thoughts, allow them to gently pass from your consciousness. They will be very insistent at first, but give them permission to go on their way. You’re aiming to sit with yourself without being fixated on any one thought. Mastering this takes years, so just aim to experience the process and admire that you are taking a tangible step in managing your emotions constructively. I respect you for doing so; it’s never easy taking those first steps.

Taking care of ourselves as we hold compassion and concern for others is key, and allows us collectively to do what needs to be done to make sure that the evil we’re seeing can be fought rightly and resist those who, with propaganda and malice, would see our resolve waver.

After all, see such sentiment commonly-expressed among Republicans at Trump rallies: 

- https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/9b2_717trump1-3-800x430.jpg

I further will explain why this is relevant on the world stage:

- Giuliani recently gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Observe Sean Hannity praising Putin's manliness while denigrating Obama for wearing a bicycle helmet while, dare I say it, riding a bicycle](https://youtu.be/timvZTKr5HQ)

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data.

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow and met with their government officials.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

In reality, if such a system existed, it makes strategic sense to make it public, as it reinforces the deterrent - ‘if you nuke us, we’ll shoot your missiles down, then nuke you back anyway’. However, it does break the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) which itself can be dangerous if an adversary decides it should first strike now before the system is developed further. This is classical Cold War arms race mentality though, and it’s arguable whether this is a genuine concern in this day and age.

Regardless, I can point to two expensive and highly publicised attempts at strategic missile defence:

SDI (‘Star Wars’) - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative
Airborne Laser (ABL) - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1

SDI was what you might consider a missile shield, taking out warheads in their terminal phase. SDI was canned after the end of the Cold War. Good money was being thrown after bad, it wasn’t delivering, and the Cold War threat was gone, so funding was pulled.

Next came the ABL project. Geared towards taking out rockets on their boost phase. It came into fruition as new nuclear threats emerged from states such a North Korea and Iran where a full strategic attack isn’t likely, and to attempt to pick out the few rockets they could get off the ground early on. Regardless, it wasn’t practical and didn’t work. Funding pulled.

The reality is ICBMs are launched from either deep within an enemies country, or somewhere hidden far out at sea. By time you know what’s going on, they are well on their way. High up in space, the nose of the ICBM opens and it starts dropping its individual warheads onto it targets, along with all sorts of dummy warheads, counter measures, etc - for the full horror if this system, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle

The actual warheads are tiny compared to the missile itself. The missile rocket body itself is done one it’s in space. The nuclear warheads released aren’t much bigger than a large traffic cone, and they are raining down from space. In a full strategic attack, it’s possible there would be thousands.

There’s no physical defence against this. You could try and preemptively launch your nukes to take out the enemies first, but this is countered by sub-launched missiles that would come after your attack any way - this is the principle that makes MAD work.

The only guaranteed way to win in nuclear war is not to have nuclear war. Any action taken that increases the risk of such a conflict should be carefully considered.

Its up in the air if Putin will stop at Ukraine, since from his perspective with all the sanctions and EU countries increasing their military budget, the balance of power will be even more skewed towards EU/NATO in next couple of years. I hope I’m wrong, but from Putins perspective it could be “now or never”.

To state clearly that we understand this is not the Russian people doing evil, but one man, and that him disappearing will fix this problem. 

  
I think this is de facto already the case, but hope an official statement to this effect would accelerate the process and improve the chances.

  
I think this is not only the way to end this conflict with the least loss of life - I think it may also be the only way, period.

  
No matter how badly the war against Ukraine goes and how long it drags on, Putin cannot afford to lose this – he must know that losing may cost him his power and his life, and therefore I think he won't – even if that means encircling and starving Kyiv while firing low-precision missiles in the city centre until the civilians are all dead and the essential infrastructure and culture are all rubble, even if it means threatening of deploying a tactical nuke against Poland to stop NATO reinforcements. I fear he will escalate as much as he can until he wins, and he can escalate much. 

  
There is no way Ukraine can defend itself against the overwhelming power of unprecise, severe airstrikes that Russia has in reserve. And as the West, what more can we do without risking open confrontation between nuclear powers, risking all of us? You can't militarily defeat a man this delusional, definitely not without first going through everyone between him and you, and he is putting his whole people in the way to be hurt in his stead.

 But his people can remove him. His people removing him seems the plausible endgoal of all these sanctions. The earlier they do, the less the damage to Russia, the less the ordinary people get hurt.

  
The horrors inflicted upon Ukraine are intolerable. But I also grieve the Russian soldiers forced and tricked into this war. Innocent children are dying each day for this war, while Putin sits safe behind the lines.

  
I don't think Putin will ever surrender, no matter how many Russians die and what atrocities are necessary against Ukrainians and how much he has to starve Russia to finance this. I think he is more likely to nuke the planet than give in.

  
But I don't think the Russians will tolerate it. There are protests by ordinary people, despite the crackdowns, because this is atrocious, because Putin is shelling civilians in a country they consider their brother. Celebrities, politicians and people across all fields of work are speaking out. The political opposition has condemned this war. Many of the oligarchs are turning on Putin. The Kremlin and the military, while clearly intimidated, must be utterly frustrated. There have been several key mistakes made in this campaign that cost many Russians their lives, and that are hard to explain – and one of the most plausible ways to explain this is that Putin has created a culture of such pressure and fear that it feels impossible to communicate bad news to him or refuse him, and so he keeps ordering more and more mad moves based on intel viewed through rosy glasses, and the generals giving the orders must know that this idiocy is killing their men. This sounds like there are a rising number of people well positioned and motivated to take Putin out, be it by an angry individual assassinating him, a military coup, a legal move by parliament handing him over to be tried for war crimes, a public mov storming his home and lynching him, or whatever other option, and a rising amount of public support would back this. If we put the idea out there and argued for it, spelled out the consequences, is it so implausible that it might happen? And seeing this clusterfuck, wouldn't a replacement for Putin likely not repeat these mistakes?

  
What would be the repercussions of outright saying this? Could this be avoided by communicating it differently?

  
I hate that Ukrainians and Russians are dying for this man, that Russia and Ukraine are suffering for this man, that we are fighting him so indirectly by fighting Russians who did not choose this. We are fighting the wrong people. The Russian conscripts, crying and hungry and wanting to go home, are not the enemy. The Russian start-ups going broke are not the enemy. The ordinary people losing their pensions are not the enemy. There is no limit to how many troops Putin will throw in the grinder to be incinerated. He will never start caring for them.

The least likely is that with EU and US support the Ukrainians win and the Russians leave. This is unlikely, but with a possible NATO country with billions in arms on their border and control of Russian energy pipelines, this will lead to more conflict.

Ukraine is split down the middle, giving Eastern Ukraine to Russia. This is basically the same result, although we’d be in a Cold War atmosphere, with less direct conflict.

Russia gets Ukraine to surrender. Ukraine signs a treaty that it will not join NATO and not receive anymore US arms. This is, in my opinion, a likely outcome. This would be the best way to broker peace, and keep Ukraine neutral.

Will Russia's different republics splinter off into their own countries?

 >The Democracy Index is an index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the research division of the Economist Group, a UK-based private company which publishes the weekly newspaper The Economist. Akin to a Human Development Index but centrally concerned with political institutions and freedoms, the index attempts to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture.

They did not establish complete dominance of the air and there is a strange absence of the RAF (Russian Air Force).  When you combine that with not the best morale, massive corruption within the military, and issues with logistics you get this embarrassment for Russia.


On the Ukrainian side, their military has done a lot since 2014 in terms of strengthening itself.  In addition, the US and others have conducted training, specifically in terms of asymmetric warfare.  You can see this focus with their foreign military aid in the forms of Javelins (portable anti-tank missile), Stingers (portable anti-aircraft missile), and other similar weapons.  The Ukrainians also have of good number of soldiers and ex-soldiers with experience due to the Russian-backed separatists.  Finally, they are motivated and that means a lot in this kind of fight.  There will be resistance movements in any occupied part of Ukraine and that is something not military can deal with, not even the US military.


So where does that leave the future?  Well Russia still is stronger in overall military strength and is changing tactics to its usually brute force with artillery.  Urban fighting is all but guaranteed and that is extremely costly.  If this war continues, we will see battles similar to those in Grozny during the Chechen Wars.

Like, imagine you had a super accurate weapon, and someone was throwing peas at you. It's easy to destroy that one (pretend you can aim perfectly for this one), but if they threw 5? Way harder. 50? You'd stand no chance. It's a similar thing for the defence system, it can't get a large amounts of weapons at the same time. Not only that, with the warheads you'd also get a bunch of decoys (because people aren't stupid, they know how those defence systems work, too), so the chance is low that you'd get all the real ones and there wouldn't be enough resources to hit all decoys and all actual weapons.

As far as I know, those defence system also haven't been tested against very long-range weapons (for the obvious logistical problems), which is a pretty large security flaw. 

So yeah, missile defence systems exist, and they do offer some protection. But even if we ignore the fact that many countries have no to bad versions of those and it's highly unlikely that Russia would only target the USA (if they want war with the NATO for some reason, they can hit a smaller country, which would also be closer and have way less time to take any actions), they're far from perfect, and in this context everything less than perfect is deadly.",False,1646256624.0,t3_t58hjn,t1_hz3jfyi,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The warhead has insufficient armor penetration.

Anti-tank missiles are often capable of hitting the slow-moving tank directly and have warheads that focus all their force into a single concentrated point in order to punch a hole in the tank armor.

The Stinger missile, and many other anti-aircraft missiles, can't really be expected to score a direct hit on a fast-moving aircraft, so it has a warhead that explodes in all directions when it's near the aircraft, hoping that at least some of the shrapnel will hit the aircraft. Aircraft usually have little or no armor, so a little bit of shrapnel might be enough to bring it down.

To enforce a no NFZ it would effectively be up to NATO countries to ensure it's kept to as Ukraine aren't in any position to do it themselves.

Secondly enforcing a NFZ would also mean enforcing it on Ukraine, hampering their ability to utilise drones and any other air support that they desperately need. This would drastically help the Russians, something NATO definitely doesn't want to do.

1. Ukraine refuses to surrender. Putin indiscriminately bombs the nation into capitulation. Thousands of civilians die. Ukraine is left as a pile of rubble full of Ukrainian rebel fighters. Russia tries to introduce a puppet government that the population doesn't accept and the situation turns into a 10+ year quagmire just like US intelligence is saying could happen (this is the most likely solution in my opinion).

2. The Russian oligarchs sit Putin down for an intervention, tell him that this situation is, ""bad for business,"" and give him an unfortunate case of ""falling out a window."" The oligarchs then put someone else in place who is willing to quickly end the war and return things to normal (this could happen, although I imagine Putin would try and use his military and police force to seize these oligarchs himself before they could try and remove him). 

3. Ukraine, demoralized by civilians being slaughtered by Russian bombardments and cities turned to rubble, submit to Putin's demands that involve: surrendering Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk all to Russia, reducing their military capacity, and agreeing to never join NATO (this is incredibly unlikely to happen since Ukraine has no reason to disarm themselves at this point).

 I think with current events, Europe will step up its own defense as a counter to Russian aggression and therefore become less reliant on u.s military power. 

Europe by itself could take on Russian even now with a fairly good chance of success, especially given what we have seen of Russia in this war so far, but having the United States on side helps to tip that even further in their favor.

The thing about explosions is, doubling the yield doesn't double the blast radius since space exists in not one, not two, but three dimensions.

Because the explosive forces expand in all three dimensions the blast radius and blast effects get exponentially less the further you get away.  Think cube root rule (cube root is used for lots of Calculations regarding blast wave overpressure)

So the larger and larger the bombs get, the diminishing returns get worse and worse.

So even though an 800kt explosion is 38 times more yield than a 21kt explosion, the blast radius is only 3.37 times as large.",1646255093.0,1646254846.0,t3_t58hjn,t1_hz3ja6l,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

So the question isn't how bad an individual weapon is, but what type of exchange we could see.


1. Tactical Use: This would be 'in theater' and a 'relatively' small bomb. Targeting a concentration of enemy forces or a city. You wouldn't see a massive exchange between countries. While it would be bad, it wouldn't change the world directly. NATO would almost certainly get involved if it did happen.

2. Limited Exchange: This would be a larger attack on specific targets outside of the theater of operations (where combat is happening). Say on military bases or cities in Europe. This would almost certainly trigger an exchange, but it could theoretically stay limited. But it would have global repercussions, because a lot of people would be dead and territory useless.

3. MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction. This is the ultimate one. An unlimited exchange between two nuclear powers. Everybody dies. Nuclear winter. Civilizations wiped off the map in a day.


The chance of any of these happening is very small. But the most likely is tactical use. Putin uses it on a city to destroy Ukrainian morale. But then he denies Russia that city, so it's a pyrrhic victory. And it would almost definitely bring NATO into the conflict.


Everybody talks about MAD, but it's important to understand [NUTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_utilization_target_selection) is actually what the US and Russia both believe in.

The range of power between all those things is orders of magnitude. So yes there are smaller nukes than we have seen but the radiation resulting from the use of any nuclear weapons even the smallest ones makes them always unacceptable.

Yeah, there's a fair bit of propaganda from the Ukrainian side as well. For example, yesterday a large outlet claimed on Twitter that a Russian convoy was destroyed and implied that the Ukrainian fighters had taken out literally *800* vehicles. No proof. And many people swallowed it up without even questioning whether it was true or not. It distracts from the true nature of the war and its horrific trajectory thus far.

The sanctions crippled that war chest and removed most of Russias tools to counter the sanction's impact. The level of sanctions was unexpected by everyone even the West. They kind of snowballed as more and more countries joined in. Everyone thought they would be limp dicked sanctions like they usually are.

In a Russia isolated war I think you'd see them primarily nuke the fuck out of Europe and NATO.  I would anticipate at least several major cities in the United states being hit, hard to say how much long range stuff they have, and how much the US could intercept.  Europe has many targets much closer and I think defence would be incredibly hard.

Assuming NATO fired nukes back into Russia, which they may or may not do is hard to say you would probably see several russian cities destroyed. I actually think the retaliation from NATO may be primarily to destroy known nuclear sites and submarines rather then nuking populace areas but who knows.

If China joined in on the Russian side you would likely see significantly more damage everywhere but I think most likely they'd just keep out of it. I would expect to see hundreds of millions killed but don't think you'd hit a billion in a Russia/NATO war.

All nukes going off at once, have a very different effect than 1000 over 70 years, and often tested on very isolated areas.

-First, fallout would be so huge that it would cause a very long winter where all crops would be dead, as well as lots of animals used for food. (Fires caused by the explosions also contribute)

-Major nations falling means a total wreck and shift of the world's economy and all supply chains would be broken, leaving smaller countries by themselves having to subsist in what the nuclear winter allows them to have.

-An incredible amount of refugees going from everywhere to everywhere, meaning any country that is doing kinda well, would get flooded with desperate people

And the effect I see the least talked about, explosions could have extra effects depending on what they hit, I read theres a big chance that a Nuke falling on Yellowstone park in the US, could trigger the world's biggest Volcano thats there, which would make the nuclear winter effect last for decades.

 >The policy of Russification of Finland (Finnish: sortokaudet / sortovuodet, lit. 'times/years of oppression'; Russian: Русификация Финляндии, romanized: Rusyfikatsiya Finlyandii) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at limiting the special status of the Grand Duchy of Finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness in 1899–1905 and in 1908–1917. It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th–early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non-Russian minorities within the empire.
 
**[Russification of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_of_Ukraine)** 
 
 >The Russification of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Зросі́йщення Украї́ни, romanized: Zrosiishchennia Ukrainy; Russian: Русификация Украины, romanized: Rusyfikatsiya Ukrainy) was a body of laws, decrees, and other actions undertaken by the Imperial Russian and later Soviet authorities to strengthen Russian national, political and linguistic positions in Ukraine.

 >National missile defense (NMD) is a generic term for a type of missile defense intended to shield an entire country against incoming missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) or other ballistic missiles. This is also used to refer to the American nationwide antimissile program the United States has had in development since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities. This article focuses mainly on this system and a brief history of earlier systems which led to it.

For a ton of reasons that I have posted through other comments. But one big driver was demographics. Population is shrinking. During WW2 the USSR sacrificed waves of men in exchange for time. Soldiers would run in with one carrying a rifle and another extra ammo. The thinking going that people would pick up what they needed as the battles raged. This resulted  a much smaller post war population. His army will not be stronger in the future. The time to act was now before Ukraine get stronger. 

But no NFZ and NATO troops is a dumb f’n idea. This war is early and Russia has not been using its traditional tactics. It is now. The goal is to salvage something that seems like a win. Going further while struggling in one war is dumb.

I will admit that I mainly do stuff in Microsoft's space, but my short answer is: asking if they can 'stop' a local database isn't the right kind of question. 

Most productivity solutions these days are managed/licensed, per seat, by a virtualized server system on the cloud (that the client can talk to). In many cases, a license 'token' is pulled down to a client machine every time it connects, which is then good for a certain amount of time even if the machine goes offline (i.e., if you have an outage you can still use your productivity tools provided by your E3 Microsoft license.) 

This amount of time varies between platforms, licenses and implementations, as do many other externalities outside of 'Does so-and-so have a kill switch that fires if the target machine talks to their licensing server?' The thing these productivity solutions have in common, however, is that they're managed to a degree by their provider, and that management involves things like integration assistance, initial tech support and troubleshooting, platform management on the providers end which one would need to contact to do a whole host of things, SLAs, etcetera. 

To put it another way: Oracle may or may not be able to 'stop' a local database. But if that database owner wants to consistently and reliably do anything with it besides look at it, without Oracle being there on their side, that's going to be very difficult and time consuming, if not impossible.

Thing is, it throws a wrench in how China is doing business. For decades, they’ve been slowly but surely expanding power outside their national boundaries. Hong Kong became theirs in 1999, but they’ve been slowly adding more and more Beijing control. They’ve been doing what Russia did to Belarus in Taiwan. Just slower. Same with the South China Sea. 

But they didn’t seem willing to risk open conflict and never launched anything remotely like Ukraine. Hell, not even Crimea or Georgia recently. 

But now there’s a big huge spotlight on what Russia did in Ukraine and unified basically the entire planet against them. And China’s lot is thrown in with Russia, basically by default.

To continue specifically to what you brought up about lots of things being intact, this is a fair point but I would much consider this to be more about incompetence and simply stuff taking time than malice. 

It's true that if the initial plans were as sweepingly successful as planned, they would not have included bombing all this stuff: but that's not sandbagging, that's simply not wasting bombs, missiles, and planes on destroying stuff that doesn't need to be destroyed in such a quick war. Now that everything's gone tits up, they are moving to destroy them: but have a very limited supply of precision pods/bombs/missiles (as has been noted by some commentators) and so are never going to be as effective as the US was.

Certainly, Putin would've preferred Trump being in office. But you keep pretending that ""bUt tHeY diD soMeThInG WhIlE a dEm wAs In!"" means anything, substantively.

It was more like:

- Trump lost and he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet would withdraw from NATO. 
- Covid happened, which delayed the plan.
- Putin opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- Meanwhile, Republicans cannot get their heads out of their asses and are taking advantage of the domestic chaos from nut-jobs like those who supported January 6th.

(Curious you neglect Putin's little excursion in Georgia under Bush, conveniently, as well).",1646257275.0,1646256658.0,t3_t58hjn,t1_hz3odwj,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
