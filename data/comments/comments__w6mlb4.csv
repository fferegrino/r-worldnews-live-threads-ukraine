> 
> - Russia’s strategic positioning as a commodities exporter has irrevocably deteriorated, as it now deals from a position of weakness with the loss of its erstwhile main markets, and faces steep challenges executing a “pivot to Asia” with non-fungible exports such as piped gas
> 
> - Despite some lingering leakiness, Russian imports have largely collapsed, and the country faces stark challenges securing crucial inputs, parts, and technology from hesitant trade partners, leading to widespread supply shortages within its domestic economy
> 
> - Despite Putin’s delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent; the hollowing out of Russia’s domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst
> 
> - As a result of the business retreat, Russia has lost companies representing ~40% of its GDP, reversing nearly all of three decades’ worth of foreign investment and buttressing unprecedented simultaneous capital and population flight in a mass exodus of Russia’s economic base
> 
> - Putin is resorting to patently unsustainable, dramatic fiscal and monetary intervention to smooth over these structural economic weaknesses, which has already sent his government budget into deficit for the first time in years and drained his foreign reserves even with high energy prices – and Kremlin finances are in much, much more dire straits than conventionally understood
> 
> - Russian domestic financial markets, as an indicator of both present conditions and future outlook, are the worst performing markets in the entire world this year despite strict capital controls, and have priced in sustained, persistent weakness within the economy with liquidity and credit contracting – in addition to Russia being substantively cut off from international financial markets, limiting its ability to tap into pools of capital needed for the revitalization of its crippled economy",False,1658652236.0,t3_w6mlb4,t1_ihes5lj,,1,48,0,48,0,0,

This one I've been saying myself...

>I'm not convinced Medvedev, who for years was seen as the liberal alternative to Putin, believes the antisemitic, anti-Polish, anti-Western hate speech he publishes on Telegram. He's creating a profile that might be useful later (just as his technocrat profile was once useful) 6/

^Medvedev is playing an ultra-hawk because he thinks that is what the power brokers in Russia will want when Putin falls, imho

>Kadyrov now proposes that Russia locate air defense systems in Chechnya. His justification is that Ukraine might attack Chechnya, which is not credible. **It sounds more like he is preparing for a post-Putin Russia in which Chechnya would claim independence**. 9/

:o

>If Russia loses the war, the people saying radical things now will have protected themselves. For my part, I tend to see the drastic proclamations as evidence that important Russians think that Russia is losing. 5/

Yep!

>Putin is clearly afraid that a general mobilization would undo his popularity and bring down his regime. In this sense he is weak. 18/

Even without mobilization his regime might be threatened in the next few years.  Russia's humiliation in Ukraine is Putin's first and foremost.

>The equilibrium that keeps Putin in power—mastery over rivals, soft support in the population, integrity of the army—is challenged by the realities of an unpredictable, costly war. Putin has been good at keeping us all in a fog. But now he himself seems lost in the fog of war 24/

>The trap presented to Putin by rivals, by the public, by the army looks like this: we will all agree with you that we are winning the war, and we will all blame you when if we lose it. This is all clouded by emotion, displacement, and fear. But this is the general picture. 25/

When it comes down to it, its a choice between troops dying on the battlefront while fighting, or civilians dying en masse after torture, gang-rapes, and mass killings. That's what happened in Bacha and Mariupol. At least with Ukrainian troops, they're actively being trained and protected as best as the army can, unlike Russian conscripts, they're not being sent to the frontlines in another country after just 5 days of training.",False,1658663189.0,t3_w6mlb4,t1_ihfo308,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

If you are reporting the location or activities of Ukrainian forces you are providing information to Russia which could get those service members and civilians killed.

As to Ukraine itself the ZSU and armed forces in general understand the concepts of operational security and have learned hard lessons early in the conflict to that effect. As such they will not actively talk about operations in progress. The risk is when a civilian(such as yourself) who happens to be in Ukraine posts a Facebook update even innocently(say they just got rescued) before the operation is over and everyone is safe. What can(and often does) happen is a Russian operator will see that post and fire a missile at that location which can turn a good moment into a tragedy.

To answer your question less frequent updates generally means there is an active operation. This could be good news if the operation goes well yes but that is why it is key to LET them do their jobs and wait patiently for them to tell you the results.

Well that's kind of the thing about how this war is going, particularly from the technological capability side.

The ""best case"" scenario for Ukraine is that it's military becomes functionally on the NATO standard and fully supplied as such. So lets say they get there. Given how good NATO kit is working against Russia, pushing them back to the border would be relatively easy. While it takes both parties to get to peace, not all war is the same.

It's entirely possible that the result is Ukraine saying ""We're done here."" and Russia just keeps lobbing random cruise missiles over the border like Hezbollah firing missiles into Israel. Annoying and occasionally deadly, not no longer nearly as existential of a threat. Except with Russia, the West can just KEEP the sanctions going forever pretty much. The longer they are in place, the easier it is for the West to just do without removing them. While the same is partially true for Russia, it's not NEARLY as so problem-free as it is for Europe.

The SKS was made as the original Mosin/SVT-40 replacement (combining the best of the late model Mosin M44 carbine and the unreliable but technically brilliant SVT-40, a compact, simple, no-frills, reliable rifle, but capable of semi-auto fire with a medium ammunition capacity) but quickly rendered obsolete by the infinitely superior AK-47 - Russia has all of them, well, those that didn't get shipped out by the USSR as foreign aid to the likes of Vietnam and the swathe of Communist revolutions in Africa. 

Plus they have the aforementioned Mosins, and other WWII era small arms, lots of PPS-42/43 and PPSh-41. This includes all of the still serviceable used weapons returned after the demobilisation following 1945 plus the huge number that were built for a campaign against Japan that never happened. Again, the Mosin belongs in a museum but we've seen the DNR and LNR troops with them, they're acceptable (if not great) as a basic ""marksman"" rifle or for guerilla squads. The SMGs again are reasonable to issue to vehicle crews who are unlikely to actually see combat, meaning their newer weapons (like an AKS-74U) can be reallocated to e.g. frontline officers, support soldiers (like an ammo bearer) and so forth.

So those kooks like to look around and say society is falling apart because it makes them feel superior. They want this because they are rejected by society so want to feel better.

He predicts great wealth generation. Which has happened for the past 200 years on average across the entire  human race. Life expectancy, literacy, disease freedom, access to clean water etc

Problem is strong men tend to be idiots and make stupid decisions... Eg trump, putin, bolsanaro, Hitler when they eventually buy into their own cult of personality.

Religious wars in Italy and the pope fleeing are again generic, and could easily be applied to the Avignon Papacy,

Bloody revolution in Russia, take your pick really, there's been enough palace coups and infighting going back hundreds of years,

Murder in the Balkans of a great character, Franz Ferdinand's death pushes over the dominoes leading to WWI,

Great cataclysms, if it's the Balkans again there is a major fault line going through the region,

Following this up to point out that you can make ""predictions"" just by reading enough current events to see patterns, some fortune tellers will be quite vague and open ended in order to hedge bets,

 and that we've seen with other prophecies, such as The Book of Revelation, that the vagueness and the speaking in code, sometimes mean that people draw interpretations that aren't always there in order to meet their own biases.

If somebody came out and said a month ago, ""At 1 PM on the Tuesday, 2 weeks from now, Jessica will badly burn herself trying to fry sausages in her kitchen, and be unable to get treated in the ER due to a staffing crisis,""

That is a bit different than saying ""there will be a time when this hungry person will get too close to a cooking instrument, and carry a burn scar for the rest of her life.""

> In 1947 Irlmaier, who at that time had 15 previous convictions - seven times for fraud and eight times for payment difficulties - was reported to the district court in Laufen by a pastor for fraud and juggling; according to the Bavarian police penal code, this was considered a criminal offense until 1957. During the trial, two witnesses stated that they had not believed Irlmaier's contradictory prophecies from the outset. Five other witnesses testified that Irlmaier's interpretation was correct. A conviction for fraud was therefore ruled out.
