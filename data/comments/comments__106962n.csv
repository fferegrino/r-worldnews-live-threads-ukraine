I think that people are really sleeping on how big of a deal the Paladins are.  The US has roughly 1000 of them so they can continue giving batches like this for a while.  Unlike with HIMARS, ammunition is plentiful if the US decides to dig into its reserves.  

The PzH 2000's are great and reportedly have made a big difference.  Not sure the version but the Paladins are almost as good as the PzH's.  Germany gave 14 from what I can tell.  The US could give that times 20 of the 109's.

If the US decides to give Ukraine Bradleys and Paladins in volume, this is a game changer.  Side note:  I read that Bradley and Paladins are on the same platform, which should save some of the maintenance and training if true.",False,1673233526.0,t3_106962n,t3_106962n,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

Day 317-319 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past couple of days were somewhat quiet, but not entirely. Yesterday around 11pm Russians launched 2-4 missiles from Belgorod, at least 2 of which landed in Merefa. They aimed at an oil refinery, which ended up being empty, so they just wasted their missiles as usual, but sadly they did manage to kill 1 person and injure 1 more. Today was also not the quietest day, as artillery duels along our border are happening very frequently, one of those was only about 2 hours ago.

As expected, Russians didn’t care about their “Christmas ceasefire” either, as during it not only were they attacking us, but they also claimed that they captured Soledar, which turned out to be wrong and it is still contested as it was before, but it just shows that they can never be trusted. It was funny seeing that even Russian puppets from LPR/DPR were pretty much saying that ceasefire that Putin wanted is a stupid idea and that they won’t be doing it. They didn’t even try to play along with their master Putin, which is pretty surprising, I thought they would be more loyal to him.

The new military aid package from the US is just enormous, almost 400 vehicles is basically an entire small army. It’s so weird that Russians didn’t respond to it in any way, they have been very silent after it was announced. Where are the usual nuclear threats? Where did the red line go? Did they finally understand that their threats are completely worthless and nobody cares about them, so now we can get any new weapon we want and they won’t mind? Maybe they were preoccupied with their “operation retribution” where they hit 2 roads with missiles and claimed that they killed 600 soldiers? But even Russians called them out on that lie, so it was yet another failure.

I wasn’t able to post in the last 3 days because I caught some virus again and couldn’t stand up from bed to go to my pc, but I’m already feeling better now, so I’m going back to writing my updates daily as usual.

5aa953e14c48ee643dc5436a41f52439,106962n,j3fy4be,"> Putin continues to use religion as a weapon of war, says former Maj Gen Mick Ryan

I just thought for a good long while and I'm hard pressed to find — no wait, I cannot think of a *single thing* that Putin has available to him that he does not use as a weapon of war. 

This cynical, self-serving view that anything and everything is just a tool to get what you want is so fucking monotonous and one-dimensional. The scheming is relentless, increasingly desperate, and by this point thoroughly predictable. Just think of the worst junkie excuse for why he needs a little money from you pretending it isn't to cop more dope. You can even see Putin's hands shaking. 

It is, more than anything, *boring*. 

Fortunately this snakepit of amoral ego and greed has corrupted everyone in it who has risen to any amount of power, and then from the top downwards right through to the lowest peon looking for someone he can fuck over to get ahead.

This fuck-who-you-can-I-got-mine attitude does not even make for a good criminal enterprise, and for a country? Fuggataboutit. What you end up with is ""Total War"", but the shitty, off-brand cereal version that your chain-smoking alcoholic mother insists is just as good — no *better* — and you should shut your stupid mouth and appreciate she made you dinner at all.

>Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 8 January 2023

>In recent weeks, Russia has bolstered defensive fortifications in central Zaporizhzhia Oblast, southern Ukraine, especially between the towns of Vasilyvka and Orikhiv. Russia maintains a large force in this sector.

>The way Russia has worked on improving defences suggests commanders are highly likely pre-occupied with the potential for major Ukrainian offensive action in two sectors: either in northern Luhansk Oblast, or in Zaporizhzhia.

>A major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia’s ‘land bridge’ linking Russia’s Rostov region and Crimea; Ukrainian success in Luhansk would further undermine Russia’s professed war aim of ‘liberating’ the Donbas.

>Deciding which of these threats to prioritise countering is likely one of the central dilemmas for Russian operational planners.",False,1673164968.0,t3_106962n,t3_106962n,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

Ukraine would have another military to deal with, but one where most of the people are against the war and current leader (unlike Russia). How would you even fight someone like that?

>The ""Operation Desert Storm"" and ""Operation Desert Storm-Engineer"" improvements were based on lessons learned during the first Gulf War in 1991. The major improvements included an eye-safe laser rangefinder (ELRF), a tactical navigation system (TACNAV) incorporating the Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) and the Digital Compass Systems (DCS), a missile countermeasure device designed to defeat first-generation wire-guided missiles, and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Battlefield Command Information System. The internal stowage was further improved and a thermal imaging system was added for the driver.

They've been pretty damn good so far (warning the world that Russia will attack, how they'll attack, etc. etc. Though they've been less good about ""how good is Russia's attack""). I don't think that its possible to hide a mobilization of 500,000 to 1,000,000 Russians. The CIA will surely figure that out before it happens.

I don't expect the USA to be ""surprised"" if this happens. What I'm worried about are the obvious, open politics about this. Republicans own the House right now, and the House is where US Spending **MUST** originate from. Republicans largely support Ukraine, but they are also controlled by an extreme group called the Freedom Caucus, who inevitably are going to try to withhold funding for Ukraine.

I think us, here in the USA, must prepare our arguments and begin fighting the political battle to ensure weapons for Ukraine. It is going to be hard fight, but the sooner we prepare, the better things will get.

The Freedom Caucus has already made their first move, trying to make McCarthy bow before them with the chaos of this past week. It will be the first of many disruptions.

d86f1e996d817c20973c8acf56bc5569,106962n,j3jpj8i,"Translated text is as follows:

On November 25, the creation of a new database was started with connection to:  - all government agencies - all ministries - the secret services (FSB, GRU and SVR) - the border control services - Municipalities - Police - Banks  Anyone can check by name.

There is no escape, so to speak.  If you are in the database, you cannot escape it  On December 27, the central bank linked all accounts of individuals with debt/loans and those who do not pay alimony to the mobilization database. 

These people (with late payment) are the first to be mobilized, along with convicts.  The border with Belarus will be closed (so far Russians could travel between the two countries without a visa)  The other borders are also being closed at the moment. 

The new mobilization must be done without fuss, not like last time with a lot of ‘hassle’. Not openly but covertly, no publicly known mobilization offices but in silence. Without press/media.  Everything should be set up/completed by March. 

The mobilization starts the 17th, first ‘in silence’.  In March/April the whole thing has to run smoothly and there will be a very large-scale mobilizing, not 500,000, but continuously, initially at least 1 million (!!) men must be mobilized by May/June. 

Anyone who tries to avoid their mobilization will be arrested and detained. They then still force into the army (separate unit that immediately goes to the front line).  For the summer (May/June) one wants at least 1,000,000 people for a major offensive. 

Many who had fled before are back for Christmas with thought that they can leave afterwards. Unfortunately, they are no longer from the country.  Starting today, Christmas, the country is locked.  Open mobilization starts between the 14th and 17th. Oekr. intel says: the 15th. 

Martial law will be promulgated.  War economy is going to oblige all factories to produce before the war. So all clothing factories are going to make uniforms, metal factories will start making weapons, technical/steel/tractor factories will start producing vehicles.

The 100k+ deaths so far are ‘nothing’ in Putin's eyes, even if the upcoming 1 million mobilized people die it won't hurt him.  He looks at the 20 million+ who died in WWII and Putin is willing to go at least as far. 

He will not deploy nukes, not at all.  He has been warned by the US & UK that both will immediately attack.  Only if Russia itself will be attacked does he consider it.  If he tries to do this sooner, he will be dealt with internally. 

Conclusion:  The West must greatly increase arms supplies and support Ukraine in the upcoming offensive to ensure that one can withstand the attack of 1 million Russians as effectively as the past two waves (about 300k at the start and 300k after the 1st mobilization).  

So:  - More HIMARS and other equivalent systems  - Start delivery of tanks immediately, many tanks  - Starting with delivery of F16s and helicopters  - Deliver huge amounts of ammo.  One can't wait months with this, then it's too late.  

Additional:  - 30 Ukrainian pilots are currently being trained for the F16 in the US, which will certainly be delivered F16s.  - The offensive comes both from the east and from Belarus (towards Kiev). Both with at least 500,000 men.",False,1673226574.0,t3_106962n,t1_j3iwvxq,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

He's a war criminal but Girkin was right. Russia should have mobilised last spring, around when Ukraine did theirs and when they started getting hammered. 

Now? After Ukraine has launched about 3 offensives and will launch another well before summer. And if the result of the next one is the same as the others Russia will be driven right back to their border before they can mount an offensive. I would say fire their military planners and strategists, but they wouldn't anyway.

As an armchair general, I also predict that in spring Russia will instigate either a fake or real attack on Kiev via Belarus to bind Ukrainian forces while continuing via Bakhmut, and Ukraine will mount a major offensive either east of Zaporizhzhia, roughly down the direction of Mariupol, or extend the offensive above Bakhmut dividing the battle zones of Luhansk oblast from Donetzk oblast.",1673180685.0,1673180466.0,t3_106962n,t1_j3g7l8o,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

People now say the same for 23.  But I guess people that have said that might have no qualifications to say how long the war will last.

Simply based on the average amount of territory that Ukraine regains each month, I suspect that all territory will be back under Ukrainian control by the end of 23.  But there are a bunch of large cities left and we have really seen Kherson reclaimed so far.  Cities will be difficult and I think Kherson being on the ""wrong"" side of the river made it a bit easier to reclaim.  Additionally, as the front gets smaller, the density of the Russians will get higher, making it more difficult as well.  And Ukraine hasn't touched the fortified Donbas line that existed before the war too.

So overall, I say that it will take at least 2 maybe 3 more years for Ukraine to regain all of it's territory.  But that might not even end the war.

Because they're incredibly capable platforms that can outrage and outshoot anything in the Russian/Soviet arsenal.

> Everything I have read about them seems to make them out to be a pain in the ass to use

Nothing you talk about has to do with usage. Logistics and maintenance, but not usage.

> Their turbine engines are complex, not reliable enough, and a lot harder to maintain then the diesel engines in other tanks

They are complex, but not particularly unreliable. While there is a maintenance overhead against a diesel engine there are also benefits to that trade-off:

- They're quieter and produce a higher frequency noise which does not travel as far.
- they can run on a multitude of fuels
- they produce a lot of power

> It would be more trouble than it's worth for Ukraine to try to deploy them now in the middle of a hot war.

No harder than any other platform that they've had to adopt or the Leopards. There will need to be some specialist training but that has to be provided for any platform.

That said, there are a few complicating factors. First, republicans tend to fall in line and put party before country, and party before their own ideas. Second, republicans don't believe in consistently, just in opportunity. So when we look at previous votes on Ukraine aid, the Dems already had a majority, so republican votes didnt matter per se, so it was easy to vote yes without raising a ruckus.

Combined, this now means that a minority of Republicans have the power and incentive to hold the rest of the party hostage.

The posts that are submitted are copied and resubmitted by the bot accounts. So one unsuspecting real person submits something and a few minutes later up to four bot accounts will attempt to submit the same exact article with small variations. For example, the edited title might end in an unnecessary exclamation point, question mark, period or semicolon.

If Ukrainians get an offensive going, with a breakthrough, it will be akin to the German 1918 spring offensive where they are able to use better trained and better armed units to completely overwhelm a battle field which has been softened up by M777/soviet artillery and guided rockets which have ruined Russian logistics.",False,1673235038.0,t3_106962n,t1_j3jslhz,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

If we assume that impeachment is a goal of the new majority in the house it should take them ~6 months.  Politically they'd wait for maximum impact to drive media cycles so closer to 18 months to impact the next election and give their base the meat they desire.

What you really watch out for, because while all these developments are theater.  Is debt ceiling votes.  That's where asinine politics affect not just the US but the world.  Passing any additional funding for Ukraine is going to be close to impossible but Biden admin will probably get creative here both in ""stretching"" the current budget, black bag appropriations and leaning on NATO partners.  This starts to become an issue in about 6 months.

Despite the impressive looking total production numbers, there just aren't that many Leopard 2s that Ukraine can get. This is because many countries that own the Leopard have it in relatively small numbers, many have less than a hundred. Germany sold their Cold War stockpiles off in dribs and drabs, meaning that any effort to provide sufficient numbers is going to run into political and logistical roadblocks.

* Political in the sense that you now have to get approval from over a dozen countries since many countries only operate dozens of the tanks. Many countries are not NATO and may not be willing to part with their stocks (Switzerland, Singapore, Indonesia) and some of which won't because they don't want to anger Russia (Turkey, Hungary). Many of these countries are now trying to scramble to rearm their conventional forces and will be looking at acquiring additional MBTs as well (Poland).

* Logistical because these tanks are not made to the same specifications; many have domestic additions or customized parts suited to their specific country's needs. Many of these Leopard 2s are in various states of serviceability due to countries not prioritizing the maintenance of the vehicles, such as the Spanish Leopard 2A4s.

If there are ""hundreds"" of Leopards rolling into Ukraine, it will be on the low end of the possible meaning of the word ""hundreds."" In other words: no more than 200.

All that it will require, is the majority-of-the-majority, to block a future funding bill. That's 112 Republicans.

It doesn't matter what the other 323 Representatives care about. The 112 Republicans, as per the Hastert Rule, effectively hold veto power over getting bills to the floor in the first place. It has been like this my whole life. That's just how the House functions.

What the Freedom Caucus accomplished last week, was a ""strengthening"" of this Hastert Rule.

GOP can go after Hunter for his dickpicks, but that has no relevance to Ukraine, so they can do what they want with them but it will not give them optics needed to cut the aid.
