> Let me briefly state my view of the situation on the Planet of the Pink Ponies (where, as you know, our government and other ""systemic VIPs"" reside).

> This planet (hereafter, the PPP) is fairly far from the Russian Federation, and as such, its populace seems unconcerned by what goes on there. And (similarly) even the most powerful events and emotions taking place on the PPP practically don't reach the citizens of our state. Well, until such moments as recently: when - quite unexpectedly - after almost 8 years of ""no alternative to the Minsk agreements"" suddenly a ""special military operation for ""denazification"" begins, and then - just as abruptly - denazification is cancelled and a disastrous ""de-escalation"" takes place instead.

> We have to state that information from planet Earth (and even more so from planet RF) reaches the PPP - due to enormous distances and natural obstacles involved - in an extremely distorted fashion, which is in no way helpful to the strategic decisions being made there. Correspondingly, those decisions, very slowly taken in the Blue Clouds of the PPP atmosphere, turn out to be extremely baffling, unexpected and even astounding for Planet RF's population.

> Here is a nice example: in February this year, the PPP was apparently convinced that the Russian Federation had modern, well-armed and well-managed Armed Forces, capable of rapidly handling the demotivated and weak government and armed forces of the so-called ""Ukraine"", that would surrender at the first opportunity and after the first shove. And when it turned out that this was not true at all (in either case) - the information from planet RF to the PPP was distorted in such a way that all Pink Ponies and Rainbow Unicorns, hovering in blue clouds, for some reason suddenly believed that they had only to make a wish - and their respected Kiev partners would happily agree to any ceasefire - if they just gave them a small concession.

> When even this assumption was not realised, the Ponies and Unicorns, again, misunderstood the signals coming from Earth (I note - not only from the Russian Federation). And they decided that they could wait for their ""partners to become willing"" as long as they pleased, without straining themselves or the population of the territory of the planet Earth subject to the PPP management - Planet RF.

> And when - as right now - ""it has never happened before, and now it is happening again"" - the PPP was taken aback. On the one hand - it seems that something has to be done. On the other hand, to do something means to exert oneself (which the Ponies and Unicorns are not used to, not to mention their lack of ability to do anything except perform obscure paper rituals, and then get high in the warm, soft, sweet blue clouds). At the same time, another interplanetary crisis - even if unexpectedly harsh - having substantially worsened the situation in the subordinate RF - has hardly affected the PPP at all. Yes, - an unpleasant cold and deathly-smelling breeze blew in the planet's atmosphere, alarming the Ponies and the Unicorns. But it was not the first time... It blew and then it stopped... like in spring during the ""de-escalation""... and then it calmed down. On Earth, the front seems to have stabilized (there were - as always distorted - signals about it). Therefore now in the minds of Wonderful Beings (which Ponies and Unicorns are by definition) there is again an irresistible temptation to ""leave things as they are"". It's like, ""it'll just sort itself out, it'll pass"".

> Hence the conclusion: the creatures on the RF Planet that are waiting for some ""meaningful solutions"" will most likely receive ""from above"" new marvelous strategic guidelines. (If they get any at all). For example, such as:

>\- ""do nothing, hold firm, wait for the partners to make an honourable peace"";

>\- ""ruthlessly crush the insolent critics and agents of world fascism, who by their stupidity and meanness are incapable of realising the genius of the directives sent down from the PPP"".

> I suppose this decision would be the second most likely, right after ""no directives at all"".

> But - like any Amazing Strategic Directive from the PPP - it will not be implemented in time, because the time on the PPP and on Earth (including - on Planet RF and its satellite planets) - flows quite differently. Simply put - it flows much faster on our planet. Especially rapidly (and with constant acceleration) events are unfolding in the vicinity of the so-called ""Special Military Operation"". So personally I am quite relaxed, because whatever decision has been taken on the PPP regarding our current situation, it is already hopelessly late.

> The end of the situation is also known in advance (it happened many times in the history of Planet Russia and other terrestrial planets): PPP, - together with all of its inhabitants, - having completely lost its bearings in space and time - will come down crashing into Earth. Unfortunately, most likely - it will crash right on top of the RF. Though a chance to avoid the PPP falling on our heads - even if only theoretically - still exists. And there is a better chance (though still not great) that the inhabitants of the Planet RF will be able to minimize the catastrophic consequences of such space calamity and survive physically... The trouble, however, is that there are too many Ponies and Unicorns walking along our terrestrial solid rock, whose bodies are here, but their souls and minds are entirely on the PPP so they do nothing in their posts.

Day 203 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, and we thought that it might finally be a quiet day, but no, they still fired their missiles at us. This time it happened at 11:30pm, there was no prior alert, just suddenly 2 loud explosions happened one after another, and about a minute later the air raid alert was triggered. We don’t know what was hit yet, but some people were saying that missiles might have landed somewhere in the center of the city. 

We don’t know where those missiles came from either, as there were no missile launches from their usual place in Belgorod this time, so they might have been launched from a plane, though if they were, then the air raid alert should have been triggered sooner, but it wasn’t. A couple of minutes later there were posts saying that new missiles were fired from Belgorod, but no explosions followed, so if they did launch, we don’t know where they landed.

Russians and their propagandists were furious when they found out that Zelenskyi visited Izyum, but wasn’t killed. They were whining about not shelling, or firing missiles at that town when he was there. And then they fired some missiles at that dam in Kryvyi Rih, flooding parts of the city and overflowing the river. That immediately stopped all the complaints about not killing Zelenskyi, it made Russians very happy, because they love it when civilian infrastructure is destroyed. Somehow it even makes them forget all about their losses in an instant, and it already worked twice in a row.",False,1663199540.0,t3_xdrv5h,t3_xdrv5h,,0,159,0,159,2,0,

>However, as t-online has learned from Ukrainian army circles, the tank artillery played a decisive role in the liberation of the strategically important city of Kupyansk. The place was considered a logistics hub of the Russian army, which ensured the supply of ammunition and materials via railroad lines.

""This prevented both the arrival of Russian reserves and the organized retreat of the enemy."" The bridge over the Oskil River is the only road connecting the two parts of Kupyansk. Without the river crossing, Russian troops were trapped on the west bank - and cut off from reinforcements from the east.

>Artillery Officer Kovalenko: ""It took us 12 shells to smash the bridge. With Soviet or Russian tube artillery, we might have needed 50 or more shells."" That was not just a logistical problem, he said, because it would require more unarmored munitions trucks to make it to the front lines. It would also put crews at greater risk: ""The longer we have to fire at a target, the easier prey we are for Russian drones and enemy artillery.""

>Russian drones regularly searched the front to knock out German artillery systems. While there have been hits and damage to the German howitzers, ""we haven't lost any yet,"" he said. The armor is good, especially at the top of the hull and turret.""

TL;DR

Russia continues having acute manpower issues which resulted in dangerously thin defenses outside of the Kherson area. Kherson is a real offensive, but designed to be slow and grinding.


Kharkiv was a colossal intelligence failure for them, they have lost a lot of equipment and the Western Military Group has been destroyed.


Russian political objectives and military objectives continue to be incompatible. The prudent strategic move from here would be to pull out of Kherson, but Moscow is unlikely to allow it.

Ukraine has the momentum and luxury to choose when and where to fight going forward.

That's over $8,600 in supplies! We still hope people will continue to contribute if they have spare cash!

“They only used a tiny number of their actual combat forces dressed up as little green men and local quislings, if Russia had committed their whole military they would have steamrolled.”



I posit that Putin absolutely would have loved to take the whole of Ukraine in ‘14, he simply couldn’t. What he gave in ‘14 was the best that he could muster. His only semi-competent combat forces were already deployed in Syria and elsewhere. Equipment wasn’t ready. Ammunition wasn’t ready. Nothing was ready. 


Putin did not predict that his toady would flee in the middle of the night and precipitate a crisis in Ukrainian government. When it happened, he immediately tried to capitalize on it as best he could. But there was no plan in place for such an eventuality. They winged it. And not having a plan, not being prepared in a general sense, a few little green men was the most that they could muster.



Putin immediately started calling for a real plan, I don’t doubt. He immediately started the wheels turning to turn his opportunistic land-grab in to a total conquest just as soon as he could get all of the pieces for it in place. It just turned out that it would take them eight frickin’ years to finally get everything ready, they suck that bad.


Everything that Putin has done for the last eight years has been focused on finishing his conquest. Years of planning, years of moving pieces around the board, years of propaganda. A competent government probably could have gotten a plan in place in a year or two. A serious government would already have made plans on contingency and have actually been prepared for anything at a moments notice. But a Russian government took eight years.

>The signing of the declaration “brings our relations to the level of an alliance,” Aliyev said after the signing in Moscow.

>The 43-point agreement covers bilateral cooperation in a number of spheres, but it is in the foreign policy and military realms that it carries its greatest implications.

>Point 4 stipulates that the two countries, “holding the same or similar positions on topical international issues, deepen constructive cooperation.” Point 7 obliges them to “refrain from any actions that, in the opinion of one of the Parties, damage the strategic partnership and allied relations of the two states.”

>At the meeting with journalists, Kiselev also asked Aliyev whether Azerbaijan was considering joining the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Russia-led security bloc. Baku has long resisted Moscow’s entreaties to become a member, and Aliyev said that the new agreement rendered the issue moot.

>“In my opinion, this [agreement] is enough. After all, it is clear that it is Russia which made the CSTO. If Russia were not in the CSTO, no one would remember the CSTO,” he said. “A step has already been taken to increase the level of military-political cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan.”

>The agreement also includes several provisions on mutual military aid, including a stipulation that the two sides “may consider the possibility of providing each other with military assistance.”

>As per point 25, Azerbaijan and Russia agree to “refrain from carrying out any economic activity that causes direct or indirect damage to the interests of the other Party.”

The Kharkiv defeat somehow dislodged and sent tge entire Eastern front fleeing, they should retrear back to defensive lines, but apparently though it is still not confirmed, Ukraine is simultaneously pushing towards that line from another front and could breach it before defenses are set up, if tvis happens the entire Eastern front will collapse and Russia will be forced to retreat to Feb borders in the East, assuming they have adequate defenses in their pre-2022 territories which in all likelyhood they have.

Furthermore he states that if Ukraine has been building divisions in these months in the South and they launch a successful attack towards Mariupol and/or another city of a similar name I dont remember, if they do this and succeed right now, at the very same moment the Eastern armies are fleeing, that would be it, it would doom the entire invasion force minus Kherson that would remain the only post-2022 Russian held area. And I think should be easier to pick up if the other fronts fall and Kherson has to face the bulk of the Ukranian Army. So we could actually be looking forward to seeing the entire invasion fail before the onset of winter.

After that it falls on Zelenskyyy what to do, if Russia is pushed to pre-February a peace treaty recognizing the pre-Feb borders, I think would be a lifesaver for Putin and would take it. It would be status quo antebellum. If Zelenskyyy insits on no peace until even pre-2022 is retaken, it is hard to see.

“I represent the private military company, Wagner, maybe you’ve heard of it. The war is tough, doesn’t look anything like the Chechen war. The rate of spent ammo is 2.5 more that it was in Stalingrad.

The first sin is desertion. No one backs out and no one retreats. No one turns themselves in. When you will be undergoing training, they will tell you about the two grenades you’ll have to have if you turn captive. The second sin is drugs and alcohol. During all the time you are with us, and for six months you will be with us in the combat zone. And the third is marauding, including any sexual contacts with local women, flora, fauna, men, anything.

The minimum age that we accept is 22. If you are younger, then we need a paper signed by one of your relatives saying they don’t mind. Maximum age is approximately 50 but if you are strong we will do basic tests right here during the interviews, we see how strong you are. Physical form is crucial here. Then we’ll make a decision.

The first convicts who fought with me, that was on June 1, at the Vuhlehirska power station, with 40 people from St Petersburg. High-security colony, recidivism. 40 people entered the enemy trenches, cut them up with knives, there were 3 dead and 7 wounded. Out of the 3 dead, one was 52, he served a 30-year long sentence already. He died a hero.

We take a very careful look at those who are jailed under 228 [drug charges], just based on whether there was addiction or not. If we have questions, while we are preparing to take you away, we reserve the right to do a lie detector test here and check how stable you are. We also are very careful when it comes to those imprisoned on sex-related charges. We understand there can be mistakes.

Who we are looking for? Exclusively “stormtroopers.” [presume infantry] 60% of my guys are that and you will be among them and there won’t be any difference between you and them. You will be treated equally and sometimes it’s we are even more tolerant towards you compared to people have been fighting with us for a long time and have gone through dozens of wars. Fire support platoons and other units that provide the offensive I have in the PMC. We have aircraft of several types, MLRS, tanks, there is everything you need in order to for an effective offensive.

Those who move forward, those who are the most brazen, they survive more often. Everyone who backs down and does not understand what to do, of course, they get into a scramble. After I tell you everything, there will be an interview. For a limited time I will present, after that several people will stay here and they will talk to each of you in the span of 2–3 hours, they will look you in the eyes and ask a few questions.

All dead, the bodies are being delivered to locations that you indicate in your will, to your relatives or they are buried wherever you say. Everyone is buried in the Alleys of Heroes in the cities where they exist. Those who doesn’t know where to bury them, we bury them near the Wagner’s Chapel in Goryachiy Kluch.

Next, in six months you go home after receiving pardon. Those who want to stay with us can stay with us. So you have no option to return to prison. Those who arrive [to the frontline] and on the first day say this is not a place for them we mark them as deserters and that is followed by an execution by firing squad.

Guys, if you have questions ask. After that you line up for the interviews. You have five minutes to make a decision. When we leave, that time is up. After that it’s all up to luck. Regarding trust and guarantees, do you have anyone who can get you out of prison alive? There are two who can get you out of prison—Allah and God. I am taking you out of here alive.

One of the reasons that the Ukrainians getting AGM-88 HARM's was such a big deal was that those missiles specifically seek out and destroy SAM radars.

It takes skill and courage to play chicken with the Ukrainian forces tasked with taking those radars out, something the russian forces appear to lack.  The countries that have already bought them might utilize them more effectively than the russians have.

Then again America and other western countries have probably gotten their hands on a ton of hardware and figured out how to neutralize that technology, so who knows.

If we apply the same ratio and one digit of precision in math, that gives original artillery pieces about 5K.  There have been about 200 days, which gives us almost 1M ""artillery-piece-days"".   

So even at low rates of fire on average (and yes, some won't have been fired at all), 100 shells per piece per day is not ridiculously low. 

It' quite conceivable that Russia has chewed through 100M+ shells so far.  That's most of their vaunted ""infinite"" inventory.

Then there's inventory.  In order to be effective in a defensive posture, each piece needs local inventory shells on hand to keep going until resupply. I'm not an expert on Russian military doctrine, so pulling numbers completely out of my ear, but let's peg that at 100% are within 60 minutes of resupply.  Let's say forward depots have resupply for 50% at 4 hours, and deep reserve has resupply for 20% at 24 hours.   That's (1 + .5 x 4 + .2 x 24) = about 8 hours of supply in the field, at maximum rate of fire 200 shells per hour per piece, or 1600 rounds per piece.  Times 5000 pieces... that's 8M rounds just in inventory.  In addition to anything fired. 

So if you have a million artillery-piece days worth of firing, and an inventory need of 8M shells in the field, most of that having been obliterated in a few HIMARS strikes, it's quite conceivable that they've gone through more than 100M and could be very very low.",False,1663168771.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_ioejvm5,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

If the war were lost, then there would be two possible reasons to keep going.  

1) The more hopeful reason for Russia would be that European support could waiver as winter drags on as though gas reserves are currently at 85%, Europe may not be able to adequately able to acquire ongoing gas supplies (or more likely, will have to pay a premium to acquire ongoing gas supplies as winter continues).  This is because typically, Europe would have it's reserves and then a continuous supply throughout the winter to warm their population.  The result could be that energy prices skyrocket for europeans and then support for the war could begin to fade.

2) The other reason could be that even if Russia knew the war were lost, it may be easier to continue fighting and sending troops into the meat grinder rather than facing the music.  As an example of this mentality, the US had intelligence at one point stating that the Vietnam war was a lost cause but continued fighting afterwards because it is hard to tell your soldiers and their families that lives were wasted and PTSD was incurred for no reason and with no material gain.  In democratic countries, it could mean that an opposing party could solidify power for a number of years afterwards.  In a totalitarian party, it is also more likely that another individual will also solidify power, but the chance of a peaceful transfer of power is significantly less.",False,1663205766.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_ioh0ljy,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

(Its of course bullshit, but it gives them something to hold on to.)

The need sanctions lifted to placate the Oligarchs and get the economy going again for popular opinion.  This will be tricky and require some sort of concessions from Russia (returning children and families to Ukraine would be part of this, might also include Russia acknowledging that Ukraine can join the EU/NATO) to get the West to agree to this.  

Then territory, which is probably what Putin personally cares about the most, but will do the least for him politically (except indirectly to give the army something to hold on to).

I think it must be understood in a broader political and historical context; What the EU did in the start of the invasion, providing military aid to a country in war that involved a ""superpower"", was a first and a big step for many EU members.  
  
Such a conflict can be really, really dangerous because it can spill into other countries, and one outcome of the conflict could potentially be a nuclear conflict.
  
So for obvious security reasons the EU/US reaction has been scaled to the developing situation, and what was political possible at each step under way.  
   
The EU and US could still pile on sanctions to Russia, but again, they try to only use sanctions that are hurt Russia more than themselves. Therefore many Russian banks are still on Swift, Russia isn't declared at terrorist state etc. All things that would escalate the pressure on Russia, but isn't done, because it could potentially cause the the situation to spin out of control.  
  
And 200 Leopard 2A7 appearing in Ukraine, would really, really scare the Russian military. With those tanks, the Ukrainian army could punch through into Moscow if they wanted too. 
  
Another example on escalation control are the only 16 HIMARS. Every attack is vetted by the US army, and the US would come down hard on the Ukrainian forces if they where used into Russian territory.  
  
The EU/US have tried to help Ukraine as much as possible, but in a way that clearly showed Russia, that they wanted the war to be contained in Ukraine, not in Russia, because that could cause the conflict to escalate beyond control.  
  
Will Ukraine get modern MBT's and fighter jets? yes, I think so, but most likely right after the conflict is over.",False,1663168666.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_iodjevc,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

d6c9cf6f939ed0fd244bdea427fe2396,xdrv5h,iofo5fi,"> Putin may be charging the narrative so that he can turn this 'special operation' into a war and fully mobilise.

So far, this seems unlikely. It would require a huge shift in propaganda to portray Ukraine as an existential threat to Russia itself, basically necessitating a total reversal of the current ""Special Operation is going according to plan"" narrative, and that takes a lot of time and/or an extremely dramatic action on the scale of a Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Mobilization still polls *extremely* poorly in Russia at the moment.

> My question is what (in simple terms) does he have to fully mobilise?

In material terms? The entire Russian economy. Mobilization isn't about unlocking large numbers of reserve forces (although it does permit conscript soldiers to be fielded legally), it's about moving the country to a war footing; granting the government widespread authority to manage people's lives for the good of the state. That ties in to why it's so unpopular, you're not just drafting people, you're also enforcing rationing and appropriating private industry to produce war materiel.

Further, this isn't really useful in the near term. Depending on the exact condition of the economy in question, it can take *years* to properly mobilize a nation. The United States began its WW2 mobilization process in the late 1930's (*before* Pearl Harbor) and didn't complete the transition until well into the war; depending on what metric you want to go by, it wasn't really done until 1944. Russia, having clearly not planned to mobilize anytime soon, would have a much worse time of things, even without taking into account the vast differences in technical resources and morale between the two nations.

The question behind your questions seems to be ""Could Russia possibly benefit from mobilization?"" To which, I would say, absolutely not. ""*Will* they mobilize in the near term?"" Only if they're unbelievably uninformed about the situation. ""What would the consequences be if they did?"" The entire Russian state would collapse into near anarchy, probably. ""What if they staged some kind of incredible propaganda show to convince people to mobilize?"" Then perhaps they could equip tens of thousands of people with some barely adequate gear, at best, and throw them into the fight, but human wave attacks have generally been shown to be ineffective against modern weaponry and basic defensive tactics. ""What if they waited a few years to mobilize properly?"" By then, they'll be pushed out of Ukraine, who will have signed security agreements with NATO, and likely other European partners. Any renewed attack would be responded to far more aggressively (barring some huge political shift); mobilization would be a wasted effort.",False,1663183005.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_iofa5fy,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

First, it's degrading Russia, which has nothing to do with killing Russian soldiers and everything to do with showing the world that Putin can't be trusted 

Second, it's strengthening NATO, which provides enormous benefit to the USA both in intelligence gathering around the world as well as mutual defense teamwork.  

Third, it's providing a bulwark against the coalition of dictatorships that Russia and China are attempting to put together. Quite successfully, I might add.

Fourth, it further proves our desire and willingness to help Taiwan defend itself from a China takeover to the world

Fifth. It bolsters our diplomatic credentials.  If the US says something is going to happen, you can be pretty damn certain that it's going to happen and that is invaluable in world politics.

Sixth, it gives us an opportunity to see our weapons and tactics in action like never before

Seventh, it gives the USA another partner for democracy who has shown explicit willingness to defend it.

Eighth, it's bolstering our allies in the sino-pacific and our coalition there is on the fast track to being enlarged and giving us a larger footprint to battle china, which will absolutely be the next big war

Ninth, it's unequivocally show the world that we restrained ourselves in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  We could have turned both into smoking holes but we tri d to limit civilian casualties the best we could.  Contrasted with Russia right now we look like fucking saints

Putin had promises that Ukraine would not be allowed into Nato and launched the invasion anyway. Ukraine is also aligning itself with its other neighbours in a natural process. It's not being controlled by a country half a planet away.

Kupiansk was the single most important logistical hub for the whole eastern frontline (even including Luhansk). The russian forces will not be able to outsustain the UAF near Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Lyman. 

Even the whole western frontline is in acute danger of being unsuppliable (I hope this is a word, no native speaker). The land connection via Melitopol is already in range of HIMARS, as are the logistical hubs in northern Crimea. Sure, they can still move a lot of stuff, but nowhere near as much as they would need to saturate their units.

Aside from that, Ukraine now has the range advantage and the initiative. Russia is spread too thin for covering the gigantic frontline and armored spearheads (as in Kharkiv) just get more probable and easier for UAF.

And I see absolutely no counterplay for the russians. They have no impressive airforce, their intel is crap, their precision missiles are depleted and even on a good day not very accurate... all this coupled with a shitty command structure and a lack of comms.

The problem is [Georgia's army only has 37,000 people in it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Forces_of_Georgia), that means the actual amount of frontline infantry soldiers is probably under 10,000 with the rest needed to support them and of course you can't commit all your troops to take back the occupied territory. So as overstretched as the Russian army is the question is do they still have the manpower to deal with the few thousand troops that Georgia would probably have to actually fight with?

It's a pretty huge gamble for Georgia because if they lose to the Russians again then they might lose even more territory outside of of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Georgia does have reserves they can call up but I am not aware how well trained they are. Georgia has rearmed and done extensive training with NATO since the 2008 war but I would not assume that Russia could not scrape together enough contract soldiers and equipment to try and fight them.

Then again the way they're struggling with manpower in Ukraine maybe Russia couldn't even field a few thousand more troops to send to Georgia.

It is not dehumanizing to wish harm upon an enemy. (In the case of Ukrainians -an invader. In the case of us in the rest of the free world - an enemy of our entire society and democratic culture, conducting a war of agression against one of our peers). It is the rational thing to do. 

I've said it before: every single russian soldier that is on Ukrainian territory right now is there of his own accord. They have the option of desertion, surrender, rebellion, etc. 

Every Ukrainian death, civilian or soldiers is a tragedy avoided by elimination of the russian soldiers as direct instruments of the russian state and army. If that elimination happens by retreat/surrender/death, the results are the same, therefore the most appropriate method for each case is fine.

There is 0 logical reason to feel any sympathy for those ""young, poor, forcibly conscripted, etc"" russian soldiers, unless one is so uninformed (or naive, or simply malevolent) as to consider the agressors equal to their victims.

They are suffering the consequences of their own deliberate actions. There is no redeeming to be had when their actions continue unimpeded.

They’re very measured and cautious in what they’ll report. Their reasoning is that US intelligence considers Ukraine’s fatality numbers generally credible with a slight overestimate (maybe 10% inflated), and they’ve reported 50K. Casualties (so, including injuries) are generally about 4-to-1. It sounded high to me as well, but if you listen to the podcast, they’re very averse to reporting rumors that haven’t been confirmed by third party sources without tons of caveats, and they’re consistently more pessimistic than the reality turns out to be.

Edit: I’m not backing these numbers myself, just letting you know what was reported by a source that I would say is relatively conservative in what they’ll report. The people contributing on there are generally professional military strategists or people who have worked in intelligence, and they tend to factor in knowledge specific to Russian military doctrine. I can’t say one way or another that we can be confident in what we “know” about how Russia treats their dead and wounded (broadly speaking) beyond anecdotal reports from largely pro-Ukraine sources in a war that has been heavy on propaganda and rumor.

He supported the Freudenberger Kreis, the Marxist wing of the Juso university groups, promoting ""overcoming the capitalist economy"" in articles.[9] In it, Scholz criticized the ""aggressive-imperialist NATO"", the Federal Republic as the ""European stronghold of big business"" and the social-liberal coalition, which puts the ""bare maintenance of power above any form of substantive dispute"".[10] On 4 January 1984, Scholz and other Juso leaders met in the GDR with Egon Krenz, the secretary of the Central Committee of the SED and member of the Politburo of the SED-Central Committee, Herbert Häber.

Yet reality isn't that way.  Cigarettes and soda literally kill their customers and the only reason cigarettes are dying out in popularity is because of laws limiting their ability to market, insane taxes, and a very concentrated government effort.

Often I'm told in rebuttal that people should be free to choose, that if they want to smoke that is their right and the government shouldn't interfere with their ability to do so.

Except I'm not sure how much free will people have that hasn't been tainted.  Marketing absolutely works on a significant majority of the population.  

Consumption is now so deep rooted in American ideology from the last 70+ years of marketing that we now associate Freedom with what we are allowed to consume.

Instead it's about our right as a God given American to have meat with every meal, the ability to hop in a car and drive, and being able to cheer on your favorite sports team while wearing your players favorite jersey number.


It's an unsustainable sickness the idea of capitalism.  It doesn't care about the health or well being of the population, it only cares about turning resources into capital as fast as it can.

Capitalism requires infinite growth on a finite planet.  For 10,000+ years humanity was able to stay in relative global homeostasis. 

Now Capitalism with a 2% growth rate leads to a double in output required every 35 years and it compounds.

For example if our energy requirements  needs grow at 2% every year that in less than 2000 years we will require more energy than our sun puts out.",1663159790.0,1663159594.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_iodw7j0,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

It’s obviously not some general thing, a way of being treated, that set off this war.

It's a localized thing, that Russia localizes to Ukraine, that's where the problem is, and they link it to ""NATO"", so it's a threat by NATO against Russia through Ukraine, right?

Of course the Kremlin makes it clear that their reasons are phoney.

But what else could the pope mean than ""this invasion is understandable when there was a possibility of the US using Ukraine as a launching point for an attack"", and broadcast that into the world, as well as his Dugina comments, and his apparent push for short term peace that I’m sure many academics, and Ukrainians, will agree with isn’t really peace. I believe Ukraine has recently published its conditions for peace - a real one.

I’m guessing the pope might be a man not of this world, but I’m not completely sure. In any case it seems his ‘peace’ might differ from what Ukrainians call peace.",1663161122.0,1663160803.0,t3_xdrv5h,t1_iodrgw9,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

When you look at the Russian government, they make it crystal clear it's lying.

All this is obvious. The excuses are laughably thin and transparent.

When Chomsky says these things, implying the US was planning to attack Russia through Ukraine (which is what ""expansionism"" means, according to commie redditors I have encountered, as well as tankies, and I'm not sure what else it could mean that remotely could justify an invasion) I'm pretty sure he's lying for *the cause*.

I can't tell if the pope is lying, that's where that post came from.

The S300 doesn’t actually appear to be for sale anymore. It was given for free to Syria in 2018, but apart from that I can’t find any reports of anyone actually paying for one since Iran bought a system in 2015.

Finally, killing an S300 with a drone is more an indictment of their IADS as a whole, and specifically their point defence systems like Pantsir and Buk. This is exactly the kind of threat that they’re supposed to defend against.

Edit: dude, even the Russians say that S300 [isn’t designed to kill low-flying drones](https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htada/20200603.aspx) and can’t detect them independently:

“The Russians told the Syrians that the S-300 radar was not intended for detecting low flying aircraft and neither is the JY-27. The Syrians are supposed to use the low altitude radars supplied with the 30 Pantsir mobile anti-aircraft systems Russia provided Syria with to form a layered air defense system. In a layered system, the Pantsir radars detect low flying aircraft and the S-300 radar would detect higher flying aircraft. The Pantsir radars are supposed to be linked to an integrated air defense system that provides the S-300 batteries with real-time information on what the Pantsir radars were detecting.”

This video suggests my rate-of-fire math is about 10x too high, but that your artillery round info might be 10x too low.   

On order of magnitude however, I suspect we are in PERFECT agreement:  Russia is in DEEP kaka now, because their defense doctrine relies on artillery. 

If Ukraine attacks on one front for a sustained period, Russia will have no choice but to commit reserve and gobble shells from everywhere else, just to keep the defense from being overrun.  

Once that supply chain is in motion, it's very hard to stop.   If Ukraine then turns around and attacks somewhere else, Ukraine can create ammunition starvation simply by jerking around Russia's logistics tail. 

I suspect this may explain what happened in Kharkiv...  While front-line ammo was allocated to west (Kharkiv), center (Bakhmut) and south (Kherson), west was de-prioritized and reserves were committed in southern flow. Western defense might have put up a good fight and did to begin with, but with no resupply when the attack came it was a very clear choice between bug out now or run dry and get destroyed a couple of hours from now, and they chose bug-out.  

There's a clear path for Ukraine to win here.  I suspect the next phase of the war to be industrial scale whack-a-mole, and we'll watch Ukraine shake Russia's logistics tail like a dog shakes a rat.

Not only did you share an out of context quote from an [article](https://www.politico.eu/article/pope-francis-says-war-in-ukraine-perhaps-provoked-or-unprevented/) you didn't source, it doesn't say anything close to what you claimed the pope said in your original comment.


The Pope is basically saying what I said he did in my comment, which was ""The west is not innocent in all of this"". He's not saying that the west wanted Ukraine to be invaded, or that the west wanted a reason to fight Russia. He's saying that the west could have done more to stop it and they didn't so we shouldn't look at this as a west is ""good guys"" and Russia as ""Bad guys"". There is a lot of bad all around. He's challenging the ""Good guy bad guy"" narrative and you're making it out as if hes Putin's best friend or something. He also thinks Putin is evil and unilaterally condemns the invasion and wants it to end. 


edit: another quote from that article you didn't source

>“Someone may say to me at this point: but you are pro-Putin! No, I am not,” Francis said. “It would be simplistic and wrong to say such a thing. I am simply against reducing complexity to the distinction between good guys and bad guys, without reasoning about roots and interests, which are very complex.”

*Most of them*  So you agree this applies to *some* of them? 

It doesn't even matter. What exactly stops them from surrendering or taking any of the other options? If they are aware of the mistake? Are they not aware that being a soldier carries that risk? And since they continue being involved it is safe to assume they willingly accept said risk, correct?

>They didnt even know they were invading another country at the start of the invasion, for christs sake - that is a pretty established fact by now.

Now we are six months in. Any russian soldier in Ukraine is aware that he is on the territory of a a different country. They are not picking up their stuff and going home. Is there putin phisically pushing them over the border? Towards Ukrainian trenches? Pulling the trigger on their AK-74s? 

>see, that's where we are differing. They ARE equal, in the sense that they are human too. Their mission might be a terrible mistake. their leaders might be monsters. but the loss of their lives is equally a tragedy. To deny them their most basic humanity and their right to exist is borderline fascist.

You are missing the point. It is entirely irrelevant they are human. They could be rabid dogs, or butterflies, or magical fairies. It is not a question of humanity.

Nobody is unjustly painting them as something else than human.

 They *would be* equal in equal circumstances. A russian in Moscow might be equal to a Ukrainian in Kharkiv. They are not right now in equal circumstances. A serial killer with an axe is not equal to a baby tied to a chair. 

They themselves waived ""their right to exist"" by commiting this crime and knowingly exposing themselves to the consequences of armed conflict. They placed themselves in a situation where their existance infringes on others. Unless they remove themselves from that situation is pure hypocrisy to grant them some moral absolution. You're expecting Ukrainians to fight using pool noodles as not to harm *the poor human invader*?

Here is an analogy: A murderer breaks into your house, murders your siblings, and tries to kill you. Police burst in and after a firefight he's dead. By your logic you should not for a second wish harm upon him, he's human too right? And by your logic you will be upset with the neighbours that are now happy you survived and he was neutralized.

Airforce 150k (no idea why so large)

350k - 50k (dead) - 80k (wounded) + 40k (mercs) = 250k

In political science, democratic socialism and social democracy are largely seen as synonyms,\[28\] while they are distinguished in journalistic use.\[29\] Under this democratic socialist definition,\[nb 2\] social democracy is an ideology seeking to gradually build an alternative socialist economy through the institutions of liberal democracy.\[30\]  
 Starting in the post-war period, social democracy was defined as a   
policy regime advocating reformation of capitalism to align it with the   
ethical ideals of social justice.\[33\] In the 19th century, it encompassed a wide variety of non-revolutionary and revolutionary currents of socialism which excluded anarchism.\[34\]  
 In the early 20th century, social democracy came to refer to support   
for a process of developing society through existing political   
structures and an opposition to revolutionary means which are often   
associated with Marxism.\[30\]

The idea that continued supply was conditional in some way, and would be cut off if Ukraine did it. Something that would distinctively say Ukraine is flat-out 'not allowed' to do it, which is what many people have been saying. So far, I have not received any. 

I guess the *lack* of a solid agreement means US can pull support any time they like for any reason, though I don't know why they couldn't anyway. 

The initial 'agreement' was to convince Senators and whatnot to lighten concerns about escalation, and make the pledge for support palpable. 

Since things have changed a lot in the past 3 months, I imagine much of those fears of 'escalation' have vanished. 

So here's what I'm really getting at. If Ukraine decides to use these missiles for counter-striking into Russia, does that really change anything at this point? If there's no actually written policy that Ukraine must adhere to, then will it really affect future support?  If Ukraine decides that they've had enough of incoming cruise missiles used on civilian targets, what do they need to do to get 'permission' to use HIMARS as a response? 

The 'promise' of Ukraine to not use them in that way was obviously to assuage fears of escalation, but the idea of Russia 'escalating' anything at this point is fairly laughable. 

What I've been asking for is some evidence is that the US is somehow actively holding Ukraine by some sort of leash and 'not allowing' them to strike into Russia... versus it just being something said in the beginning to get the weapons in the first place.

I can't imagine the US or the West in general backing off support now if Ukraine does adjust and start using them for counter-strikes. I *could* see it maybe affecting the decision to sent ATACMS or not in the future, so Ukraine should still decide carefully. 

But counter-strikes are valid self-defense when cruise missiles are being launched from Belgorod, etc, and I don't see a proportional response being seen as out of line.

I’m focusing on international law myself, but more on corporate law, so I admit I don’t know the definition of each item. What I can tell you is most items either have a subjective OR an objective tests. An objective test would be Person A damaged substation B and it was his fault, therefore he committed an act of war.

Likely, though, it would be subjective. You would have to prove that the partisan, or alleged partisan, had an *intent* to harm the power substation. So I’d you crashed into it on purpose it would be an act of war, If you were drunk it wouldn’t be. If you claimed you didn’t mean to you would likely be grilled and they would look at other evidence- had you mentioned before you intended to damage the occupiers? Had you been party before to any other accidents or “accidents”? Etc. 

The problem with law, trials, everything is that, in a civilized society at least, we are trying to get a fair outcome. It’s not always possible.

Say person A, through fraud but not theft, lost his bike to person B. Person B then sells it to Person C and runs off with the money. Person A has no claim against person C. Person C now owns the bike. Why? It’s what was decided is fair.

What if Person B stole it instead of used fraud to obtain it? Then he never obtained title and Person A *can* reclaim the bike.

Mind you this is all the American system but our laws are built upon literally hundreds of years of cases- one of the earliest I’ve had to study was from the 1200s post Norman conquest of 1066.
