The last couple of days definitely weren’t quiet. There was one missiles strike aimed at Kharkiv and a bunch more aimed at Kharkiv oblast. During the night where Wagner started their mutiny Russians lunched about 3-4 S-300 missiles at Kharkiv, two of them were intercepted, the other two hit nothing of importance. Both of them hit the ground, one landed in an industrial zone and damaged 10 civilian cars, the second missile landed somewhere in a residential district and damaged a gas pipe, thankfully there were no casualties.

At first, I thought that it was weird that they decided to bomb our cities while Wagner was capturing their own cities, but I think I had it backwards. It was Wagner that knew when the next missile strike would happen, so they attacked when Russian bombers were needed elsewhere. That is probably the reason why we didn’t see any bombers attacking the Wagner convoys, but we did see plenty of helicopters that did attack them and were shot down. Of course, it’s all a speculation, but I think it does make sense, it was the biggest missile attack in months, so their bombers would need to be resupplied before they could have been potentially used against Wagner.

The ending to the mutiny was definitely very anticlimactic, but I really don’t see how it could be a psyops. They destroyed 6-7 of their own helicopters and a plane, killing about 15 pilots, and got literally nothing in return, and now Putin looks weaker than ever. No, Putin is not playing a 5D chess, he’s not a genius mastermind and I have no idea why so many people still think so highly of him, he’s a stupid old international war criminal and nothing more. 

People that talk about a “surprise Wagner offensive on Kyiv from Belarus” have probably not followed this war at all, because that an utterly delusional theory. There’s no place in our country with better defenses than the northern border with Belarus, there was absolutely no fighting on that front since Russians were routed from Kyiv, so we were able to mount defenses there completely unopposed. People defending that border are also not the same people that are conducting the counteroffensive right now, so there won’t be manpower issues. If people think that we will be scared of “Belarusian nuclear weapons (lmao)” and not attack any force that might try to attack us from that direction then they are sorely mistaken. 

There is no element of surprise in an offensive from that direction, I guess some people think we are living in medieval times without satellite surveillance giving us real time intelligence on any potential threat. If they wanted to move Wagner to Belarus for an attack then they would have just done that without any “psyops”, if that was a psyops then its success literally hinges on us being incredibly stupid and not seeing the obvious moves, which isn’t the case. We also have aerial supremacy in Kyiv region, good luck trying to attack us from air there, it would be a slaughter of Russians forces.",False,1687818923.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,132,0,132,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/index.html

""Social media video and images have emerged showing the wreckage of a military aircraft reportedly brought down by the Wagner Group in a rural area of southern Russia.

The plane’s markings showed that it was a Russian Air Force Ilyushin-22, an aircraft sometimes used as an airborne command and communications center.

The Russian Defense Ministry has not commented on the loss of any Il-22 planes.

The cause of the crash is not clear, but footage that captured its plunge to Earth indicated it had been struck by a missile or rocket.

A Russian military blogger said Saturday that the Wagner forces had shot down an Il-22 aircraft carrying 10 people.

Irina Kuksenkova, a correspondent for Russian state-controlled Channel One, said the plane came down near Voronezh, and that Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin had offered to compensate the dead crew’s relatives.

Prigozhin has not commented on the crash but claimed Saturday that a Russian combat helicopter was brought down. Video also emerged Sunday of the wreckage of a Ka-52 helicopter in the Talovsky district of the Voronezh region.

A Russian military blogger claimed the helicopter had been shot down by Wagner and said the crew had been killed.""",False,1687780204.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

""The criminal case against Prigozhin did not stop. The investigation continues,"" the source said about the Wagner founder, according to TASS.

On Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists a deal had been reached with Prigozhin and the charges against him for calling for “an armed rebellion” would be dropped, without providing a time frame.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko also claimed Saturday that the criminal case against Prigozhin would be dropped. With Prigozhin’s Wagner forces just hours away from reaching Moscow, Lukashenko said he had brokered a deal with Prigozhin, allowing him to go to Belarus and not face charges.

However, neither Prigozhin nor his press service have confirmed a deal. Prigozhin has not been seen in public since his departure from Rostov-on-Don Saturday night.""",False,1687780600.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

I'll edit this post shortly with a TLDR.

TLDR: Putin's ""pathetic and wobbly"" speech. Reveals weakness. Don't think the de-politicized blob in the middle will dissolve, or there will be revolution in Russia, not at all. Don't exaggerate this crack in his aura, although it is there, he knows about it, it's irreversible. Putin feels incandescent rage at Pringles, and betrayal is the worst crime possible to Putin. Pringles generated a ""potentially revolutionary"" situation. If it had gone further, it's not clear what he would've done - odds are, he'd have been ""handled"" by the regime. Putin saw this as an existential threat, ""spoke with wobbliness of somebody who felt that his power was in danger, and his life too"". The message to Wagnerites who marched is extraordinary, and it's weakness won't go unnoticed. Roughly, Putin said you've done something so terrible, but implied he forgives them. Those who accept you've made a mistake, can sign up with MOD. ""We're gonna see what that means, because we don't know."" Many experts assume Pringles going to Belarus is not like going there in numbers, which isn't clearly acceptable to anybody including Luka, so what it means we don't know yet. Organic revolutions are impossible to Putin, has to be foreign interference, so that came out in his speech. Putin was ""perilously close to really thanking Wagner for stopping in time"" (HAHAHA). The implication is almost that Wagner realized it was being used by the west and stopped in time. Putin excused tardiness of response by saying there was an instruction to avoid bloodshed, and he thanked ""civil society"" to resisting Wagner (Putin knows this is a lie). Putin didn't thank the army in general as an institution. ""This does to some extent bring out an interesting distinction between the regime and the state... Jeremy Morris' last piece is about how all of us follow experts, academics, etc.... all of us make sense of this environment."" Next vids will help us better watch and listen to the world around us.

EDIT: A bit further explanation. The ""depoliticized blob in the middle"" he references, that's a theme across his analysis. Basically (and all that follows is his view, I just want to write it without saying that every time for simplicity): Russian society has been largely depoliticized, to a degree we in the West can't really comprehend. You have about 20% Z fanatics, rabidly pro-victory. You have, maybe a bit less than that consciously anti-war, anti-Putin, and then you have more than half the population in the middle who left politics to the regime in exchange for stability, a normal life. That gamble they made is now clearly wrong, but it's too hard for them to accept. Especially after this failed coup, Putin is going to be under tremendous pressure. In Russia, most of that pressure is going to come from the Z-fanatic, pro-victory side. So he's going to have to politicize that huge blob in the middle (by taking steps toward fascism and victory to appease the Z-fanatics), and he's going to have to make them pro-Putin, fascist. That's a dangerous game. Putin doesn't want Russians marching in the streets, even if they agree with him. He wants them on the couch, watching TV, and not thinking deep thoughts about where the power and money is going. So whenever Vexler mentions this depoliticized blob, that's his shorthand for long-time viewers of saying ""Russian society in general"", kinda.

That said, they admit that this is still largely speculation. 

Translation below (warning, long read). TL;DR, Wagner and GRU are essentially the same thing, GRU wants to save Russia by ending the war, the deal between Prigozhin and Putin may well have put this into motion.

>ZHENIA-SLAMMER, OR EVERYTHING IS GOING TO PLAN

>Yesterday's Troubled Saturday was a colorful show that cheered up the Russians quite well. But the vast majority still made the main mistake: they seriously believed in the sincerity of Prigozhin’s declarations and considered Wagner’s gestures on their own, without any historical and political context - and now a lot of people are at a loss: why did all this happen? What's the point? and is there one?

>Of course, the meaning was and is, but to understand it, the whole situation must be analyzed from a higher point of view.

>We do not pretend to know the innermost and access to state secrets, but any sane person can formulate certain theses that are not noticed / ignored by propaganda, and quite intelligible logical conclusions from them. So:

>1.1. Military intelligence (in the Russian Federation it is the Main Directorate, the former GRU) is always a “ministry within a ministry” and, using the resources of the Ministry of Defense, to which it is formally subordinate, it always conducts its own policy.

>1.2. PMC ""Wagner"" was created with the direct participation of the GRU, all command positions (up to the very ""Wagner"" - Utkin) are occupied by former GRU officers. ""Wagner"" is provided with weapons and ammunition precisely through the GRU and helps the GRU to solve its tasks outside the Russian Federation.

>1.3. The most sane part of the Russian elite - including the military elite - has long been ripe for a request to stop the senseless disgrace called “SVO”, which directly leads Russia to a hopeless dead end, if not to death. And there is an understanding that without the elimination of Putin and the military command (Shoigu-Gerasimov) this task cannot be solved. The sane part of the Russian army is precisely the GU-GRU and those who stand behind them (see paragraph 1).

>1.4. Historically, any transformation of power in Russia (top coup) is best combined with an external military defeat, to which the attention of the population will be diverted, at the same time, all the blame can be shifted to the former government.

>Consequently, the task under paragraph 3 in the current conditions can be formulated as follows: to ensure the end of the senseless war in Ukraine and hang all the dogs on Putin, Shoigu and Gerasimov, with their further departure and the end of the “SVO”.

>The general contractor is the Main Directorate (GRU), its subcontractor-executor - that is, the very sledgehammer that should strike - PMC ""Wagner"". And no matter how it ends - the prisoners are not sorry, for the GRU they are just meat and consumables.

>So far, state propaganda has not given clear answers to obvious questions:

>2.1. How did it happen that no one even tried to stop the Wagner march - neither the army, nor the National Guard, nor the FSB, nor the Ministry of Internal Affairs?

>2.2. Why was Prigogine forgiven for 6 defiantly destroyed aircraft?

>2.3. What did Prigozhin actually agree with Putin (why did he have such a satisfied voice when he talked about stopping the campaign and returning back)?

>The answer is obvious: it was not Prigozhin's hysteria and not a spontaneous rebellion, but a clearly planned and executed action. The GRU-Wagner rebellion was a success:

>3.1. Putin has long been inadequate, but he covers for Shoigu and Gerasimov, who may understand the plans of the GRU and not want to take responsibility for the defeat in Ukraine (and try on prison uniforms). Therefore, they will do their best to drag out the “SVO” and delay the inevitable. Hence the dumping of the actions of the RF Armed Forces in Ukraine into complete meaninglessness.

>3.2. The GRU does not want either the death of the Russian Federation or the destruction of its military potential, therefore it is actively working against the Defense Ministry and the General Staff.

>With a high probability, the GRU has a very specific plan on how to end a hopeless war with minimal economic and image losses for the Russian Federation, and yesterday’s speech by Wagner is Shoigu-Gerasimov’s “peace enforcement”.

>3.3. Judging by the fact that “Wagner” did not enter completely defenseless Moscow along the M4 red carpet, the coercion worked, and the plan to stop “SVO” was finally approved at the highest level. To paraphrase Al Capone, a kind word and a sledgehammer (“Wagner”) can accomplish more than just a kind word.

>Now the GRU can put this sledgehammer in a box (to Belarus), or just throw it away - it doesn't matter anymore. The tool worked 100%. Ahead - interesting news.

Ukraine still must battle on and remain focused on booting Russia out of their country inch by inch.

However with that being said this is the prime opportunity for other countries to step up and continue aid to Ukraine as more and more pressure could finally break the dam and lead to the end of Putin.

Lukashenko received a generous pay-off for dealing with Prigozhin, it seems.

Under Putin's decision, Belarus will pay a very low price for Russian gas until 2031.

Currently Minsk pays $127.52 per 1,000 cubic meters. This price will be valid until 2026, as Belarus ambassador to Russia Dmitriy Krutoy told media.

Terrorist Girkin-Strelkov commented on Prigozhin's latest statements: 

""I will repeat my conclusions. It was an attempted armed rebellion to remove Putin from power. There was an aim specifically to commit a coup d'état

The whole military operation was perfectly executed and prepared. A real master class. Those who have served and know at least something about an army should understand that unprepared units will not achieve such results. If the march had not been prepared, it would have ended halfway from lack of diesel and other things.

I will try to give my version of this coup attempt

Every coup has power and a political component. After the beginning of the SMO, it became clear to all that a conspiracy and a palace coup was possible. The question remained who could do it. As it turns out, Wagner was the perfect armed tool. There is a conflict with the Ministry of Defense. There was the possibility of preparing a conspiracy without fear of anything, because Prigozhin's protection is perfect. And there are many other factors as well

Timing was perfect. The Ukrainian offensive; everyone was busy managing and defending. No one could imagine someone launching an insurgency. Wagner was recovering from Bakhmut. Everyone believed that the PMC was almost incapacitated. There was a weekend ahead. Officials and enforcers were relaxed. Some were on holiday. Administration buildings were empty

Route of travel. Don route was full of people, which was beneficial to the rebels as a ""human shield"". Plus the longest days. Prigozhin actually admitted that they almost arrested Gerasimov in time to leave Rostov. I am sure that the aim was to arrest Shoigu and Gerasimov in Rostov. The capture of Rostov was a militarily competent action. As I have written before, it was impossible to carry out an operation in Rostov to arrest Prigozhin

Wagner's units were not just marching, they were breaking through to Moscow. What facilities were they supposed to take? That question remains open. They had every opportunity to blockade the Ministry of Defense, General Staff, Lubyanka, PA and possibly the airports. There are witnesses that strange groups appeared in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the morning and moved around in an organized manner, dressed in camouflage uniforms just about in the street

Striking at the Wagner base was a ""legitimate"" reason for Prigozhin to take action. What they said about the reluctance to shed blood was a lie. It started to be shed immediately. The ""protest"" was a lie. There was no need to fly to Moscow for that. It would have been enough to take Rostov. In such cases, almost immediately Dzerzhinsky's division is brought into Moscow. Kantemirovka and Tamanskaya were on full alert, but there was no order to go to Moscow. Putin clearly outlined what was happening. So did Sobyanin

Masses of people with their own tasks were to turn up in St Petersburg too. A GAZelle with cash was not just stored on the street. It happens when you have to distribute money to people quickly. It was like that on Maidan, by the way. Apparently, for some reason the political plan failed. Prigozhin, apparently, really did not want to take power himself. He had to provide a power plan. It is said that Putin flew urgently to St Petersburg. If so, Prigozhin stopped because there was no point in continuing the military operation. And then there were behind-the-scenes negotiations and so on

Everyone felt there was no state for about twenty-four hours. I guess in the future we will find out who the conspiracy was made for. In any case, this was just the beginning. Stakes are as high as ever. Next time the conspirators may succeed

If something looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck.

P.S. The main thing now is to show the public that this was not a conspiracy. We need to shift the public's attention from political categories to disputes between ""economic entities"" and personal grievances. That is being done.""

When Ukraine was invaded the Belarusian Army absolutely did not want to get involved and successfully resisted Russian pressure to do so (although they did turn over much of their stockpiles to Russia). Many Belarusian people went to Ukraine to fight against Russia where they received training and weapons.

I have stated in this thread for months, given the weapon's buildup the big push seemd to be prepared for 2024, GLSDBs are going to give Ukraine an overwhelming artillery advantadge when combined with Himars and Storm Shadow and F16s are coming, with ATACMs being the only thing left that has not been given.

So if they dont take the full land bridge in this counteroffensive is not catastrophic, that being said, some big gains need to be made this year, gains that at least dislodge Russia from.some defensive lines so they dont flood the lines with fortifications. Or that puts Ukraine in an advantadgeous position to make use of the overwhelming firepower they will have next year. Indeed, I recall some weeks ago an Ukranian Commander stated that the counteroffensive was to put Ukraine in a better position than before, which seems to be a reasonable minimum goal.

Now if a breakthrough isnt acheived in 2024, thats when I would be very worried, there is no much more new weapons the west can provide after F16s aside from ATACMs, so if Russia can hold on in 2024, it means its a stalemate and the war has become one of attrition, production and economy, an extremely unappealing and uncertain prospect.",1687814204.0,1687813941.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has made it clear that he didn't target Putin when he declared his troops would march on Moscow, saying: ""We didn't march to overthrow Russia's leadership.""  
In his 11-minute video message, he says: ""The aim of the march was to avoid destruction of Wagner and to hold to account the officials who through their unprofessional actions have committed a massive number of errors"".  
He says Wagner regrets ""they had to hit Russian aviation"" and they turned around ""to avoid spilling blood of Russian soldiers.""

I still think it is possible that Wagner's ""run on Moscow"" was just a diversion, half real, half inflated over Telegram, and that the actual goal was to overrun facilities with WMDs along the way. If Prigozhin wanted to recover immunity for himself and Wagner, that would probably be more clever plan.

the Belarusian people and the entire global community must be fully aware of the danger of armed mercenaries on our territory. Everyone thought it couldn't get any worse, but it did.

We have another problem for the whole of Europe. Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia should review their security system. Now, there is a great threat In the center of Europe, there are people with real combat experience who committed crimes in Ukraine.

Putin gave Prigozhin to lukashenka. Will putin move nuclear weapons in the middle of this boiling pot? Is it a plan to shift the responsibility to the dictator and criminal? It remains unknown. Isn't a center of terrorism and blackmail being created in Belarus? Probably.

> A.I.-generated transcript of Prigozhin’s latest statement, just released:
> 
> Today I opened the press service and received thousands of questions about the events. In order to avoid misunderstandings, I want to answer the main of these questions. First. What were the prerequisites for Masha Justice on 06/23/23? PMC ""Wagner"" is perhaps the most experienced and combat-ready unit in Russia, and possibly in the world. motivated, charged fighters who performed a huge number of tasks in the interests of the Russian Federation and always only in the interests of the Russian Federation, in Africa, in the Arab countries and around the world. Recently, this unit has achieved good results in Ukraine, having completed the most serious tasks.
> 
> As a result of the intrigues of ill-conceived decisions, this unit was supposed to cease to exist on July 1, 23. A council of commanders gathered, which brought all the information to the fighters. No one agreed to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense, since everyone knows very well from the current situation of their experience during the NWO that this will lead to a complete loss of combat capability. Experienced fighters, experienced commanders will simply be smeared and will actually go to the meat, where they will not be able to use their combat potential and combat experience. Those fighters who decided that they were ready to move to the Ministry of Defense did. But this is the minimum amount, calculated by a percentage or two. All the arguments that were in order to keep the Wagner PMC safe and sound were used.
> 
> But none were implemented. in an attempt to enter into any other structure where we can really be useful. We were categorically against what they want to do. At the same time, the decision to transfer to the Ministry of Defense and understanding our attitude to close the Wagner PMC was made at the most inopportune moments. Nevertheless, we put the equipment on the grass, collected everything that was needed, made an inventory and were going, if the decision was not made, to leave on June 30 in a column to Rostov and publicly hand over the equipment near the headquarters of the NWO. Despite the fact that we did not show any aggression, we were attacked by missiles and immediately after that the helicopters worked. About 33 fighters of PMC ""Wagner"" were killed. Some were injured.
> 
> This prompted the Council of Commanders to immediately decide that we should move out immediately. I made a statement in which I said that we are not going to detect aggression in any way. But if we are hit, we will take it as an attempt to destroy and give an answer. During the entire march, which lasted 24 hours, one of the columns went to Rostov, the other in the direction of Moscow. During the day we covered 780 kilometers. Not a single soldier on earth was killed. We regret that we were forced to strike at air assets, but these assets were dropping bombs and delivering missile strikes. During the day we covered 780 kilometers, short of 200 small kilometers to Moscow. During this time, all military facilities that were along the road were blocked and neutralized. Nobody died, I repeat once again, from those who were on the ground. And this was our task. Among the fighters of the Wagner PMC, several people were wounded and two dead, who joined us, military personnel and the Ministry of Defense, of their own free will. None of the fighters of PMC ""Wagner"" was forced to this campaign, and everyone knew his ultimate goal.
> 
> The purpose of the campaign was to prevent the destruction of the PMC ""Wagner"" and to bring to justice those persons who, through their unprofessional actions, made a huge number of mistakes during the SVO. It was demanded by the public. All the servicemen who saw us during the march supported us. We did not reach about 200 kilometers to Moscow, having covered 780 kilometers in one and the other direction. We stopped at the moment when the first assault detachment, which had approached 200 kilometers from Moscow, deployed its artillery, reconnoitered the area, and it was obvious that at that moment a lot of blood would be shed. Therefore, we felt that the demonstration of what we were going to do, it is sufficient. And our decision to turn around was two major factors.
> 
> The first factor is that we did not want to shed Russian blood. The second factor is that we went to demonstrate our protest, and not to overthrow the government in the country. At this time, Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko extended his hand and offered to find solutions for the further work of Wagner PMC in legal jurisdiction. The columns turned back and went to the field camps. I want to point out that our march of justice showed a lot of the things that we talked about earlier. Serious security problems throughout the country. We blocked all the military units of the airfield that were in our way. In 24 hours, we covered the distance that corresponds to the distance from the launch site of Russian troops on February 24, 22 to Kyiv and from the same point to Uzhgorod.
> 
> Therefore, if the action on February 24, 22, at the time of the start of the special operation, was carried out by a unit in terms of the level of training, in terms of the level of moral composure and readiness to perform tasks, like the Wagner PMC, then perhaps the special operation would last a day. It is clear that there were other problems, but we showed the level of organization that the Russian army should correspond to. And when on June 23-24 we walked past Russian cities, civilians met us with the flags of Russia and with the emblems and flags of the Wagner PMC. They were all happy when we came and when we passed by. Many of them still write words of support, and some are disappointed that we stopped, because in the march of justice, in addition to our struggle for existence, they saw support for the fight against bureaucracy and other ailments that exist in our country today.
> 
> These are the main questions that I can answer in order to exclude rumors both in Russian social networks and the media and in foreign networks. So, we started our march because of justice. On the way, on the ground, we did not kill a single soldier. In a day, only 200 kilometers did not reach Moscow, they entered and completely took control of the city of Rostov. The civilians were glad to see us. We showed a master class on how February 24, 22 should look like. We did not have the goal of overthrowing the existing regime and the legally elected government, which has been said many times. We turned around in order not to shed the blood of Russian soldiers.

This confirms what I've been thinking and saying, that this wasn't a coup, this was a last ditch effort to demand the ousting of Shoigu and preventing the dissolution of Wagner.

Now it looks like Lukashenko's role in this is to allow Prigokhin and the Wagnerites loyal to him to move their operations to Belarus, where they can continue their worldwide operations and avoid the Ukrainian meat grinder that Prigokhin has been rallying against lately. 

The rumors that Shoigu might be replaced, and the quote from the chairman of Russian parliament yesterday stating that Wagner shouldn't be dissolved, makes it seem as though Russia might be wavering on all of this. They're about to lose ~8,000 trained soldiers (maybe more) to this, and those who don't transfer, and get rolled into the general military, are going to resent it.",False,1687793810.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

- We have yet to see the effects of morale, it could be catastrophic making the frontline crumble to not having have an effect at all and business as usual.

- Many already have commented on how weak this makes Putin, it would be beating around the bush to comment on that. But something I havent seen discussed is how this makes the 2024 potentially lethal for Putin. Rigged or not these are the times where the average Russian is reminded they have a dictator they supposedly vote for. We have already seen in Rostov the fires of rebellion faned. Election times are going to be a powder keg in Russia.

- In line with the previous point, Ukraine has a predictible powder keg to capitalize. 2024 happen to be the year Ukraine will get overwhelming artillery advantadge with GLSDBs added to the mix and will also get F16s. They can press the attack during such time and attack targets like the Kerch Bridge.

- Putin can no longer mobilize, it would be potentially suicidal after this. This is HUGE, it means the army Putin now has, conscritpts and whatever volunteers he can draft is all he is going to get. Maybe conscripts will be able to fill the hole without a mobilization though, Russia get more of those yearly.",False,1687800909.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia does actually have a Double Jeopardy law.  You can't actually drop charges and then refile them easily in the Russian justice system. 

Putin has had carte blanche to write laws for a long time, all the way back in 2013 he signed a law that basically says you can in fact try someone again even if they've been aquitted if ""evidence of a worse crime"" comes out. And he's been using that *heavily*. 

But, Prigozhin immediately incurred a charge of High Treason/Insurrection/whatever and Putin can't reasonably make up a crime worse than that under the current system. 

So if they drop charges, they actually are legally dropped this time.  Putin can just defenestrate as per usual, but Prigozhin is in a bunker so there are no windows.  Also presumably Putin already explored those options long ago, Prigo has been talking shit for a while.

I dont know if Prigozhin went in with the intent to really overthrow Putin, maybe he did, maybe he didnt. But regadless, lets suppose what most assume happened: Prigozhin didnt got the support he expected to defeat Putin. So why Putin wouldnt just destroy him? Normally he would.

But Prigozhin here had a card he could play, he could simply make Putin lose the war, no ifs and buts, he could. The area Wagner took cut off the invasion force from the mainland. Wagner captured 2 major cities, retaking them by force could take months, Wagner took the SMD. He could also repeatedly call for the frontline troops to join him or surrender. And even if Wagner did not immediately had the support to win, it wasnt impossible for that to happen.

This lead to a position where both Prigozhin could lose but also take Putin down with him by just collapsing the frontline. Which would lead to what we just saw: A deal where neithet Putin or Prigozhin got what they wanted.",False,1687829526.0,t3_14j6s09,t3_14j6s09,,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,

""Yes because a meltdown is extremly unlikely. That was the whole issue with Chernobyl. It was spitting out radioactive material out of the reactor with no end in sight. It was causing an uncontrollable reaction that was hard to stop due to a major design flaw in the reactor that made it not only impossible to shut it down, it actually increased the chain reaction, causing the meltdown. This flaw has been fixed decades ago. It also didn't just happen like that, dozens of safety measures were ignored to even reach that level of reactor failure. In the Zaporizhzhia plant they even use different reactors that are much safer. The reactors itself have large concrete containments and built-in fire protection systems. Most of a total of six reactors have been shut down a long time ago. The current danger is, there is radioactive waste stored on the site, not very much. The material is mostly stored in deep pools and fortified containers. If that material were to be set free from their containers that holds them, there you have your local issue. It would contaminate the site itself and the closeby surrounding area.

Also this, from Pavel Podvig:

""Creating a serious ""radiological event"" at ZNPP is not a trivial task. There are many reasons it is most likely to stay (very) local. Nothing like Chernobyl or Fukushima.

Podvig linked to this video, it's from an expert (Dmitry Gorchakov) who explains why the danger is greatly overblown and has the knowledge and facts to back up his claims. He also goes into how many people are using the plant to manipulate public opinion by exaggerating the scale of a potential accident, for political purposes, and blackmailing the world community with a nuclear catastrophe. He even explains the extremely unlikely event of a missile hitting directly into one of the reactors. It would just depressurize and stop working, there's a chance it could create a powerful steam explosion. It will NOT cause a nuclear bomb like explosion. It could throw out some radioactive material if the containment is damaged as a result. The most dangerous type of this material (volatile iodine) only has a half-life of 8 days, and again would only pose a threat to the local population in the surroundings of the plant. But again, this was his worst case hypothetical situation, which is unlikely due to the reactors being mostly shut down and are contained in heavily fortified concrete containers

Finally, Dmitry Gorchakov his main conclusion:

So as a conclusion, I would say that due to the design features, an accident on the level of Chernobyl or Fukushima at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant is unlikely, if not impossible. Nevertheless, accidents on a smaller (read: LOCAL) scale are possible, including the release of radiation, including volatile iodine, pollution of the river system or local pollution of the industrial site.

Prigozhin's specialties are sausage, mercenaries, and troll farms/propaganda. Were the convoys descending on Moscow real? The destruction of bridges and the fuel dump by Russian forces certainly were. The ultimate troll would be if Kremlin had to act as though the coup was real while also suffering the double humiliation that it wasn't. Shiogu and Gerasimov would be responsible for the embarrassment of attacking phantoms, while the Kremlin would have to pretend they are still in power or look as though they have caved to Prigozhin's demands. Indeed, the Kremlin seems to be tripping over itself with its own bizarre and contradictory accounts of the ""deal"" whereas Wagner is suddenly silent.

When you step back and take stock of the hard facts around Prigozhin's coup vs things that were inflated from simple Telegram/Twitter comments, it seems unclear to me how much of the rebellion was real. Wagner was certainly in Rostov, but even the images from there... what are we really seeing? At least two tanks, and about 40-50 troops and a similar sized crowd.

It is known that Progozhin came in to the sunlight thanks to Putin. He was called Putins Chef for a reason, with all the cut backs in the food business. 

Next came Wagner, with all the operations in Africa, Syria etc., we know for a fact that Wagner used Russian military equipment and could request assistance of Russian air force when needed. This again shows how close wagner was with Russian elite/Putin.

What I am trying to say is that Prigozhin is fully made by Putin, and I think we are way overextending his influence and willingness to go against status quo in Russia, long story short, I think he is just a pawn and played his role flawlessly.

Yes, this thing made Putin look weak, but only temporary. Lets look at the facts again, war is going bad, and I am sure Ukraine will find a gap in the front, its only a matter of time. Putin can try to go for full mobilization, but thats risky as hell, even though it does not look like it, but even Russian people have their limits until they go revolution mode. So what are the options? So many Russian soldiers have died and for what, if they pull back now, it will be for two oblasts? If they can even keep them… Putin needs a big win, while ditching Ukraine war and here enters - Belarus. You could say parts of Russian army are already there so he could’ve done it already, but taking Ukraine was supposed to be easy as well and look what happened, mistakes can’t be made. The best forces need to participate in it. So Russia needs a crazy, bold yet believable scenario how to send Prigozhin and his mercenaries to Belarus, while Lukashnko gladly agrees to it, thinking he’s a hero. And whola here comes le coupe. And they are about to have their best troops in Belarus, that I think could handle the Belarusian military to overtake Belarus, giving Putin a win, that might give him enough political points to withdraw from Ukraine.

During the shenanigans, I made comments about how I thought the reports of Prigozhin stockpiling ammunition away were disinformation. It'd be hard to get away with that at any sort of scale for very long. I instead thought that perhaps Ukraine made a contribution to the ""Wagner Sedition Fund"" in the form of donating Soviet/Russian equipment. The response I got was largely negative. 

However I've also been thinking about how during the ruckus, Putin and the Kremlin kept using the term ""treason"" instead of ""sedition"". Treason means to give aid to an enemy in a time if war. Sedition means to undermine or rebel against the sitting regime. 

Now, you can stretch the definition of treason here to include acts that casually undermine the war effort, and God knows Russian law is whatever Putin wants it to be. 

But it also occurs to me that it could have been signalling from the Kremlin, that only got to Prigozhin during ""negotiations"".

> At first, I thought that it was weird that they decided to bomb our cities while Wagner was capturing their own cities, but I think I had it backwards. It was Wagner that knew when the next missile strike would happen, so they attacked when Russian bombers were needed elsewhere. That is probably the reason why we didn’t see any bombers attacking the Wagner convoys, but we did see plenty of helicopters that did attack them and were shot down. Of course, it’s all a speculation, but I think it does make sense, it was the biggest missile attack in months, so their bombers would need to be resupplied before they could have been potentially used against Wagner.

Oh, that's something I've not seen anyone else mention. Your perspective is invaluable! Makes perfect sense.

Another interviewee told Vyerstka that her husband, who was in Rostov on **Saturday**, informed her of the likely deployment to Belarus but has not been in contact since.

If he told her this on Saturday, which is when all the shit was going down, then that hints to this being planned in advance (not to mention the rapidity with which this has been announced).

Maybe this was Prigozhin's play all along? If he didn't get what he wanted regarding the removal of Shoigu and preventing the dissolution of Wagner in Russia, he'd move it to Belarus? He's spoken very vehemently against the Ukraine war recently and clearly wants him and his men out of it. This would get them out of the meat grinder and allow them to continue their worldwide operations. 

That could explain why he just left. He came to make his final demand, with the ultimatum that he'd take those loyal to him and leave. So it wasn't a coup, it was a way to show how many were loyal to him. And this is that ultimatum playing out.

The Kremlin did say that the Wagnerites that *didn't* join the 'coup' would be rolled into the Russian Army, and those who did would not be prosecuted and not rolled into the army. I was wondering what would happen to them...

>Currently, there is no data to confirm the information about the construction of a camp for the PMC Wagner in the Asipovichy district, Belarus.

>Today, the Russian media Wyorstka reported that construction of a camp for Wagner mercenaries allegedly began in the Asipovichy district. It’s said that the journalists received confirming comments in the forestry and a source “close to the administration of Mahiliou region.”

>The text says that there will allegedly be several camps for 8000 mercenaries and that the current camp area is 24,000 square meters.
>In addition, the post says that several relatives of the PMC Wagner mercenaries confirm that they will be sent to Belarus.

>What can the Belarusian Hajun say?
>As of 17:30 26.06, we can definitely say that in the past 24 hours there has been no activity in the Asipovichy district, not to mention the construction of such a large facility.

>The data of a foreign (Russian) edition that they were able to get comments from sources close to the administration of Mahiliou region are questionable. However, Belarusian independent media haven’t received such comments and haven’t confirmed this information yet. 

>As for the possible transfer of the PMC Wagner mercenaries to Belarus, we will be able to confirm or deny this information by direct observation. Currently, there are no PMC columns moving to Belarus or that are already in Belarus.

It looks like the ultimatum may have been to either kick out Shoigu and Gerasimov and preserve the Wagner group, or he'll take his loyalists to Belarus. Now Belarus has just announced they're building a camp to house 8,000 Wagner soldiers.

But there are also rumors of Shoigu being replaced, with a successor even being named, and yesterday the chairman of Parliament said that Wagner shouldn't be dissolved... so it sounds like Russia might be waffling on whether to accept the ultimatum or not.

Prigozhin has recently been shouting from the rooftops that the entire war was a mistake, and started under false pretenses by Shoigu and co, and then subsequently mismanaged. He wants to get the fuck out of there. 

If Russia replaces Shoigu, it could lead to the war ending, with Shoigu and co being scapegoats for the whole thing, and Wagner can go back to the 'good old days' of its worldwide operations. A win for Prigozhu. 

If they don't, and Prigozhu takes his loyalists to Belarus, he still gets to go back to the 'good old days' of worldwide mercenary operations, and gets himself and his men out of Ukraine.

The question is whether Russia has the power to forcibly *stop* Wagner (or a big chunk of it) from making an exodus to Belarus. They couldn't stop them marching to Moscow, after all. And allegedly (and according to the just-released recording), men from the Russian Army joined him on his march.

Sure, he would have preferred that Putin listen to him, kick out Shoigu, end the war and stop the dissolution of Wagner, but this is a better outcome than what would have happened (the complete dissolution of Wagner).

At least from the Ukrainian side, there is an emphasis on reducing risk to their manpower and fighting capacity, which means that progress will be cautious, fully planned out, and tactically sound.   Speed, conserve warfighting capacity, effectiveness - pick two.

Also, you're buying into the idea that strategic and operational goals must be tied into the amount of territory taken or conquered.   Though it is a much easier measurement to take when gauging for yourself how well the war is going, it is often counter to the operational goals for one side.  In the case of the last few months, the Ukrainians have been aiming towards breaking the ability of the Russians to actually conduct a war.   The Storm Shadow attacks on logistical centers and supply points, the erosion of key supporting elements such as artillery and logistical transports, and the denial of easy supply routes for Russian ammunition and equipment points towards that as a solid goal.

Many of the recent counteroffensive shaping maneuvers have not been focused on achieving breakthrough, but positioning the Ukrainians to allow them to keep Russian forces engaged and using up that advantage in certain equipment and ammunition numbers, forcing them to fritter that away.  As pointed out rather succinctly by Perun in his latest YouTube video, tying this into the deterioration of Russian manufacturing due to sanctions means that the ability of Russia to conduct a war is dropping at a precipitous rate.  That's what they've been aiming for.

The most optimistic view is that Ukraine is focusing on destroying Russian equipment instead of gaining ground, which would make sense since you'd rather fight that equipment now than when its better protected at the defensive line. Its also possible they think the Russian leadership will underreact to this tactic, since Russian army reports are notoriously optimistic, yet map changes are taken very seriously (think of how big of a deal it was for Russia to capture Bakhmut, even though its strategically not important).",1687814597.0,1687814493.0,t3_14j6s09,t1_jpn1pe7,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

In Cyrillic, Russian uses two letters **e**, which sounds like the ""ye"" in English **ye**s, and the letter **ë**, which sounds a bit like the English word **yaw**. Confusingly, Russians tend to drop the two dots above the second, because Russian language users always know by context which one is used just by seeing the word. 

Accurate transliterations into Latin will account for this:

- Семён / Semyon (not Semen)
- Артём / Artyom (not Artem)
- Хрущёв / Khrushchyov (not Khrushchev). 

But yeah sometimes Russian names can look funny. I had a Russian language student in my class once, whose husband's surname was Вагин (sounds like VAH-gin), and according to naming rules, when marrying, the woman takes the man's surname in the feminine form, which in this case is Вагина (VAH-gi-na), but of course when you transliterated to Latin, all I saw on my register was Liubov Vagina, or Luba as a short name.

11 minutes long.

AFU soldiers are treating some wounded with a few blown up/disabled armored vehicles around them. Several soldiers obviously have already lost limbs, and a few are likely dead(?).

Some of the soldiers are walking between the wounded and step on anti-personnel mines, thus also wounding them. One of the soldiers is able to make it to the top of a Bradley, and he obviously knows the area is packed with mines as he tries to step on a long white rope(?) that is hanging behind the vehicle. No idea what the rope is for, maybe to show the vehicle's path. His last step blows up a mine; unclear whether he was wounded or how badly but he makes it to the top of the vehicle. Before this, he also shot at the area right behind the vehicle where the mine goes off at--he likely already knew it was there. He's able to maneuver the Bradley (or tell the driver) to get a bit closer to the wounded. Honestly at this point, I wouldn't walk literally anywhere--seems like there's a mine per square meter.

Bradley is maneuvered to get a bit closer and the soldiers are able to get a few wounded onboard. One thing of note is they seem to be highly trained as they are *very* quick on grabbing tourniquets and applying them.

Another mine goes off, and guy on the Bradley backs it up even more to get closer.

Drone rotates up to show something in the distance--not sure what, maybe an ongoing battle--by the time it zooms back out, there's a shit ton of fire/smoke on the ground. Not sure what from.

One of the soldiers that got wounded while treating the others pulls himself up the ramp to get onto the Bradley.

Eventually a few get on and they leave or reposition. Another Bradley arrives and backs up, lowering the door. A soldier (looks like a medic as he has blue gloves on) makes a large jump out and takes a knee. The moment he puts his knee to the ground at 9:22, another mine goes off and flips him around--left leg is hanging on by a few bloody strands, and the other also appears to be injured. Great training is shown as by 9:29, he's already grabbing a tourniquet and applying it on himself. By 9:56, he's working on dragging himself back to the Bradley which leaves a pretty rough blood trail up the door. Another soldier from inside the Bradley (who obviously is trying to avoid stepping on the ground) helps him make it in. Red smoke is shown, not sure what it indicates.

The Bradley is reversed a bit more to get closer to the remaining injured. They gave up on sending anyone else out onto the ground (smart move) and instead used some kind of cloth/rope to have the injured grab onto to be pulled in. Last guy shown was already injured at the beginning, so he also watched the other soldiers who were treating him (and other injured) get injured themselves, as well as the medic that jumped off and immediately lost a leg.",1687812412.0,1687804684.0,t3_14j6s09,t1_jpm4q44,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

While it's true that ""the west"" can outproduce Russia, the fact of the matter is that it can't just provide all of its arms that it produces to Ukraine -- the vast, overwhelming majority of what's used and produced has to be kept for ***their*** stockpiles. We can only afford to give Ukraine a tiny fraction of what we have, and even if western NATO-aligned countries ramp up production significantly, it's just absurd to assume that it's all going to go toward Ukraine. China's increasing military assertiveness demands that these countries build up and maintain increasingly powerful militaries in response, and that inevitably comes at the expense of aid to Ukraine.

And, obviously, the longer the war goes on, the less appetite western nations will have for the continuation of the conflict and the donation of billions of dollars of aid. As weak as Russia has shown itself to be militarily, the one strength they have is the political will to continue a conflict that their leader has decreed as an existential fight that they must win. Since Russia doesn't have a political power base that opposes this view, the war will inevitably continue for as long as the Russian political elite, i.e. Putin, wants it to... even if it ends up being years and years.

That's a strength that can't be underestimated, and it seriously threatens the prospect of total Ukrainian victory. More likely, in my opinion, is a long period of bloody stalemate followed by the capitulation of certain portions of eastern Ukraine to Russia as part of a peace deal.

The only wild card here is Prigozhin's uprising that showed real cracks in the Russian political apparatus.

He never even said a bad word about Putin. His beef was with Shoigu, Gerasimov, etc, who he blames for both the start of this war and its mismanagement. He's been publicly saying this for a long time. He's been accusing them of profiteering off the war, and doctoring reports to hide the true number of casualties to make 'pretty reports' for Putin to read. 

By way of analogy... imagine you're a department head for a company. You believe in the company, and its mission. You're a comany man. You admire the CEO. 

But you're watching this company being run into the ground by shitty upper management. These executives are embezzling from the payroll, making terrible business decisions. You realize this is going to end in ruin for the company. (This is the sort of stuff he's actually said - that this war could mean the end of Russia.)

To put salt in the wound, one of the other execs/department heads convinces the boss to dissolve your own department, and transfer your crew to their own department (this is what has happened with Shoigu being the guy pushing for Wagner to be dissolved into the MoD as regular soldiers). So not only is this asshole poisoning the company, but he's gonna take down your guys with it. 

So what to do? You decide to get a bunch of your best guys from your department to storm down the hall and pound on the CEO's door and ask him to set things straight, and kick out this Shoigu guy (the march to Moscow).

Only the CEO's a chickenshit, hears you coming, sneaks out the backdoor, calls all of you traitors, sides with the corrupt exec. Well, fuck.

But you had a backup plan. Your boy Lukashenko is running a Belarusan office and could use some well-trained keen-eyed emplyoees like you and your department. So rather than being dissolved into that shitty exec's department, you take your best guys and go work for this other company, who promises better treatment and respect.

The core of the group outside of the convicts are recruited from the best soldiers in the Russian professional contract soldiers (as opposed to the conscripts). They’re also extremely well armed and you don’t want them going on a revenge tear domestically by killing Pringle after he made a deal.

But the more information we have coming out, bit by bit, is clearing up the picture.

Prigozhin started by aiming his mutiny directly at Shoigu and Gerasimov.  I believe the plan was for other field commanders to pledge their support as well.  The ultimate goal may or may not have been to overthrow the government, which is why the Russian waited it out.

Wagner had far less than the 25K troops originally reported, closer to 7-8K.  Nothing to sneeze at, but not enough to take Moscow without support.

The underlying theme presented by Ksenia Turkova in her live chat yesterday was that Russians are lazy.  The exact term I believe she used was that Russians were hoping to ""order a takeout rebellion"",  i.e. for a rebellion to happen and be delivered to them without them having to do anything more than use a smart phone to order/track it.

With all these factors in play, Prigozhin didn't have the support he needed, and he knew the longer he held out the more likely the field commanders and public would turn on him and Wagner (not that I know what Wagner's reputation in Russia is anyway).  

Personally I think his plan was to oust Shoigu and Gerasimov, get himself appointed Minster of Defense and get Surovikin to replace Gerasimov.  After Bahkmut and watching the ineptitude of Gerasimov's direction in prosecuting the war, Prigozhin is probably of the opinion that only he and Surovikin know how to win the war.",False,1687809510.0,t3_14j6s09,t1_jpmmrq9,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Seeing how eager the Russians have been to try and divert Ukrainian forces away from the axis of their counterattack, maybe the Ukrainians saw something the Russians were trying to set up on the left bank and wanted to set up a defensive point to nip that effort in the bud.   It would be too hard to set up and supply any counteroffensive actions through that area due to the marshy terrain, but it would be suitable for a defensive hold action and some limited pushes south to perhaps force infantry and artillery back.   Any actions beyond that would be highly risky, and the Ukrainians aren't keen to throw away troops right now.

Ideally, this would be a set-up for a larger crossing to establish a larger beachhead that will allow some units to enter the area.   Rather than fight all the way down south, I can see the Ukrainians at least trying to set up artillery so that they can gain fire control over the western supply line from Crimea, pinching the Russian supply chain even further now that the larger route through Henyches'k has a few Storm Shadow warhead-sized gaps.  But again, that would be extremely ambitious, and only if the Russians don't push the units back out.

In terms of % of GDP spent, it's middle of the road but is actually above the US + UK.

The question is whether he'll get it. They apparently agreed to this *extremely* hastily, while an armored column sat outside the gates, before they could think it through. 

They were about to dissolve Wagner altogether, and presumably directly take control of the foreign operations. But in haste, they agreed to let Prigozhin and his loyal Wagnerites move to Belarus, so they still exist, and Prigozhin is still the boss of all those dudes propping up African dictators for blood diamonds and shit. So now, how does Putin profit from that? Those guys are getting paid by Prigozhin (by way of Belarus now) - their boss just relocated. And Belarus will reap the profits of their activities. 

I wonder if the Putin administration even knows how to *contact* the Wagner troops in Africa and elsewhere. And even if they can scrounge up some phone numbers, they might get the 'new phone who dis' treatment, because apparently Prigozhin has a lot of loyalty from these guys and told them not to answer.

(Also worth noting, on the side - it's possible this whole thing wasn't his idea to begin with. If the trigger was Russia wanting to absorb and dissolve Wagner, Prigozhin isn't the only person in Wagner who would be pissed off by that, and it's very possible he was facing his own mutiny if he _didn't_ go through with it. That would at least line up with reports that it was threats to families of Wagner leadership that popped the momentum behind the coup.

No one thought that. But we knew there a big change happening in Russia and we sought to become more open with them and include them in Western economic policies and such.

>we could have had Ukraine a part of NATO by now even before the annexation of Crimea

No. Joining NATO requires a number of things, one of which is dealing with corruption. pre-2008 Ukraine was a massively corrupt political environment. They were following the same path that Russia did: corruption and autocracy. Then there are the requirements for upholding Western standards. Ukraine would have had to make many unpopular changes to its laws to join NATO.

Of course there were. That doesn't mean you don't at least try to present a different path for them. By Bush's 2nd term to Obama's first term, it was clear that Russia wasn't going to change, though.

Should some random person living in China, Thailand, Syria or Venezuela go hungry because they are ruled by a repressive authoritarian regime?

I don't like the fact countries with dismal human rights records have their money protected but the reason it is very rare to seize money from other countries almost no matter how badly they act is because not only will it just hurt the people in those countries it also risks destabilizing our whole economic system. That is why sanctions are what countries usually do when they are pissed at one another and of course those sanctions will not cover something like food or medicine. That way you can exert pressure but the governments of these places don't panic that they will have their money seized. It's kind of hard not to let countries with large economies become ""systematically important"" because if they trade a lot they are going to have substantial reserves of cash available for transactions and that money is going to be in a bank somewhere. 

If western countries just start deciding that they can take any other countries money when they piss them off you could see a fracturing of the whole world economy, that's why they almost never do it and why even very liberal governments are very reluctant to touch Russia's money, if it makes other governments jumpy it could come back to bite us all in a very, very bad way.

91956c4b87f7f507fed80132fbda8c9d,14j6s09,jpnvow4,"I don't have the link saved, but I read an article earlier that quoted an interview with the wife of a Wagner soldier, who said that her husband had told her on Saturday (while they were still driving toward Moscow) that he might be stationed in Belarus soon. That says to me that the 'backup plan' was always to move the Wagner operation to Belarus if Putin didn't agree to oust Shoigu and stop the dissolution of Wagner. 

In other words, Lukashenko didn't swoop in out of nowhere to suddenly make the offer. Prigozhin and Lukashenko have a history together, and Prigozhin already has business interests in Belarus. They clearly set this up ahead of time and blindsided the Putin administration, who hastily agreed without being given time to think about it (while a column of soldiers were sitting outside the gates). 

Now the Putin admin seems to have realized what the fuck they just agreed to after the fact. They hastily agreed to give Prigozhin and his loyalists amnesty and let them go to Belarus. They seem like they're wavering now on whether to go back on that or not. They got caught with their pants down and agreed to the 'terms' perhaps too quickly. 

Prigozhin didn't *need* to actually carry out an armed insurrection. 

And Lukashenko benefits from this. Now he has a small army no longer loyal to Russia. And he gets to profit from Wagner's various foreign 'adventuring' like supporting dictators in Central Africa in exchange for blood diamonds and other natural resources - a share of the booty that used to go to Russia. It weakens Putin and Russia and gets him marginally out from under Putin's thumb and makes him look clever and strong. 

Carrying out a military coup would have been a disaster, a bloody and disasterous conflict. 

There's also the fact that Prigozhin stopped in Rostov and met with Russian generals there and explained that he wanted to meet with Shoigu and Gerasimov. He basically said 'I just want to talk', and was welcomed along the way. His troops didn't fire a shot outside of self-defence with Shoigu's MoD sent attack aircraft at him. He was careful to paint it as a peaceful demonstration. 

'Hey look, Mr Putin, at all the loyal soldiers here under my command. We're here to ask that you remove Shoigu... etc. Here's a reminder of the value we provide you, please don't dissolve us and make us work for that bastard Shoigu who's both responsible for starting this stupid war and mismanaging it horribly'.

Meanwhile, it made the MoD look incompetent and stupid for failing to stop their approach by easily cruising through and shrugging off air attacks. And Russia tore up their own highways, sabotaged bridges, etc trying to stop them, assuming they're there to pull a coup. Then Wagner arrives, and Prigozhin's like, 'What, you thought I was gonna hit you? I told you I was just here to talk!' 

So the Putin admin is heavily in panic mode here, everyone fled the Kremlin, failed to stop them from advancing, etc, and suddenly they're asked to negotiate. When they turn down the demand to ditch Shoigu, etc, Prigozhin shrugs and pulls out plan B - a pre-arranged agreement with Lukashenko to move his loyalists there. The Kremlin hastily agreed, probably thinking he was still prepared to do an armed coup. 

This preserves Prigozhin and at least part of his troops. They won't be dissolved and sent back into the Ukraine meat grinder. They can go back to backing up African dictators in exchange for blood diamonds or whatever. And Russia agreed to it all, hastily, and now they look weak if they go back on it (they look weak anyway for agreeing to it). 

Over the past 24 hours it looks as though Russia has been waffling on their decision - there have been grumblings that Shoigu may be replaced after all, with a possible successor even named, and yesterday the Russian parliament chairman stated publically that the Parliament's opinion is that Wagner shouldn't be dissolved after all. This sounds like a last ditch effort to change their minds and maybe give in to Prigozhin's original goals. Because otherwise, they're losing thousands of the best-trained soldiers they have and potentionally a lot of profit from Wagner's international activities. And they're also pissing off the remaining Wagnerites who will be forced back to the Ukraine front lines as ordinary grunts, with plastic armor and rusty rifles and less pay. 

It feels like they were really caught with their britches down here. They look weak for offering basically no resistance to the Wagner convoy. They look timid for being afraid of it in the first place and tearing up their own roads and throwing air attacks at it. They look cowardly for quickly agreeing to Prigozhin's terms to make his men go away, and giving him permission to export his operation to another nation, robbing them of those forces and profits. And now they look weak and waffling by apparently struggling how to handle the optics of all of this and how to go forward. They're sending out all sorts of mixed messages, including Putin's short speech tonight, where he spoke highly of Wagner, but also said don't rebel, etc. 

And, outside of the aircraft shot down in self-defense, Prigozhin did all this without firing a shot. They didn't raise arms against a single RU soldier along the way. 

What Prigozhin did was WAY better than an armed coup. He checkmated them without firing a shot.

Now, that's not to say that this all can't go wrong for Prigozhin. The story isn't over. But I think these past four days will be studied for a while by analysts, strategiests, political scientists, whatever. It's pretty remarkable.",False,1687827151.0,t3_14j6s09,t1_jpnqf1n,,4,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Russia did that before. From top of my head.

* Donetsk airport: ""Ukraine taken the airport"". Hours later Russia releases a video with occupiers claiming they repelled the attack.
* Even Donetsk: Gun fight in Donetsk city, with video with sound of shots fired.

Also common during Kharkiv/Kherson counter offensive to see tweets like ""Ukraine already at XXX"" (far far from front line, and then tweets ""we repelled the attacks"".

To me that's so much more effective than seizing the Kremlin like so many people thought he should do, which would have been bloody and messy and ultimately would have failed.

Shoigu panicked and sent air attacks (which were shrugged off), RU tore up the highways and destroyed bridges (and an oil depot for some fucking reason), Putin got on TV prematurely calling them traitors, and then Prigozhin rolls up and says, 'What bro? You thought I was gonna hit you? I said I just wanted to talk'. 

And then when his demands to have Shoigu and Gerasimov removed and Wagner left intact weren't met, he pulled out his backup plan, which was to move his loyal Wagnerites out of Russia to Belarus, where they can continue propping up Central African dictatorships in return for diamond mine profits and other natural resources, which will go to Belarus and not Russia. And they'll be out of the Ukraine fight. 

 And Russia is now short thousands of its best trained soldiers. 

And Lukashenko comes across looking strong here, too. Belarus will profit from Wagner operating from there, and now Belarus will receive thousands of soldiers that don't report to Russia anymore, easing the thumb Russia has on the country by however much. I just heard an MSNBC commentator say that Lukashenko may benefit the most from this. 

The Putin admin look like fucking FOOLS from this. Not to mention weak as fuck. They got played, hard. 

Now there are rumors that Shoigu might get the boot after all, and the Russian parliament is calling for Wagner not to be dissolved, which might mean Russia is wavering and might capitulate at the last minute to prevent all this.
