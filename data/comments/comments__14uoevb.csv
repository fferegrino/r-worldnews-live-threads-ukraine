>Russian state-approved media has responded to the 24 June 2023 Wagner Group mutiny in three phases. Outlets were almost certainly initially surprised by the mutiny and were not prepared; Russian TV maintained its usual schedule.

>After the insurrection was defused, Russian state outlets sought to ‘correct’ claims that security forces had been passive. Narratives promoted the idea that President Vladimir Putin had triumphed by thwarting the insurrection, while avoiding bloodshed, and sought to unite the country behind the president.

>Nearly a week later, the state started to play down the significance of Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin and the mutiny, while tarnishing his character. Wagner Telegram channels have largely gone silent, almost certainly due fo state intervention. By contrast, Putin has undertaken unusually prominent public engagements, almost certainly aiming to project strength.

1.) Russian economy is rapidly collapsing as their ability to prop their own economy up with reserves has been erased.  Ruble vs USD now stands at 91.3 Ruble per Dollar.  Just 16 days ago it was at 80 Ruble per Dollar.  Enormous change.

2.)  Russia now has a much large NATO border with no buffer zones, that border will continue to expand.  Russia WILL lose AT LEAST their 2014 occupied Ukrainian Territories.

3.) Chinese Yuan\* is also devaluing rapidly as its Economy teeters on the edge of the biggest real estate bubble in history.

4.) Escalating aggression in the seas around its borders has caused Japan, Philippians, Australia, and Taiwan to lease an enormous amount of land to the United States to build SEVERAL NEW heavily supplied bases.  Most of these bases will be on Islands that will act as unsinkable Carriers protected by both US defenses and the host countries.  Japan is actually in the process of building a few islands China style for this purpose.  All complete with powerful radar and surveillance equipment that gives a much deeper view of what China is doing

These Islands are located at perfectly strategic locations where any and all Chinese ship travel will have to pass by American forces to get anywhere - specifically commercial shipping boats.  Its a full blockade that can be ready at the blink of an eye, completely freezing the Chinese economy.  Worth noting Taiwan sits almost exactly at the center point of all these new bases.

5.)  Australia has paid the USA 300 Billion USD for the right and aide to build a huge number of US class Nuclear Powered Submarines.  This was done to further clog shipping lanes and exponentially expand immense response capabilities should China do the dumb.

Russia began the war with 3,417 tanks available. At the same time, Ukraine had 987, according to The Military Balance for 2023, an annual report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank which looks at military equipment inventories.

While Ukraine's tank fleet has continued to grow, Russia's has been severely depleted.

During the conflict, Ukraine has lost 558 tanks and captured 546, data from open-source outlet Oryx suggests.

Meanwhile, Oryx estimates Russia has lost 2,091 tanks in the war.

I have posted about him many times—starting [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/wwcnkv/shoigu_sidelined/) when Russian opposition media reported that Putin circumvented Shoigu to get reports directly from Teplinsky.

One pro-Ukraine analyst wrote a piece on him last year, essentially characterizing him as the [**only effective commander** on the Russian side](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/vjfcyr/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/idnarh2/), and broke down why he had success in the Lyman campaign which he led [he was later moved to the southern region].


He really made quite a splash with a report submitted directly to Putin which excoriated the Russian command.  Afterwards, [Putin traveled to Genichesk, Kherson region to speak with him directly about it and why Teplinsky drew such conclusions](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12slbap/comment/jh1oz7o/), something that was later [confirmed by the Ukrainian side](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12utzov/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jhd2eda/)

[Ive added the summary below]

He’s been generally considered the most competent among the battlefield command—by fellow Russian commanders, and by Ukrainians, too, as his leadership hasn’t been wrought with the same predictable mistakes as other Russian commanders have had.  It should be noted that Gerasimov’s removal as overseer of the SVO was amongst Prigozhin’s demands. 
____

Teplinsky’s report and Putin subsequently visiting him directly:


*VolyaMedia* analyzed Putin’s trip to occupied territories, here’s some of their findings:

- Despite Kremlin saying trip was 17 April, it was April 12-14. 

- Putin had no MOD Generals with him as entourage. 

- Sources dispute purpose:

  - Officers were being sent to the regional HQ^1 from elsewhere, Putin unexpectedly accompanied. 

  - Second reason,^2 so Putin could speak directly with the commander of the Airborne Forces, Mikhail Teplinsky, who had submitted “a detailed report on the deplorable state of the troops, Gerasimov's wrong tactical decisions, the incorrect use of air assault units, and the poor training of the mobilized, and his recommendations…[including] that the Airborne Forces and special forces units should be immediately switched from assault missions to sabotage missions in order to disrupt preparations for the Ukrainian offensive.”^3  The Report—which aggravated the already-bad relations between Gerasimov and Teplinsky—prompted the [meddlesome] Putin to talk personally with Teplinsky, after reading report 2 months ago.


  - Third reason is a second version of the same Teplinsky saga.^4  After reading Teplinsky’s report in February, but “simply for personal communication with the paratrooper general [Teplinsky], Putin would not have gone to the combat zone [Kherson]. The visit … is connected with the desire to check Gerasimov's latest proposals on the spot. The commander of the Russian grouping, Valery **Gerasimov**, according to our interlocutors, **fears that the measures he has taken to repel the Ukrainian offensive will not save the situation**. Therefore, in early April, he asked Putin for **permission to withdraw troops**—to Crimea and to the territory of the Russian Federation—if the situation completely gets out of control. Putin decided to find out the opinion of the generals [on the ground, regional HQ] who were dissatisfied with Gerasimov—especially Teplinsky—and at the same time listen to the commanders in specific areas.”

It is disheartening to hear all this false information in the West being accepted as facts. This will result in a change in public opinion and, consequently, no weapons for Ukrainians. They need them, obviously, because they are being attacked. Sadly, it is not so obvious anymore, according to some people, including Elon Musk, Lex Fridman's guest Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and others. I am deeply worried about the Ukrainians, so I sent an email to Lex. He probably won't read it, but maybe if more of us send emails and comment on his Twitter and YouTube, we can be heard. I will share what I sent here. We can all use our own words, but we need to counter these guys. Most people just parrot the opinions of the people they look up to. We can all spread the truth to counter this Russian criminal regime. I have also sent emails regarding the spread of these harmful narratives to news publishers, especially those in the Middle East and East Asia, where Russian propaganda is stronger. Here is an example of an email I sent. Feel free to copy parts or use it as inspiration to convey the point effectively.  
""Hi Lex (or anyone who seems uninformed about Ukraine),  
I am an avid listener of your podcast, and I thank you for the countless hours of knowledge I have received.  
As someone with a powerful voice, I have been increasingly worried these past few months about more and more people adopting the narrative that the Ukraine war was provoked by the West, leading to an invasion and attempted takeover (Kyiv offensive) of another country. Regrettably, they rarely point the finger at the elephant in the room. Why is that? We need your help. Please question these people and challenge their claims. Otherwise, they are merely influencing gullible individuals to believe, for example, that Ukraine should not be armed. This will directly result in Ukraine losing lives and their land. The only reason Russia retreated from Kyiv was because they were defeated, but they are still advancing and taking more and more land.  
I hear everyone parroting this 'we provoked Russia' narrative as if it justifies Russia's invasion and ongoing systematic war crimes (these have been documented by the United Nations), which show no signs of stopping. Notice how they rarely point the finger at Russia, the obvious culprit in this whole ordeal—the country that attacked Ukraine, not the other way around. The only thing stopping them is the Ukrainian army. Therefore, they desperately need help and weapons. Ukrainians want to be a free country and are willing to sacrifice everything for it. They rarely speak of the obvious fact that Ukraine does not want to be part of Russia but desires to be an independent country and part of the EU. It's disheartening that these influential voices, including yours, Joe Rogan's, and Elon Musk's, seldom mention this obvious fact. These opinions have the power to sway public opinion and garner support for Ukraine. For Ukrainians, this support means life and death. It's depressing to see how people blindly follow these narratives while the facts are obvious to everyone. You wouldn't give land to an aggressor that invaded, raped, pillaged, and murdered its way through your country. So why should Ukraine be expected to do just that?  
Why should the West be blamed for Russia's invasion and the suffering inflicted upon Ukraine? These people are fighting for their independence, just as they did during the Euromaidan protests.  
Truly, it is disheartening. I sincerely hope you read this message and consider addressing these topics on your podcasts, encouraging your guests to question more and helping to educate people better. It has a profound impact on the lives of those in Ukraine.  
Kind regards,  
We can make a change, guys. There are so many of us. Just a civil and educational email or a comment to those who do not see the full picture.""",False,1688925325.0,t3_14uoevb,t3_14uoevb,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

I think Vilnius and the following Ramstein will be extremely consequential for Ukraine. We've seen hype from all sides. Usually it's just Ukraine saying big things will be announced, but this time around, many other countries are saying the same. They are going to establish the NATO-Ukraine defense council where Ukraine and NATO will be equal members (Stoltenberg quote). NATO membership is ruled out until after the war, but I think this council could be like Ramstein on steroids, where countries can trigger some sort of Article 4 and acknowledging their own jeopardy stemming from the current conflict. Currently, no countries are forced to give, forced to increase production. You have countries like Hungary blocking financial and military aid to Ukraine. Some binding decisions could come from this new council. Anything short of sending troops would be allowed.

Erdogan's change in mood indicates to me that a shift in policy has happened. Almost like they've decided not to engage with Russia at all anymore. Why would he release the Azov commanders? That would make it almost impossible to get anything out of Russia for at least the near future. No agreements or negotiations are really possible when you break a deal like that and humiliate Russia.

So here is what I think happened behind the scenes. Turkey has agreed to the deal proposed by USA to re-enter the F35 program. Turkey will exchange its S-400 for Patriot and the $1.5B payment they already made that was being held by USA for F-35 will finally be unblocked and Turkey might receive jets under an accelerated timetable. Turkey will give some F-16 to Ukraine in exchange for the acceleration of the F-35 jets. Sweden would enter NATO under the same deal.

Ukraine would get S-400 and F-16 in the coming months. Turkey has also agreed to unilaterally extend the grain deal and provide protection to grain ships. I think that Ukraine could also become Turkey's first export customer for their fifth gen fighter (though that is still some time into the future).

At Ramstein, we will see the announcement of the fleet of F-16 for Ukraine. There will be around 90+ jets. 28 from the Netherlands, 38 from Norway and Romania, unknown number from Turkey and 24 from Draken international (which were acquired from Norway and the Netherlands). Norway and Romania will agree to a ring exchange for newer F-16 and/or accelerated F-35 introduction. In the interim, other NATO countries will provide the missing capabilities, just like we are seeing in the Baltics. Draken will receive some ring exchange and compensation. Future decommissioned F-16 will go to Draken.

USA will announce ATACMS for Ukraine. The Netherlands had agreed to purchase 80 ATACMS from the US but canceled their contract early this year because ""Other systems could provide the same capability"" Such systems are from Israel, which we would not expect to give long range missiles to Ukraine. So it makes sense that anything earmarked for the Netherlands could go straight to Ukraine. There is no argument to be made that it would make the US weaker, because they already agreed to sell them to the Netherlands. We know Ukraine will use them responsibly because they've used Storm Shadow responsibly.

Ukraine will receive 100 Merkava tanks from Israel through a ring exchange. We know this is true because TASS has said it's not true. So by definition, it must be 100% true.

In addition, I believe most countries will be donating some heavy stuff, mostly tanks and IFVs. There is no taboo on tanks anymore and countries have had time to repair existing tanks and get them ready. I also expect USA to give 100 Abrams and probably another 100 Bradleys and Strykers to go with that (they donated 32 Bradleys and Strykers just this week).

Finally, we will get a true number on DPICMs, probably in the few 100k.

I also agree with you and others, that lately Putin, Kremlin & Russian army are acting weak, and it could be a reason for the increased activity.

* Russian winter offensive, Bakhmut included, were bleak. Very little progress, with heavy losses.
* Putin was weak during the coup. They could not stop Wagner by force. It showed Kremlin is very fragile.
* Prigozhin is still at large, Garimazov seems to be gone.
* Ukraine has liberated the heights around Bakhmut, and it looks grim for the Russians there.
* In the south there has been slow progress for weeks.
* Ukraine is shaping. Artillery, AA, command posts, ammo/fuel depos, railway hubs, bridges are hit on daily bases. Soldiers are complaining on the lack of artillery and supplies.
* Azov officers released.
* Grain deal continues, with or without Russia.
* More and better weapons to Ukraine.
* Birth rate is back to the level of the 90s.
* Rub in free fall. Russian Central Bank commented on the grim future.

It is just some examples.

Propaganda I've seen here lately.

* Fear mongering. Nuke/wmd threats, Wagner could attack Europe, using nukes. NPP explosives.
* The fake 700000 children deported.
* US is bad for sending cluster weapons.
* We must have peace now and freeze the war. Stop sending weapons.
* Elections interference, eg Netherlands.

Early after the invasion last year, some chess players did write an open letter condemning the war. [https://www.chess.com/news/view/stop-the-war-44-top-russian-players-publish-open-letter-to-putin](https://www.chess.com/news/view/stop-the-war-44-top-russian-players-publish-open-letter-to-putin) (The interview with GM Alexander Grischuk  where he express his thought on the war is well worth watching).

Other players on the war: [https://www.chess.com/news/view/russian-chess-grandmasters-leave-russia](https://www.chess.com/news/view/russian-chess-grandmasters-leave-russia)

Eg:

>Vladimir Fedoseev  
...  
>  
>In the Belgrade Grand Prix, which started three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Russian participants did not play under the Russian flag. On the first day, Fedoseev asked the organizers to remove the flag of the Russian Chess Federation from his board.  
>  
>""My request to play under the FIDE flag had not been processed yet due to an administrative error,"" Fedoseev said. ""Playing under the RCF flag for me means the same as loyalty for the country.""  
>  
>Fedoseev had ""personal reasons"" not to sign the open letter to Putin, but his stance against the war has been clear from the start. He says he could not live in a Russia where a majority is supporting the Russian aggression, which cannot be called war by law.  
>  
>""I cannot imagine what would be my reaction to this,"" he said. ""In Russia you also learn a lot about World War II and the symbolism, but now it looks the same, more or less. At the moment I think that it's not a democratic country. Also, I feel that this is going only worse and worse every day for Russia.""

&#x200B;

>GM Alexey Sarana  
>  
>""I love Russia a lot, but I hate all the political stuff,"" said Sarana. ""What our government is doing now is absolutely disgusting. I cannot accept it, but I cannot do anything about it. But I have no sympathy for this war; all the reasons are absolutely terrible.""  
>  
>The reason Sarana's name is not on the open letter to Putin is simple: he wasn't asked. ""Almost all my friends are chess players, and almost all do not support the war. Everyone is against it—except Karjakin.""

With the situation now being that Ukraine holds the initiative, and with such a massive frontline, it is putting pressure on one of Russia’s consistent and largest weaknesses; logistics.

In a very big generalization, Ukraine has a major advantage being more or less the “inner” side whereas Russia is more surrounding Ukraine’s lines. This allows Ukraine to direct attacks to new directions in very different regions with relatively little effort whereas Russia has to swing their troops and all a lot farther in order to get to each major frontline location.

Ukraine is smart enough to have seen this and so part of this whole offensive that people are whining over for being too slow or unsuccessful is to simply jab at the frontline in various areas. Obviously they’d love to simply break through and roll behind enemy lines, but that’s unrealistic since they’re facing nearly half a years’ worth of fortification buildup from Russia. Instead, Ukraine can put the heat where they feel most ideal, and with their incredible intel + surveillance Ukraine can then make strikes along the logistical corridors with their long-range missiles.

What is this false narrative being spread that they are not?


Because of how they detonate and drops smaller munitions over a larger area, on many more angles from the detonation point, they are MUCH more likely to explode inside the trench or into dugout and hit the soft targets inside them.


If you are struggling to understand why, imagine instead of firing 1 round that either enters or misses the trench, its now firing 70+ each time, that rain down over a huge area from the point of detonation. Imagine the video below, but instead of a plane dropping it, the artillery shell explodes up in the air and rains down the bombs instead. They dont hit the ground then spread, which of course would be ineffective. They are devastating against armor convoys, trenchs or anything really, theres a reason these munitions make up the bulk of the US stockpile and its because of how deadly they are.

And questions of morality are not an objective metric, but a subjective evaluation. And I'm pretty sure such a consensus doesn't exist unless you apply lots of presentism.

Most people can't afford to consider questions of morality, to mangle with their private lives and opportunities. As a German, part of coming to terms with your own identity is to imagine yourself to be an average citizen during the 3rd Reich, and if you honestly ask yourself how much you would be willing to sacrifice for your morality I can guarantee you, that the honest answer for the overwhelming majority of people would be very disillusioning. It's one thing to sacrifice your own life (which would be extraordinarily brave), and another when your actions will have a tremendous negative impact on the lives of your spouse and kids. That's how authoritarianism and totalitarianism operate, they're holding the people who are the most important to you captive.

Certainly, the situation in Russia is less severe, which is why I always cringe at such comparisons, but being arrested for political stuff certainly means trouble as well, and the overwhelming majority of people anywhere will always stay away from trouble.

Sometimes, the damage can just be a derailed track, so it can't move, can be recovered, and new tracks be put on rather easily.

I also work on D11 and D8 dozers and know the process, not that it matters.

My point is that while I generally do like to take ukraine numbers at face value, you do need to focus on destroyed means destroyed and captured, and destroyed also means immobilized. Even if the 4k tank number is true, and I will assume it is, that doesn't mean 4k tanks are entirely unfixably destroyed. Even 5% just being track derailment, which is a normal failure mode for tanks when munitions that target the tracks or other weapons hit the tracks and easily fixable is 200 tanks usable in the future, ukraine likely even captured a lot of Russian tanks by having crews abandon tanks that had track damage and they fix it as well. Not all damage means that the tank will never be used again, nor will it not be used 2 weeks from now.

That's my only point, really.

Edit: Also, no one is saying anyone's lying. Numbers are reported and assumptions are made. Not every body is actually counted you know, and on the flip side sometimes more people die than you counted.

They took military bases and summarily executed 100s of soldiers for the crime of not being Sunni.

See Palmyra, Raqqa, Prophet Yunus mosque for some examples. Women were forced to become sex slaves while their sons were trained to become Jihadis. Simultaneously as this played out, ISIS planned and executed many attacks in the rest of the world, such as in France.

I think this is why Ukraine is betting on Bakhmut. The rest of the frontlines are heavily mined and have multiple levels of fortifications, that Ukraine itself didn't set up at the start of the war due to some of their governors ending up as collaborators.
If Ukraine's gamble works, Russia will be forced to make a choice between their current attempt to encircle Avdiivka or throwing an ungodly number of troops to prevent the shame of losing Bakhmut. 

I also want to point out that land gained with blood is never given back voluntarly. I assure you Russia only left Kherson and Kharkiv because they were untenable positions, plus absolutely no one predicted that Ukraine was going to take either of them. So as long as Ukraine is well supported they cannot be condemned into a stalemate. Of course, avoiding costly mistakes like Kremmina or Svatove is paramount, as I believe that was a major factor in their reduced ability in preventing Wagner and Russian troops from going through the fortification they set up on the path to Bakhmut.

Russia didn’t gain it with blood. That’s the point. They made big flashy advances with almost no casualties, and would have required huge casualties to hold on to them. So like Germany retreating to the Hindenburg Line in 1917, they voluntarily withdrew from territory that had no economic or strategic value to them, in order to economize force and enable a forward defence on the enemy’s terrain. 

Russia has now consolidated its positions and entrenched. They have in effect set the line of territory they intend to hold long term, and if Ukraine can’t retake it those are the lands they will eventually lose. So far, Ukraine has retaken none of it.

The irrefutable proof that this is false is that Russia is attacking in Lyman's direction. Because without Lyman Slovyansk and Kramatorsk are much more difficult to achieve.

The retreat from Kharkiv was also far from optimal, and Ukraine recovered tons of lost equipment.
Losing territory also has an impact on artillery range, allowing Ukraine to strike deeper into occupied territory.   
Economic I can't tell. If you can link a source comparing the poor economic potential of those regions that would be great. 


>Ukraine has never taken territory Russia was determined to hold.  

Except Russia was determined to hold Kherson, and as I mentioned they blew up the bridges to make that position untenable. When Sorovikin was appointed then they decided to withdraw. It wasn't a good will gesture nor was it out of disinterest for the region.


>That’s exactly how Haig would have described the Somme, and for similar outcomes in terms of territory gained.
