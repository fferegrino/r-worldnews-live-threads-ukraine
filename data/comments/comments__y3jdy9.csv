Very interesting article. Among other things, it disproves the argument of Russian trolls that a majority of the world supports Russia and only westerners don't (using support in places like India to justify that idea).

> Only minorities in 25 countries around the world – ranging from 3%-6% in the UK and Spain to 22% in India and 23% in Saudi Arabia – believe the world would be a safer place if Russia achieved its aims in Ukraine.

Also only 37% of India would support recognising Crimea in return for Russia withdrawing from everything else, and that's the highest percentage of any country listed.

Many Asian and African countries are unfortunately more apathetic than the west on this and have large pro-Russian minorities, but the majority still seems to be against what Russia is doing. Later on in the article you can see some have a large number of people blaming the west, like India and Indonesia, but I think this shows that doesn't mean they're majority pro-Russia.",1665789572.0,1665788694.0,t3_y3jdy9,t3_y3jdy9,,0,67,0,67,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 14 October 2022


- In the last three days, pro-Russian forces have made tactical advances towards the centre of the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast. Elements of 2nd Army Corps, the pro-Russia militia of the Luhansk region, likely advanced into the villages of Opytine and Ivangrad to the south of the town.

- There have been few, if any, other settlements seized by regular Russian or separatist forces since early July. However, forces led by the private military company Wagner Group have achieved some localised gains in the Donbas: Wagner likely remains heavily involved in the Bakhmut fighting.

- Russia likely views seizing Bakhmut as a preliminary to advancing on the Kramatorsk-Sloviansk urban area which is the most significant population centre of Donetsk Oblast held by Ukraine. Russia continues to prosecute offensive operations in central Donbas and is, very slowly, making progress. However, its overall operational design is undermined by the Ukrainian pressure against its northern and southern flanks, and by severe shortages of munitions and manpower.",False,1665730593.0,t3_y3jdy9,t3_y3jdy9,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

Day 233 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they fired a lot of missiles in the direction of Kharkiv from Belgorod again. First ones were fired at 1:10pm, there were 4 in total and all of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv, we don’t know what was hit, but presumably they were targeting civilians again. This time there were no blackouts after the explosions, so they definitely weren’t aiming at substation, or maybe they did and just missed.

Then something weird started happening at 7pm, as there were 10 missile launches from Belgorod, but none of the missiles made it to Kharkiv. It could have been their air defense firing at something incoming in their direction, but then again, they use their air defense to shell Kharkiv and it malfunctions extremely often, so even if it was AA, we don’t know what they were using it for this time.

Though their thermal power plant did suddenly blow up, so it could have been either from one of their missiles malfunctioning and falling on it, or it could have been also done by our missiles or artillery. The hit was very precise and the explosion was caught on video, so I’m not sure that it was from a failed missile launch.

Russian telegram channels immediately started saying that “the Ukrainian Nazis are shelling Belgorod *with western AA systems.*” They seriously said that, some were even saying that we used *NASAMS* to do it, which we don’t even have yet, and even if we did, do they not understand that AA systems are not *usually* used to hit ground targets? Their S-300 being repurposed to do so is an outlier, not the norm. It was hilarious to read nonetheless, yeah we just got new air defense systems, so what do we do with them? Of course we start by bombing *ground targets* in Belgorod with our *AA missiles*, yeah that makes perfect sense.",1665794603.0,1665794421.0,t3_y3jdy9,t3_y3jdy9,,0,120,0,120,1,0,

It staged a “people’s uprising” in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, using Russian soldiers (please look at Girkin’s biography for an obvious example) and paid-off local thugs. Prior to that there was no “Donbas” separatism in the region, and there wouldn’t have been any talk of anything of that kind had Russia not shipped in its thugs and soldiers and started stirring shit up. 


>Ukraine spent 8 years defending its territories — and doing everything to avoid harming civilians in the process. In many, many cases, Ukraine continued paying the people living under temporary occupation their pensions and social support — because despite what Russia claims, those are our people, and we care about them. 


>Meanwhile, Russia did everything in its power to spread chaos and terror — it opened up literal concentration camps for the people who didn’t want to be part of the “Russian world” (example: Izolyatsiya), it killed off its own henchmen when they got too independent, and constantly tried to provoke the Ukrainian army into an escalation. It spread idiotic lies about how Ukrainians were “bombing the Donbas”, while simultaneously preparing to start a full-scale of invasion and, well, level the remaining cities of Donbas with the ground. 


>They screeched about “protecting the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine” and then started a full-scale invasion and destroyed Mariupol — a city filled with predominantly Russian-speaking people! — and unleashed pure horror on Kharkiv, another large, old city, also filled with predominantly Russian-speaking people. 


>Russia started spreading horror stories about Azov, making it out to be a far-right unit specifically made for the slaughter of Russian-speaking Ukrainians… despite the fact that the majority of soldiers in Azov are, in fact, Russian-speaking Ukrainians of all backgrounds, political beliefs and ethnicities. 


>And while Russia spread these absurd horror stories, their own swastika-toting, civilian-torturing Wagner mercenaries proudly throw the Nazi salute in photos and openly talk about their desire to slaughter Ukrainians by the thousands. And as Russia spreads its propaganda all over the African continent, cynically play-acting as an “anti-colonial power”, these same Wagner mercenaries slaughter entire African villages and rob gold mines in order to buy more weapons and kill yet more civilians


>In conclusion, fuck Russia and fuck all the terror and pain it keeps bringing into the world.

The Ukrainian military says it has destroyed a significant amount of Russian weaponry in a strike against a railway hub in the eastern region of Luhansk.  
  
It also said the Russian had suffered substantial losses in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk.  
  
But in its operational update Friday, the General Staff made no mention of fighting around Bakhmut in Donetsk, where Russian forces appear to have made some gains in recent days.  
  
But the General Staff did say that Russia “continues to focus its efforts on attempts to implement its plans to reach the administrative border of Donetsk region.”  
  
The General Staff said that “according to preliminary information, in the area of the railway station in the town of Antratsyt \[Luhansk\] our soldiers destroyed a significant part of the enemy’s weapons and military equipment transported by rail. The amount and nature of damage is being specified.”  
  
CNN is unable to confirm the attack.  
  
More on Ukraine’s counteroffensive: In recent weeks, Ukraine has targeted Russian supply lines in Luhansk as it seeks to build on its successful offensive in neighboring Kharkiv.  
  
In other areas, according to the General Staff, some 150 Russian soldiers had been killed and about 100 injured by Ukrainian attacks in Khlibodarivka (Donetsk region), Tokmak (Zaporizhzhia region) and Tokarivka (Kherson region).  
  
The General Staff claimed that in the city of Kherson, Russian forces had seized 13 barge-type vessels for the transportation of personnel and equipment across the Dnipro River. Ukrainian long-range rocket attacks have made most bridges across the river impassable.   
  
It also claimed that three S-300 units had been destroyed. S-300 missiles have been causing devastating damage in central Ukraine, especially in Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/10/14/ukraine-infrastructure-damage/

Ukrainian officials are urging people across the country to conserve energy and warning of a difficult winter after Russia pummeled critical infrastructure. This week, dozens of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones struck power plants and substations, cutting electricity, heat and hot water in many cities and forcing factories in some areas to temporarily close.

The Washington Post identified eight energy facilities across six regions that were damaged or destroyed on Monday and Tuesday, using pictures and videos shared on social media along with satellite imagery and fire tracking data. They provide a sense of the scale of Russia’s attack, and the impact on major cities from Lviv in the west, to Kryvyi Rhi in the east.

Power is back on, for now. On Thursday, Ukrainian officials cautioned that efforts to fully rebuild the energy infrastructure could take months.
“This heating season will be very difficult,“ Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukraine’s electric transmission company, Ukrenergo, said during a television interview. He warned that future Russian attacks on the electrical grid were expected and that the utility may need to impose scheduled reductions in service.

Lots of questions about Starlink, and lots of evasive answers. Bear in mind that this whole mess might just be psyops intended to accomplish a specific purpose in regards to Russia or other interested adversaries.

Interesting that there was a question about another PDA, Singh said wasn't aware of a new one, but a new one was announced a little later. They definitely keep a tight wrap on announcements.

> Fake callers trick Ukrainian foreign minister  

>Pro-Kremlin comedians used a fake phone call to elicit explosive statements about Crimea and warfare from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""If you ask me who is blowing something up in Crimea or Belgorod, I will tell you in private, yes it was us,"" Kuleba said in the phone call, which was widely circulated in Russian media. The Russian caller on the other end had posed as ex-U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul. Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey was already fooled with a similar trick in June.  

>In Russia, Ukraine is blamed for the explosion on the Crimean bridge. Kyiv has not officially claimed responsibility. However, Kuleba's statement is likely to be interpreted in Moscow as an admission of guilt for the damage to the bridge.

Texas Instruments, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and all the rest are turning big fat profits, yet we still celebrate the great contribution of their weapons.

Few, if any, technologies have been more critical than Starlink, since it allows the Ukrainian army to communicate, coordinate and control drones with great flexibility in a wartorn country. However, instead of using this dependency for profit maximization, SpaceX has been donating terminals and taken care of service.

That other actors have contributed by paying for many of the terminals does not negate the other donations and the monthly service costs worth tens of mio. of USD, which could grow exponentially as Ukraine wants to ramp up.

11-Putin is both extremely pragmatic and extremely not pragmatic.  His big ideas are rigid, conspiratorial, and over-emotional in his DIRECTION, but his means of achieving those are extremely pragmatic, open, patient, and flexible.

14-Putin believes he is superior to the majority of other leaders, and he sees only winners and losers.  There is no such thing as mutually beneficial negotiations.  Being willing to give up portions of something are either a sign of weakness or a stalling tactic to get the rest later when you are stronger.

15-Putin considers all former areas under Russian Empire control as “territory”.  Not nations, not states, but  rogue areas, under the evil influence.  He sees them as temporarily “lost” territories that should be managed as current Russian Federation’s existing autonomous regions.

5f63c2c10b4e52c0acf22e1374110c90,y3jdy9,iscg82j,"> Martingale strategy

A martingale is a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th-century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins the stake if a coin comes up heads and loses if it comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. Thus the strategy is an instantiation of the St. Petersburg paradox.[1]

Since a gambler will almost surely eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy is certain to make money for the gambler provided they have infinite wealth and there is no limit on money earned in a single bet. However, no gambler has infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets can bankrupt unlucky gamblers who chose to use the martingale, causing a catastrophic loss. Despite the fact that the gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy, the gambler's expected value remains zero because the small probability that the gambler will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with the expected gain. In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house's edge. Additionally, as the likelihood of a string of consecutive losses is higher than common intuition suggests, martingale strategies can bankrupt a gambler quickly.

I admit that it has been a few years since satcomms class, but we spent a whole unit on the economic side of various satellite systems, and the one common factor for basically every system - the one which makes it economically viable in the long term to spend $100M on a launch - is that you don't really incur many additional costs to operate the system once it is in orbit.  
  
If there were no terminals in Ukraine, the starlink transponders would simply be empty during that transit period.  It's not like Ukraine is denying finite capacity to other paying users.  And if the system is designed properly, operating the transponders at a higher duty cycle should not significantly decrease the lifetime of the satellites (this limiting factor is typically station keeping fuel, not elecontrics).  Real operating expenses would then be maintaining the ground segment, which controls the constellation, the costs of the gateway systems, the peering costs for the ISP, and the IT labor overhead of whatever system management is specific for Ukraine.  I am struggling to come up with any way that these can add up to the $400M/m he is claiming - indeed, a large portion of Ukraine's application usage likely requires no internet peering at all.  IT overhead is probably the largest factor, but not to the tune of $400M/m.    
  
What I suspect he means is doing is adding up the expected revenue which could otherwise be derived from each ground terminal if it were operated under the highest tier service package, while ignoring the marketing value of the deployment.  I get that the company needs to be making money and likely has per-transponder-per-terminal revenue goals they would like to to hit, but I still think his accounting is misleading.

And frankly, he assumes everyone else is the same.

>Rule 14:  Putin believes he is superior to the majority of other leaders, and he sees only winners and losers.  There is no such thing as mutually beneficial negotiations.  Being willing to give up portions of something are either a sign of weakness or a stalling tactic to get the rest later when you are stronger.

>Rule 15:  Putin considers all areas under former Russian Empire control as “territory”.  Not nations, not states, but  rogue areas, under the evil influence of foreign powers.  He sees them as temporarily “lost” territories that should be managed as current Russian Federation’s existing autonomous regions are managed.  He literally does not believe that these are “non-Russian” regardless of the population makeups.

There is no legitimate argument where Crimea was Russian between 1991 (when Ukraine voted for independence from the USSR) and 2014.

Musk checks a lot of boxes that foreign intelligence services (not just Russia) would want to manipulate: richer than God, zillions of internet sycophants, narcissism, history of erratic/impuslive behavior, concerned with public image, etc. All of those things fit Trump too. He doesn't have to literally be on the payroll, the kompromat can be something a lot less salacious than The Pee Tape™....and yet you'll still hear something like the 1783 reference coming out of an American's mouth.

OK, I know this isn't Lord of the Rings, but I have been thinking about this speech from South Park a lot. Because Principle Victoria is right, the cancer will take everything. So you must be prepared to fight it. That means sacrificing your hair, your strength, injecting poison directly into your body because if you aren't willing to do that, the cancer will happily take everything it wants from you.

And the thing about cancer is, cancer is stupid. It will die without you, but it doesn't care. Its only goal is to spread and take and take more and more from you.

> Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!
> spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
> a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
> Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

> With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

> Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

> Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.",False,1665726414.0,t3_y3jdy9,t1_is973o8,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

 A HIMARS vehicle can load a pod in 5 to 10 minutes.  In theory just one, a solo HIMARS system can launch the entire production of missiles in under one hour.  In practice they like to drive around between shots.  But still, just one crew can fire all the missiles before lunch.  

Added HIMARS lets them be spread out across the front.  They are long range weapons but Ukraine is a big country.  There is an intimidation factor.  If the Russians knew there was only one HIMARS they could be confident that nothing would be incoming for at least 5 to 10 minutes after a volley.  

For USA there is usually an amphibious assault ship or airlift involved.  Sending both a truck and a HIMARS would take up space and require support for the truck driver.  HIMARS is its own supply truck.  The marines have hundreds of them.  

With 20 HIMARS Ukraine could concentrate 10 in one place.  The same number of hits per week in the war.  But now there might be 60 missiles in flight overhead all at once.  More if we add missiles from the MLRS units.  That might be disturbing if it landed behind you.",False,1665797144.0,t3_y3jdy9,t1_isczr0h,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Almost everyone else (including most commentor on Reddit, that probably didn't read the original) are spinning this as a reaction to Musk's recent tweets. But this all happened way before that.

What happened just now is that someone at the Pentagon leaked this information, just after a ton of publicity about Musk's tweeting about the war. It feels like an intentional choice to try and make him look bad (or worse) and a ton of media sources are playing right in to it.

For starters it'd heavily depend on where you land them, the south of Crimea isn't actually that important if you want to cut supplies. It's mostly the eastern part that matters in tgat regards. Kerch specifically, as that's where most ferries go, not to mention the bridge. Or you could focus on the railway and highway coming from Kerch by going for Vladislavovka and Primorski.

The big bloody problem, would be getting an actually large force there. Because you need to get past Sevastopol. Which is the main Russian naval base in Crimea. Meaning it'd be rather easy for Russia to intercept an Ukrainian fleet. And Russia does have a sizeable black sea fleet. It's why Ukraine has basically been unable to use their naval forces and ships.
And nowadays it's basically impossible to do any preparation for this without the Russians noticing, meaning they could prepare too.

Second problem would be supplying that force in the event you manage to land all of it. Here the Russian navy would again be a massive problem. And a big enough force to be an issue for Russia and not get easily overwhelmed, would need a lot of resources to last. Remember, Crimea is big. It'd take a long time to take all of it if Russians don't surrender en masse.

Third problem, the force send would have effectively no room to maneuver unless it is extremely successful and manages to take a large chunk of territory.

Fourth problem, they'd need a lot of anti air ir they'd get murdered by Russian aviation. Which is added to the supply problem. Same goes for artillery who'd have an easy time firing at the Ukrainian force because those would likely not have equipment to deal with that easily.

But yes, it would be possible to significantly reduce supply flow into Crimea. It'd likely still be possible however, albeit in smaller amounts.
However simply blowing up the Kerch bridge fully, and getting long range artillery at the sea of Azov coast would also result in this.
It is also not necessary to cut off supplies entirely, reducing the flow enough has essentially the same effect.


Honestly it'd probably be better to send small teams of saboteurs to destroy the railway network there.

Musk is a defense contractor.  The fact that he sounds like Oleg Deripaska is of great concern to the U.S. defense community.  Musk is also likely willfully violating ITAR, which puts his control over SpaceX and Starlink in serious jeopardy.

At this point, there is certainly every reason to believe that there is an open counterintelligence investigation into his actions over the past week or so.  People saying that Musk won't face any consequences due to his immense wealth don't understand the power of the USG.

The (relatively well supplied and trained) Russian forces there throw a ton of materiel and people at the Ukrainian lines and gain a few hundred yards at great cost (to both sides). The Ukrainians defend and fall back in a way that makes the Russians pay heavily for their small gains. They then counterattack as the opportunities arise, and the long term gains are very small at enormous cost to Russian forces. This is one of the few spearheads of what's left of serious Russian military power on the ground and it's being very effectively blunted.

The Ukrainians are smart to defend that region rather than throw a lot of forces there to attack a strong force all out. They're making good gains for less cost to the north and the south-west of that front.  Better to stick to two fronts of advance and make the Russians pay for their small gains near Bakhmut

They can just slow the Russian advance down to a crawl there and let them waste resources they then can't use elsewhere. Soon enough Ukraine will be able to flank them from the north (and maybe even from the south as well if the front in Kerson Oblast collapses badly enough) and then it will be very much game over. It might take a month or two before they're even in a position to consider trying it but as things look at the moment it might well come before the Russians attempt sending in a ton more troops, early next year

When it does come, expect it to be carefully planned, well-resourced, sudden and devastating to the forces that remain there.",1665793790.0,1665793358.0,t3_y3jdy9,t1_isct22n,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Slight correction: they work to turn the middle class against the lower class. That was the point of the Fox News cycle in the '00s.

The constant division sown convinced them to vote against their own interests.

 >The Battle of Taranto took place on the night of 11–12 November 1940 during the Second World War between British naval forces, under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, and Italian naval forces, under Admiral Inigo Campioni. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft ship-to-ship naval attack in history, employing 21 Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious in the Mediterranean Sea. The attack struck the battle fleet of the Regia Marina at anchor in the harbour of Taranto, using aerial torpedoes despite the shallowness of the water.

Starlink does not statically allocate 1% of the throughput to one satellite , let alone one of the spot beam if there’s 100 users. The ELI5 is , Starlink uses a combination of burst time plans and beam hopping slots in conjunction with a traffic and resource planning manager to allocate everything.  It’s also important to note these are regenerative payloads and not the traditional bent pipes you see on most GEO systems (where you’d need to reserve a channel on a spot beam) 

They’d also have different SLAs for different customers and im 95% sure these commercial plans are best effort with a EIR given. If you want a CIR you pay through the teeth for it and not the $120 per month they are quoting. 

For the most part cable or fibre is better in built up areas but if you’re looking for a low latency defined paths a LEO-based internet service is a better choice. Two prime examples of this are financial markets where you want the latency and defence communication networks ( such as what is needed for the command and control sites the USAF is flying FORTE11/12 from) where you want to control the entire path.

Apparently the hardware is different, but the hardware in Ukraine now is the consumer + business type, the terminals cost $1300 and $2500 respectively, and have already been paid for. 

Even if the top tier subscription would add more bandwidth and reliability, the question is if that is even needed in many cases. So using that number is absolutely fucking nuts.

Lastly, **it all runs on the same network**, all these subscriptions. Best you can hope for is that traffic tagged from a higher tier has some type of QoS tag that gives it preference over other traffic. But that only become a real issue if there is congestion on the network. However, that $4500 does not represent actual incurred costs of the service, it represents virtual lost revenue.

Here:  The Starlink website.  [Starlink](https://www.starlinkhardware.com/starlink-prices/)  

20k Units.  At 600 per unit, the full cost of 20,000 units is $12,000,000.  USG and other countries covered 80% of that, as per the article you just linked.  That's $9,600,000 for those units covered by USG, minus the cost of the units provided by SpaceX which comes out to $7.2 million.  

Article also claims SpaceX has covered 80% of costs for service.  20k terminals costs a total of $1.2 million per month according to this article.  According to the article, pricing for Starlink in Ukraine is just $60 USD.  That's $960,000 per month for SpaceX.  Assuming that $60 is a profitable price for them, who knows how much the USG is really being gouged?

So, no, I suppose if there are really 20k operating terminals in Ukraine, that we have not fully paid for 20 months.  But it's going to be really hard to defend his pricing model and any claims that he is being philanthropic here.

I don't think that's true. Public perception of Musk has switched significantly in the last two to three years already, and this only accelerates that shift. My social cirkel consists mostly of techies who really admired him, already his political stances did not help him there, but the Ukraine comments have pushed people over the edge.

This used to be his ""core audience"". These are the people that follow SpaceX developments and watch launches online. These are the early adopters that drive Tesla's and have Starlink internet at home. These were the people telling the rest of society about how great those products were from a position of trust and authority. Every technical person supports their friends and family in buying choices and they get asked for advice a lot. If a techie drives a Tesla, people in their cirkel will assume it's good. Making those people your *detractors* is an enormous problem. We're certainly not quite there, but I have noticed a marked shift. Used to be that criticisms of Musk were not heard, now there is a lot of discussion in tech cirkels regarding him - and it's not trending in the right direction fro him either.

Such a shift does not become visible fast as the general public tends to be much less tuned in, and it will take some years for these new detractors to influence the general public, but once that proces has started it's almost impossible to undo.

If Musk keeps going this way, I would not be surprised if in a few years he will have to step back from a managing role in his businesses.",1665754459.0,1665754190.0,t3_y3jdy9,t1_isa9240,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

What I'm talking about is not a ""unit"" of a professional army that actually uses this army on a regular basis — the number of which, prior to this war, you could count on one hand. I'm talking of mandatory training of conscripts in an army which has zero expectations of actually using those conscripts in any serious conflict.

What do you reckon the drill officers were supposed to do to us, other than shouting, in a normal western democracy? They have zero power at the end of the day, as long as you don't do anything illegal.

A place like Russia, with an army of supposedly 1M active personnel (minus 100k or so since February), has a core of a few tens of thousands of actual professional combat troops that they would have used in their various international adventures, like Afghanistan, Chechnia, Georgia, Syria etc.

Well, clearly that wasn't the army's decision.

Right. So how did they manage then to invade Afghanistan and suppress it for the best part of a decade (not successfully, sure, but the US and UK didn't far any better just recently, right?), how did they manage to help out Assad to a point where he managed to beat off the insurgency, how did they manage to invade and hold Crimea since 2014, how did they then manage to invade and occupy an area 1/5th the size of France? 

Did it work out? No, obviously not. But I'd argue that hadn't delayed their original ""three day special military operation"" strategy until after the Olympics (allegedly, to appease China), they might have succeeded to take Kyiv because they wouldn't have got stuck in the thawing mud.

What happened since then has laid bare the myth of Russia being a military superpower. But that myth wasn't held by anyone in military circles anyway, because at the end of day Russia's economy was the size of roughly Italy's pre war, and it was well known that most of their equipment and military doctrine was out of date and out of service.

Syria was a much smaller scale conflict than the war in Ukraine, easy to look reasonably competent in small doses. And in both places they were fighting people that mostly had assault rifles and no heavy weapons at all. No air force, no large air defense systems other than MANPADS, no artillery, no tanks. Look what happened to Wagner in Syria when they tried to assault a base protected by the US, they took hundreds of casualties apparently.

And speaking of thirty years ago that's when that story was from Greece. My buddy from Greece originally who has had family go through it in the early 2000's has told me things had gotten better, still underfunded and stupid sometimes but I think they would have said something if food wasn't provided. I wonder if being a democracy people did complain and eventually politicians were pressured into making it better....

Anyway you are assigning a level of competence to the Russian army that they clearly do not deserve and still trying to argue they're not so bad compared to other armies despite the scale of corruption they clearly have.",False,1665745487.0,t3_y3jdy9,t1_is9txj7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
