*The Armed Forces of Ukraine retained the ability to make precision strikes against targets deep inside the aggressor’s grouping. Most probably, both shellings of the Chornobayivka airfield (on 15 and 18 March) were carried out with Tochka-M ballistic missiles from the Zaporizhzhia region, which forced the Russian side to accelerate its actions and launch strikes in the direction of that city, as well as search for and destroy the remaining Ukrainian operational-tactical missile launchers.*

*The Ukrainian effectiveness in destroying command posts and eliminating senior Russian commanders is noteworthy . . .  which is the result of close cooperation between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the US Army’s reconnaissance units. The defenders are supported by, among others, electronic reconnaissance aircraft, which provide the Ukrainian army with real-time information, without which such significant successes in attacking enemy command structures would be impossible.* 

*American intelligence also helps evade Russian strikes. However, the Ukrainian army’s shrinking arsenal of precision-guided means of destruction limits its ability to use this kind of support.*

a6eabe054086acb2122a1ec1bdfd6e38,tj2zp9,i1iuqvk,"Makariv is liberated. If you weren't following the locations here, this is about 30k west of Iprin. Part of the 40 mile convoy was along this road, and many of those failed bridge crossing attempts happened to the north of this road between Stroyanka (along this road) and Iprin to the north. Units from the convoy dispersed into the treelines in this area as well. This is quite a major victory, as this is the furthest west the invaders have been pushed since the first few days. This was the group that entered through Belarus.

Yesterday it was reported they were unsure if there were troops south of highway from the attempt to circle south. Seems like there were a few as there are hotspots south of highway, but seem to be dealt with. 


Seems the counteroffensive is faring quite well in the north. The rest of the units in this area are between this road and the highway to the north from what I can tell. The area is farm and woodlands, and this is where Russia has dug in a bit. Many many hotspots in this area, even in last 24 hours. Some of this could be farms and grass burning, but undoubtedly Russian forces have taken fire as far back as the wood southeast of Borodyanka. 

Judging by the hotspots, the fighting has moved 20-30k away from Kyiv now and a very clear front has emerged, likely from UA artillery. These troops have faced some of the worst logistical issues as well, so their capacity to return fire may be somewhat limited. 

The hotspots on firms can also result from grass fires ignited by GRADs, but I suspect grad supply is limited for Russia in this area. 

There are signs of fighting in Iprin still, but they are much smaller pockets. And they are further from Kyiv than a week ago. The fighting will likely move into the area between Borodyanka and Makariv now, as there are still Russian troops there. The fighting around hostemel airport has stopped, with only sign of activity in the woods to the north. The original maxar pictures were along the airport ring road and surrounding area. These places came under heavy attack, after which they dispersed into the countryside.

The northwest attack has been... I don't want to say repulsed.... but significantly reduced, and it is now ua forces making gains with Russia on defence. Much less going on in the northeast of Kyiv, with some shelling of russian troops. Ukraines forces seem to have stopped that advance for now, but the main counter offensive is on the northwest. 

Seems Russian control is a bit more staggered to the northeast as well, with fighting happening well into ""Russia controlled"" territory. 

With supplies being particularly difficult for Russia around Kyiv, it seems a matter of time before ua pushes the northwest front further back and liberates some of the smaller towns on the western outskirts. If they are successful, they will push the western artillery out of range of the Kyiv city center.

Edit: Spelling

Edit2:
I would not be surprised if UA focuses on Borodyanka (north of Makariv) in the coming days even over Irpin. If some maps are to be believed, if ua forces push North from Makariv and east from the ua territory around borodyanka, the Russian forces between borodyanka and Iprin could be effectively encircled. There are significant hotspots in Borodyanka in last 12 hours, and seems area has been hit be shells or rockets. If this is retaken, Russian forces arrayed between iprin and borodyanka would be cut off from behind. There only way out would either remaining forces recapturing borodyanka, or to the North where the second part of the force lies near dymer. This could prove difficult though as topographically the North seems easier to isolate, and few routes. The quick advance left them very vulnerable to the head being pinched off from supporting forces.",1647868369.0,1647866427.0,t3_tj2zp9,t3_tj2zp9,,0,119,0,119,0,0,

(that don't represent the true left):

11 Ukrainian political parties suspected of collaborating with Russian invaders have been suspended until martial law ends. On social media we can see a lot of false interpretation of this event as of president Zelensky made a fascist turn and banned main left-wing parties.

* Opposition Platform — For Life: An ultra-conservative party that spreaded conspiracy theories and hatred towards LGBT. Its cooperation with the occupiers is so undisguised that we don't need to mention it once again. In essence, OpFF was the main agent of Russia's influence.

* Sharij's Party: The leader of the party is an outspoken Nazi who hates Roma, Muslims, blacks, homosexuals, and everyone whom the Nazis are supposed to hate. At the same time, he is fighting 'Ukrainian Nazism' led by president Zelensky who is ethnical Jew.

* Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine: Nazbol vortex, religious fundamentalists, racists and Russian ultranationalists. Aesthetically it was a cheap cosplay of North Korea. At the end of the party's life, it simply supported pro-Russian presidential candidates.

* Socialist Party of Ukraine: Party was captured by OpFL member Ilya Kiva. The former leader Alexander Moroz moved to Belarus to glorify the wisdom of dictator Alexander Lukashenko, and the former ideologist moved to the occupied Crimea and accepted Russian citizenship.

* Opposition bloc: Former zealots of fugitive pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who begged Vladimir Putin to bring troops to Ukraine to suppress the 2014 revolution. A party of corrupt officials and obvious collaborators.

* The other parties — Nashi, Left Opposition, Union of Left Forces, State, Socialists, Vladimir Saldo Bloc — have never been real political actirs and occasionally emerged during the election as spoilers (except of Saldo who ended as an undisguised collaborator).

The Ukrainian left had no contact with them, and I assume that the parties were controlled by the head of this ultra-conservative collaborationism.

Martial law is a time of tough decisions. In addition, I personally would not call temporary suspension of collaborating parties as something brutal. This is not imprisonment or extrajudicial executions.

At the same time, the Ukrainian left — the real left, not the red-brown, bloody shit — is currently fighting against Russian fascism or helping the front.

Point by point translation from the Twitter thread:

>”Some Chinese demand China to follow the West and condemn Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is naive.”

>”Let me be candid today and explain the strategic importance of Russia to China. On the surface level, China and Russia support each other diplomatically, on Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, HongKong. But more importantly, is our back to back strategic alliance.”

>”China, rather than Russia, is America’s major strategic competitor. America’s focus now is on Russia, but as Mike Pence said, give it some time they will refocus on China. And when that day comes, we will thank Russia for being our ally, or at least being neutral.”

>”Russia’s war takes it to the forefront of competition with the US, temporarily replacing China, giving us breathing space to regroup after Trump’s brutal trade war. Two powers resisting US hegemony is better than one.”

>”A no-limit partnership with Russia will have strong deterrence effect on US policy, making it harder for US to move for final showdown with China, with Russia’s supply of energy, food and other raw materials.”

>”If war breaks out in Taiwan Strait or South China Sea, China’s conventional capability can already surpass US. With Russia’s hostile nuclear force, it will be difficult for US to leverage its nuclear deterrence against China.”

>”A strategic alliance btw Russia and China is mutually beneficial and reinforcing, providing deterrence against Japan and India.”

>”If US can drive a wedge btw Russia and China, Putin will face certain defeat, and China will be next. We will go back to the old days of being anti-Russia and anti-US at the same time.”

>”Some say why not take the chance to repair relations with US? Its goal for Russia is to disarm, but its goal for China is to completely stop our development and prosperity, make us a client state like Japan and Korea, buy its weapons, and remain only a cheap source of product.”

>”China will avoid conflict with US not proactively challenge US, but will use our power to force US to accept peaceful coexistence. **Russia is the most important partner to achieve this goal. That’s why we can’t abandon Putin during this war. This is in our long term interest.”**

There's been many reports in the past several days of Belarusian military convoys moving toward the Ukraine border. This morning another convoy of vehicles were headed to the same area.

ec8c2b032da541b261dd28dd52193b2d,tj2zp9,i1js80e,"I got bored and decided to calculate the minimum casualties based on only the vehicles that Oryx has photographic evidence of being destroyed. 

Oryx's list which only those with photographic evidence so keep in mind this a BARE bare minimum.  
[https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html)

**TL;DR to start:**

**Minimum casualties based on photo evidence (itself a minimum) of destroyed vehicles:**

**4053**

**Maximum casualties based on that same minimum, assuming no trucks carrying infantry and no deployed infantry outside of vehicles:**

**9267**

Russian tank crews have at least 3 people:

Tanks (263, of which destroyed: 109, damaged: 4, abandoned: 39, captured: 111)

Expected minimum given this (Just destroyed)?

327

Maximum (all crews of abandoned/captured killed truth for photo provable is between):

789

BMPs hold 11 people (Russia is known for overpacking them, too so that's low end there are BMPs in the next two categories):

  
Armoured Fighting Vehicles (173, of which destroyed: 74, abandoned: 34, captured: 65):

Expected minimum given this?  
Only destroyed:  
814  
Maximum from photos (all crews of abandoned/captured killed truth for photo provable is between):  
1903

  
Infantry Fighting Vehicles (248, of which destroyed: 123, damaged: 2, abandoned: 31, captured: 89)  


Expected minimum given this?

Only destroyed:

1353

Maximum from photos (all crews of abandoned/captured killed truth for photo provable is between):

2728

  
BTRs (most of the APCs) hold 10+ people:  
Armoured Personnel Carriers (77, of which destroyed: 24, abandoned: 14, captured: 39)

Minimum:

240

Maximum: 

770

Russian MRAPs hold 16+troops a piece:

Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles (12, of which destroyed: 4, abandoned: 3, captured: 5)

Minimum:

64

Maximum:

192

GAZ tigrs (most of the destroyed) have 4-7 soldiers, so I'll assume 5 for these purposes:

Infantry Mobility Vehicles (57, of which destroyed: 30, damaged: 2, abandoned: 5, captured: 18)

Minimum:

150

Maximum:

785

The most common type of destroyed self-propelled artillery is the 2S19 Msta-S which have 5 person crews:

 Self-Propelled Artillery (41, of which destroyed: 10, abandoned: 13, captured: 17)

Minimum:

50

Maximum:

205

Most common type of MLRS destroyed is the BM-21 'Grad' which have 3 member crews:

Multiple Rocket Launchers (30, of which destroyed: 14, abandoned: 4, captured: 12)

Minimum:

42

Maximum:

90

Only two types here so I'll just go by individual crew counts:

Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns (9, of which destroyed: 5, abandoned: 3, captured: 1):

minimum:

20

Maximum:

53

Most common here are Pantsir-S1s and Buks which have a crew of 3-4, I'll go down to 3.

Surface-To-Air Missile Systems (39, of which destroyed: 19, damaged: 1, abandoned: 7, captured: 12):

minimum:

57

Maximum:

117

Fixed winged aircraft, I'll just count 1 per:

Aircraft (15, of which destroyed: 14, damaged: 1)

14 killed/captured, since we know the one was on russian propaganda.

Helicopters are... hard since there's a lot of variables (some are troop transports) and we know a lot of them were destroyed on the runway, so I won't add them:

Helicopters (34, of which destroyed: 29, damaged: 3, abandoned: 2)

Next is BY FAR mostly Ural trucks, which have a 3 person seating capacity. The other major one are KamAZ 6x6s. I'll assume 3 people per truck and not loading passengers in the back (though we've seen some loaded with passengers in the back).

Trucks, Vehicles and Jeeps (545, of which destroyed: 312, damaged: 15, abandoned: 59, captured: 158)

Minimum:

936

Maximum:

1635

Not going to count UAVs for obvious reasons.

These ones are a bit iffy cause there are multiple types (engineering vehicles range from special BTRs to Trucks with very different crew counts), I'm not bothering to add these, but they exist.

Communications Stations (11, of which destroyed: 3, abandoned: 4, captured: 4)

Radars (2, of which destroyed: 1, captured: 1)

Jammers And Deception Systems (4, of which destroyed: 1, damaged: 2, captured: 1)

I was pretty ignorant of the situation in the Kuril islands before this. I'm guessing that Japanese and Russian citizens could travel freely between them? I didn't know that there were only a few thousand people across all of the islands, so I wonder how big of a deal this is in practical terms.

Will residents now be permanently be cut off from things like grocery stores and doctors offices because they are on a nearby Island that belongs to another country? I would imagine that that is an easy way to depopulate the islands. If people can't live there, why wouldn't they go back to the mainland?

I thought it was politically very important for Russia to have a population on the islands so that nobody could claim that they belong to Japan anymore.

59b77cddb26a4fbcef8db8e394df4579,tj2zp9,i1i37mu,"So I think I figured out what happened with those explosions in Belarus on the 16th. 

For those that don't remember, there were [explosions reported across the entirety of the south of Belarus](https://twitter.com/HannaLiubakova/status/1504194054585831429), basically everything south of Minsk (that tweet was just the first list, not the whole list). [Here's a video with sound](https://twitter.com/HannaLiubakova/status/1504200802835050499).  Local authorities gave confusing and contradictory explanations, one of them even saying it was a planned artillery exercise, at midnight, proving that he both is a moron and also knew exactly what happened and was lying about it. 

We know a group called the Cyber Partisans have been successfully hacking and disrupting rail lines in Belarus, them and a group called [BYPOL have been successfully disrupting Belarussian rail lines, most notably on March 3rd](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-699184).  They'd also successfully hacked rail lines during the protests a while back. 

[I am using the Jpost links instead of direct links to the Russian state media sites cause Russian state media is filtered on Reddit]

BYPOL is presented as a loose organization of public service employees, such as police and military officers, who don't recognize Lukashenka as the leader of Belarus and they consider the opposition-in-exile government as the legitimate one. 

RiA/Belarussian authorities reported on the 17th that they had [""thwarted"" an anti-Russian terrorist attack](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-701618) where people were going to attack a Russian group at a rail station with molotov cocktails. This attack and arrest happened at the exact same time and place as the reports of explosions across southern Belarus. 

The [opposition-in-exile representative tweeted](https://twitter.com/franakviacorka/status/1505244711086444545) that all rail lines between Ukraine and Belarus had been cut on the 19th, and even more recently has detailed [even more damage](https://twitter.com/franakviacorka/status/1505691787280670723) that Belarussian activists have done to the rail system, including a physically disruptive attack on relay systems on the 16th. 

Also on the 17th, [Belarussian security services started patrolling the railways in the south of Belarus](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/special-forces-of-the-belarus-will-protect-the-railway-from-sabotage/), specifically the relay stations. (Note, that website is an unknown, but I can confirm everything they said was said by authorities ad it happens to be a good writeup). They also specify that the patrols have been started up since March 17th after ""sabotage operations""

My conclusion: There was a widespread, coordinated partisan attack on the Belarussian railway system on the night of the 16th/17th where people used explosives and molotov cocktails to destroy the railway control relays across the entirety of the south of Belarus. 

This also confirms some other odd ends of news that have happened. There have been reports of increased military movement, which people have been taking as an indication that Belarus might step into the fight, but it's been driving me crazy because a majority of videos show Belarussian vehicles driving north towards Minsk and Brest, not south towards Ukraine. This tracks with a major rail disruption. 

Now, I've not fully fleshed out this theory, because I don't know how rail lines work and there might be something completely obvious that I'm missing.  But a lot of pieces fit together, I have a group with a history of doing this thing claiming that they did this thing, I have sources from Belarussian, Russian state media, and opposition groups that something did in fact happen on the 16th, and I have sources from Belarussian authorities on Telegram that there was a specific reaction to sabotage attacks on relay centers.

Edit just to keep it all in one place:

> 
> Updated on March 21, 2022, 10:51 AM EDT
> 
> The U.K. government is preparing to step in and temporarily run Gazprom’s British retail supply arm as it comes under increasing pressure from companies turning their backs on Russian business over the war in Ukraine. 
> 
> Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd. is a prime candidate to be taken into the U.K.’s special administration regime if it fails, to ensure continuity of supply, according to a person familiar with the matter. Officials are closely monitoring the situation of the company, which has more than 30,000 business customers.
> 
> The preparations by the U.K. government are the latest sign of how the Russian-controlled company is getting squeezed as a result of the invasion. Energy firms are also turning their back on Gazprom’s wholesale trading unit, with only a few of Europe’s large energy firms still doing business with the company in the over-the-counter market.
> 
> No one at the retail unit, which trades as Gazprom Energy and supplied over a fifth of U.K. business gas in 2020, was available to comment. The subsidiary is run from offices in London and Manchester and supplies businesses and public bodies, including parts of the National Health Service.

- [How We Verify Our Reporting on the Ukraine War](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html) - The NYTimes explain their news coverage of the Ukrainian war. One excerpt regarding videos: ""The team, which includes Ukrainian researchers, has vetted hundreds of videos to determine if they are real, or misrepresentations. When a hospital is bombed or residents film shelling of their communities, Times journalists authenticate where and when each video was filmed, use forensic video tools and other techniques to confirm that the video has not been manipulated or faked, interview witnesses and collaborate with their Times colleagues inside Ukraine to determine what’s actually happening."" *The New York Times*

An older BBC article on bullying in Russian army from 2004:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3756866.stm

BBC Article text (NSFL)

The Russian military is reported to be investigating claims that army conscripts were forced to work as male prostitutes in St Petersburg.
The command of the interior ministry unit denied the claims made by the Soldiers' Mothers human rights group.

The group says it was contacted by a parent of a conscript who had been forced to work as a male prostitute.

Last year, an 18-year-old soldier was so badly beaten that he had to have his legs and genitals amputated.
The BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow says the latest claims follow a series of scandals which have damaged the Russian army's reputation.

A spokeswoman for the Soldiers' Mothers, Ella Polyakova, told the BBC that in St Petersburg there was ""a network of clients"" who would pay for sex with soldiers.

Older servicemen are said to have forced younger conscripts into prostitution and then taken the money for themselves.

Brutality

The Sychev bullying case drew worldwide attention to Russian army abuses.

Private Andrei Sychev was forced to squat for several hours by fellow soldiers and then tied to a chair and brutally beaten up last year.

As a result he developed gangrene in his legs and genitals, which had to be amputated.

Now permanently disabled, Pte Sychev has just announced that he is to write a book about his ordeal.

Such cases have highlighted the appalling conditions suffered by some Russian service personnel at a time when Russia is seeking a greater role on the world stage, our correspondent says.",1647878918.0,1647877916.0,t3_tj2zp9,t3_tj2zp9,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

She was talking about how her teacher showed videos of people were helping the women and kids get to safety. This really warmed my heart and made me sad that little kids have to even discuss this.

Then her dad and I were talking about the situation and he said something along the lines of, ""Russia's strategy seems like it's hit-or-miss.""

The 9 year old piped up, ""Daddy, this is Russia we're talking about. Their strategy is miss-or-miss.""

I know the situation isn't funny, but that really tickled me. At the same time, it made me heartbroken because when I was 9 I don't know that I even knew about the wars in the world. This was before social media, and honestly I don't think I even knew what cable news was at that age. But kids today are saturated and inundated from any and every corner.

They claim to the Russian people that only 500 soldiers have died, obviously if it's a lot more than that, then they can't take them back to Russia for funerals. So why are there convoys of buses claiming to be carrying dead Russian soldiers back to Russia? There's loads of videos of these convoys. 

They brought mobile crematoriums to Ukraine to burn the dead soldiers... I honestly think they're killing those citizens then taking them to Russia to destroy the evidence.

They are first and foremost looking out for their own national interests, and they are struggling with internal crisis as well. This seems like a scenario where the West could do better than just threaten China with sanctions, there should be something that could be offered to China in return for them to help stop Russian aggression.

So what could it be? 

Also, does China have any meaningful way to stop the conflict? Them being the single largest ""ally"" to Russia seems like a useful point, but I'm also unsure how they should go about stopping Russia.

This is how u dismantle it with facts.

1. There is no automatic thing that triggers a nuclear strike and ww3. None. It only happens when one of the parties with nukes decide it would happen. Putin could launch nukes tomorrow if he considers that economic sanctions that have been applied are too much. Nothing is stopping him. At the same time he might not launch nukes even if NATO engages him directly in a conventional war in Ukraine. Again no evidence either way.
2. Putin has threatened nukes at almost every single step of the way and they have never been used. We can not stop supporting allies just because Putin threatens to do things he has never done nor his predecessors have done.
3. Nobody has any evidence what Putin's ""red line"" is. Absolutely no one. People who say ""don't do this or that or you will trigger a nuclear war"" have no clue about what goes on in Putin's mind.

If you see a Russian agent or a useful idiot arguing here ""dude we shouldn't do this otherwise ww3 or nukes"" ask him the following questions. Keep in mind that the burden of proof is on the person making the statement:

1. What evidence do you have that if the west or ukraine do x,y or z nuclear war or ww3 starts? 
2. A lot of stuff has already happened like sending weapons to ukraine, economic sanctions against Russia, plus a big NATO exercise right in Russias face. Why no nuclear war or ww3 yet.

Usually you will notice that the Russian agents or useful idiots will not provide a shred of evidence about the claims of nuclear war or ww3. A main counter argument that the agents or trolls sometimes use in return is the ""Putin is crazy argument and you don't wanna push him to far"". The main counter arguments to this are as follows:

1. If he is crazy he can launch nukes at any time anyway so why bother with appeasement. Just do a preventive nuclear strike on all Russian nuclear facilities, take out Putin and hope to survive if any Russian nukes are incoming. You have a higher chance of survival  like this since at least not all russian nukes will hit.
2. No evidence that Putin is actually crazy and irrational. This is war fits the rationality of a war of expansion. Has happened for hundreds of years of human history.",False,1647871902.0,t3_tj2zp9,t3_tj2zp9,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Apparently, US and Europe continued to deal with Putin for years. Even when he abused the laws of his country, when he changed the Constitution, when he silenced all opposition, when he invaded Crimea, when he funded separatists, when he allegedly(or is it proven, I'm confused on that?) influenced US elections, when he poisoned Navalny. Yeah, sure, there were some sanctions, but otherwise relationships still continued. Goods were exchanged, his money wasn't bloody. France apparently supplied him circumventing the sanctions? What was up with that? So, his regime enjoyed constant money flow and could be as strong as he ever wanted and no one could oppose him. Citizens of all those countries also didn't particularly mind and probably wouldn't even be able to point out Ukraine on the map.

But, SUDDENLY, Putin turned out to be bad. Now everybody wakes up and starts acting! Quick, ban all trade, stop buying resources, kick him out of various unions, help Ukraine! However, to plenty of people apparently, the real villains are Russians. And no, not Putin or Russian Putin supporters. Sure, they're evil, but that's just the fact of life, they're a statistic we've already accepted. No, the real villains are those Russians who were and are courageous enough to speak out, to protest, who can access outside information and foreign websites and those, who, God forbid, left or are leaving the country. Apparently they're the bad guys for ""not doing enough"", for ""being cowards"", for ""caring only about the sanctions and their skins"", etc.

Meanwhile, there are apparently plans to get replacement gas from Qatar? The Qatar? The country that supports terrorism like ISIS, has pretty much no human rights and slavery. I'm sorry, is there a backup plan for when Qatar eventually SUDDENLY turns out to be bad?

* Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea aren't coming back.
* Russia gets its land bridge to Crimea, in exchange for funds to aid with reconstruction that Ukraine can call war reparations.

* No amnesty for Russian soldiers or leadership; the Hague will seek charges
* Russia receives no relief from sanctions

* Russia withdraws from *all* separatist regions. Including South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Transnistra.

> 
> ""Nationalists have placed mines in ammonia and chlorine storage facilities at the Sumykhimprom chemical plant in Sumy in order to poison the Sumy region residents in case Russian troops enter the city,"" he said. ""In the settlement of Kotlyarovo, Nikolayev region, militants of nationalist units are plotting a provocation with the use of toxic chemicals. For these ends, they have placed containers with toxic chemicals in the building of a secondary school, which will be exploded when Russian forces approach the settlement.""

> ""We warn the entire civilized world and international organizations about the Ukrainian authorities’ cynical provocations, which, if realized, will be blamed on Russian troops as it has been done more than once,"" he stressed, adding that it is being done with the support from the United States and a number of countries of the European Union, which consider Ukraine as an instrument of anti-Russian policies.

>National pride is a point of emphasis in Mariupol—a fact reinforced by Freedom Square’s laser show, which uses projections on the Square’s promenade area to showcase modern symbols of the city including various flowers representing Ukraine’s 25 regions. As the flower projections move through the display area, they each morph into the shape of the region they represent, before gradually merging into a single country. The Square also boosts the city’s image by reinforcing its seaside appeal via a life-size fountain and rolling waves depicted in the laser show.

> Surrounding the Square and housing the lasers, light sources and speakers for the show are 25 metal birds—another symbol of the country’s 25 regions. To further emphasize the theme of Ukrainian heritage, each pole-top has a QR code leading to a site with information about the country. The Square’s ambient lighting is directed downward to illuminate functional areas, minimize light pollution and to keep it from being too intense for the location. The lighting also changes with each season and on holidays, keeping it interesting for both locals and visitors.

Even before the war, China was already seeing improvements in its energy and commodity security in BRI developments through central asia, especially the roads and pipelines to the west.

People were ridiculing claims that china's conventional warfare ability has not surpassed that of the US. That's not exactly what the author said. The author specifically stated that the conventional warfare ability in the vicinity of China is greater than that of the US, which is completely true. The US would be hard pressed to enforce a blockade, and would not be able to withstand the barrage of land based artillery that is already massed on the chinese coast. Yes, US overall possess greater warfare abilities, but they would actually need to depend on allies like Japan or Korea to fully complement their power projection, and they would have to do so thousands of miles away from home ports, and would be very costly.

Russia, having institutional corruption, was having trouble coming up with the money to build roads and pipelines, especially through siberia. The war has given china leverage against russia such that they are speeding up these infrastructure plans (with Chinese money).

I doubt that the war actually changes the strategic landscape of asia in the long term. It only accelerated the Russia-China partnership, but this was going to happen eventually.

Second assumption was that the Ukrainian government would flee Kyiv as soon as the invasion started.

1. Their superior air force destroys first the enemy air force and SAM batteries.

3. Heavily armoured columns push into bewildered and undefended towns as the Ukrainian army flees, with the civilian and territorials who are left behind completely demoralized and immediately surrendering.

Because in the east Russia positioned their massively long range S-400s in Belarus and Russia which would tear the MIGs to shreds. UA has the weapons to hold the front line, tho they might have to shorten it a bit.

The bulk of UA forces is also in the west training. I don't see an option of Ukraine getting its territories back. They would need some very heavy weapons that nobody is willing to provide.

Forget the MIGs they need S-300 and S-400 and a lot of them, they need heavy howitzers, mobile mortars, guided munition, ballistic missiles, IFV and a whole lot of personal gear. They needed this gear yesterday and the west is still discussing what to send.

Also while we have seen the cost of war for Russians, it's likely its extremely high for UA as well. Ukraine needs long range ballistic missiles to take out Russian anti-air in Russia and Belarus which can take a turn for much much worse. It's a shitty situation that I don't see going better for Ukraine.

Russia has paid a massive price and will continue to do so. But they got mostly what they wanted they will now entrench them selves, fortify their lines, get logistics running since their backs will be safe and then it's pretty much over for Ukraine it has lost all that territory.

> 
> A zoo in the south of Ukraine has asked for international support to keep its animals alive after most of its staff were either evacuated or joined the military to fight Russian invaders.
> 
> Mykolaiv Zoo is operating in “wartime mode,” its director, Volodymyr Topchyi, said in a Facebook post earlier this month.
> 
> “Every day we go to work, feed and clean the animals despite the howl of the air raid siren,” he wrote. “Seven of our employees went to the front to fight the invaders.”
> 
> Topchyi asked people to consider purchasing e-tickets to the zoo to financially support it during the war. The park is home to polar bears, hippos, lions, wolves, elephants, zebras, primates and many other animals, according to its website.

Russians have their own numbers and people who are aligned with Russia are taking those to be true. Now we all know why that’s a bad idea. 

I said this a week or so ago that the truth is somewhere in the middle and if anyone takes any other source too seriously, they will be disappointed. 

The numbers that DoS is giving seem likely to be near the truth. They have been spot on with the events leading up to the invasion so their intelligence has some history of holding true. That is a good reason to believe them. This along with the NYTimes report a day or so ago puts Russia in a much better position than previously indicated by the chatter and Twitter posts we have been seeing.

> 
> ""Nationalists have placed mines in ammonia and chlorine storage facilities at the Sumykhimprom chemical plant in Sumy in order to poison the Sumy region residents in case Russian troops enter the city,"" he said. ""In the settlement of Kotlyarovo, Nikolayev region, militants of nationalist units are plotting a provocation with the use of toxic chemicals. For these ends, they have placed containers with toxic chemicals in the building of a secondary school, which will be exploded when Russian forces approach the settlement.""
> 
> ""We warn the entire civilized world and international organizations about the Ukrainian authorities’ cynical provocations, which, if realized, will be blamed on Russian troops as it has been done more than once,"" he stressed, adding that it is being done with the support from the United States and a number of countries of the European Union, which consider Ukraine as an instrument of anti-Russian policies.

Hypersonic missiles can travel at a far lower trajectory than high-arcing ballistic missiles, which can be easily detectable. Hypersonics can also maneuver and evade missile defense systems.

My friends, I like war...

No, friends, I love war!

I love holocausts.

I love blitzkriegs.

I love defensive lines.

I love sieges, charges, I love mop-up operations, and retreats.

Wars across prairies, in streets, in trenches, in grasslands, in frozen tundras, through deserts, on the sea, in the air, I love every act of war that can occur upon this earth.

I love blasting the enemy to smithereens with artillery salvos that thunder across the lines of battle.

My heart leaps with joy whenever a soldier is tossed high into the air and cut to pieces by well placed sniper rounds. And there is nothing like a tank operator using a Tiger acht acht (88) to destroy enemy tanks. And the feeling that comes when a soldier runs screaming from his blazing tank, only to be mowed down by heavy machine gun fire, is such an exquisite feeling. Like when ranks of infantry brandish their bayonets rushing into the enemy line. It moves me deep within my heart to watch a fresh recruit stabbing over and over into the bloated chest of a long-dead enemy.

The sight of deserters being strung up from a street lamp is an irresistible pleasure. And there is nothing more arousing than the sounds made by prisoners of war dropping like flies, screaming in agony as they're mowed down by ear piercing schmeissers!

When a band of pitiful resistance fighters makes their final stand with nothing but small arms, only to have their city smashed to atoms block by block by 4.8 ton bombshells, (tone suddenly softens) I'm in ecstasy.

I love it when my forces are ravaged by a Russian armored division. It's so sad to see towns and villages that were supposed to be defended at all costs, being laid to waste, their women and children being raped and killed.

I love to be squashed under the heel of the British and American war machines. The humiliation as my men crawl around like vermin, ducking the jagdbombers flying overhead.

Gentlemen... All I ask for is war, war so grand as to make Hell itself tremble. Gentlemen, I ask you as fellow brothers in arms what is it that you really want? Do you wish for further war as I do?

(Dramatically raises voice) Do you ask for war to sweep in like a tempest, leaving not even ravens to scavenge from this Earth!?

(The soldiers begin shouting/chanting ""Krieg"" meaning ""War"")
...Very well. Then krieg is what you shall have. We are a clenched fist, ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might.

But... After enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness, for us, a simple ""ordinary"" war will no longer be sufficient.

(Raises voice) We need a MASSIVE war! A war beyond any other that man's history has ever known!

We are but a single battalion... The remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong. However, I believe that each of you old warriors is equal to a thousand of their sickly soft children! We represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men!

It is time for them to awake the ones who sent us screaming into oblivion, and who now lie sleeping. Let's drag them out of bed by the hair, and remind them of what we are! We will remind them of what it feels like to live in fear. We will remind them of the sound our jackboots make against their throats.

(Cuts to scene of Alexander Anderson looking up at Millenium's Zeppelin and the blood-red moon, before fading back to The Major)
We will remind them that there are more things between Heaven and Hell than are dreamt of in their philosophy.

(Cuts to soldiers shouting ""It's Europe! We see the lights of Europe!"" while looking out at scene below, and then meeting of Hellsing and Integra, before cutting back to The Major)
Our Kampfgruppe of one thousand vampires is going to burn this world down to ash.

(Cuts to window scene)
Yes, my friends! Soon, Europe's charred remains will illuminate the night sky!

(Cuts to window with Seras and Pip)
I have brought you all back just as I promised I would. Back to our favorite battlefield. Back to our beloved war!

Refraining from murdering people because of the things they think and folk they associate with was the lesson most of the west arguably did learn from WW2. Democracy has done a fairly good job of keeping the absolute loons away from the nuclear winter happy house but there's no substitute for free and fair elections. Putin didn't get where he was by dodging bullets accidentally. Any attempt to remove him at any point would have been met with almost certain nuclear war or at the very least a destabilised Russia with god knows how many cock eyed warlords near nuclear silos. 

There's just learned about geopolitics and then there are comments like this. No nation would authorise absolute power to remove other world leaders in fear it would legitimise their own undemocratic removal. 

Advocating killing people with some sort of warped all knowing, all right, act of God scenario is just not right. No matter how just the murder.

> MOSCOW, March 21 - RIA Novosti. Russia refused to negotiate a peace treaty with Japan, the Foreign Ministry said.

> Relations between Russia and Japan were overshadowed by the absence of a peace treaty for many years. Tokyo claims the islands of Kunashir, Shikotan, Iturup and Habomai, citing the bilateral Tract on Trade and Borders of 1855.

> In 1956, Moscow agreed to consider handing over Habomai and Shikotan after a peace agreement was reached. The Soviet side hoped to put an end to territorial disputes, but Tokyo did not renounce claims to all the islands. As a result, the peace treaty was never concluded.
> 
> Moscow's position is that the islands became part of the USSR following World War II, and Russia's sovereignty over them is beyond doubt.

It's also a talking point because endorsement/support/integration of such movements makes is a vast threat-multiplier.

If a state actively integrates and endorses neo-nazi ideology, that is a large and immediate threat - and Russia knows better than most how disastrously destructive Nazis can be ... which is of course why they used that accusation since the end of WWII for almost everything (a telling little example being how the Berlin wall was the ""Anti-fascist protection wall"").

With Ukraine, the Azov batallion, groups of people sharing that ideology in the southeast - and especially the official integration of the Azov batallion into the military command structure is a (afaik the only) real instance of Nazi-threats Russia can point to. 

With the US and NATO, that ""kernel of truth"" are things like Gladio, similar right-wing stay-behind organizations and especially active US support for regime changes by autocrats & fascists slaughtering civilians to secure their influence in the cold war. 

Of course Russia does the exact same thing and employs much more fascist tactics at home than the west does - but the point is that of course Nazis are a threat even before they start doing unlawful things (plus, they just change the laws when in power), and the more official endorsement and support Nazi groups get, the more dangerous they are.

So it's - as usual - a mixture of like 5% ""kernel of truth / legitimate concern"" and 95% propaganda - to drum up support and present an international facade for their own authoritarian/hegemonic aspirations. 

To sum up: Yes, in liberal democracies people are free to hold and voice opinions I may find despicable. This too has limits, though - direct incitement to violence or planning and attempting to overthrow the very liberal-democratic foundation of society for example. Since that *is* the known aspiration of Neo-Nazis, they are also a real threat even if all some group of them do *so far* is protest and organize - which is why it's in general a talking point.

Should be for any dangerous ideology - but sadly, religious ideology mostly gets a pass for historic and sociological reasons... which it absolutely shouldn't.",False,1647876495.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1j854o,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Moscow also allows MOEX to be traded as an index fund.  So if you pay that 90 rubles for one share of MOEX, you just invested in 50 of the largest Russian companies.

We have index funds here too of all sorts of shapes and sizes.  There are even total market index funds.  Both domestic and foreign.  So I can buy one share of a total market fund here and essentially be invested in every public company in the USA, or every foreign company.

You can arrive at this sort of number by dividing Russian estimated KIA by Russian estimated (or documented) equipment losses, then multiplying that number by documented evidence of Ukrainian equipment losses.

Whilst the Vienna Convention protects those buildings from interference by the receiving state, contrary to popular belief they rarely have any other special (eg extraterritorial) status.

Nevertheless, could the bombing of such a vacant building amount to an ""armed attack"" on the sending nation, within the meaning of NATO's Article 5?  Perhaps, although Article 6 (whilst not explicitly limiting) suggests otherwise.  In any event, it'd first be up to the sending nation to raise that argument and then up to the rest of NATO to accept it.  And that's pretty unlikely.

*Even if* such an argument were raised and accepted, Article 5 only commits member states to ""*assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area*"".  Member states might deem that the security of the North Atlantic area is best restored/maintained by taking no action, or that the necessary actions do not include the use of armed force.

*Even if* such an argument were raised and accepted *and* member states deem that the use of armed force is necessary to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area, the level of force deemed necessary would likely be proportionate to the attack on the NATO member to which they are responding (namely the bombing of their vacated embassy building in Kyiv).  For example, a proportionate response might be a single missile strike against the site from which that bombing was launched.

It is absolutely not the case that the bombing of a building in Kyiv would automatically trigger all out war between NATO and Russia.",1647883198.0,1647881382.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1jpq9t,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Started as an orphan and college dropout, is   gifted one Russia's most profitable companies for bargain bin price (relatively) at the ripe young age of 33 by somehow getting himself into Yeltsin's inner circle. Here's some text:

 In 1995, Abramovich and Berezovsky acquired a controlling interest in the large oil company Sibneft in a rigged auction.[35] The deal took place within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100 million for half of the company, above the stake's stock market value of US$150 million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions. The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, to suggest that the real cost of the company should have been in the billions of dollars (it was worth US$2.7 billion at that time).[36][37][35] Abramovich later admitted in court that he paid billions of dollars of bribes to government officials and gangsters to acquire and protect his assets.[38]

As of 2000, Sibneft annually produced US$3 billion worth of oil.[39]

The Times claimed that he was assisted by Badri Patarkatsishvili in the acquisition of Sibneft.[40][41][42][43] After Sibneft, Abramovich's next target was the aluminium industry. After privatisation, the ""aluminium wars"" led to murders of smelting plant managers, metals traders and journalists as groups battled for control of the industry. Abramovich was initially hesitant to enter into the aluminium business, claiming that ""every three days someone was murdered in that business"".[44]

Abramovich sold Sibneft to the Russian government for $13 billion in 2005.[35]",1647850056.0,1647849745.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1i88ju,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

People living in major cities are (relatively speaking) much wealthier, better educated and more connected/online than those in rural areas; accordingly they are already better informed (and, politically, lean much more strongly against Putin).

The people who this information needs to reach are those who are much more isolated, and therefore many such communities may not in fact directly know anyone who has been sent to Ukraine.  Indeed, military units are drawn from geographical areas: so whilst some communities may have been badly hit, others may not have anyone deployed to Ukraine at all.

Check out what CNBC has to say about it:

> **Oligarch Roman Abramovich’s $50 million Colorado mansion could become a sanctions target**
> 
> PUBLISHED SUN, MAR 20 202211:16 AM EDT
> 
> Robert Frank
> 
> A Rocky Mountain mansion owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich would likely be among the first assets frozen by the U.S. government if he is sanctioned.
> 
> Among Abramovich’s many global real estate trophies is a 14,000-square-foot modern mega-home on 200 acres in Snowmass, Colorado, just outside of Aspen.
> 
> The home is well known in architectural circles and was designed by New York-based Voorsanger Architects. Perched nearly 1,000 feet above Snowmass Village, it rises like a giant glass wedge along Wildcat Ridge. Its steel folded-plate roof, which looks like a giant wing, was designed for heavy snow loads and cantilevers 40-feet over the driveway.
> 
> Inside, the home is clad in sleek black walnut with floor-to-ceiling windows offering dramatic views of Capitol Peak, Mount Daly, the Roaring Fork Valley and Aspen. A 12-foot-tall moss-rock wall divides the east and west wings. Brokers say Abramovich added millions of dollars worth of improvements to the home, including space underground.

The pact was signed in Moscow on 23 August 1939 by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and was officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Unofficially, it has also been referred to as the Hitler–Stalin Pact, Nazi–Soviet Pact or Nazi–Soviet Alliance (although it was not a formal alliance).

I've been trying to be as realistic as possible but i'm not seeing much gains from russia in the last few days. Doesn't mean they're not there, I'm just very very curious as how it is going and my impression so far is:

Mariupol still stands, if only barely.

Russian forces are stalled on most fronts, and have issues resupplying their troops. and stabilizing the situation in the cities they are occupying.

Ukraine are getting ''enough'' manpower, seeing as they don't want untrained foreign fighters to come. Their military training camps are getting hit by missiles in the west, with some damages and loss of life. (Implying that Russia sees the training camps as a real threat, when they are focusing on bombing those rather than supporting the front lines.)

Ukraine is talking and showing signs of executing numerous counterattacks, which if their reserves has been mobilized and their supply of weapons from the west has arrived. We might soon be seeing the results of 200 000,- Russians facing a 500 000,- Ukrainian force armed with western weapons across a massive frontline.

I'm probably just far too optimistic, but really were are the russian gains and why is it still so grim for Ukraine?

This one needs to be put into context.

So let me provide you with a bit of context from Germany. The first 4 tweets are mainly personal opinion and could have been felt in any other european country, it's just Germany because author of the tweet is in Germany.

The tweet regarding Scholz and that ""russophobia is unacceptable"" is right and from the Germany perspective, Ivan or Olga (random russian names) didn't sent troops into Ukraine to start a full blown war, so yes it isn't a russian war, it's Putin's war which gets supported by a unknown amount of people. Yet hating all russians for that is simply wrong.

I can't say anything about the following tweet because I don't know the region she is / was in Germany but this also mostly will be a result of a meetup with far right extremists who will hate you no matter if you are from Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, China or even France. These far rights are also often more open to russian progaganda and the nationalistic side resulting in her tolerance of russian chauvinsim. I can tell you, most germans won't side with any chauvinsim simply because of our own history.

""Pro-Russian rallies"", well there are rallies that are allowed because Germany is still a democratic state and you can't easily forbid any rallies, also Pro-Russian rallies doesn't directly means they support the war, but I can totally understand the misfortune there, same goes for the symbols, there aren't many symbols that are forbidden in Germany except several Nazi symbols. Hate it or love it, but it isn't so simple to just forbid this.

Attack on the refugee, again could be far rights or some other stupid folks that simply hate foreigners or is influenced by Russian media outlets (RT for example) that also had huge influence in Germany regarding anti-vax protests around Corona. (You'll mostly see a lot of overlaps in people supporting Russia, being Anti-Vax/Corona and voted AfD)

\+ Don't forget Berlin was split until 1990 and so was Germany while the western states won't have that many supporters for Russia, the eastern states still have a lot of people that romanticize the good old days under Soviet influence. So this isn't as easy as it seems to be, and gosh I hate when every situation happening in Germany directly leds to an: OH GOSH WHOLE GERMANY IS LIKE THAT? No it isn't!

The rest is mostly bureaucratic stuff.

But and that is important and doesn't gets picked up by the author: Most germans \~+80% are in favor of supporting Ukraine and picking up Ukranians fleeing from war.",False,1647888585.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1k8f0q,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

The political instability that lead to the fall of the Roman Republic started with the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, the one that created a precedent for using the *very* public murder of one’s opponents as a political means to an end. An opponent who was dead was no longer an opponent, and a murder that could be retroactively justified as being for the protection of the republic wasn’t a murder.

The retaliatory strike against those senators and their supporters who killed Tiberius by his brother, Gaius Gracchus, using a private army he amassed through political connections in turn set up the precedent that would lead to Sulla’s using a private army to take Rome and unleash his proscriptions that would see his rivals killed without due process. This had a two pronged effect, leading to the precedent of Caesar using his army to march on Rome, and the Roman senators fearing Caesar would inevitably return the proscriptions and have them killed if they didn’t act first.

What you’re vaguely trying to do in order to form a comparison to your opinion of the current push for further involvement is to rope in the connection between Tiberius Gracchus’ land reforms for veterans of the Carthaginian wars, but it doesn’t hold water. It was not the Carthaginian wars that lead to the events surrounding the fall of the Roman Republic, it was rather the use of murder as a means of silencing a political rival, and the subsequent escalations, that did it. The Carthaginian wars, and the resulting push for land for veterans was the setting, not the underlying cause. It could even be argued that the push for land for veterans was only the veneer Tiberius was using to address the problem of corruption and the hoarding of land and wealth by the Patricians, and even this could be argued that it was because Tiberius, like his ideological descendant Caesar, had realised there was an untapped goldmine for political support in reaching out to the then politically ignored pleibean classes.

I see you’ve been trying various tactics to try and form somekind of a comparison between current events regarding Russia and Ukraine to various events in Roman history, ranging from Augustus to now the murder of the Gracchi. The problem is you’re working backwards, you have a set view of history in how it *could* be made relevant to current events and you’re contorting yourself trying to find ways to make the events of the present mirror the events of the past. Unfortunately, that’s not how this works.

""Airspace"" is anything within 12 nautical miles of a national border over sea, and the literal land borders over land. 

An ADIZ, or Air Defense Identification Zone, is basically just anywhere where militaries want to know who's flying there.  For example, the strait between mainland China and Taiwan is a fairly important ADIZ, and you best tell both the PRC and ROC militaries that you're there if you're gonna be there. But, it's not actually violating anyone's territory. 

Those media articles are about Russian aircraft entering ADIZs and NATO nations waving them off, but in none of those cases did Russian aircraft actually enter ""airspace"" or violate a national border.

 >A Thursday War is the colloquial name given in the Royal Navy for the weekly war-fighting and damage control exercises that are held during Fleet Operational Sea Training (FOST), so named because they are usually held on a Thursday. FOST is responsible for ensuring that Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels are fit to join the operational fleet by testing vessels' readiness through a series of drills and exercises. These culminate in the so-called 'Thursday War', war-fighting scenarios designed to test a ship's company's reaction to various situations and emergencies.

 >The resource curse, also known as the paradox of plenty or the poverty paradox, is the phenomenon of countries with an abundance of natural resources (such as fossil fuels and certain minerals) having less economic growth, less democracy, or worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. There are many theories and much academic debate about the reasons for, and exceptions to, these adverse outcomes. Most experts believe the resource curse is not universal or inevitable, but affects certain types of countries or regions under certain conditions.

231ed8bbbf2d31f0a550ffe4a33d57c8,tj2zp9,i1iyycq,"> limited trading of federal bonds (whatever that means)

A ""bond"" is a promise (""my word is my bond"", ""I bind myself to doing such and such"", etc): in this case, an IOU issued by an institution.  It is how big institutions borrow money (because the amounts involved are too much for any one bank to lend): they write lots of little IOUs (each something like ""*I promise to pay the incumbent holder of this note $100 on 31 December 2030*"") and then sell those IOUs in the ""bond market"".  Investors obviously won't pay face value for them, but they will pay a lesser amount (the discount varies according to the borrower's credit risk, together with other things like interest rate expectations).  Investors then trade in these bonds over time, buying and selling them as they perceive the value to move.

A ""federal bond"" is one issued by a federal government (in this case, the Russian federal government; bonds issued by the US federal government are known as Treasury Bonds or ""T-Bonds"", and those issued by the UK government are known as ""gilts"" because they used to be issued on gilt-edged paper).

""Limited trading"" in this case means that trading of such federal bonds is only being permitted during reduced hours and in particular formats (initially a discrete auction, where prices will be progressively offered until a buyer is found).

-- 

Bonds often promise a more complicated set of payments than simply a single lump sum at the end of the term (as given in the example above).  Each such intermediate payment is known as a ""coupon"" (because, historically, one would physically detach a coupon from the bond document in order to claim the payment when it fell due).

When a bond has many small regular coupons followed by a large final ""bullet"", then the cash flows look a lot like a traditional term loan with interest payments (the coupons) and a capital repayment (the bullet).  Hence sometimes coupon payments are colloquially (though technically not correctly) referred to as interest payments.

On Friday, coupons were due on two Russian federal bonds: one denominated in US dollars and the other in Euros.  There was speculation that these payments would be missed, but they were in fact paid.

Had those payments been missed, then the terms of the bonds permitted Russia 30 days to remedy the missed payments before they would be in ""default"" of their obligations.  Being in default would likely have permitted bondholders to demand immediate redemption in full (ie payment of all outstanding amounts), though this would depend on the exact bond terms and governing law—and ultimately would be a bit meaningless given the inability to pay.

-- 

Over time, an institution may issue many different bonds with very different payment structures—and this makes it rather difficult/meaningless to compare the price at which one of their bonds is trading against the price at which others of their (or their peers') bonds are trading.  Instead, investors tend to look at the ""yield"" of each bond: which is the effective rate of return a buyer would get if they purchased the bond at its current price (equivalently the discount to the bond's face value, and therefore an excellent indicator of what borrowing cost the institution would face if they were to issue new debt).

Whilst considerably more comparable, yields do still vary according to each bond's precise structure.  Accordingly, investors will often look at a borrower's ""yield curve"", which is the plot of its bonds' yields against their maturities.  Typically bonds that mature sooner are seen as less risky (and therefore have a lower yield) than those that mature farther into the future (and which therefore have a higher yield): that is, yield curves generally ""go up""—but the situation does sometimes ""invert"", such as when investors perceive an impending recession (very much the case with Russia's federal bonds right now).",1647880119.0,1647868654.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1irvwj,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The GIUK gap is an area in the northern Atlantic Ocean that forms a naval choke point. Its name is an acronym for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom, the gap being the open ocean between these three landmasses. The term is typically used in relation to military topics. The area has been considered strategically important since the beginning of the 20th century.

There is a lot of talk about the eastwards NATO expansion, but that is not really the big thing. Sure, geopolitics-wise it did put pressure on Russia, which is still historically deathly afraid of any western attack - it has been burned into their minds after the two world wars. In an age of nukes, it was not really realistic anymore, but it was a narrative propaganda could easily latch onto. Also the idea of just not accepting nations that apply would undermine the right of people and nations to choose for themselves, even if in this case it also aligned with US interests. Western imperialism has a problem there with respecting self-determination of nations too, of course, but in this case it was actually in support of self-determination.

But the thing the US was complicit in was how post-Soviet Russia was handled in the 90s. The heavy support for Yeltsin to at any cost prevent communists to hold government in Russia created the class of oligarchs that then enabled Putin to secure his power and it disenfranchised the people within Russia and stoked on antidemocratic attitudes towards elections. The wholesale and corrupt bargain-selling of state owned enterprises and haphazardly rushed ""shock therapy"" privatisation was mainly politically motivated to keep Yeltsin and fund his campaign, and it was supported by the West, trying to get some sort of controllable government. Turns out it ended up enabling fascism in the long run, it was in hindsight a stupid choice made when the US felt more or less invincible and righteous to a fault. Russia was at a real crossroads of history then - of course no one could know how it would have turned out without western support of Yeltsin, but it is clear the US did not dare to have a democratic Russia if their choices did not also align with their vision of a new world order. They tolerated and even supported the creation of the oligarch class and they tilled the field of corruption Putin grew rich, fat and ambitious on.

It's not like ""it's all the US fault"" either, there was, of course, also agency on the Russian side. But I think history will look at that as a point of hubris and a mistake for a long time to come.",False,1647881373.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1jpeg0,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

It always has a responsibility to its own citizens, soldiers, and economic well-being. That's literally why we have a government.

Moral calculus is always distasteful to talk about is an emotionally disconnected way because, as you say, we're simultaneously watching people's lives being destroyed in front of us. But the moral calculus still has to be done, whether it offends people or not.

If a child is standing in the middle of a highway, it is probably offensive to ask whether it's in my ""interest"" to sprint across four lanes to rescue that child... and yet I have responsibilities to my own family, to the other people on the road who might be killed when they swerve to avoid me, and yes, my own wish not to die... So offensive or not, at some level, I consider my own interests while deciding how best to attempt to save the child.

PS: On top of that, one has to consider the long-term sustainability of any aid. Any aid that is outside my countries own interests will not be sustainable. My own citizenry will start to object, will revoke funding, will remove those making those choices from office, etc. So a short-sighted attempt at aid can ultimately be less helpful than sustainable aid that is supported by the majority.

Retired generals, logistical experts, geopolitical analysts, etc. You can also look at the raw numbers. Who knows what Russia’s real casualties are? Conservative Pentagon estimates are 7000 KIA a few days ago. Ukraine is claiming something like 15000 KIA. Let’s split the difference and call it about 10k (more in line with Baltic intel assessments). If you take into consideration the cold weather and shitty medical evac of the Russians probably more like 2x wounded instead of the more typical 3 to 4x because you’re going to see a higher rate of fatalities. Sprinkle in some POWs. Let’s say about 30k hors de combat so far for the Russians is going to be in the ballpark (they don’t know themselves for sure). Russia invaded with about 190k. So that’s about a 16% casualty rate. Now, how much punishment can a unit take and still be effective is a matter of some debate. Classically an American unit would be around 10% - however that depends on the circumstances. Terrain, weather, offense or defense, supply status, etc. Units have maintained effectiveness at greater than 10% in some circumstances. However, once you get to 30% you start to see a pretty significant drop off. Unit cohesion and morale starts to break down. Typically at that point you need to rotate the unit out. Russia sent the majority of their BTGs into Ukraine - they don’t really have a reserve to rotate and replenish. They have some, but replacing their hardware is not going to be easy. So if they’ve lost 16% in less than a month and they’re currently losing about 1k a day, then in about another four weeks that army is going to need serious help.

These were presented late in November 2021. Putin repeated ""we will get what we want"", indicating that this wasn't a negotiation. But then, of course, they did the diplomatic dance of pretending to negotiate. The point of that is that it satisfied Putin's need to feel important. All these European fools coming to listen to his rants! Many opportunities to humiliate them. The point of the pre-war negotiations was to probe and harass the West, nothing more.

Copied from [another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tj7krr/866_of_russians_support_the_idea_of_launching_an/i1imjny/): 

>This article is purposely misrepresenting data and the poll is horseshit.

>1st point: The question:
[Do you support] Russia’s right to use direct military action in order “to force other
countries to abandon their support for the Nazis in Ukraine?”

>The data: 40.6% replied positively, 40% were undecided; only 13.4% gave a negative answer

>The claim: The article claims that 80.6% support the war. Bullshit, 40.6% stated they support the war. And let's not even mention the suspicion a Russian would feel being polled about the war in a climate where political detractors are oppressed to say the lightest.

>2nd point:

>The question: ""In which countries should the RF continue the special military operation after the denazification of Ukraine?""

>The data is then completely confusing, as is the statement. There are two bars, a grey and a red one. Neither is labeled. A red bar states that 75.5% (of an unspecified group) votes ""Poland"" and the matching grey bar bar says that 48.6% (of a different group?) voted for Poland.

>What is this division? who even answered this question? Because if 53.4% of the people are against or unsure about the war, I highly doubt then, that these people are part of the 75.5% of people wanting to continue the invasion into Poland. So how are these divided?

>Bullshit data presentation, bullshit evaluation.

>3rd point: Question: ""Do you assume that the RF, in order to protect its legitimate interests, and provided that VP receives information about the threat of use of such weapons against Russia, would use nuclear weapons in a restricted way?""

>First of all, what a loaded soft languaged question, which is then used to make nonsense claims against the Russian people. ""Do you think Putin would nuke preemptively (but carefully) to stop you getting nuked?"" is what this boils down to.

>The data:

>40.3% - Yes[, We would use nukes]

>34.3% - Maybe yes, maybe no. Not sure [if we'd use nukes]

25.5% - No[, we wouldn't use nukes]

>The claim? ""75% of Russians variably accept Russia's use of nuclear weapons"" They then proceed to evaluate this as ""40.3 support it, 34.3% approve to some extent, and 25.5% reject it.

>EXCUSE ME? That is NOT the question the respondents answered. They were asked ""do you think RF would use nukes in a preemptive retaliation."" Not their opinion on the matter.

>And the final statement from the founder of the group? ""In conclusion, Active Group founder Andriy Yeremenko noted that Russian public opinion may reflect and influence the Kremlin’s future actions.

>“We get the impression that the Russian respondents are aggressive not only towards Ukraine, but also towards the EU. Upon hearing the topic, they either refused to respond to the questions or declared their full support for further Russian incursions into other countries.” comments Yeremenko”

>EDIT: oh? So many people didn’t even respond? Curious, no? I wonder if it’s for fear of Stalinesque sting operations? How about telling us how many refused to answer? And the “full support” - except for the majority 53% who expressed outright condemnation or uncertainty.

>What bullshit is this? I'm reporting this article for being complete drivel. It purposely misrepresents data for the purpose of shitstirring and misrepresentation of the Russian populace, who aren't exactly having a great time either thanks to their Great Leader provoking the rest of the world.

Undertaken by the Allies in 1944, the operation threatened an invasion of France in the Pas de Calais region through the simulation of a large Field Army in South East England. Quicksilver formed part of the Operation Fortitude deception, itself part of the strategic Operation Bodyguard plan. The key element of Quicksilver was to convince the Germans that ""First United States Army Group"" (FUSAG) commanded by General George Patton would land in the Pas-de-Calais for the major invasion of Europe, after the landings in Normandy had lured the German defenders to that front.

B) Formal peace that will be accompanied by diversions backed by Russian forces, targeted at cities and civilian lives. Ukrainian terrorists will be blamed, providing them with an excuse to invade again when they please.

Allies will actually back down from supporting Ukraine because their own citizens will feel the economic backslash caused by sanctions. It will be done under the agenda that peace in the Ukraine ""was reached, so there is no need in keeping the sanctions that strict"".

“ British website The Telegraph is reporting that Russia is using mobile crematoriums in Ukraine in bid to hide its losses. But the accompanying video footage of a crematorium actually dates from 2013. It was posted by a Russian incinerator construction company and is not footage from the ground. The use of mobile crematoriums by Russians during the current war in Ukraine is yet to be verified. We tell you more in this edition.”

Ballistic missiles easily fall into the category of hypersonic weapons. However their high altitude flight makes them easy to detect, and their predictable flight makes them possible to intercept.

Some newer hypersonic weapons aren’t necessarily faster. But they don’t follow a ballistic flight path and are able to fly much lower. At lower altitudes and at the ranges these weapons operate, they are shielded from detection by the curvature of the earth. So it’s not only their speed which makes them hard to react to, it’s the fact that some can approach their target at much closer ranges before they can even be detected from the ground.

What we've learned in the last few weeks is that the US's training and intelligence can really boost a small country's ability to defend itself against an overwhelming force... and (perhaps) that economic repercussions from a unified NATO are nothing to sneeze at. We also see that membership in NATO is incredibly valuable. Poland, for instance, it probably pretty happy with its membership right now.

The fact that the US isn't going to get into direct conflict with countries who have significant nuclear capability is nothing new. The people who seem surprised by this are obviously new to paying attention to global conflict.

You are falling into qanon level conspiracy theories.  There's a psychological need to explain bad things happening as a higher power or an evil person's decision because the human brain has a hard time dealing with bad things happening for literally no reason.  The vast vast majority of conspiracy theories are built out of this phenomenon, because people feel better if there is something they can fight instead of facing the fact that they're dealing with a random and uncaring universe.

You are stringing together two facts and creating a whole narrative based on those two facts for literally no reason.  

There is no indication that anything you said is true, and in fact there is a lot of evidence that everything you have said ISN'T true.

I don't think the US would be able to defeat a chinese naval blockade of taiwan especially if the navy worked in conjunction with land-based artillery, missiles, and planes.

Even in the case where the US sent 100% of its surface fleet and planes to Taiwan, China's ships and planes (by number) will outnumber those of the US. There is no way US would achieve air superiority around taiwan, as china's land based air power would overwhelm them by shear number.

I think a future conflict with taiwan will not result in any bombardment or invasion, but a static naval blockade. This is normally seen as an act of war, but international law is different when the nation being blockaded isn't seen as sovereign. The US and allies will probably enact sanctions and airlift into Taiwan, but they can't do this indefinitely.

If US deployed farther in any conflict against the chinese, it would seriously affect their sortie rate. Any closer and they are in danger of even artillery. China has way more land-based airbases that can outcompete the amount of planes US or allies put against china. US would be limited to carriers and depend on its allies for air support. In a future conflict with taiwan, I'm not convinced korea would support US if it meant shelling of US air bases in korea.

In addition, China's navy is the largest in the world, although they are not the best equipped.

It’s also a large reason that Ukraine is receiving so much lethal aid and is something that Zelensky has been preaching to the world while asking for said aid: “Russia won’t stop after Ukraine”. 

With that said, the aid and support Ukraine is receiving is absolutely being affected in part by the threat of Russia attacking the rest of Europe. Therefore, I think it’s untrue that we are simply doing nothing and don’t care because it’s not a NATO country. If those fears already exist and we are already sending so much lethal aid and support to Ukraine because of fears of Russia continuing its conquest after Ukraine, the use of a nuclear bomb in Ukraine would likely cause the rest of the world to immediately step up its involvement due to the possibility of Putin being willing to do the same to the next country.

Sure, but that didn’t help the Argentines during the Falklands War. And that’s really what this conflict would be: a vastly scaled-up Falklands War.

>Even in the case where the US sent 100% of its surface fleet and planes to Taiwan, China's ships and planes (by number) will outnumber those of the US.

You should probably check those numbers. USAF is the largest air force in the world. USN is second. Even when you set aside planes for other theaters, that’s a massive number of aircraft. 

And while the PLAN has more hulls than the USN, tonnage is another story. Many of those ships are coastal patrol craft unfit for the kind of war we’re talking about.

Then there’s perhaps the greatest advantage the US has: friends. Other Asia/Pacific nations would likely join any American intervention to defend Taiwan. This brings more ships, more aircraft, and more bases to launch land-based aircraft from.

Allied forces wouldn’t have to secure air or naval superiority; they’d just have to deny it to the Chinese. Without either of those conditions, securing and maintaining a beachhead on Taiwan would be impossible.

Another important piece of the puzzle is that China isn’t able to *project* naval power globally. Not even after the PLAN finishes its ongoing expansion. This means that regardless of what happens around Taiwan, the USN rules the oceans. Small groups of ships can be left to patrol the choke points of international trade and destroy Chinese merchant shipping.

The longer any war drags, the more it favors the US.

>I think a future conflict with taiwan will not result in any bombardment or invasion, but a static naval blockade. This is normally seen as an act of war, but international law is different when the nation being blockaded isn't seen as sovereign. The US and allies will probably enact sanctions and airlift into Taiwan, but they can't do this indefinitely. China will basically beg the US to fire the first shot.

The flaw in this strategy is that blockades have to be enforced. This means boarding or destroying any vessel sailing into Taiwanese ports, so the US has the initiative here.

Space based detection systems have a great difficulty relaying precise enough information for ground based systems to target a moving weapon. Additionally, one of the problems with space based lasers is that the atmosphere is not nearly transparent enough for energy transmission over such great distances.

I would guess we would easily need multi Megawatt power levels and that simply isn’t even close to development. 

Right now shipboard laser systems have the potential to replace close in weapon systems (CIWS) which have engagement ranges of several miles. I think these lasers are in the 100kW range.

Shorter terms means that they have to pay the loan back faster and can't do as much with it.  Both of them together factor into the price the market is willing to buy them at.

A nation isn't like you or me though.  They can just print money to pay back the loan.  However, that devalues their currency which creates inflation and makes everything cost more.  So the value of my bond is, in real dollars, less and I, as an investor, get screwed.

If I think I'm going to get screwed, I'll charge you more or not buy bonds at all.

Nobody buying bonds means that the only way a government can get more money is to print it, steal it from another nation or raise taxes.

It gets a little more complicated for nations like North Korea where the only use of money is to buy things from other citizens.  In that respect, it's just the internal demand and the government can force people to do work rather than paying them.

>So a bond being sold for 100 USD and 200 USD, the 200 USD one has to be repaid sooner?

Possibly.  It depends on what the Russian government is offering for their bond.  For instance, let's say that they have a $100 bond that they're willing to pay back at .25% in 5y.  So, the ""value"" of that bond is $100.25 and I need to give them $100 and ""park it"" for 5y.  So, is that $0.25 return on my investment worth it?  If not, what would be worth it?

The advantage of a government bond is that it's often guaranteed return so there's very little risk that you'll lose your investment.  But if it's a Russian government bond?  Maybe...not so safe, right?

So, what rate of return over what period do I need to get before I feel safe buying it?

>If the Russian government is the only one selling, than who is buying?

Generally, anyone who is able to do so.  Usually, national bonds are offered in national currency so it would be people that had lots of rubles and needed to put them somewhere safe.  Lots of legitimate and illegitimate actors in and outside of Russia need that.

For instance, China holds a lot of US bonds.  But so do American pension funds.  Each of those have money to spend and bonds are a safe investment.

Russian national bonds are probably similar.

>Does it mean that some people are willing to buy from Russia with higher risk attached?

Yup!  It's all risk vs reward.  That's what drives the price up and down.  National bonds, as a category, tend to be sold to ultra-low risk investors. And a problem with the Russian bonds is that the war in Ukraine has made them significantly more risky.  Especially for foreigners.

>I've also read that the Russian Central bank is buying their bonds to keep the bond price high, how does this make sense?

Yup!  Anyone with lots of liquid capital can effect the markets in this way.  But doing so compounds their exposure to the thing they're trying to prop up.  In a market like Russia, taking the money of a creditor in a bank and using it to prop up bond investments may be good or bad depending on how the investments turn out.  It is very much a way to use private assets to help out the public purse.  The level of corrupt influence between the bank and the government indicates whether creditors should trust the bank with their money or if they should put it elsewhere.

Does that all make sense?  You're starting to get into more of the nuances of government finance and that's a yuuuuuge topic!",False,1647888372.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1jxhgf,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Let's not talk to much about recent bygones however, what's interesting is that the UK never wanted a EU as it is today, even when it was first envisioned in the Rome Treaty. I would call it the biggest failure of british foreign policy, to not managing to stop the formation of the political union on the continent.

It was therefore so funny in hindsight that british people voted to leave the EU, because it didn't turn into what they initially wanted it to be: 

A solely trade focused entity.

Instead now doubly so, they stand outside the very union they have been part of building up. As Britain was at the forefront in including east europe into the union after the fall of the Soviet union, and which has been pushing for inclusion of the balkans and in some ways for Turkey to join as well.

Now instead, they've given up so much of the ''soft'' power over these minor economies they pushed to include in the single market. To Germany and France, which suddenly find themselves in the position to form an even more centralized and capable EU.

Examples of this is the Frontex, the EU led acquisition and distribution of Corona equipment and vaxxs, and now a more aggressive use of the EU central bank, more EU courts overview of EU law through a formalized court ruling, a EU prosecutors office, and a possible EU army. 

For a EU administration of such a relative small size, to involve themselves and gaining legitimacy in involvement in such affairs were unlikely just years ago. It's an interesting time forward, and Britain will be standing outside looking in.",False,1647864022.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1ipdaj,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, including the Spanish–American and Philippine–American wars. At the onset of the 20th century, the United States shaped or installed governments in many countries around the world, including neighbors Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Sooo... your critizing the free market model that the EU did with exports, as them not doing their job as a ''cartel''.

AZ was phased out in Norway and EU because it was seen as too deadly for certain parts of the population compared to extent of the virus spread at that time. Atleast that was the wording in Norway and they and Germany was fairly similar in this assessment from their health sector which had registered the deaths of health professionals blamed on the AZ vaccine. (Blood clots if i remember correctly.)

And yes, the mRNA was developed in the EU, however US comp as you mentioned came with a very large budget and their massive production capacity into a ''joint venture'' with the EU companies to both develope it quickly, and to produce as much as possible as quickly as possible.

And the US naturally would not export until their demands were met, this was by the world seen as dooming their vulnerable populations to death. While the US was vaccinating people who could probably survive the virus, the EU on the other hand focused their acquisitions to vaccine their vulnerable people in all member states. And were open to export during the time they were vaccinating the rest of the population which had less risk of dying from the virus.

Can't really see any big fault in this, there were different priorities, UK leadership wanted a political win with high vaccination rates, even not disclosing the deaths from the vaccine until after Norway and Germany had phased out the use of AZ. 

US leadership wanted a political win with high vaccination rates, and not being blamed by their political opposition of ''letting americans die while foreigners gets OUR vaccines.'' Which i totally understand.

And the EU member states, which after lots of bickering and problems in administrating, distributing and handling this crisis. Individually did impose export blocking of vaccines, like Italy and France. While the EU could not do so by law, as it did not have this power from its members, so basically you're arguing for a more powerful EU ''cartel''.

Which is fair enough, an US style EU federal system would probably be superior to the one it has today. However if so it would need a massive increase in budget and more centralization of power. We might see this in the future, as the EU has shown itself capable in handling numerous crisis the last decade.",False,1647867342.0,t3_tj2zp9,t1_i1iupvl,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

As it did not have the legal framework to do as national central banks would do in times of crisis. And likely was therefore a very small and limited organization compared to the Bank of England or Federal reserve in the US.

What's interesting is how much it changed during the crisis, and how its legal framework to allow it to face such situations were implemented and how the bank has grown in size and influence in just over a decade.

I didn't talk about AZ phasing out of use today, i spoke of the early vaccination process during the Covid crisis, and how the EU focused on mRNA vaccines when the blood clot issues, made the governments put them on hold, and in the end gave AZ vaccines away to poorer nations.

I doubt the former members would join it so easily, as their economies were devasted when the UK joined the EU trading bloc, now i think it's fairly certain they have new deals.

I think Trump is an excellent example of any nation having difficulties, i even see Putin as an example of Russias weakness, he shouldn't have held power for so long, and it seems likely the Russian will pay for allowing it to get this far. Same with China, i expect Xi Jinping to be an example of the weakness of the nations leadership. 

So what becomes of the EU system we do not know, Brexit as well is an example of the EU not being infallible or inevitable. However i do believe its leaders sees the value of unity and cooperation, especially in a ''cartel'' world we have today, with superpowers like US, China and possibly India in the future.

What ways the federal EU might take in the future, might become as controversal as Trump supporting Putin over his own intelligence community.
