Day 182 of my updates from Kharkiv.

As expected today was a pretty awful day, so many missiles were fired at our cities, thankfully many of them were intercepted, but some still made it through. The amount of individual air raid alerts was extremely high. They were popping up one after another, just as the last one ends a new one starts, because either there’s enemy aviation activity over the border, or a missile was spotted somewhere. 

Kharkiv was shelled many times today, we were shelled at least 3 times in the morning alone. Also surprisingly there were 2 intercepted missiles in Kharkiv oblast, and right after one missile was intercepted yesterday too. We don’t know where those missiles were headed, but probably at the city. There was also a second missile strike at 3:50am. Three missiles were fired in total, and all of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, so today no missiles reached the city.

That missile strike on a civilian train was so fucking horrific, they killed 22 people, including a child, and injured at least another 22. Why the fuck are they targeting civilians with expensive missiles? Do they still think that they can scare us, or make us surrender by doing this? They are completely delusional and they never learn. Terror bombing doesn’t work, and it never will. How do they not understand that?

Basically, Russian holidays are very defined in terms of dates, they are strictly from Jun 1 to Aug 31 (repeating kids' school holidays). Idea of the article is that mood of Russians will get significantly worse once September comes. Lots of city folks will return from holidays and their ""dachas"" (summer garden homes, also people should understand that dachas are not privilege of the wealthy people in Russia, even poor families might have dachas in Russia). Once they return from summer cottages/holidays, they will get back to working routine and they will notice decline in economy quite significantly. For example, by comparing cost of preparing their kid for school with last year.

Kremlin is quite worried about this perspective, so they plan to give free money to population to cheer them up (same as they did during covid).

Over the past six months, **Ukrainians have inspired the world with their extraordinary courage and dedication to freedom.**  They have stood resolute and strong in the face of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine. **And today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains – and will remain – a sovereign and independent nation.**
> 
> The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty. As part of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98 billion of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.  This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.
> 
> I know this independence day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks. But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians’ pride in themselves, in their country, and in their thirty-one years of independence. Today and every day, we stand with the Ukrainian people to proclaim that the darkness that drives autocracy is no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere. The United States, including proud Ukrainian-Americans, looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come.

**So what's Ukraine's plan at the moment?**

We know they are shaping things for an offensive, but when, we don't know.

We do know they are striking further into occupied territory and this is to be expected as their capabilities expand. It also *could* be an indicator of the best targets more and more being further away from the frontline - that would be amazing if true.

Ukraine has previously stated about offensive action in August, leading into September. They have also since stated their offensive will be done differently and not waste their strength.

I see two possible outcomes based on different priorities:

1. An offensive prior to Rasputitsa around Kherson and/or Melitopol direction. These possibilities are based on wanting some sort of sellable success soon.

2. An offensive post-Rasputitsa in *pick your area*. This offensive is based on the priority of conserving troop and equipment strength. This is much harder to speculate on due to timelines and force dispositions.

Speculation: It may be that Ukraine wants to conserve forces at all costs and is happy to degrade Russian Kherson elements into a surrender/retreat.

This could be achieved with effective fire support and a reasonable ground force.

This still leaves armoured and mech elements in question, we know they have enough to do something with and have used them in mobile defence and response roles.

So the question is; given Ukraine's internal lines of supply and Russia's splitting of forces between the East and Kherson, what would be the most effective use of force?

*Pure Speculation* but some sort of action in the Melitopol avenue or some sort of ambitious, quick-strike in the Kharkiv-East avenue.

Both provide clear advantages and can be achieved while holding Russian Kherson forces in a degrading state.

If messaging is all about Kherson and Crimea, and there is success elsewhere, Ukraine has played the information and deception spaces exceptionally well.

But deception in the modern battlespace is very hard to achieve due to ISR.

So my father is in India, in the oil import/export business. 

He says after Western countries stopped buying Russian oil and hit Russia with sanctions, the Russians have turned to both India and China to sell all their shit at record discount rates. 

Now business is booming for dad and guess what…India is on selling the oil at much higher prices to, you guessed it, the West (US, UK, EU etc). 

So Russia still gets revenue albeit lower than normal getting around the sanctions, enabling them to prolong the war, and India/China wins. And fuel prices are perfectly normal in India. 

So if you want to really stop the Russian economy, you will need to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism and disincentivise trade with Russia. Without this, the war is going to go on for a very, very long time.",1661333525.0,1661333091.0,t3_ww9c5j,t3_ww9c5j,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

**Is there any confirmation or any more detailed information regarding who is shelling whom at Zaporizhzhia?**

To me there are a few possibilities:

1. Russia is creating false flag attacks to blame Ukraine. It could also be trying to cause irreparable harm to the Ukraine homeland (e.g. nuclear disaster)

2. Ukraine is trying to retake territory and is carefully striking back although trying to avoid a nuclear disaster.

3. Both sides are blowing smoke.

I'm reading a lot of MSM articles and it simply either states that shelling is happening in the third person, or mentioning that both sides are pointing fingers at each other.

**Example 1: [NYT (3rd person)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant.html)**

>On Monday, Ukrainian officials said that there had been shelling again near the plant 

**Example 2: [Reuters (both sides accuse each other, excerpts below)](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-chief-demands-international-access-ukraine-nuclear-plant-after-new-attack-2022-08-08/)**

>Kyiv and Moscow traded blame on Monday for the weekend shelling of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex amid international alarm that their battle for control of the plant could trigger catastrophe.

>Ukraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians.

>Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian attacks had damaged power lines servicing the plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to ""prevent disruption"".

>Reuters could not independently verify either side's account.

**Example 3: [WaPo (Both sides)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/20/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-ukraine/)**

>Russia and Ukraine have each accused the other of attacking the site. International concern mounted in early August, when Russia and Ukraine traded blame for shelling on Zaporizhzhia that damaged parts of the plant.

I listened to [2 NPR podcast episodes](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510366/state-of-ukraine) specifically about Zaporizhzhia and neither is definitively clear about who is doing the shelling. I tried to listen to a longer one by Telegraph, but so far it isn't clear either. Most of these podcasts and news articles focus on assessing the risk of a meltdown, as well as both sides pointing fingers, and finally what the UN and IAEA are saying.

I brought this up earlier but was downvoted to hell, but there's multiple ways to think about the whole situation. The first is that in theory because the power plant is occupied by Russia, shelling would have to come from the other side (Ukraine). The same logic applies where Kyiv is Ukrainian held, so attacks on Kyiv are from Russia. Now the logic may or may not hold up here, and some have pointed out because this is Ukrainian homeland would Ukraine really want to risk a nuclear disaster? And I think it's completely fair to suggest Russia may be inciting false flag attacks. They've done so in the past in other situations. These are all fair points, and completely valid in reasoning.

The problem to me is why is Mainstream Media so tight lipped about this? No MSM outlet has gone far enough to accuse Russia of false flag attacks, yet none have accused Ukraine of performing any shelling. Most just talk about shelling and that's it. Am I just missing something here? Are there reputable milbloggers about this offering more info?

**And before you downvote me for ""just asking questions,"" I think it's in everyone's best interest to demand quality information. I'm not trying to throw out conspiracy theories--in fact I'm suggesting that our brainstorming, biases, guesses aren't what is considered quality reporting, which is why I'm trying to look for journalism confirming what is actually going on. With the amount of disinformation about this war that we've seen so far, it is in everyone's best interest to get factual information on the events and situation.**

**Edit**: I want to be clear that I believe this entire situation was avoidable if Russia simply did not invade, and even after invading, it has [clearly militarized the nuclear power plant](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/europe/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russian-vehicles-intl-hnk/index.html) to use it as a meat shield. What it has done is extremely reckless including [trying to disconnect Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-disconnect-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-power-ukraine-rcna43866) from the grid to send energy to Russian territories instead. I'm not supporting or condoning ANYTHING that Russia has done. I'm trying to confirm information because this subject has been circling around for weeks now and I wake up everyday to shelling reports but without any more details.

>The disappearance of summer holiday optimism  
Two sources close to the presidential administration (AP) told Meduza that the Kremlin’s internal political bloc is discussing and worrying about a possible increase in social discontent among citizens. However, they explained that these discussions are not based on sociological research. “The whole sociology is now focused on elections (in September there is a single voting day in Russia — approx. Meduza), and the budgets for it are rather limited,” explains one of them.  
Both of Meduza's interlocutors describe autumn as a traditional time for the growth of such discontent. According to sources, in the summer social anxieties recede: people are busy with vacations and dachas. In autumn, Russians begin to worry about the difficulties associated with work; they pay attention to rising prices - while the summer holiday optimism disappears. “In principle, summer is a time of some kind of pause: it is warm, light, working days pass in the background. In autumn, everyone understands: winter is ahead, don’t expect good things, ”one of them ironically says.  
Preparing children for September 1 is an additional trigger of social tension. According to one of Meduza’s sources close to the Presidential Administration, people inevitably compare how much they spent on school preparation in 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale war with Ukraine, and how much they spent in the past, and the scale of the price increase becomes obvious to them.  
Both sources draw attention to the fact that the topic of ""special operation"" (this is how Russian officials and official media call the invasion of Ukraine) is beginning to annoy the Russians, ""they get tired of it."" At the same time, the interlocutors emphasize that earlier interest in military operations dampened social discontent: “But we don’t have shelling - even if prices have risen; difficulties for a short time.  
“And in the fall, people will return home both from vacations and from virtual participation in the “special operation”. They won’t like what happens at home,” says one of Meduza’s interlocutors.  
Indirectly, the loss of interest of some pro-government Russians in the war with Ukraine is evidenced by the results of a survey conducted by the private research holding Romir. According to him, the share of coverage of the First Channel has decreased since February 2022 by 8.1%, and the channel ""Russia 1"" - by 8% (both are completely controlled by the Kremlin). Most of the air time on Russian TV is now occupied by political talk shows, where hosts and participants talk about Ukraine and ""hostile countries of the West.""  
How United Russia turned from a party of power into a party of war. And what role did the “watchers from the Kremlin” play in this? Says Andrey Pertsev  
a month ago  
The authorities are preparing to distribute money  
Another reason for the Kremlin's concern is the closure of production facilities in the regions due to the withdrawal of Western companies. Unemployment problems are expected in the Kaluga region, where the factories of large foreign automakers are located, the Leningrad region, where there are also large enterprises owned by Western owners or dependent on Western supplies, and in other industrial regions.  
The political bloc of the Presidential Administration sees the distribution of money to the Russians as the only means of combating the growing social discontent. Meduza’s interlocutors remind that during the COVID-19 restrictions and economic difficulties due to the coronavirus, the Russian authorities financially supported the population several times; as a rule, these measures concerned families with children and were carried out before the elections. “In the autumn they will try to throw money at the dissatisfied. Let these be relatively small amounts, but people will still be pleased to receive them, ”one of Meduza’s sources is sure.  
In the spring, Meduza wrote that the Kremlin’s political bloc was trying to find the contours of an ideology that would explain to citizens why Putin started the war and why Russians must endure economic hardship due to sanctions. However, at that time the development of these ideas was based on the settlement of the conflict through peaceful negotiations.  
Putin is now set on a “long-term war,” three sources close to the Presidential Administration told Meduza about this. The Kremlin is no longer trying to ideologically frame this strategy. The authorities expect that in the near future the discontent of citizens will be able to ""extinguish with money.""",False,1661394654.0,t3_ww9c5j,t1_ilol07i,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

What keeps Ukrainians from launching an offensive at night, starting with sowing chaos right behind enemy lines by special forces? The Russians have limited infrared, the Ukrainians have Javelins which have excellent night vision and allow foot soldiers to somewhat make up for any disparity in armor. Trenches are somewhat mitigated at night, when you can't see much, and you're hearing fighting on all sides. HIMARS and artillery could at least cut holes for soldiers to advance, even if there are not enough to saturate the full front. Everyone talks about the artillery disparity, but Russia would be shooting at moving targets with no good intel on where to aim.

After explaining why Russia must be declared a state sponsor of terrorism, in order to stop profiteering, like your dad is doing, it's ironic that you don't seem to realize that your father is individually sponsoring terrorism, and profiting by doing so.  

And you, by extension are member of a terrorist-sponsoring family. 

I would suggest to you to get your moral shit together and decide for yourself whether what's going on in Ukraine is or isn't terror, and whether or not you support anyone who is profiting from the situation.

You and your father shouldn't need a state declaration to force you to do the morally correct thing.   You can choose to do it all by yourselves.

[edit: and now in this microcosm of post and reply, we can see exactly why Russia hasn't been designated a state sponsor of terrorism... Because everyone (particularly those in petro-industry) has self-interest dealing covertly or overtly downstream from Russia and acts as though it's their right to further their self interest and profit, until some government intervenes and says otherwise.  On the excuse of being just a small fish.  So none of the small fishes act.  Expecting somehow that whoever is steering the whole school of fish will steer for them.  Except, like democracies, that's not how schools of fishes work.  The school is steered by the sum of the individual swimming of the individual little fishes. ]",1661346455.0,1661334963.0,t3_ww9c5j,t1_ilkmev6,,1,-3,0,-3,0,0,

The purpose of the UN is to provide a diplomatic alternative to war. The bullshit, and it is bullshit of course, is inevitable and supposed, in a way, to be the way it works. Without the mouthpiece to spout bullshit and flex on the world, they would just have the other thing: war. 

Basically any diplomacy at all is better than war, because war is the worst humanity has to offer. You're just wanting the UN to be something is can't be and do something it can't do, which is perfectly understandable. But the UN does help: Russia can very visibly see the whole world ganging up to hate them, and can't pretend to themselves that this isn't true. This might reasonably be tempering their strategy, but you can't prove causation that way, when something doesn't happen. Without that, things could be, as bad as they are, even *worse*.

I'm case you have caught on, no - people here aren't afraid of being a little biased in favor of Ukraine and giving them the benefit of the doubt. That's based both on the horrors we do know Russia has committed on Ukrainian soil, and on the instigation principle that, as primary and total cause of the war, Russia has abandoned any claim to sympathy as long as it chooses to remain in Ukraine's borders.

On that basis, yeah - a hard insistence on ""silent until proven"" as the standard of discourse is going to look a lot like you've simply seen people believe Ukraine first and you don't like it, so you want them to shut up (or, at least, you want to use your ""questions"" to ""level the playing field"" as much as possible, when all you're doing is opposing a moral choice people have made and you don't seem to understand).

The beauty (and drawback in this case) of western democracy and free speech is that any idiot/bad faith actor with facebook can spew and spread any disinformation with 0 consequences.
This should in essence be countered by education, leading to a tendency to check the validity of information. 
Sometimes this doesn't work.

Russian propaganda targets exactly this part of the population that is either less educated (both formally and informally), has (valid) grievances like pensions, job security, health issues, etc and tries to play all parties against themselves.

They do this either by bots/shills that go online and  spread false information, false equivalences or other fallacies, or compromised press, or by funding their agents in certain political parties that  use nationalistic/populist discourse, or other sublte methods to sow discontent and them offer Russia as a ""good"" alternative.

In Eastern Europe for example, beacuse the commie past there are plenty of old people that miss those times and are easily swayed since they lack the ""reflex"" to check most information They lived most of their lives when doubting public information was a big no no, and it's not that they wouldn't check it's that they are primed to believe whatever info comes first and fits their ego.

I think the way of spreading misinformation can be understood depending on the target. 

Poor people will believe and vote those that will give them some token ""gifts"".

Uneducated (and straight up stupid people) will believe and vote those that make them feel ""smart"" (rememeber the Covid conspiracies?)

Uninformed people will believe and vote those that seem believable ""prima facie"" and might not spend time and energy to analize context or sources (this is where white lies and fallacies prove usefull)

Most of the categories above will sometimes fight for what they believe to be true, and spread the misinformation further. These are the ""Usefull Idiots"" that spread your propaganda for free.

Also, people have a tendency to fit in. And if all your friends are compromised by propaganda you might start doubting your own information so that you fit in 

If you have a few compromised/bad faith actors with some folowers in the targeted population brackets, you got yourself a cheap, self sustaining propaganda machine in a foreign country.

>Multiple people told you Russia is shelling the plant.

Mutliple people through insults without quoting a single article.

>The US told you it was Russia at the UN today... 

I read the news about the [UN discussion today](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/08/23/world/ukraine-russia-war-news). Where does the US openly accuse Russia of doing the shelling? Here's [another article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220823-russia-ukraine-spar-at-un-over-nuclear-plant-dangers) from a non-US source.

>Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Tuesday over who was endangering the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, as the United Nations urged both sides to insulate the Ukrainian facility from the ongoing war. 

>Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, heightening the danger of a nuclear disaster.

>Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador, countered that Russia is responsible for the risk and must pull its troops away and allow inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency into the plant.

Where does the US say anything accusing Russia today of shelling the plant?

>so did everyone else except Russia. 

Which country's leaders? Which Pentagon officials are openly blaming Russia here?

Again I'm asking for where this obvious information is. I feel like you're so blatantly biased that you don't even care about the actual facts. I've made it clear I'm against what Russia has done with the invasion with its aggression and I'm personally wanting to see Putin completely defeated and thrown out of office, but at the same time I care about the facts. If you don't care about any facts and just want to spew a bunch of unconfirmed info, go for it, but I'd love to see you find a source to back up all these claims that I'm missing the information right in front of me.

I'm happy to be proven an idiot if the information is right there in front of me. I'm only asking for help here because it's clearly not that obvious. There's another poster that talks about fog of war. So which is it?

In the past, media has confirmed plenty of Ukraine claims including the sinking of Moskva, blowing up Russian jets in Saky, etc. So it is possible to attain confirmation. Not saying it's easy, but Western media can absolutely confirm Ukrainian reports.

If you're insistent on the fog of war, then let's just call it that. There's clearly not enough confirming information for the reputable media sources to come out and make definitive claims that one side or the other is doing the shelling here. Accusing me of not liking Ukrainian accounts isn't the truth either. No one should be basing their information solely on one side or another. This is why investigative journalism exists. You're literally ignoring the hundreds of people risking their lives and reporting on information on a daily basis. They do a service to the world by bringing us facts on the ground, supplying photos, videos, etc. As do the citizens of Ukraine.

>Whose incompletely-proven statements do you trust more?

If it were between the two sides of course Ukraine, but let's not pretend information solely coming out of one side has been accurate either. The reality if you look at UK and US estimates of casualties is somewhere in between what the two sides are saying. The two battling sides have their motivations, which is why western media doesn't solely report Ukrainian claims verbatim. They're generally cautious and report claims from both sides, and upon confirmation go out and put their credibility on the line that they believe this is what happens.

Assuming the Russians haven't stolen the diesel generators, or the fuel. 

If coolant is not continuously pumped through a reactor EVEN AFTER SHUTDOWN, the coolant will boil-off, and the core will heat up to past 2000 degrees C.  At that point the steam will split into hydrogen and oxygen, then those gasses will ignite, causing an explosion. Similar to what happened at both three mile island, and fukushima. 

Reactor fuel that was actively critical, will contain decay products which will be generating a large amount of heat for the next 3-5 years; so they need to be actively cooled until those decay products cook-off. 

So no.  Safe shutdown will NOT be fine if they lose their connection to the power grid to provide power to cool those cores.

Now, if Russia does the responsible thing, in that event, and continues to supply those diesel generators, and works to restore the electrical connection, things will be fine.

You basically summed up - the modern movement calling itself ""conservative"" is actually reactionary, and they're being emotionally manipulated by sophisticated and very well-funded propaganda. 

The human brain has a modern, rational part which maintains language and reasoning, and a primitive (by evolutionary standards) emotional part, full of glands and hormones and chemical signals.  

Most of what happens in the primitive part of the human brain, happens without much insight or knowledge by the rational part of the brain. When someone on TV tells you that brown people are coming to steal your jobs and rape your women, your rational brain may tell you that this is nonsense, but the emotional part of your brain is triggered, and those survival instincts that kept our species (and its progenitors going all the way back to the first vertebrates) alive, will do it's job and cause a reaction. 

It's also a risk watching ""conservative"" media: because even if you tell yourself you don't believe something (or someone) - you can still have your emotions triggered in a way that serves the oligarchy which owns the newsmedia worldwide, and wishes the masses to behave in a way that serves the interests of the oligarchy. (mainly: fight each-other rather than fight them and their influence).

 I am not sure about the personnel side of things (training mechanics, etc) but it is one of the most easily *deliverable* aircraft we have. No special coatings, no fancy outboard diagnostics, hell IIRC, it doesn't even have left/right side parts (designed to be interchangeable), and the only truly specific piece of support kit is the cart that they use to feed it the 30mm.

From that stand point it is a good fit because it doesn't require that Ukraine overhaul their flightline to support it, because it was designed to be supported in the field. A Soviet air bunker might be an upgrade from the worst conditions it was designed to be operable in.

Simply throwing around JAQ as a term is meaningless. Reporters ask questions all the time. If what I'm asking is so wrong, then show me why I'm wrong. If you have no thing to contribute except personal attacks, then do you really care about this conflict?

>You really forgot the complete conjecture you made on your own terms, without evidence, in prior post that Ukraine was the one shelling, then ""asking for confirmation"" over and over and over?

Where did I accuse Ukraine of shelling? I stated that this is the narrative being painted by MSM that BOTH sides are accusing EACH OTHER of shelling. If you are referring to my earlier post in the thread, it wasn't an accusation at all. It was speculation that if territory is held by one side, then doesn't it get attacked by the other side? It's ""JAQing"" if you want to slap your stupid term everywhere. That's like asking who would attack Kyiv--logic goes that Kyiv is Ukrainian held, so it would get attacked by Russia. I suggested that using this similar logic I would have assumed that shelling would be coming from Ukraine given the ZPP is Russian held. However, like a responsible person, I wouldn't simply ASSUME something and believe that is the situation on the ground. T confirm/disprove/validate that assumption, I combed through news articles for a better understanding. That's when I noticed that MSM reports don't make it clear at all who is doing the shelling. That is why I'm asking Reddit if there is more information to understand WHO is doing the shelling.

Maybe you lack any critical thinking, and that's fine, but it seems you're so hung up in your own biases, you want to accuse me of everything negative you can think of. You clearly don't care about getting accurate and reliable information. That's just such a shame given how much misinformation Russia has injected into this war. If you don't care about that, then so be it, but don't go attacking people who want information.",False,1661320938.0,t3_ww9c5j,t1_ilk6dlr,,8,-1,0,-1,0,0,

What fucking difference does it make if we just had no reporting on the war from February til now right?

Stop insulting the thousands of journalists on the ground and the thousands of reporters covering and writing articles, podcasts, analysis about the war. Millions if not billions of people benefit from accurate information.
