It's mid-afternoon in Kyiv, seven days after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Here are today's latest developments:

*From CNN*

**Russia squeezes the south**: Russian forces are battling to take control of strategic cities in southern Ukraine, after days of intense fighting.

**Mariupol under siege**: Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the Russian military is creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in the port city.

**Battle for Kherson**: The mayor of the southern city of Kherson indicated it had fallen on Wednesday, saying Ukrainian forces had left. However the situation remains unclear, according to British military intelligence.

**Wave of refugees**: More than one million people have left Ukraine in just a week, according to the UN. 

**Expected talks**: A second round of talks are set to take place in Belarus on Thursday between Russian and Ukrainian delegations. The first round on Monday lasted five hours and ended without a breakthrough.

**Moscow changes tactics**: Russian troops are engaging in more direct attacks on Ukrainian cities after attempts to encircle targets such as Kyiv were frustrated, said a NATO official.

**Shelling in Kharkiv**: In northeast of Ukraine, 34 civilians were killed by Russian attacks on the Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours, emergency services announced this morning.

**Russian isolation deepens**: Sanctions and asset seizures continue to be announced, while Formula One has terminated its deal for the Russian Grand Prix.

**China denies alleged request**: China has dismissed a Western intelligence report alleging that Chinese officials asked Russia to delay its invasion until after the Beijing Winter Olympics had finished.",1646315804.0,1646315650.0,t3_t5ryzh,t3_t5ryzh,,0,410,0,410,1,0,

It sounds like they are “in for a penny, in for a pound”, and are taking the long view on costs. They are “all in” until the democratic Zelenskiy  government is effectively destroyed, and then they will negotiate a “peace” with a new pro-Russian caretaker regime, who will then pursue a ruthless crackdown as Russia moves in to rebuild and control infrastructure. Eventually “elections” would be held.    As far as sanctions go…  honestly, I didn’t think ideology was playing a role here, but now think it is.  An editorial in government controlled press declares the vision of an ethno-nationalist Eurasion empire.  Those in power who share that vision may be willing to see the Russian people wrenched from Western markets and culture, a whatever cost, to create a separate cultural sphere. They have already been bemoaning western cultural influence for years, hypocritical as that is. I think it is a mistake to see the Russian government as merely motivated by personal greed. There is an ideolgy at work. It may be a bizarre Imperial romanticism from another century, but it runs deep.  They seem to believe they are making big history for the glory of Russia, and they seem to believe they are right.

*From CNN's Phil Mattingly and Betsy Klein*

The White House has asked lawmakers to approve $10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for Ukraine as part of a $32.5 billion emergency funding request sent to Capitol Hill as Russia continues its advance on Ukraine.

The request follows weeks of discussions between White House officials and lawmaker about the shape of any potential emergency request, which was expected to focus heavily on Covid-19 needs. But the escalating Russian invasion has dramatically increased the size of the request for Ukraine specifically.

Lawmakers are in the midst of negotiations over a long-term funding deal and face a March 11 deadline to reach an agreement.

The Ukraine funds are expected to be attached to any final deal, but the process remains fluid.

“This request identifies an immediate need for $10.0 billion in additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance for Ukraine and Central European partners due to Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion,” the formal request sent Wednesday from acting Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young to Congressional leadership says. 

Young suggested the initial $10 billion request for Ukraine would address “immediate needs” and more funding could be needed.

“Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, I anticipate that additional needs may arise over time. This funding request is based on the Administration’s best information on resource requirements at this time, and we will remain in touch with the Congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess resource requirements beyond these immediate needs,” she said. 

**More on the funding request**: The detailed request provides $4.8 billion to the Department of Defense, including $1.8 billion for support in the region as US military units support the US European Command and NATO Response Force, $1.3 billion for cybersecurity and other defense support, and $1.8 billion for replenishment of DOD stocks. It also calls for $5 billion for the Department of State and US Agency for International Development (USAID), including $2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance like food and other support, $500 million in military assistance through the Foreign Military Financing program, and $1.8 billion in economic assistance to help “support continuity of government and the resilience of the Ukrainian people, as well as emergent needs in the region.”  

The request also provides $21 million for the Department of Commerce to bolster export controls, $30 million for the Department of Energy to provide “technical assistance for electric grid integration,” $59 million for the Department of Justice to support a newly-announced Task Force KleptoCapture to enforce sanctions on Russia and other funding for the Multinational Task Force, and $91 million for the Department of Treasury for sanctions support and IRS criminal investigations, among other expenditures.",False,1646316276.0,t3_t5ryzh,t3_t5ryzh,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

*From CNN's Luke McGee*

For days, residents of Kyiv had been bracing themselves for a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery to arrive for an assault on the Ukrainian capital.

Days later, they're still waiting.

On Thursday, the UK's defense ministry said the convoy appears to have stalled some 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Kyiv and has made ""little discernible progress"" over the past three days, citing intelligence.

""The main body of the large Rusian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the center of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" the UK statement said.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday night that while the convoy and Russia's broader push towards Kyiv ""remains stalled,"" there was a significant concern ""that maybe the window is closing to be able to get aid into cities that may become under siege.""

A senior US defense official told reporters on that although the convoy is suffering shortages of fuel and food, the US has assessed that the Russians ""will again learn from these missteps and these stumbles and will try to overcome them.""

To answer your question from the previous thread about how the USSR was organized and whether Ukraine and Russia were their own things before it collapsed.

USSR is an acronym, it means United Soviet Socialist Republics. On paper, it was a bunch of semi autonomous regions, like Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia, all working together under a single authority known as the central committee.

Originally, Lenin's idea for the country was to have it be as decentralized as possible. Having the central committee's (the central government) job simply be that of resources allocation while the autonomous regions largely governed themselves through their own elected soviets, workers councils. 

They all worked together out of their own free will, not through force, atleast on paper. Lenin installed these soviets in the first place during the civil war and used force to ensure that the regions remained socialist, but otherwise it was fairly decentralized.

Stalin changed all that and heavily centralized the state, using the central committees control over resources to effectively force more power towards Russia and himself. This forever changed the USSR from a loose group of socialist republics brought together through shared history, ideology and mutual security. Into a Socialist empire centered around Russia. From here on the regions we're really more like provinces then semi- autonomous republics. The name stayed however.

So really, Ukraine was always, atleast on paper, seen as its own state within the larger Soviet alliance. In practice though, it was really a province of a Russian ruled empire for most of it's history within the USSR",False,1646316259.0,t3_t5ryzh,t3_t5ryzh,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

After all, see such sentiment commonly-expressed among Republicans at Trump rallies: 

- https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/9b2_717trump1-3-800x430.jpg

I further will explain why this is relevant on the world stage and Ukraine:

- Giuliani recently gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Observe Sean Hannity praising Putin's manliness while denigrating Obama for wearing a bicycle helmet while, dare I say it, riding a bicycle](https://youtu.be/timvZTKr5HQ)

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data.

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow and met with their government officials.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

I keep using the American civil war analogy with friends -- if the southern states had actually broken off after the civil war there would be a cultural feeling that they were all still the same nation. As leadership shifted a few times, a growing desire to reunite might emerge...a certain number of people on the leaving side would prefer to come back...federal US leadership might interpret that, along with poor ties to the new leadership, as cause to ""liberate"" their sympathizers...Ukraine was once part of Russia, in a very recent past, and Putin remembers that time. He can't get over the idea of them being separate and doing well, especially when 30% of their people wanted to reunite. It's far from a majority but it's enough to make him think he will have support. 

Not justifying him AT ALL, but it seems like a valid comparison to make so US people can understand a little better. Frankly, if Texas seceded from the union of the US and their leadership was hostile/non-friendly towards the rest of the US we might see a similar situation. Estimates were that roughly 30% of people in Ukraine were Russian sympathizers...do you really think numbers in the US would be any different? If Texas or California split off from the rest of the country you would have similarly high numbers of people wanting to return to being ""Americans"".

They want to raze it to the ground and salt the earth beneath it; The only value Putin sees Ukraine having is in being an example to other nations he wants to invade.

As per their most able-bodied men: *Almost.* The majority of the troops being thrown at the conflict right now are conscripts, most of whom are very inexperienced. A small number of those conscripts are also people who've been caught for minor crimes, instead of being sentenced to community service or non-custodial sentencing, have instead been sentenced to military service. The people Putin's throwing at the meat grinder in Ukraine are the soldiers and citizens he wants the very least - the one's who are the least useful to him. It's no surprise that these troops are also being given the bare minimum of the oldest equipment, munitions, gear, etc. Right now these inexperienced troops are being used to push Ukrainian defense forces into clearly-definable defense corridors, which can then later be bombed or shelled. Once Putin burns through his most expendable men, you'll see a dramatic shift in tactics and apparent aptitude from his commanders.

This is why it's *imperative* that we keep pressuring our leaders to keep giving Ukraine whatever they need now - materiel, ammo, arms, vehicles, you name it; they're going to need it.

Russia is just much poorer than China, so they can't afford to have a full time ""National Security"" force. Martial Law is just when you had to use soldiers to occupy your own cities.",False,1646319922.0,t3_t5ryzh,t1_hz6twcb,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

He would never say he rules by force or at his whim. He always tries to justify his action. Even the Ukrainian invasion. The justifications might sound ridiculous to us but we are not the target, the target is a nationalistic nation that has been condition by propaganda for ages.

That's also not proof, because they don't list all the dead, you have to search by name. So unless you search for every single soldier, you won't actually know how many of them died. 

>There is a ridiculous number of international observers and journalists documenting everything

And most of them, including the US, can't corroborate those numbers.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The 'KyivNotKiev' campaign is part of the broader 'CorrectUA' campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Look at how they consider what it means to be “combat ready” and “deployed” for military technology: the sukhoi 57 Felon is considered combat ready despite them having one single working model. They have 12 prototypes. The F-35 wasn’t considered combat ready until a certain active number was reached. Now they’re proliferate around the world. Russia claims to have hypersonic missiles. Every icbm is essentially hypersonic as all that means is 5x the speed of sound. ICBMs travel at 15-18k mph. The glide vehicles are the aspect that need to be hypersonic which to date has not been figured out by the US. Does Russia have that technology, and if so, is it reliable and functional?

They don't.  Russian is a Slavic language, which while part of the Indo-European family, isn't really European.  Other ""distant cousins"" of Russian include Farsi, Kurdish, Tajik, Punjabi, and Afrikaans.

In other words, you have to go way up the linguistic tree to find the common ancestor between Russian and, say, French.

Orthodox Christianity is really the strongest reason to think of them as ""the East.""

We are far from a point of no return. All that's needed to stop this is for Russia to be unable/uninterested in keeping up the invasion. This can happen through a combination of economical (sanction), political (unpopularity at home and abroad) and military means.

Russia has an history of giving up military actions when the cost become too great like in WW1 and in Afghanistan so its not ridiculous to think that the current state, which is weaker than both the URSS and the Russian Empire would fold in the same way.

>Things are escalating quite hard suddenly, with a Putin speech coming up.

The invasion force has performed extremely poorly considering the discrepancy in military power (on paper) and the increasing unstability in Russia might force Putin to put pressure on his own people (through martial law or something else). This is not a good thing for him.

>Even Russians are no longer safe now.

Nor should they. Like it or not, Putin is using *them* (the population) to wage *his* war.

The infantry in a Russian battalion do not have a choice about where they are.  You have the ability to choose whether or not you buy from Exxon.  It really is about you.

We’ve detonated (for test) more nukes than currently exist.  So the raw amount of energy these weapons can release (on a global scale) is not going to create a nuclear winter.

Also, we have the capabilities of shooting down most of the missiles that would be fired.  And those would mostly be fired at strategically important or population dense areas.  Also, nukes can basically only damage surface targets.

So millions would die, not billions.

It's possible, though in my limited understanding very unlikely, that Russia and the US could nuke each other to pieces without triggering a nuclear winter - according to some.",False,1646323981.0,t3_t5ryzh,t1_hz71vup,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Putin - when he says he's going to denazify Ukraine - is evoking those feelings. He is evoking the feelings of Russian people, who have been spoonfed since they were infants what a great power USSR was and how Nazis would not have been defeated without them (truth be told, their contribution was out of this world), and how only USSR was able to win the Nazis. 

And now he says that ukrainians are Nazis, or ruled by them. For your average Russian, it's supposed to evoke a school lesson where they teach how USSR lost 22 million people and how much Soviet blood lies in European soil.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us?

Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

The US has made it clear that the full weight of the US armed forces will come down to retaliate against a member of NATO, but it's entirely possible another member mught not deem it ""necessary "". If Russia tries pushing into Nato territory it is pretty much guaranteed the entirety of NATO is going to drop the hammer. If Turkey decides to start launching missles ar Russian ships and Russia retaliated I doubt anyone would consider Article 5 seriously. The entire article hinges on self defense. You can't punch someone in the mouth and then claim self defense after they retaliate.


Actual text of article 5:
The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

Article 51 of un charter:
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.",False,1646319106.0,t3_t5ryzh,t1_hz6lnpt,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

1. Russia has lost significant numbers of troops and materiel. Even notoriously dishonest Russian state media is reporting huge losses. Some of Russia best trained units have been killed or destroyed. Russia has already committed something like 80-85% of their invasion force and additional troops are unlikely to improve the situation given Russia's logistics challenges. 

2. Russia didn't bring enough forces to fully occupy Ukraine, expecting much lower resistance and higher domestic Ukrainian support which has not materialized.
 
3. Russia is already having logistics trouble feeding their troops and fueling their vehicles. This does not allow them to sustain an expanding front with even more limited logistics.

4. The Russia advance is mostly stalled. Russia's best chance at gains was in the initial weeks of the attack while they supressed known strong-points with cruise missiles, paradrops, special forces operations. Gains will be much harder from here on out. 

5. Russia has burned through more of their smart munitions and cruise missiles.  They will have trouble making more. Ukraine meanwhile continues to receive the highest quality materiel and support from over 30 nations. 

6. Russia has not even taken down the Ukrainian air force and the skies are still being contested after 8 days (let alone the first day air dominance Russians expected.) The Russian air force has continually flown less effective sorties since the invasion began. Likely confirming intelligence assessments about a lack of well trained pilots and maintained aircraft. 

7. Russian forces are demoralized with hundreds having surrendered already despite being the aggressor with a larger conventional force. Ukrainian morale meanwhile is improving rather than falling.

8. Russian combat capability is apparently falling. Their troops are undertrained and casualties will only increase from here.

9. Ukraine has a growing foreign volunteer force that will likely continue to grow, especially if they can begin to reverse Russian gains. Russia has no such international support as yet.

10. The Russian ""pinning"" action on the Donbas is starting to slacken, allowing regular forces to be sent to other areas. 

11. Russia sanctions are starting to take effect and were much stronger than initially planned. The Russian economy and domestic support for the war will likely continue to fall in the coming months. Thousands and thousands of Russians are already arrested. 

12. Initial Russian demands for complete lay down of arms before talks has already been removed (indicating a softening negotiating position) 

13. Ukraine is slowly training and equipping their reserves which will soon begin to relieve front-line units allowing for greater operational mobility.

 >Martial law in Russia (Russian: Военное положение в России) is defined in the Russian law as a special legal regime that is introduced in conditions of external aggression or its threat. In this way, it differs from the state of emergency, which is introduced in the event of an internal threat such as an attempted coup, unrest or disaster. Martial law should also be distinguished from the State of War- a term that refers to the period between the outbreak of hostilities and their end. The procedure for introducing and abolishing martial law in Russia is defined in the federal constitutional law “On Martial Law” (2002).

Only the western part, eastern part is in a conflict since the world war

And in case of defending democracy, what democracy are you defending, us imposed or british imposed or the french imposed. US has been raiding the middle east against dictators right? Why not invade brunei or north korea or saudi arabia, all are dictators tougher than iraqi saddam. No democracy has the right to consider other criminal unless proven guilty, was the us able to find the bio weapons in iraq till today which they justified their war or did they found osama bin laden (of ksa killed in pak)  family trace back to afghanistan.  What democracy are you going to defend.  The democracy that dint take in syrian or rohingya refugees because their skin color was a bit shady but the same one are openly accepting ukrainian refugees.  Or the democracy that is ousting out russian athletes and e gamers out of competitions and sports, but tend to say sports are out of politics when palestine or iraq rejects playing against israel. The democracy that bombed somalia 3 days ago,  supporting a dictator (ksa) to bomb yemeni people. Which democracy should we protect. And which source should i believe the ones that said the 13 ppl including 8-10 yrs old droned down were afghan and taliban spies or the ones that said they were just unloading groceries into their home. We are being manipulated in the name of democracy, else epstein would have never just suicided in a secure prison with no rope that could hold his wt for the suicide to occur.

Russian cash went to funding the pro brexit message. Those messages convinced some people to vote for brexit. This is literal influence.

Given the overall vote went very narrowly in favour of leave (2%), you can see why it may be reasonable to conclude Russian influence affected Brexit.

Scotland being “immune” isn’t something you can realistically prove; many voters there still voted for brexit, even if the percentage favoured remain overall. I also think it’s notable that Holyrood and Edinburgh in general appears to have less problems with Russian cash than London, which would go some way to explaining why they were “immune” (if that were true).

Again, I’m not saying the Brexit was good or bad; I’m not saying there will be a second referendum.

An immediate war with the USSR would have been a very bloody conventional war. The US had, at the time, 3 bombs - one was the trinity test, one was an untested design dropped on Hiroshima and the other was the same design as trinity dropped on Nagasaki. These three weapons were very much still prototypes and it's somewhat surprising all 3 of them went off. Note also these are *bombs* and needed to be dropped from *bombers* for which you need air superiority - like the US had against the Japanese but would not have had flying over Eastern Europe to get to Moscow.

> How do you feel about Ukraine right now?

I feel awful, and I feel fully justified in supporting Russia's exclusion from the global economic system. I don't, however, see how this either defends your claim that the US is some righteous vanguard of justice, or your claim that we can forcible de-nuke the world like this.

> US/EU are a unifying force, believe it or not. You don't need to believe me here.

I believe you. I am very much a European in both nationality and sentiment. I do not, however, blindly believe either are a paragon of truth and justice and I can see very compelling reasons that other countries would not trust the US's good intentions. Why should a Russian or Chinese trust the US would demilitarize after they did. All they'd see is a guy saying ""I'm going to nuke you if you don't get rid of your nukes"" and then what? ""I'm going to invade you with the threat of nukes you don't have""? And once again, the US has a track record of travesties - you cannot no true Scotsman them away and they'd definitely play on the fears of other nuclear powers.

Finally, what's to stop these countries proliferating again once the US has got rid of their own nukes? It's not like the science is arcane and unknowable.

Finally I want to talk about other WMDs.
