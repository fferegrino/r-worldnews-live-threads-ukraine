TL;DR - these mobilized guys are probably going to be sent into battle with a rifle that may not work, malnourished and possibly with hypothermia, not even guaranteed to be in any kind of uniform. I'm not sure Ukraine will even need to be all that worried about Russia's so called ""gloves off"" moment.

>Mobilization, as you can probably understand: we have an emergency. There is no money in the budget provided for it, there are no ready-made places in training centers, there is no stock of clothes, there are no plans to provide meals, and logistics have not been calculated. Let's just try to figure out how much the mobilization of 300 thousand people will cost.

>The military commissar of Yakutia said that the mobilized would receive 205,000 rubles a month. Multiply by 300 thousand people. That's 61.5 billion rubles (about $1 billion US) a month. Three months - 184.5 billion rubles ($3.06 billion US).

>Each summoned is entitled to equipment. Clothes, shoes, body armor. On the forums of PMCs, you can see that their fees cost at least 100 thousand rubles per person, if you buy everything yourself. Suppose that the state will spend at least 30 thousand rubles for each. That's 9 billion rubles ($150 million US)

>Soldiers still need to be fed at the very least. Let's say that the food of one person costs 300 rubles a day (I don't know what you can feed for this money). This is 90 million rubles a day or 2.7 billion rubles a month ($44.8 million US). That is, for three months - 8.1 billion rubles ($134 million US).

>It turns out that in three months about 200 billion rubles ($3.32 billion US) will have to be spent on 300,000 mobilized people. And that's not counting weapons, transport, medical expenses. Where does such money come from? So I guess how it will be. Either no one will pay, or they will pay the minimum. Meals - dispossessed of one of the private companies for free supplies. They will collect from warehouses what was lying around from clothes - and forward to the front line, in winter, to freeze and die not so much from shelling as from pneumonia. And to place 300 thousand people will only work in the trenches, in the rain and snow. If there are enough weapons and body armor and helmets for everyone, it will be amazing. Rather, the principle of the salvation of the mobilized will be the work of the mobilized themselves. This is what autumn and winter are like.",False,1663834583.0,t3_xkl3su,t3_xkl3su,,0,80,0,80,0,0,

They also wanted to know the same breakdown in regards to sanctions on Russia.

I also wanted to know these answers so I did some research.

First, in regards to appropriations, the president doesn't matter as much as congress does because they approved / allocated the money to be appropriated.

However, the president does matter in term of implementation of said appropriations and in terms of implementing sanctions (as will be seen below).

&#x200B;

These appear to be the bills passed by congress appropriating money / supplies to Ukraine from 2014 through today:

* STAND for Ukraine Act
* Ukraine Freedom Support Act
* Ukraine Security Partnership Act
* Ukraine Security Cooperation Enhancement Act
* Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act
* Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act
* Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act of 2022
* Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022

Caveat: there is \~180 million in security aid for Ukraine prior to Biden that I am not sure who authorized or when.

&#x200B;

**Obama administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>Between 2014 and 2016, the Obama administration committed more than $600 million in security aid to Ukraine.While the Obama administration refused to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons in 2014 to fight Russian-backed separatists, it offered a range of other military and security aid including counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies, according to the Defense Department. The U.S. also pledged 230 Humvee vehicles.  
>  
>In the last year of the Obama administration, the U.S. established the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provided U.S. military equipment and training to help defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million for this initiative.  
>  
>**Sanctions**:  
>  
>Before 2014, the United States had imposed relatively few sanctions on Russia, primarily targeting members of terrorist groups and transnational criminal organizations. However, in response to Russia’s territorial aggression in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States introduced numerous sanctions on Russia, designating 95 entities and individuals involved in Russia’s malign activity in Ukraine in 2014 and an additional 132 designations and 143 designations in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These sanctions made up the vast majority of sanctions on Russia during this time, accounting for 370 of the 429 Russia-related designations from 2014 to 2016, or over 86 percent.

&#x200B;

**Trump administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>The Trump administration in 2017 agreed to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, later committing to sell $47 million in Javelins.  
>  
>In 2017 and 2018, the Trump administration approved DoD and State Department allocations per acts approved in prior years. This amounted to \~250 Million per year.  
>  
>In 2019, Congress passed the ""Ukraine Security Partnership Act"" providing for \~400 million in additional security aid:  
>  
>The $250 million Defense Department’s tranche was set to include sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection and secure communications, night vision equipment, and military medical supplies and treatment. The department previously included counter-sniper equipment, Humvees and tactical drones as well.  
>  
>The State Department funding included $141 million for a broad array of purposes, to buy American-produced weapons through the Foreign Military Financing program, but also to provide advisers and training to boost Ukraine’s NATO interoperability: English language labs, medical equipment and improvised bomb simulators. The funds could also pay for spare parts, sustainment and training for previously purchased U.S. gear.  
>  
>Trump delayed the release of this $391 million congressionally approved security assistance for Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden.  
>  
>**Sanctions**:  
>  
>During the Trump administration, the rate of new sanctions on Russia slowed but took on a broader focus, with new sanctions targeting malign cyber activity, election interference, and Russia’s support for countries like North Korea. For example, new cyber sanctions on Russia-linked entities accounted for 69 designations during the Trump administration. The Trump administration issued 273 designations from 2017 through 2020 on Russia-linked individuals and entities, of which 131, or just under 48 percent, were related to Ukraine.

&#x200B;

**Biden administration**:

>**Appropriation Implementation**:  
>  
>In total, the United States has committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration in January 2021. Since 2014, the United States has committed more than $15.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.Since February 24, 2022, US security assistance committed to Ukraine as of August 24, 2022, has included the following:

>As of August 24, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has imposed more than 1,500 discrete sanctioning actions on over 800 targets related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, almost 1,000 foreign companies have “self-sanctioned” by shuttering or curtailing their operations in Russia, which has contributed to Moscow’s financial isolation from the global economy.

- On 21 September 2022, Russia's Putin announced a 'partial mobilisation' to support operations in Ukraine. Russian Defence Minister Shoigu later confirmed this would involve the mobilisation of 300,000 reservist troops.

- Russia is likely to struggle with the logistical and administrative challenges of even mustering the 300,000 personnel. It will probably attempt to stand up new formations with many which are unlikely to be combat effective for months. of these troops,

- Even this limited mobilisation is likely to be highly unpopular with parts of the Russian population.

We can and must oppose <...> And also a protest in the interests of millions of our fellow citizens. Especially women whose fathers, husbands, sons and brothers the regime wants to use as cannon fodder. <...> In the end, getting a fine or several days of arrest is better than getting a funeral,” Viasna said in a statement.

>What you need to know. On September 21, the largest rally in the past six months took place in St. Petersburg - a rally against mobilization, at which at least 536 people were detained. The police used force against the protesters. During the arrest at Gostiny Dvor, one of the protesters broke his arm in two places and smashed his phone. 

Of course there won't be much optimism here that we'll see anything bigger than last time. I still think it will take time for a large number of people to comprehend their new reality, but who knows, by then probably everyone will know someone who's been taken away.

First time offenders are mostly let off with a warning. Of course, being beaten with an iron pole is still quite likely!

My bet is that an average “mobbie” will have about 10-20 hours from the moment they’re mobilised to the moment they’re in Ukraine.

> Putin emphatically did not say that the Russian nuclear umbrella would cover annexed areas of Ukraine nor did he tie mobilization to the annexation. He addressed partial mobilization, annexation referenda in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, and the possibility of nuclear war in his speech—but as separate topics rather than a coherent whole. The fact that he mentioned all three topics in a single speech was clearly meant to suggest a linkage, but he went out of his way to avoid making any such linkage explicit.

> Putin framed his comments about the possibility of Russian nuclear weapons use in the context of supposed Western threats to use nuclear weapons against Russia. He claimed that Western officials were talking about “the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia.” He continued, “I wish to remind those who allow themselves such statements about Russia that our country also has various means of attack...”  His comment on this topic concludes by noting that Russia would use all means at its disposal in response to a threat to “the territorial integrity of our country, for the defense of Russia and our people.” That comment could be interpreted as applying in advance to the soon-to-be annexed areas of occupied Ukraine, but its placement in the speech and context do not by any means make such an interpretation obvious. Nor is Putin’s language in making this comment different from formal Kremlin policy or from previous statements by Russian officials. Putin’s speech should not be read as an explicit threat that Russia would use nuclear weapons against Ukraine if Ukraine continues counter-offensives against occupied territories after annexation.",False,1663865112.0,t3_xkl3su,t3_xkl3su,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

1. They all support the war, or like, the vast majority over 80% do
2. They all hate the war and don't support it, but are too afraid to speak out

I am here to say that the story is not quite so black and white, and in reality it's definitely more of a gray area that leans towards most Russians supporting the war, at least in part.

First, Crimea. Most Russians support the illegal annexation and occupation of Ukrainian Crimea. In their minds its a settled and done fact that Russia owns it now, and many view  the Referendum there as legitimate. So as much as the last 8 years of this conflict can be viewed as the prelude to this full scale invasion, Russians do generally support that decision. Even Navalany, who is often lauded here as some sort of white knight savior of Russian democracy and liberalism, supported the Annexation. Probably close to 80-90% support this.

DPR/LPR: the state-lets Russia ""Supports"" (created) are a similar situation, most people believe the state media narrative on the Donbas. They are Russians who want to be in Russia, they all speak Russian and when they tried to make that happen Ukraine began a genocide against them ""bombing them"" for 8 years. The majority of Russians believe this narrative, but not as thoroughly as they believe in the annexation of Crimea. Somewhere around 70-80% support this

The invasion: The initial invasion was also widely supported, state media set the stage and made the justifications for years in preparation and most of the public was at least somewhat receptive of it. One concept I heard was of the the apathetic supporter. A person who would've never thought that Russia *should* invade, but now that they have, that they should *finish* the invasion. This is distinct from lacking support for it. This is the first issue where any real contention begins, a majority support the invasion, but likely closer to 60%. The remaining 40% are either against it, or too apathetic to do anything. 

The mobilization: this is the big unknown, will public opinion shift rapidly? will people try to pretend it doesn't exist? will anyone against the war try to flee anyways? Who knows, I would guess that it will push public opinion against the war, but if it leads to (even momentary) military success for Russia it will likely increase support for the war. If it goes bad, we may see a first for the war where less than 50% of Russians support the war.

So my assessment is this, most Russians support the war, but by no means everyone. There remains a solid base, in the double digits, of people against the war even up to the issue of Crimea. You cant just put a simple number to it, as some people support only some aspects of the war. Also there seems to be both a generational divide and rural/urban divide. Young people in cities are seemingly the most against the war, while older and rural people are the most in favor.

The information is an assment of conversations I've had with primary sources of Russians either A) still in Russia or B) who fled as well as  publicly available polls from within Russia.

tl;dr: most Russians support the war, mobilization may change that, but there still remains some amount of opposition, probably less than 30% of Russians. I don't think these protests will topple the government.",False,1663828641.0,t3_xkl3su,t3_xkl3su,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

It takes less than 10 minutes to reload a HIMARS with a new pod of 6 missiles. 

In 2021 USA was producing 9,000 M31 missiles per year.  1500 pods per year.  Less than 5 per day.  A single HIMARS vehicle, just one, could drive for 50 minutes into the combat zone.  Then calmly adjust targeting, fire the missiles, then drive for 50 minutes toward another pod being delivered.  They can piss and eat a snack between these cycles. 10 hours is a bit of a long day which speaks for training extra HIMARS crews so that they can rotate.    

It is possible the Lockheed will increase production.  I do not think numbers have been announced.  USA had some in inventory but total ever produced was recently 50k and many of those were fired in Afghanistan.  

The 9000 per year is not a small number.  Thousands of pieces hardware destroyed or disabled is extremely disruptive.  Ukraine can be selective and destroy vehicles (or hardware) that are located in positions that are inconvenient for Ukraine.  

You are correct about the pods.  One M31 pod is 6 times as many shots as one ATACMS pod.  The pod delivery rate is the limiting rate. (Person i was replying too said 16 HIMARS was not enough and that there was plenty of ammunition but ATACMS would be an inefficient use of those 16 HIMARS)

Due to Putin’s recent, major escalation, I strongly support harsher economic sanctions, including declaring Russia a state sponsor of terrorism due to their attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and their funding of the Wager terrorist group, as well as more military aid including: M1 Abrams tanks, ATACMS missiles, F-16 fighter jets, and increased training for additional Ukrainian soldiers. Additionally, I also support visa restrictions for Russian nationals, especially those connected to the military or government.

The most recent example of this is the idea that Putin would never declare a mobilization. Mark Hertling -- a *very* smart and very experienced man -- described Putin's actions as 'jaw-dropping'. I feel the same too.

I feel like I no longer have any real idea of how this conflict might look even a month or two from now nonetheless a year later (if it even lasts that long). I also get the feeling that reading more analysis isn't going to be very helpful.

Move some tactical nuke related hardware  around for Ukraine / NATO to see as a show of strength and willingness to use them. Announce that the ""special military op"" is finished, call a ceasefire, and make a show of pulling stuff back into new territory, and assure everybody that no further military action will be taken against Ukraine - as long as they promise to respect new borders. Offer to trade any remaining prisoners. Offer to sign some sort of peace treaty guaranteeing Ukraine's safety. Hell, they could even ""suspend"" the mobilization to keep the Russian population happy and also make it seem like de-escalation.

Now, obviously, why would Ukraine settle for that? Not only would it be ridiculous to let Russia get away with that considering their past promises, but it also only works with Russia in a position of strength. The fact Ukraine is kicking Russia's ass makes the idea of Ukraine just giving up that land even more laughable.

*However*, it absolutely will cause pause for thought. Even taking tactical nukes out of the equation, the thought of ending this war will be appealing to many. Ukraine could also be rushed into NATO (or placed under NATO special protection of some sort) with no-fly zones along the disputed borders. At that point we have a stalemate. Russia says ""attack our new land and we use tactical nukes"" and NATO says ""take one step past your new land and face the full power of NATO"".

This is the only way both sides can say they get something worthwhile. Putin claims he won and the operation was a success. Ukraine (while obviously not happy in the least) is now part of NATO and the EU with all the protection and economic benefits that offers.

What they get will be old and non-functional, but it will come largely out of these people's pockets and the remainder isn't that difficult to subsume.  Russia is still making ~$20 billion USD on oil, monthly, even if gas is well below average at the moment.  

The thing about a state that has to make a large profit every year to break even because so much is stolen through grift and embezzlement along the way is it can cut down on the largest sources of embezzlement whenever it wants to and essentially incorporate those people's savings into its budget for good measure.  

For another nobody expects Russia to actually pay these people.  They are routinely withholding pay from existing units in Ukraine.  They'll say there's a three-month minimum before you start earning or it's contingent on victory or some such thing.  They don't even have to worry about Victory Day for nearly a year.  

Basically the results of that 'math' there are very doable with the current Russian budget.  However...it's a huge underestimate of the actual expense of war.  It isn't just itemized clothing and ammunition, or paychecks.  They need repair crews, electricians, road materials;  even at forced labor that's parts and cost of improving production for parts and materials.  The existing bases, even on the Russian side of the border, aren't equipped to house that many units, so you're also building new bases or at least large annexes and barracks from scratch.  

Russia [was estimated](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/18/russian-defense-spending-surges-to-300m-per-day-amid-ukraine-war-a77712) at spending ~$300 million USD a day back in May with a smaller force.  That's $9 billion USD a month.  Now you have to more than double that, and add on investment purchases like the expanded bases and equipment probably from China.  Russia will end up spending over $20 billion a month, easy, assuming they get all 300,000 active at the same time.  And that's where it'll begin to add up.  

TL;DR:  They can totally match an increase of $3 billion USD in three months.  That's really nothing at all and shouldn't make anybody gasp.  *But* they're actually going to be spending a great deal more than that, and it's a high enough amount that it's worth asking how long it can be sustained (a year?  half?).",False,1663836147.0,t3_xkl3su,t1_ipfz6l0,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

The difference is that Ukraine is training them better/slower and does not at the moment need to put them directly on the front lines.

The key difference is that Ukraine has less, but better equipment and is getting more every day. And that for right now at least, the new soldiers can work behind the front lines for a while gaining experience instead of being thrown into the meat grinder.

Both countries have economic problems and will struggle with logistics, but Ukraine has western support, Russia has Iranian and Belarusian support.

While these new Russian troops will likely cause problems for Ukraine, it's doubtful that they will have an impact on the outcome of the war. Mobilization will farther destabilize Russian society though.

All of these tenants create an environment that can support a persons pursuit of virtuous actions or selfish material actions. Whether you think one dominates the USA or another the fact of the matter is if there weren’t a condition, an environment to allow CHOICE, there couldn’t exist either. The richness of the belief in freedom is so engrained in the country that the alternative of oppression is equally respected, understood and rich. Whether someone clings to the affluence of a grocery store in every  town, a giant tv, a fancy car, or  the freedom to speak against a corrupt politician, have the right to a fair trial, and be protected against government intrusion, both the materialist and the virtue seeker understand that if they can’t have what they want the other option is oppression, is tyranny. Don’t count Americans out from knowing and deeply understanding  what a dystopian path could lead to.

First of all, you have been in that prison for a reason. Maybe you were a murderer. Maybe you just stole something. It's not like prisons are exclusively for political prisoners. So no, the country did not wrong you, statistically speaking.

Second. You are a 'murican. It is the best country in the world. Currently it's fighting against those stinky Mexicans who are utterly corrupted and also wanted to give some military bases to Yuropeans who finally showed their true colours and now want to attack your glorious country. Yes, life is tough in the USA, but where isn't. Besides, it's the best country in the world.

You also know that Mexicans would cut your balls and cook them with tequila. The TV said that. You don't trust the TV, sure, because you know it's controlled by Murdoch and american oligarchs but maybe there's something on those rumours anyway. Besides, we all know that Mexicans simply don't have the culture and the gracious behaviour of you, happy citizens of the USA. They are just dumb villagers.

You heard that your army is losing in Mexico. But that's all because of some corrupted generals, or similar officers. They are the reason why you're losing, temporarily of course, and as soon as your Prezzident will be properly briefed, he will certainly kick them out. Maybe you are even truly concerned, there's a lot of our guys dying down in Tijuana and you heard that you've been pushed out from Monterrey. Not good. But hey, it's a risk that could pay out. Or do you want to rot in your prison for another 10 years?

Now think about it. Why the hell would you ever surrender to those clearly inferior soldiers from Mexico, why would you risk that they would kill you or maim you while you'll be surrendering... when you can jsut stay at the base and be under the protection of the mighty U.S. army?

Russia has put itself in a position where it doesn't have a lot of options, and Ukraine has goals that sure, they may be able to achieve it militarily, but will they be able to enforce it politically, as in get Russia to concede defeat.  


We are in this very difficult situation where, neither side can ""win"". Because to win you need to force the other side to accept that you won. So lets go with the Ukraine victory, retaking all of its occupied territory, including retaking Crimea. Victory right? well, what if Russia says No, what then? perpetual war?  


I know that some may say that Putin will be depose if that were happen, but honestly i don't think any of us can be sure of that outcome, Putin has demonstrated a level of grip over Russia that rivals the level of grip that Stalin had. And even if that were to happen, there is absolutely no guarantee that the next guy in charge won't be even worse. So i'm genuinely skeptical of any prediction of the fall of the regime.  


I find it a bit worrisome how many people seem to disregard Russia's nuclear threats so easily, I believe that they are legit, because Russia doesn't have a lot of options, if its conventional army fails in Ukraine, they have no other option but to accept defeat, or escalate, again, and the only escalation after the failure of the conventional army will be nuclear.  


Don't get me wrong, I DO NOT believe that the west should surrender to Russia, or that it should force Ukraine to negotiate. This should be a decision for Ukraine, and the west should support Ukraine so that they can actually be in a position to make a decision, and not have a decision be forced upon them by Russia.

Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1953 out of unknown reasons – in secret and in a likely even illegal move. It wasn't really an issue at this time because Russia and Ukraine were both in the soviet union – which gave Russia the opportunity to simply continue to russify the region. Because of this there was a huge separatist movement in Crimea long before Russia invaded. This also allowed Russia to annex Crimea rather peacefully which – together with the mostly unified media – helped to convince the Russians that this was the right move.
2. The ""escapees"" that are allowed to speak in russian media simply tell a different story where the Ukrainians are the source of all evil and Russia was the bright White Knight.

Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused


Don't these talking monkeys know that
Eden has enough to go around?


Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it
Right in two


Angels on the sideline
Baffled and confused
Father blessed them all with reason
And this is what they choose?


Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over
Pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys
Give them thumbs, they forge a blade
And where there's one they're bound to divide it
Right in two


Right in two


Monkey killing, monkey killing monkey over
Pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys
Give them thumbs, they make a club
To beat their brother down
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here


Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two


Fight till they die over sun, over sky
They fight till they die over sea, over air
They fight till they die over blood, over love
They fight till they die over words, polarizing


Angels on the sideline again
Benched along with patience and reason
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering where this tug of war will end

In early 1945, with Germany's defeat inevitable, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin set his two marshals in a race to capture Berlin. Although the race was mostly between one another, both marshals were supported by other fronts.

I think the wild cards here are: What shape Russia's nukes are in, probably not much better than the rest of the military frankly, and does the US have anti-missile tech capable of knocking out a significant number of whatever Russia can launch.

Western aid gives out and Russia takes Ukraine; Russia somehow pushes Ukraine out of the oblasts fully: Two scenarios where he's hoping that the war could taper down to another frozen conflict and keep suppressing dissent. He might even claw back a legacy by being the man who took those regions.

Ukraine pushes Russia back slowly. It's a long grind, and a lot of soldiers die for it. In fact, it's such a long grind that it becomes the new normal. Tempers die down as people acclimatise again to ""This is just how it is"". He might not regain popularity, but it saves his own hide.

If the Russian MoD puts out some insane press release, or some Russian politician says something inflammatory and scare-mongering, they report it. It's your job, or the one of news organisations that buy Reuters' pieces, to add opinion and judgement.

You could also be saying that their filter on what to report or not is biased toward things that get clicks. Sure, to some extent as they're a business, but as a news agency they only filter in ""verifiable"" and ""of public interest or not"", not in ""societal implications of publishing this"". High ranking politicians of a UNSC member state threatening nuclear war ticks the boxes. In general, verifiable facts of public interest that get clicks usually do so because they're genuinely interesting and have value in being shared, so I don't see what's wrong with that. Since most people don't consume news straight from reuters or AP, the third filter, which you're looking for, is done by newspapers, TV news, etc.

TL;DR: It's not Reuters' job to do geopolitics by deciding not to publish Putin's latest rant just because he clearly appears to be bluffing. Reuters reports it, but it's up to news organisations and you personally to decide what to do with that and whether to amplify it or not.

> Many people ask, when Navalny becomes President, what will he do with Crimea? And the question is not very easy. On one hand, the annexation of Crimea was a crime against Russian interests, a violation of international treaties, it caused sanctions, it caused isolation. On the other hand, unfortunately, the idea of the annexation of Crimea was so popular among many Russian voters between 2014 and 2021. Imagine any next President of Russia. If they were publicly advocating for the idea of giving Crimea back to Ukraine—before this war, they would probably be ousted. We hope the Russia of the future will be a democracy, and in a democracy, the opinion of the voters counts, and is important. And this created a very complicated puzzle for the next president. Well, now I believe that after this war, it’ll be very clear that in order to rebuild relations with Ukraine, to return to the civilized world, Russia will just have to do it.",False,1663830531.0,t3_xkl3su,t1_ipft74t,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The region wanted to secede from Ukraine and claim an independent state. A lot of Ukrainians were abducted and removed from the general population before this war and the War in Donbas. Putin supported Donbas succession, but he never wanted to openly state “this land is mine”, even though we see his imperialistic intentions. Putin has the heart and support of the Russified Ukrainians in that region as well as the migratory Russians who live in Donbas to help round out the population with their existence and attractive living conditions. Before these wars, Donbas was apparently one of the most beautiful places in Ukraine. 

Due to Ukrainian governmental neglect, an inability to grasp control on the region politically, corruption, as well as Russian meddling, the correct political pieces took charge of Donbas and began pushing the narratives that these people were different from Ukrainians and that it’s attractive to have Russia coalesce with them. 

With the war in Donbas, Ukrainian shelling, there was enough populace of radical thinking individuals to push their secession beliefs - and to be honest, they kind of chose to live as a totalitarian shithole. 

The Donbas region is a totalitarian government, globally recognized to be run by terrorist republics. Travel and living in the region was/is difficult because of the societal conditions - imagine your neighbors turning against you and reporting you to authorities because they had a hunch you arent totally with them on this secession. Officials in Donbas monitored everything (phones, agendas, personal and travel records). The people who are reported would basically be thrown into the “modern-day gulags” of the region, thought to be worse than the gulags we traditionally came to learn about in Russian history. 

It’s a very complicated messy situation and Russian meddling in the region has gotten to a very solidified point in favor of Russia annexation or in favor of independence. 

Then with this war of course, some realize that living under Russian rule isnt attractive because of how they treat Ukrainian peoples….especially in military zones. Rape is widespread, forced conscription through trickery, systemic executions. For instance, one story (i dont remember if it’s Luhantsk or another city) involved the use of fire alarms in a large apartment building so that everyone ran outside and clear the building…..this tactic was used to effectively and easily count and choose the men that will be conscripted into LNR/DNR forces.",1663854704.0,1663854098.0,t3_xkl3su,t1_ipfrhnk,,7,2,0,2,0,0,
