>☠️ The Legion ""Freedom of Russia"" and the RDC held a joint press conference in one of the border regions of Ukraine. Caesar's words:

> 1. Our struggle continues : the operation in the Grayvoron region was successful and its goals were achieved. The enemy is defeated, part shamefully fled; we captured a large amount of equipment and took prisoners. We will not betray the idea of a Free Russia, the hope of Russians, we will return truth and justice to Russia. We will come again. Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh, Rostov, Moscow - wait for us.

>2. In the Belgorod region, we witnessed the unscrupulousness and cruelty of Putin's troops: while the legionnaires were passing through settlements without touching the locals, the cannon artillery and aircraft of the RF Armed Forces were working in peaceful cities. Is this the same concern for citizens that the Kremlin is talking about? We proved that Putin's troops were completely unprepared for the organized resistance of the Russians and are ready to wipe out their own lands from the face of the earth, so as not to show weakness.

>But the truth is that the RF Armed Forces are demoralized and unprepared. They practically did not carry out resistance, despite the huge numerical superiority. Because our goal is not purses and power, but liberation and justice in Russia, and the truth, as we know, always wins.

> 3. Together with the RDK on the territory of Russia, we used the equipment that the army of the Kremlin zombies had taken away from the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Bakhmut. We successfully ""retrofeiled"" this technique and returned it back.

>4. The total losses for the operation amounted to 2 people dead and 10 wounded . In contrast to the hypocritical statements of propagandists who are unable to win and therefore paint huge losses for us.

>🫡 Eternal glory to the dead, and honor to the living! We will return home: to Belgorod, and to Moscow, and to Vladivostok. Russia will be free!

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 May 2023.

&#x200B;

* Credible research by independent Russian journalists suggests that between January and May 2023, Russian military courts dealt with 1,053 cases of personnel going absent without leave (AWOL) – more than during the whole of 2022.
* Russia’s military has struggled to enforce discipline in its ranks throughout its operations in Ukraine, but its issues have highly likely worsened following the forced mobilisation of reservists since October 2022.
* Court data suggests that most of those found guilty of going AWOL are now punished with suspended sentences, meaning they can be redeployed to the ‘special military operation’.
* Russia’s efforts to improve discipline have focused on making examples of defaulters, and promoting patriotic zeal, rather than addressing the root causes of soldiers’ disillusionment.

He was then nowhere to be found while the units under his command were obliterated during the Second Battle of Lyman. Lapin subsequently got into a social media spat with Kadyrov and got himself fired.

This is the first time since then General Lapin is back in the news. He's being ridiculed by pro-Russian sources for barking nonsensical orders which no one is following, in a location far removed from the action several days after the enemy has left, and running around in a poorly fitting vest out in the open without a weapon or a radio.

> “There was no shelling from the Uragan MLRS systems from Ukraine. We ourselves fired on the Graivoron border crossing point using 120 mm mortars, ”said the source. According to him, the border crossing was well fortified, but ""when we went on the attack under the cover of a tank, all the defenders fled."" One of the fleeing Russians died when things, according to the raid participant, ""got a little out of hand."" Another border guard, who had been hiding for several hours in the basement, was taken prisoner.
> 
> He also confirmed that the footage showing two American HMMWVs was taken on that spot, with the jeeps crashing into the trenches at the checkpoint.
> 
> After the checkpoint was captured we began to spread out according to our plans. The first wave went and warned civilians not to leave their houses and apartments. They reached the district center quickly. When the second wave arrived, including me, there was not a soul in the villages. Dead streets.
> 
> According to the source the Russian forces ""woke up"" only after a few hours, began to pull up their units, artillery and aircraft and began to fire, and the goal was ""not only the outskirts, where the fighters of the RDK and the Freedom of Russia Legion were located, but also the buildings which, as they assumed, we captured - the department of the FSB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the administration building"".
> 
> A participant in the raid stated that there were lightly wounded among his comrades-in-arms, while, according to eyewitnesses, there were many civilian casualties. Among the Russian military, according to him, there are significant losses in killed and wounded.
> 
> Serious resistance, according to him, was only met when the incursion reached the regional center Grayvoron. It was its capture, he said, that was the initial goal of the operation, but due to the weather and the condition of the roads, the start of the operation was disrupted by half a day, ""and not all results were achieved.""
> 
> “We are just learning. Our power is growing. We will improve. Arrange new raids,” the source said. “If this time they tried to capture the regional center, then next time we can try to reach the regional city.”

Anti-Putin Russian source:

> Starting in September 2022 masses of conscripts have been sent to the Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine. 
> 
> The mothers of conscripts told reporters that their children are “at the very front” of the border and “see Ukrainian soldiers.” They live in dugouts, dress up as and carry on border guard duties. At the same time the actual border guards as well as the National Guard are positioned miles behind them. “[Conscripts] are in front of the border guards like targets. Professionals who get paid for this are hiding behind the backs of our untrained children, while ours are only paid 2,319 rubles [28 dollars a month]” one of the mothers told 7 × 7.
> 
> The conscripts do not have the necessary training - in months they are taken out to the shooting range once or twice, although the management reports on daily training. Conscripts are assigned military specialties that do not correspond to their training, and live in dugouts that they build themselves.
>
> “They were sent to the front literally two weeks after being called up. They've been to the shooting ranges a couple of times, and that's it. They learn everything in the fields, and how to survive too,” said another mother of a conscript. The soldiers do not have enough equipment and food. Food is often donated by family members and volunteers.
> 
> At least seven conscripts have been killed as a result of shelling in the Belgorod region over the past few months. Officially, the authorities do not report this: for example, during the shelling on January 16, at least three conscripts were killed - and neither Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov nor the Ministry of Defense ever acknowledged the shelling.

The fighting in the Graivoron district has ended. According to the information we have, the RDK units returned to Ukraine by the same path they had taken on the morning of May 22[^1^].

The Russian units likely chose not to take risks and slowly approached the Ukrainian positions. The competently prepared positions, even without soldiers, gave the RDK time to retreat peacefully back to Ukraine[^2^].

There is little information about losses on either side. Sources in the Russian Armed Forces say that the footage published by ""war correspondents"" showing six bodies in uniforms similar to Ukrainian ones, presented as killed ""saboteurs"", was not made in the Belgorod region[^3^].

It's too early to talk about civilian casualties. Information will appear in the morning and will be updated throughout the next day[^4^].

Footage has appeared online in which the Chief of the Main Staff of the Russian Ground Forces, Colonel General Alexander Lapin, is seen wearing body armor and a helmet next to an abandoned or damaged RDK armored vehicle

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-24-23/index.html

""Dmitry Peskov, the Russian president's spokesperson, has said he believes the conflict in Ukraine should not be allowed to freeze. 

Peskov was asked in an interview with Russia state media outlet TASS whether he agreed with the West's viewpoint that the conflict should not be frozen. He replied ""Russia is in solidarity"" with this view. 

The spokesperson was quoted as saying: “Russia is only considering the possibility of completing a special military operation: ensuring its interests, achieving Russia's goals either through a special military operation, or by other available means.""

The comments come as Ukraine is expected to launch an imminent spring counter offensive which would spark more intense fighting and could prove to be a pivotal moment in the war.

Meanwhile Russians have been shocked by an attack on the country's southwestern Belgorod region, claimed by a Russian anti-Putin group that says its goal is the ""complete liberation of Russia.""

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-24-23/index.html

Ukraine’s bid to become a member of NATO while there is a war with Russia is “not on the agenda,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said during an interview at the Brussels Forum event on Wednesday. 

Asked whether the war in Ukraine makes it “easier” for the country to join the alliance, Stoltenberg said:

“Yes and no. I think that everyone realized that to become a member in the midst of war is not on the agenda, and that is not the issue. The issue is more of what happens when the war ends, in one way or another. And then of course, the war ensures that Ukraine is becoming even closer to NATO,” Stoltenberg continued.

The NATO chief acknowledged that there are some ""different views in the alliance"" on the issue of NATO membership for Ukraine, but he added that all members are in agreement that Ukraine will become a member.

""We all agree that NATO’s door is open for new members and that it is for NATO allies and Ukraine to decide when they should join, not Moscow,"" he said.""",False,1684970195.0,t3_13qagof,t3_13qagof,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

First of all they are dissappointed that us Ukraine supporters are not morally broken and in despair over Bakhmut, and it confuses them profoundly. They expected this to be a huge moral boost for their side and to sink the hopes on ours. As you probably know almost all of us have the view that Bakhmut the city hasnt mattered for half a year. It is gone, erased. Bakhmut the meatgrinder mattered, and most of us view that as a resounding Ukrainian success. As such, it was a military operation more than a place, and the city itself getting finally taken doesnt matter at all.

Their second dissappointment is in the Russian armed forces *yet again* failing to properly defend against Ukrainian attacks. This time...ok lets use the popular term; ""Ukrainian allied troops"", walks right over the border and holds villages for a full day.

So they are looking for ....desperatly looking for....the win they can rub in our faces, arent getting any reaction so keeps flailing and prodding and making up what they percieve as brilliant insults, laugh at their own jokes, and quietly is unnerved by how we in the West and Ukraine is completely unfaced by the Bakhmut developments, how a looming and seemingly increasingly large in scope counteroffensive is pushing nearer and nearer, and how Ukraine keeps managing to sneak jabs and uppercuts right through their guard, time and again.
You have to realize that what little they *have* understood this far into the conflict is that *Russia can not win with Ukraines current support*. They are **desperatly** looking to find anything, whatever, can weaken western resolve, sow splits and divisions.

Ukraine is planning a counteroffensive. Letting Bakhmut fall instead of concentrating troops there to prevent its fall is part of the plan.

>The fighting in the Graivoron district has ended. According to the information we have, the RDK units returned to Ukraine by the same path they had taken on the morning of May 22.

>According to information from the Russian military, the RDK units left the Belgorod region between 16:40 and 17:30. Moreover, the Russian Armed Forces did not pursue them or attempt to destroy the departing equipment.

>""They dug trenches there, and they did it competently. We cautiously approached them. We spent about two hours on reconnaissance and approach. By the time we got there, they were already gone,"" explained a Russian army officer who was in the Golovchino area.

>The Russian units likely chose not to take risks and slowly approached the Ukrainian positions. The competently prepared positions, even without soldiers, gave the RDK time to retreat peacefully back to Ukraine.

>Russian Armed Forces units are combing the forest to the north of Kozinka, Glotovo, and Gora-Podol. There is little information about losses on either side. Sources in the Russian Armed Forces say that the footage published by ""war correspondents"" showing six bodies in uniforms similar to Ukrainian ones, presented as killed ""saboteurs"", was not made in the Belgorod region. The video is indeed strange because the killed do not have the colored armbands and leg bands characteristic of Ukrainian units, and the RDK soldiers' uniform is not pixel camouflage, as in the frames, but multicam. The RDK's Telegram channel also denies that the bodies shown are those of killed volunteers.

>The same post claims that the RDK has no losses. Russian military personnel who were in Glotovo, Gora-Podol, and Kozinka today say they saw no bodies of the dead.

>""There was bloodied clothing, obviously taken off a wounded person, there were boots, I saw blood. Whose it was, who knows. No bodies. Either they took them with them or there were no losses. They definitely should have wounded, but they took all of their own,"" says a Russian Armed Forces officer who was in the villages around which the fighting was taking place.

>There is also no information about Russian losses. According to the Russian Armed Forces officers and the group's headquarters, from the night of yesterday until 17:00 on May 23, between 12 and 15 servicemen were killed and between 21 and 40 people were injured. We cannot confirm these figures yet. Counting losses in the Russian army is not a quick process.

>The main Russian ""war correspondent"" Sladkov wrote today that one of the residents of Kozinka was shot by ""saboteurs"" because they found a Russian military uniform at his home. This turned out to be a lie, which was caught by the Belgorod Telegram channel ""Belgorod No. 1"", which is completely pro-government by the way. So, it certainly cannot be suspected of anti-Russian sentiments. The man was not shot, but died from a shrapnel wound. Possibly from a fragment of a Russian shell.

>It's too early to talk about civilian casualties. Information will appear in the morning and will be updated throughout the next day. Fortunately, sources in the Russian Armed Forces say that there was almost no fighting in the villages themselves and civilian losses should be minimal. There are also no attempts by the FSB to portray civilian losses as ""innocently shot residents of Belgorod."" We hope it will stay this way.

>Footage has appeared online in which the Chief of the Main Staff of the Russian Ground Forces, Colonel General Alexander Lapin, is seen wearing body armor and a helmet next to an abandoned or damaged RDK armored vehicle. Pro-Russian channels claim that Lapin ""personally commanded the operation"". Our military sources react to this with nothing but profanity, saying that Lapin was in Belgorod, but did not command the operation, and only after dark, when the RDK were long back in Ukraine, he arrived at the scene of the fighting to pose for a photo next to the Ukrainian equipment.

>""He'll also get a medal for defending Graivoron and another apartment in Moscow,"" a Russian staff officer comments bitterly.

This thread can be quite valuable but in peoples zeal to shut down Russian shills often *any* criticism of anything Ukraine does no matter how light or reasonable gets slammed down with seemingly little or no thought put into whether it is valid criticism or not. And before people jump in with ""well this wasn't a Ukrainian operation"" I get that is a great cover that while true you must still admit the fact that these Russian militia's that raided Russia did so with the blessing of Ukraine and were supplied by it. They didn't steal, stand up and organize a column of vehicles on Ukrainian soil in secret and then invade Russia with it, this was all authorized by Ukrainian authorities.

The first thing I thought when I saw those Humvees was how stupid it was to include them in the attacking force, there are lots of Russian and commercially made equipment Ukraine had to pick from to arm them and it was an own goal not to make dam sure no equipment donated by other countries was used. I can't wait until Ukraine has thrown Russia out of the country and while cross border raids such as this can play a small role in aiding that goal this was a silly mistake for Ukraine to make. I don't think it will have serious long term consequences for aid deliveries but I bet the next raid they make dam sure they don't make the same mistake again.",False,1684969025.0,t3_13qagof,t1_jlhot6y,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

One thing I am pretty confident about is that Prigozhin has little to no chance of challenging Putin for Russia. To even attempt such a thing you'd really need to have at least two of the following things: the military, the FSB, the National Guard, and popular support. There is no real data that I've seen on how popular Prigozhin is throughout Russia, but in my experience living in Russia, he is just seen as another oligarch and I don't believe he is well liked beyond the hard-core militant ethnofascists, and they are far from a majority despite what people like to say about Russia. 

Regarding the military, Wagner has already been struggling to bolster its numbers, and I can't see a scenario where the military largely switches their loyalty from Shoigu/Putin to Wagner.

But the Taliban took advantage of the politics, they attacked in 2008 when they noticed our weakness, and Obama was forced in 2009 to troop-surge into Afghanistan, despite having a 2008-campaign promise to have us pulled out.

Ultimately, Obama did set us up with China / Taiwan a bit better. And thanks to Ukraine, China is seeing that aggression will result in loss of trade and international standing. So China is now less likely to attack Taiwan.

We could have played the European Theater better. We should have been paying attention to Georgia and Chechnya. But I'm not actually sure how we could have done Afghanistan better.

---------

That's just foreign policy. Obama then continued to execute TARP which likely saved our economy. Then Obamacare of course, which fixed a few issues in our health care system. Etc. etc. I think it was a good run overall.

But I also would have been proud to have McCain as president. While McCain was smarter in Europe, I'm not convinced that he was smarter in Afghanistan or China.

The base had a stockpile of approximately 5 million rounds of Mk VII ammunition which was no longer approved for military use. They took a newly rebuilt Vickers gun, and proceeded to fire the entire stock of ammo through it over the course of seven days. They worked in pairs, switching off at 30 minute intervals, with a third man shoveling away spent brass. The gun was fired in 250-round solid bursts, and the worn out barrels were changed every hour and a half. At the end of the five million rounds, the gun was taken back into the shop for inspection. It was found to be within service spec in every dimension.""

I can pretty much enforce the consent of my nieces to do anything I want. That's the problem, children are... well... children. They trust the adults and largely do what they're told.

They obviously start thinking for themselves in their teenage years, and we draw the line at 18 when we traditionally call them full functioning adults (or at least, enough of an adult to join the military or other major decisions). 

But when we're talking about 11 year olds to 16 year olds... its a lot less clear what ""consent"" even means. And I'm sure that children grow up at different rates (some of them obviously don't have an independent streak even into 18+ ages).

And that's the problem. ""Child, go stick your hand into this heavy machinery"" was a real thing in the early 1900s, and plenty of children got maimed because of it. And the pictures of the children with missing limbs was all that the US Public needed to change our laws and stop child labor.

Plus it does give Russia more ammunition for it's internal propaganda to say they're fighting NATO and this war is an existential threat to the Russian regime, they use that line of thinking to try and get more support for the war in Russia. Seeing American equipment used to on Russian soil gives them them another chance to push that narrative backed up by a real event for once.

They would have been OK had the Allies not won, either. This is the reality for life in a dictatorship. The optimal survival tactic is to keep your head down and let it succeed. Whole books on this subject have been written by dictatorship survivors, including by political dissidents who faced persecution their whole lives. People who don't understand this unsexy reality about living in dictatorships usually tend not to have lived in a dictatorship themselves. We're not talking about optimal strategy for overthrowing it. We're talking about optimal strategy for not getting killed or imprisoned.

Even in the very worst, most genocidal dictatorships, a large majority of its citizens survived the round-ups and purges. Russia, specifically, went through one of these dictatorships. Despite the absolutely mindboggling number of people Stalin killed, the fact remains that most of the people in the USSR survived just fine, and the large majority of survivors went right on living throughout another four generations of post-Stalin rule in the USSR. When you say that your optimal survival strategy is to resist, that is just factually incorrect. People who resisted tended to die in far, far greater numbers than the people who tried to stay out of it.

>If your argument is that nothing, not even resisting literal nazism, is worth the risk, then you’re beyond redemption on this topic.

I'd like to hope I would personally take the risk, but I don't fault someone who isn't strong enough to do it. Nobody truly knows how much risk they can stomach until they are faced with the literal life-and-death decision themselves. Most people who earnestly believe they would resist are in fact wrong and would not. Statistically, even in the most altruistic of cultures, more than 90% of all humans anywhere on Earth will not resist a dictatorship no matter how brutal it is because human brains are deeply engrained with survival instincts that are almost impossible to override. This is why things like conscription are even necessary in the first place.",1684956430.0,1684955106.0,t3_13qagof,t1_jlgoxvo,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

Welcome to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, where keeping yourself out of prison and keeping your family fed and not raped is actually, in fact, a much higher priority for the vast majority of human beings than being allowed to read the books you want or having a nice job.

Most dictators get stopped *before* they become dictators. The world's track record of internally deposing dictators *after* they seize power is terribly, terribly low. The only guaranteed thing about trying to overthrow a dictator is that most of the people who try, will die, even if they win. Your average, ordinary people in the dictatorship look at those odds and say, ""Sorry, but I just can't do that.""",False,1684983680.0,t3_13qagof,t1_jlim25n,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

Yeah. This is the kind of victim blaming that gets a lot of traction in this thread. It gets traction because it's easy to think this way. ""They just aren't revolting because they're dumb,"" or ""They just have cultural learned helplessness."" The reality is that nowhere on Earth is safe from a dictator, and once installed, there is no country that would have a population well prepared to overthrow them without outside help. Americans, for example, would roll over and take it up the ass. Most Americans have never lived true hardship and are absolutely not prepared to risk imprisonment, death, or losing their family to fight for their constitutional rights.

>Has their ever been an industrialized dictatorship that wasn't at war with a neighbor the minute they'd consolidated internal control?

Yes. China, which is the number one reason why China's dictatorship model is proving so horrifying successful. China's dictatorial leaders figured out that you can use economic globalization to solidify your power. Instead of making war with the West, they courted Western economic investment and symbiotic reliance. Now the West can't help overthrow China's dictatorial leadership model without dooming their own economies.

The quickest way China's dictator could lose power is by going to war with Taiwan, because it would sever a lot of those economic relationships that keep the West from being openly antagonistic to China's internal politics. But there is no guarantee that a war with Taiwan would actually cause the West to fight. China is growing increasingly cocky towards the West and might eventually make a move on Taiwan. If the West blinks and fails to take up arms out of fear of losing their economic symbiosis with China, then China's dictatorship will enjoy a power surge rather than a failure.

Putin was banking on the same gamble with Ukraine, but he lost that gamble. Now his relatively stable dictatorship is under ten times more threat than it was in 2021. The best chance the Russian people have of being able to overthrow Putin, stems from the Ukrainian Armed Forces completely gutting Russia's vast armed forces and militarized police organizations. If Russia had never invaded Ukraine, then Russian citizens would have had absolutely no chance of being able to organize without quickly being thrown in prison.

If the FSB and Rosvguardia continue to take a beating in Ukraine and get spread increasingly thin, then Russian citizens might be able to re-calculate their chances of getting arrested or killed if they resist, and the newly calculated equation might finally come out in favor of resisting. Additionally, as Russia's economy continues to unravel, regular Russian citizens may get to point of economic despair that is so ridiculously awful that they finally decide being killed or arrested is scarcely any worse than their impoverished status quo. Unfortunately, we're still a long way out from that rock bottom kind of poverty. We probably won't see a true revolt in Russia until people are literally starving in the streets, because you need the risk of bodily injury to be as high or higher with the status quo than the risk of bodily injury if you revolt before enough people will finally get together and do it without foreign help.",1684986170.0,1684985898.0,t3_13qagof,t1_jliqbxw,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

""Unwilling to fight for things they feel they are entitled to"" is NOT how I would describe Americans.  Honestly, I think you'll find yourself in a gunfight pretty fast trying to take our *cheeseburgers*, let alone constitutional rights.
