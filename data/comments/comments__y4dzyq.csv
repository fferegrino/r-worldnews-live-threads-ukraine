Day 234 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was relatively quiet, this time there were no missiles strikes. We did think that missiles were launched in our direction a couple of times during the day, but they turned out to be actual Russian air defense trying to shoot something down, and not their “air defense” that they use to hit Kharkiv with. It’s impossible to know which is which until it lands at its target, or blows up in the sky, so we still get warnings about potential incoming missiles every time anything gets launched from Belgorod.

After one of those missile launches, that we thought would be aimed at Kharkiv, an oil depot in Belgorod oblast caught on fire, so it’s safe to say they were trying to intercept something that was aimed at that oil depot. At least one shell/missile did make it through in the end. There was another “missile launch” from Belgorod at midnight, but it also was just their air defense trying to shoot something down again. Every time they fire their AA *or missiles aimed at Kharkiv* we also get an air raid alert, so that makes it harder to distinguish between the two, by default we always think that those missiles are aimed at us.

It really wasn’t a quiet day in Belgorod today, not only did their oil depot catch on fire, but some people also opened fire on the mobilized conscripts at one of the training grounds in Belgorod oblast. Official reports say that 11 people were killed, but regular people are saying that at least 22 were killed, and 16 were wounded. They are saying that there were 2-3 Tajiks that opened fire, 2 of which were killed and the last one either got away, or never existed.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 October 2022
 

- Contingents of mobilised Russian reservists have been deployed to Ukraine over the last two weeks. Their average level of personal equipment is almost certainly lower than the already poor provision of previously deployed troops.

- Many reservists are likely required to purchase their own body armour, especially the modern 6B45 vest, which is meant to be on general issue to combat units as part of the Ratnik personal equipment programme. This vest has been selling on Russian online shopping sites for 40,000 roubles (approx. USD $640), up from around 12,000 roubles (appox. USD $190) in April.

- In 2020, the Russian authorities announced that 300,000 sets of Ratnik body armour had been supplied to the Russian military, which was ample to equip the force currently deployed in Ukraine. Endemic corruption and poor logistics remain one of the underlying causes of Russia's poor performance in Ukraine.",False,1665817965.0,t3_y4dzyq,t3_y4dzyq,,0,75,0,75,0,0,

The new talking point I've been seeing from some of my fellow Americans is that Biden should not be giving so much money to Ukraine and instead use it back home to help citizens.

1. Congress passed all of this funding. They could also pass stuff to help American citizens back home but that typically devolves into accusations of socialism and doesn't get passed. Vote in people who would also do things to help citizens back home.

2. Most of what we're sending is military gear that was designed to fight Russia. It's not like we're sending bucket loads of cash. Also we give so much foreign aid to lots of countries every year.

3. Russia is saying and acting out some very genocidey things. We said never again after WW2. If they took Ukraine quickly they would not stop at that border and the conflict would likely spread deeper into Europe. Sending all the weapons and gear pro actively aims to stop this.

4. Russia absolutely hates USA and wants to see us destroyed. They've been waging an information war through social media destabilizing the country and fueling the division in our country.

5. Similar to another point but specific to Europe. What took America from good to great on the world stage was helping to rebuild Europe after the war.

**What does the data show?**

In short, Ukraine controls 79.7% of their core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22, and 79.4% just 10 days ago. Before February's invasion, they controlled 90.9%.

Since the Kharkiv counter-offensive began on 6 September, Ukrainian forces have liberated 1.1% of their territory (over 2,400 square miles), and have demonstrated that they can hold this territory.

🔴 Russian KIAs are an estimated 30,800 (± 2,900), with a 30-day average of 80 KIA per day.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs are an estimated 13,200 (± 600), with a 30-day average of 30 KIA per day.

The president was asked whether Belarus was going to join Russia's special military operation. “We, as I said it many times, are taking part in the military operation in a way that we support Russia in every possible way. Our support lies in the fact that our Western borders with Poland and Lithuania were not violated, so Russian troops were not stabbed in the back via Belarus. That's how it has been since the very beginning,” the head of state said.

“Our role is as follows: we care for Russia's wounded and take on Ukrainian refugees. We admit some 400-500 Ukrainians a day. They have equal rights with Belarusians here. This is our role,” Aleksandr Lukashenko said. “But we are not killing anyone there, and we are not planning to kill anyone there. Firstly, no one, and I mean Russia here, is asking us to take part in this operation. And we are not going to do it. We have always said this. Apparently, you do not want to hear us.

This poor man was named Mr. Peniston. I swear to you that this was, and possibly still is, his name. I think if I was cursed with that name I would go out of my way to pick a life path that ensures that my future career would be anything, anything at all, other than teaching 8th graders. And yet, there he was. 



Anyway, one day the film he showed was about the element tungsten. You know those cheerful educational films they would show on The Simpsons with Troy McClure? It was exactly like that, except it was about the wonders of tungsten. For some reason, finding a reason to use  the word tungsten in everyday conversation became a running joke amongst me and my friends for the rest of the year and never failed to crack us up. I moved away after that year and haven't spoken to any of them in about 30 years, but I never stopped being amused by the word ""tungsten"". If you know someone who seemingly went out of their way to mention the word ""tungsten"", despite it being a rather obscure element...well that may have been me. And if so, even though I didn't show it at the time, let me assure the 14 year old boy who lives inside me was howling with laughter.



I have never told this story to anyone before. So why did I come clean here in this thread? I don't know...for some reason something about the way Russia is cramming men into trenches like sardines gives me the feeling that this thread, which I've checked daily since Feb 24, is about to love talking about tungsten almost as much as it loves talking about Elon Musk.

By what magic do those on the far left believe Putin has anything for them? 

My guess is that it is based on simple opposition - the West and America is bad, they are supporting Ukraine, so Putin must be right. They eat up Putin’s notion that he’s just fighting Western imperialism, that Ukraine is just an issue that has been stirred up by US encouragement, without which Ukrainians would happily be Russians. 

Yet this version of events denies Ukrainians any agency.

Here is the main idea: acquire seized Russian assets, manage the assets, and give the proceeds to Ukraine.

Western governments are going to sell seized yachts and privates jets and give the proceeds to Ukraine. We can help Ukraine by taking this a step further. What if we buy and commercialize these assets and make Ukraine profit from them? They'll have a long term source of revenue from this in addition to the initial sale. Even if it's just a few hundred thousand per year, that can still be useful to rebuild a bunch of stuff in Ukraine. Hopefully it could be millions!

The war in Ukraine

I want to be clear. What’s happening now is unpleasant, to put it mildly. But all the same things would have happened later, under worse conditions for us. So our actions are correct and timely.

We’re not giving ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. Look at Crimea, 2.5 million people live there. They captured it, and cut off the water. Our troops had to go in and turn the water on. That’s just an example of the logic of our actions. If they hadn’t acted, we wouldn’t have reacted. Or take the bridge they blew up. Now we have to think 10 times over how important it is for the Russian Federation to ensure communication with Crimea across territory.

It’s not necessary right now to continue massive strikes on Ukrainian territory. Out of 29 targets, seven were not hit as the defense ministry planned, but they’re gradually getting to them.

Negotiations with Ukraine

We know Kyiv’s position – they were always talking about negotiations, requesting them, and now they’ve adopted a resolution that prohibits negotiations. What is there to talk about?

###Public Sentiment in Russia Darkens Over Ukraine War

####Call-up of more men to military service and talk of nuclear weapons are rattling citizens

MOSCOW—President Vladimir Putin’s massive military mobilization and escalating talk of nuclear weapons in the protracted Ukraine conflict are rattling many Russians, including urban elites for whom the war had seemed far in the background.

The WhatsApp messaging group for residents of a stately post-World War II apartment building on a major thoroughfare in downtown Moscow, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, is peppered with messages of concern: “Is the bomb shelter in the basement still habitable?”; “Who do we need to contact to get it inspected?”; “Where are the entrances located?”

In some urban centers, apartments are being put up for sale or rent at fire-sale rates, say real-estate experts, as hundreds of thousands of Russian men have left the country since Mr. Putin ordered the call-up of reservists to generate new troops to fight in Ukraine.
Nearly half of Russians said they were alarmed and felt fearful following Mr. Putin’s announcement of the draft, while another 13% said they felt anger, according to a poll last month by Levada Center, a nongovernmental sociological research organization, of 1,631 people over the age of 18 in urban and rural areas of 50 regions.

A poll by the state Public Opinion Foundation published around the same time as the Levada survey also showed that the prevailing mood among Russians was now one of unease, according to 70% of 1,500 respondents.

“Now is a really unusual situation for our country and a new collective psychotrauma,” Ekaterina Kolesnikova, director of North-West, a private research center for the study of management practices and the social-political mood, wrote on the group’s Telegram page earlier this month.

“Now is a really unusual situation for our country and a new collective psychotrauma,” Ekaterina Kolesnikova, director of North-West, a private research center for the study of management practices and the social-political mood, wrote on the group’s Telegram page earlier this month.

The disquiet—especially among well-to-do urban Russians who had been somewhat sheltered from a war in which many of those killed were from poorer regions—threatens to erode support for Mr. Putin, said some experts who follow Russia’s domestic policies and their political and social repercussions.

Both Western Kremlin-watchers and many Russian political analysts who back Mr. Putin say that public discontent over the Russian president’s policies is unlikely to throw him off course or shake his control. But observers of Russia’s political landscape say the dissatisfaction threatens to spread, and the Kremlin does closely monitor Mr. Putin’s approval ratings. Policy analysts noted that while many Russians were willing to tolerate their president’s restrictions on political freedoms, they did so on the understanding that their lives and the country’s prosperity wouldn’t be destabilized.

“Many people feel disappointed, somehow deceived even, in the sense that they simply did not expect this turn of events,” said Grigorii Golosov, a political scientist at the European University at St. Petersburg. “Of course, it undermines their trust both in the Russian leadership in the short term and in the long-term perspective.”

The Kremlin didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether it was concerned about growing public discontent.

Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said recently that it was understandable that current events would trigger certain unsettled emotions, but the Kremlin hadn’t seen much polarization in Russian society. He told the RBC Russian business media group in an interview last month before the mobilization that this year had seen a “union among citizens and their consolidation around the head of state.”

A number of issues are contributing to growing unease. The annexation of Ukrainian territory without Russia’s having full control, failures on the battlefield that allowed Ukraine to regain ground, and Mr. Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons are feeding public uncertainty and doubt about the soundness of Kremlin strategy, analysts said.

One of the prevailing concerns, according to analysts, is the recent mobilization, which has left few segments of the population untouched. Officially called a partial mobilization, the call-up has wide reach that is hitting home in many cities. It includes men with previous military service or expertise and those currently in the reserve, among other criteria, according to official state media. Early in the war, Mr. Putin promised that only professional military personnel would participate in what the Kremlin calls its special military operation.

Russia’s Ministry of Defense said last month that 5,937 Russian soldiers had died since the conflict began in February. The Pentagon estimates the number of Russia’s war dead and wounded could be as high as 80,000.

Public anxiety is reflected in recent posts on a St. Petersburg group page on VKontakte, Russia’s version of Facebook, where a woman who identified herself as Yanochka Pogodina wrote, “This is some kind of terrible dream. Lord, let us wake up in peacetime!”

A man identifying himself as Pavel Petrov responded, “Yanochka, this won’t be settled by itself. Everything is going to hell.”

In the Irkutsk region of southeastern Siberia, psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists are offering free consultation to the relatives of those called up to fight, according to health authorities in the region.

Following the announcement of mobilization, Maria Gribova, director of a construction and real-estate consulting firm in St. Petersburg, noticed an increase in people there selling their apartments at a discount on previous market rates—sometimes between 10% and 20%. “People are worried about the safety of their money,” she said. “People don’t want to take additional risks... We don’t know if tomorrow we will have our man with us or if he will suddenly be called up.”

There has been a marked increase in people renting out their apartments in big cities, either because they are leaving or as a source of additional income, and this has brought down rent prices, according to specialists in the rental market.

“The most negative thing that has already happened is the disappearance of the illusion that hostilities are taking place somewhere far away and do not affect economic development,” said Oleg Buklemishev, director of the Economic Policy Research Center at Moscow State University.",False,1665836072.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_ised1x0,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

And it's important to note power has been restored in the vast majority of areas already. Yes these attacks could make for difficult times for Ukranian civilians during the winter but Russia is unlikely to be able to do enough damage on a consistent enough basis that wide scale and prolonged outages occur, eg millions without power for weeks at a time.

And even if they did somehow keep up the strikes to pull that off it will most likely have very little effect on the Ukranian military, armies already pretty much assume they will not have power where they operate. Repair depots and rear areas could be affected but generators can probably make up for much of that, generators have already been included in aid to Ukraine. And since so much of Ukriane's military supplies come from outside the country there is less risk of power outages greatly reducing the amount of material they have to fight with.

So while Russian attacks on the electricity grid could have an effect they are unlikely to affect the outcome of the war in any meaningful way.

He thought he wouldn't need them and that he had more influence and control in Belarus; it would have been a breeze taking control, given that Belarus just let the elite Russian troops into the country without resistance at the start of the war. Now the Belarussian army knows Russia doesn't have the trained manpower to really pose a threat. So this is Putins attempt to fix this; mass troops in Belarus and try to pressure them to join the war(along with bribe some people), but the Belarussian generals know that no matter how many troops they mass there, almost all of them are untrained or poorly trained. And they understand that no matter what putin's bribes are, you can't spend that money if you're dead and putin will likely send them to the front lines to die(because Russians won't give a fuck if they die, considering they barely give a fuck that their own die)

And if this plan doesn't work, at least putin knows he gets a distraction out of this. And maybe morale improves on the thought they might get help",False,1665858168.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isfw92n,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

On the other hand Putin has no intention to stop the war, only to freeze it and buy time. Considering the gross number of miscalculations Putin has made, a new northern push wouldn't be the odd one here. Why even announce the ""Joint forces"" otherwise. To me it seems as a front to hide any involvement of Belarus. That said, if it were to happen I am betting on a focus towards western Ukraine instead of towards Kyiv. Trying to cut the lines towards Poland and remove the momentum Ukraine has. Putin doesn't have a lot of conventional options left. Even Zelensky said he believes Putin is trying to get Belarus more involved.

I do hear a lot of thoughts about this is just trying to distract Ukrainian forces. But they have been doing that for months already, and things have only gotten worse in the east for them. So obviously this isn't enough. That might be a factor to start a new front again, to tie up more forces than the ones already tied up since a long time. It would at least force Ukraine to rethink the strategies again.

It would be a big and risky gamble. Since Putin isn't trying to have peace, he might think it is worth it.",1665857239.0,1665856825.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isfw92n,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

*Antifaschistische Aktion (German: \[ˌantifaˈʃɪstɪʃə ʔakˈtsi̯oːn\]) was a militant anti-fascist organisation in the Weimar Republic started by members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) that existed from 1932 to 1933. It was primarily active as a KPD campaign during the July 1932 German federal election and the November 1932 German federal election and was described by the KPD as a ""red united front under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD.""*

*During the Third Period, the KPD viewed the Nazi Party ambiguously. On one hand, the KPD considered the Nazi Party to be one of the fascist parties. On the other hand, the KPD sought to appeal to the Strasserite-wing of the Nazi movement by using nationalist slogans. The KPD sometimes cooperated with the Nazis in attacking the SPD. In 1931, the KPD had united with the Nazis, whom they referred to as ""working people's comrades"", in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down the SPD state government of Prussia by means of a referendum. In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion*

After Maidan, those people did not stop thinking about how to protect their country and they watched Russia take advantage and grab Crimea and Donbas. They had just thrown one dictator, they were not going to accept another. And so they joined defence forces, independent brigades, armed forces, arms industry and other institutions relevant to defence of their country. And then they begun to plan.

Here are a few of mine so far:

On the people:

*The failure of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 directly correlates to Russians forgetting that Ukrainians voted 90% in 1991 to be independent and Ukrainians remembering that they did.*

On capability:

*While modern equipment and weapons are important, in 2022 Ukraine reminded the world that people are the true capability, the true weapons, and purpose is the stone that sharpens them.*

On corruption:

*The biggest contributer to Russia's loss in Ukraine wasn't Russia's systemic corruption and its impact on military capability or logistics but its impacts on accurate intelligence and policy advice to decision makers.*

It's actually unnecessary for Russia to start another offensive through Belarus in order to tie down Ukrainian resources in the north, because their presence in Belarus in combination with the government of Belarus conducting covert mobilization measures, already forces Ukraine to keep a significant amount of forces in the north. 

  
Now that is not to say that there is a zero chance of an offensive happening in the north of Ukraine.

Other countries have encouraged citizens to leave Ukraine following the bombings on Monday. The US has been generally urging caution and people to leave since the start of the invasion.

Twitter has been talking about China, Kazakhstan and other embassies evacuating, particularly the Jason Jay Smart guy. But he made out in his tweet that Kazakhstan had announced this just now, when in reality it was after the bombings. He also mentioned Serbia and others but I’ve seen nothing about them. He’s also said other weird stuff previously, like being strangely adamant that Russia’s Security Council meeting was cancelled on Monday and that Putin didn’t know how to respond to Kerch, even when others pointed out he was incorrect. The meeting happened, and Putin had already decided to use the bombings as his official response (which he’d planned for a while anyway)

Defence and offense are very different games and the Ukrainians don't really have much experience with the latter(they are gaining it quickly) and honestly though their upgraded soviet tanks are fine for defence they really don't suit offensives well anymore. They seem to lack the really aggressive tempo needed to ensure rapid enemy collapse and breakthrough.


Which is nothing to be ashamed of. I'm fairly certain only NATO and Israel really have the experience or capacity to execute offensives of that level. 

Currently they very act like, and are an army in transition from a Russian ""slow and steady offensive with consolidation before restart"" doctrine to a more Western Lightning War doctrine which involves thunder runs. I'm ignoring the weird Russian thunder runs at the start of the war which failed miserably.

On the one hand, Russia is seriously short of trained infantry,  hence mobilization.  However, Russia also lacks capacity to absorb untrained Mobiks to the combat units, and capacity to train them domestically.    Russia  is getting mauled by Ukraine, even with the defender's advantage. If they don't hang on until mud fixes things a bit, and then through winter, they are not going to be able to relaunch anything in the spring. Russia needs to shift the balance of forces.

Meanwhile back at the farm team, in Belarus, there is at least  an entire undamaged military - stripped as it may of spare weapons and equipment (another thing Russia is short of).  Russia can't pull this capacity into its forces for a few reasons - firstly that Luka needs  these to maintain  power over  the people of Belarus, and second that there are sympathizers to Ukraine in Belarus and that creates information security issues for Russia if they are imported.  

But Russia can send its mobiks to Belarus.  There they can be  trained (and housed, and fed, and equipped).  Any  pictures they send back home won't be of Russian training disaster videos, they will be Belarussian training disaster videos.  Lack of weapons?   Belarus.   Bad food? Belarus.  Holes in boots? Belarus... and so on.  By sending  tens of thousands of mobiks to  Belarus,  Russia exports the PR disaster that is its training capacity.

Also, who knows... Belarus may have a change of heart and decide to stomp on Ukraine.  Especially if something catastrophic happens and it looks like Russia will win after all. In which case, building their capacity with tens of thousands of Russian soldiers, even poorly trained, bolsters their chances.   Ukraine needs to defend against that eventuality, and position some of its force northwards.  These are forces that can't mount offensive operations in the south.  

Thus training Mobiks in Belarus creates contingency, weakens Ukraine's offensive capacity and exports the PR disaster of Russia's actually shoddy training and logistics.  All in one go.  And Luka gets a huge increase in his forces,  the chance to jump in or stay out at his  discretion,  and of course it's all going to be paid at a premium by the Kremlin.

A number of issues are contributing to growing unease. The annexation of Ukrainian territory without Russia’s having full control, failures on the battlefield that allowed Ukraine to regain ground, and Mr. Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons are feeding public uncertainty and doubt about the soundness of Kremlin strategy, analysts said.  
One of the prevailing concerns, according to analysts, is the recent mobilization, which has left few segments of the population untouched. Officially called a partial mobilization, the call-up has wide reach that is hitting home in many cities. It includes men with previous military service or expertise and those currently in the reserve, among other criteria, according to official state media. Early in the war, Mr. Putin promised that only professional military personnel would participate in what the Kremlin calls its special military operation.  
Russia’s Ministry of Defense said last month that 5,937 Russian soldiers had died since the conflict began in February. The Pentagon estimates the number of Russia’s war dead and wounded could be as high as 80,000.  
Public anxiety is reflected in recent posts on a St. Petersburg group page on VKontakte, Russia’s version of Facebook, where a woman who identified herself as Yanochka Pogodina wrote, “This is some kind of terrible dream. Lord, let us wake up in peacetime!”  
A man identifying himself as Pavel Petrov responded, “Yanochka, this won’t be settled by itself. Everything is going to hell.”  
In the Irkutsk region of southeastern Siberia, psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists are offering free consultation to the relatives of those called up to fight, according to health authorities in the region.  
Following the announcement of mobilization, Maria Gribova, director of a construction and real-estate consulting firm in St. Petersburg, noticed an increase in people there selling their apartments at a discount on previous market rates—sometimes between 10% and 20%. “People are worried about the safety of their money,” she said. “People don’t want to take additional risks... We don’t know if tomorrow we will have our man with us or if he will suddenly be called up.”  
There has been a marked increase in people renting out their apartments in big cities, either because they are leaving or as a source of additional income, and this has brought down rent prices, according to specialists in the rental market.  
“The most negative thing that has already happened is the disappearance of the illusion that hostilities are taking place somewhere far away and do not affect economic development,” said Oleg Buklemishev.",False,1665834984.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isekefn,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

 >The Battle of Hostomel was a battle fought for control over the town of Hostomel between the Russian and Ukrainian armed forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As part of the Kyiv offensive, the Russian forces sought control over Hostomel, Bucha and Irpin in order to encircle and besiege the Ukrainian capital city Kyiv from the west. Due to the intensity of the Kyiv offensive, the Kyiv Oblast State Administration named Hostomel, along with Irpin, Bucha, Highway M06, and Vyshhorod as the most dangerous places in the Kyiv Oblast.

I think about it like this.

You remember that airfield they kept (keep?) trying to use over and over even when it didn’t make sense? Where the cost of the losses completely outweighed any potential military advantage, but they kept sending helicopters anyways because someone up high decided they needed to?

On a grander scale, that airfield is Crimea. Russia has, on multiple occasions, spent any amount of money and bodies it takes to keep a warm water port, even if it ends up crippling them in the process. Without a land bridge and a secured water source to Crimea, Russia’s hold on the peninsula would have remained tenuous longterm.  

So you come in guns blazing, decapitate the leadership in Kyiv, and dictate a surrender of large swaths of Ukrainian territory in exchange for peace. You get the industrial heartland, some of the best farmland in the world, fresh water and a land bridge for Crimea. Maybe you pick up the historically important Odessa as a bonus and land-lock what’s left of Ukraine entirely. You even get to “trade” non-slavic fodder for a fresh batch of slavic Ukrainians. You’ll still exploit them of course since they’re not Russian, but at least they look like you. Easy peasy. 

What they didn’t expect was nearly as much pushback from Ukraine and the West - and why should they? No one stopped them in Georgia. No one stopped them in 2014. Why should this be any different?

But once the pushback comes, it’s too late. They’re already going to eat the sanctions no matter what, so they might as well keep throwing bodies at the problem and take as much land as they’re allowed. In a few decades or a hundred years, everyone will have forgotten, but they’ll still have that territory.

Now jump to the present. Kyiv didn’t happen. Land locking Ukraine didn’t happen. Odessa didn’t happen. Kharkiv didn’t happen. But if you keep throwing enough bodies on the dumpster fire and threaten nuclear armageddon enough times, maybe you can convince the weak links in the west to stop supporting Ukraine and call for peace. You get to keep your land bridge, fresh water access, and your warm water port. Everyone everywhere loses, but Moscow *wins*. It gets the land, and it gets to blame the US and Europe for how badly fucked Russia is economically. Use Rosgvardia to maintain the crackdowns on the populace and ride it out until the economy eventually rebounds. That’s the only play left.",False,1665854988.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isf9mfs,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

 >The 2021–2022 Belarus–European Union border crisis is a migrant crisis consisting of an influx of tens of thousands of immigrants, primarily from Iraqi Kurdistan, with smaller groups hailing from elsewhere in Asia and from parts of Africa, to Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland via those countries' borders with Belarus. The crisis was triggered by the severe deterioration in Belarus–European Union relations, following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, the Ryanair Flight 4978 incident and its sanctions, and the attempted forced repatriation of Olympic sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya from Tokyo, Japan.

*""In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.""*

The KPD decided that the way forward in Germany was to do whatever it took to undermine the SPD government so they worked side-by-side with Nazis to try and overthrow them. The KPD referred to the Nazis as “working people’s comrades.” The justification for this, as Thälmann (the leader of the KPD) himself put it, was “After Hitler, Our Turn!”

In 1932, on the eve of Hitler’s rise to power, the KPD and the Nazi factions united to support transportation and rent strikes which crippled Berlin and led to rioting. In some cases, “Communists and Nazis stood arm in arm collecting money for the strike.”

A few months after the Berlin strikes, the SPD and its coalition of pro-democracy parties were unable to win enough seats in the July 1932 election to form a coalition government. This failure was in no small part due to the decision of the KPD and the Nazis to work together to attack the SPD.The failure to form a government set off a series of elections every few months until the Nazis, through the use of violence, eventually won enough seats to form a government.",1665858348.0,1665857431.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isfxobs,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

> In mid-November, Haines used a previously scheduled trip to Brussels to brief a wider circle of allies: NATO’s North Atlantic Council, the principal decision-making body of the 30-member alliance. Speaking in a large auditorium, she limited her remarks to what the intelligence community believed the evidence showed, and didn’t offer policy recommendations.
“A number of members raised questions and were skeptical of the idea that President Putin was seriously preparing for the possibility of a large-scale invasion,” Haines recalled.
French and German officials couldn’t understand why Putin would try to invade and occupy a large country with just the 80,000 to 90,000 troops believed to be massed on the border. Satellite imagery also showed the troops moving back and forth from the frontier. Others posited that the Russians were performing an exercise, as the Kremlin itself insisted, or playing a shell game designed to conceal a purpose short of invasion.

Most were doubtful, and noted that Zelensky seemed to think Russia would never attack with the ambition and force the Americans were forecasting. Didn’t Ukraine understand Russia’s intentions best?

>If you have become adept at running a Defence-in-depth, then you are going to advance and consolidate to ensure you don't suffer the same issue.

Ukrainian logistics would have to be extremely weak to not be able to cover distances that armies have been covering since centuries at this point. 

>To top this off, they likely don't want to risk unnecessary losses. The further they extend into occupied territory, the more open they are to Air Strikes, artillery or ambush.

In areas like Kharkiv, where by all accounts the Russians were in disarray and lacked fallback lines letting them restablish lines is going to be more costly then pushing them to the point of collapse. 

>These types of offensives are more what you see when the balance of power is more even and battlespace is more contested. It's why rate of advance resembles later years WW2 in Europe and not Iraq 2003.

Later years of WW2 saw massive offensives though. They took longer to plan and execute but the territorial change was massive, and there's many instances of commanders either pushing too hard or not pushing hard enough and letting the enemy regroup. 

The Ukrainians aren't invading the USSR in '41. They're retaking recently lost land against an enemy far less vicious or competent than the '43 Germans. If Ukrainian offensives are being limited by logistics it's mostly experience at fault rather than equipment, if those were the limiting factor they would be clamoring for trucks instead of tanks and training.

> “The young men trying to leave the country are worried about their own lives — that doesn’t mean they’re against the war. I’m sure that many of them will continue to support Putin’s nationalist policies,” he added.

Musk didn’t. He just asked for evidence. That’s not calling anything out. That’s him giving a platform for the message without calling out its falsehood. He ensured that message was seen by millions without doing his due diligence to ensure he wasn’t spreading lies.

Take for example federal income tax in the US. Today, millions of Americans have to go to accountants or buy software from intuit or taxact to file our taxes. But the government will tell us if we are wrong. They already know the answer. It could be as simple as saying, yup, this looks right or no, this is wrong, here's what really happened. For many people it would be very much more efficient. 

But every time the government has tried to do this private businesses like Intuit have sued to keep it complicated so that they can charge us for software. Same thing with internet service. Comcast has sued towns for setting up their own municipal internet. They want it to be a ckusertfuck that we have them pay them for. That's good for their bottom line, but it's not necessarily more efficient overall. But yes, in those cases where it's broken, they are efficient at serving the need of that brokenness.

Intuit is very efficient at producing TurboTax. But fighting to keep the need for TurboTax isn't improving efficiency in the overall system. It's only allowing them to be efficient in the context where something like TurboTax is required.

A similar thing is found in healthcare where each blood sucking middleman is very efficient at taking your money, but the overall ckusterfuck of health insurance and networks and groups and subfees and copays and whatever is not what anyone would call efficient. Is my insurance company effective at getting lots of money for their CEO? Yes. Are they efficiently helping me with my desire to have my healthcare needs met? Well, not overall. Maybe compared to the other shitter health insurance company. You know what I mean?

Likewise, as efficient as private industry can be when they have realized the target, they are still vulnerable to completely missing the mark and having to be pushed there by government. That's really the sweet spot Tesla carved out. Existing car companies could have been Tesla. They had electric cars in the 1990s (and the 1960s for that matter). But they allowed the electric car to be killed because they were more efficient at making ICE cars, Oil liked it this way, and so did auto makers.

But with a nudge from government in the form of tax breaks and rebates and probably even grants and stuff, Tesla was able to come along and disrupt things. It took a private company forging ahead and moving fast and trying to actually market these cars to real people, but it also took aid from the government to make it happen.

There are three tiers of subscriptions from Starlink, tier 1 ($100 monthly, $1300 terminal), tier 2 ($500 monthly, $2500 terminal) and tier 3 ($4500 monthly, $10,000 terminal). Tier 1 is the residential subscription, tier 2 the commercial and tier 3 the maritime one.

However, all use the same network. The difference will be that likely the tier 2 and tier 3 subscriptions will have a higher priority on the network, better connection hardware and higher troughput. The terminals that have been delivered by SpaceX in Ukraine are either tier 1 or tier 2 terminals. 

They *may* have enabled a tier 3 service subscription on those to maximize bandwidth, however that does **not** equal direct costs for them, as the infrastructure side of the network is exactly 100% the same. So it is literally impossible that there is an actual direct cost of $1300 associated with a $4500 subscription.

> The post you linked argued that for an ISP it is irrelevant if 100 % of bandwidth is used up by one or 100 users. It is, however, a fact that ISPs typically oversubscribe their service by more than an order of magnitude.

So, I wrote that post and I addressed that in the post as well. That particular point was made because the person I was responding to was saying the 20k terminals had about 300k users on them, so it would come out to $66 per month per user. Latest count shows only 150k users to begin with, but the fact is that these terminals are still limited to their maximum throughput capacity, so data does not scale linearly with the amount of users, there is a hard cap.

> The prudent thing would be to apply Occam's Razor and and conclude that SpaceX does not want to bleed even more money. Instead, first judgement is passed, preconceived bias is applied to maximum effect and foregone conclusions are used to lead with the most malevolent interpretation available.

And that is just plain false. I am applying my expert knowledge based on 15 years of telco experience and I am examining the numbers Musk is mentioning through that lens.

Let me put it this way. The financing structure for telecom operators is two-fold. There is the infrastructure part of the company, which has a *lot* of upfront investment associated with it. These are the cables in the ground, the interconnectivity, the hardware layer. In the case of SpaceX, this will be the satellites and the ground stations that are uplinked to transit providers. Then there is the service part, which delivers the actual internet service over the infrastructure. Here you will invest in an network core/backbone, and have your support organization, your developers, operators, marketing, sales, etc. 

The infrastructure generally speaking is what is perceived as having the actual value in the company. The idea is that even if the service part doesn't run so well, the infrastructure could be opened up to other service providers, or sold to a competitor to deliver services over. Either way, once you have put the necessary billions into this part, it is considered a very stable long term valuable asset (which of course you have to maintain). Generally speaking, this makes it relatively easy to attract investors for it. Pension funds for example, *love* this type of revenue stream as it's very safe and predictable. 

Any money you put into upgrading the infrastructure is seen as value added as it represents future income. Generally speaking, money flows into the company through repeated subscription revenue, and depending on factors about 20-40% of that revenue will be attributed to the cost of the infrastructure. As a whole, the infrastructure part and the service part will have their own P&L's and require separate leadership, strategy and planning - although of course they work together very closely.

Looking at the situation in Ukraine. We see that there is a lot of extra traffic coming into the network. Essentially, this means they have to build additional ground stations with transit links. These ground stations are actually not *that* expensive, comparatively, they will come out to about 200-300k a piece. Essentially, it's just some antenna's (~50k) and then some routing equipment, likely with 1 or 2 100Gbit uplinks redundantly. There is no need to build more than 10 of such stations over Ukraine, looking at the total amount of users.

A network with a few hundred thousand households will need a throughput of several hundred Gbit/s. We're talking 20,000 terminals with about 150-200k users here in Ukraine. Many on mobile and in emergency connectivity type situation, not people torrenting, watching 4k video streams or engaging in Zoom calls all day. So the actual bandwidth requirement will not be that great. It may be that SpaceX also needs to upgrade their backbone, but again.. we're talking a few hundred Gbit at most. These are not spectacular numbers. If such an upgrade would run 2-3 million in cost, I would be surprised. Now the big ticket item here is likely the satellite launches. Musk mentioned those in his post. But, at best, SpaceX is either accelerating planned launches or rather more likely putting satellites in a different orbit so that they get better coverage over Ukraine. Essentially, this is something they were planning anyway. 

But in essence, what we are seeing here is infrastructure costs that add value to SpaceX, which represent future income, that they were planning to make *anyway*, be attributed to Ukraine. At best we can state that they are redirecting the buildup of their network to put a focus on Ukraine rather than earlier planned areas, which alters their financial outlook. That is completely fair, and should be looked into. However, we also know that a lot of terminals and subscriptions in Ukraine are simply paid for by the people there themselves. So we're also seeing a corresponding peak in revenue to match the expenditures. Yes, the revenue will be much less than the expenditures, *but that is in the nature* of a telco business. You invest big upfront and then get a steady stream of income with a very significant profit margin in the end. 

So frankly, it is very clear that Musk is counting investments in his own company, which currently have a corresponding revenue stream, as part of this enormous cost he cannot supposedly bear. That is the **only** way you could ever get close to the mentioned $400 million. And that is a wholly disingenuous way of looking at it. What I would agree on here is that they are potentially seeing a larger than expected CAPEX, which means something for their cash position, and that they are positioning infrastructure for Ukraine which will probably not be a long term revenue stream as normal internet will get restored over time there, reducing the need for Starlink.

And that conversation is totally fair to have. But the ""I need $400 million or Ukraine loses Starlink"" is complete bullshit. It's opportunism and war profiteering and Musk can absolutely fuck off and die in a fire for that.",1665853958.0,1665853684.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isfijy6,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

The turbo tax example is a direct counterexample to that claim. There is money to be made in selling TurboTax. And Intuit is a efficient at making and selling TurboTax. But the invisible hand of the free market has not produce the most efficient solution to the general problem. It's produced the most efficient tax software solution. The overall problem has a better solution.

> But if we are talking about technology and tech companies, then being more efficient means achieving more faster and with less money.

Intuit is a tech company, so even here it's a fitting counter example. look, I agree that if you want to compare the tax software some government office would make to the tax software the market will produce, then Turbo Tax will be better than whatever Humboldt County will produce. But that doesn't mean needing tax software is the most efficient way to manage the overall problem.

There are times where the scale of the issue gives government solutions a distinct advantage. And there are times where the diversity and competition of private industry gives it a distinct advantage.

But the magical value ascribed to the word ""efficient"" is one I think we should always question. Private industry is more efficient at what exactly? 

Consider a billion cars driving on a million roads, with used tires piling up in landfills and thousands of deaths in accidents and oil and gas being consumed and dumped into the environment. Is that the most efficient solution to transportation? It's clearly producing a shit ton of waste. But it's time efficient, compared to a shitty bus system or Uber or something, especially out in the rural parts of America. But elsewhere in the world the public system is more efficient. In dense cities the automobile is less efficient. They are too big and take up too much space causing congestion and the distances travelled are smaller and the locations more congruous. You find many people all want to go from this section of the city to that, and so it makes more sense to have public transportation do exactly that. It's a lot like flight. It makes more sense to have 2 big airplanes leaving twice a day to take 300 people each from NY to London than to have 600 single person shuttles flying from NY to London all day long.

Efficiency isn't another word for best. And the market doesn't always produce the best solution or the most efficient solution to the overall system. It will produce the most efficient solution -- in terms of making profit for the company involved -- for the specific subset of the problem that the market decides to address.",False,1665858488.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isfu8gm,,9,2,0,2,0,0,

The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.[[119]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\)#cite_note-evolutionary-119) Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one [wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998[[120]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\)#cite_note-120)) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified ""diversity partitioning"" and ""clustering analysis"" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols. Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.[[121]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\)#cite_note-121) Philosopher Lisa Gannett has argued that [biogeographical ancestry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biogeographical_ancestry&action=edit&redlink=1), a concept devised by [Mark Shriver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_D._Shriver) and [Tony Frudakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Frudakis), is not an objective measure of the biological aspects of race as Shriver and Frudakis claim it is. She argues that it is actually just a ""local category shaped by the U.S. context of its production, especially the forensic aim of being able to predict the race or ethnicity of an unknown suspect based on DNA found at the crime scene.""[[122]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\)#cite_note-122)",False,1665835175.0,t3_y4dzyq,t1_isem8gk,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
