Day 90 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet during the day, but around 3 hours ago a lot of missiles were fired in our direction from Belgorod, apparently at least one of them was intercepted, and we don’t know where others landed. There were reports of explosions being heard in the city, but we don’t know what was hit. There are some loud sounds of explosions even right now, but they are most likely coming from our artillery.

That statement made today by Shoigu was very funny; saying that they are actually intentionally slowing down the pace of the special operation to avoid civilian casualties is such bullshit. “Yeah, we are on day 90 of our 3 day operation because we wanted it to go slowly, and no, you didn’t see our victory speech, that was posted on day 3 of the war by a state news agency because we forgot to turn auto-posting off.”

How do they even say such garbage with straight faces? They are very experienced in lying. And then that whole reviving USSR thing, what even is that? They are already proposing to change Russia’s flag to USSR one in their Duma and recreating soviet pioneers. It’s as if they looked at USSR and decided that the best things about it were actually the Iron Curtain and Gulag.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg added he was optimistic that NATO would welcome the two countries as members. 

He warned business leaders gathered at the forum against trading security for short-term economic gains, as the war in Ukraine has highlighted the perils of dependence on ""authoritarian regimes."" 

Stoltenberg cited overreliance on Russia for energy and on China for technology infrastructure, such as the 5G network. 

""Freedom is more important than free trade,"" he said.

Stoltenberg's comments come as Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday that Finland and Sweden will attend the NATO summit taking place in Madrid in June.

""We are going to welcome two new countries in NATO and I think this is very important for European Union stability and for the NATO future,"" Sanchez said during a question and answer session in Davos.

Madrid will host the NATO summit from June 28 to June 30. Expanding the military alliance, which currently has 30 member states, will be a key topic.

From CNN’s Sophie Jeong in Hong Kong

Outgoing President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte has criticized his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for killing innocent civilians in Ukraine.

Duterte said that, while both he and Putin have been called killers, the two men are different.

""A lot of people are saying that Putin and I are the same because we kill people,"" said Duterte during a public address on Monday night, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency (PNA). 

""But I kill criminals. I do not kill children and elderly. What is happening in Russia and America is different from what is happening here.""

Duterte said he was not condemning his ""friend"" Putin, but was rather sharing his sentiment.

""Putin is my friend. You are in control of everything. Anyway, you really started the ruckus there. Control your soldiers. They’re running amok,"" Duterte said, according to the news agency. 

Duterte also requested that the Russian Embassy in the Philippines relay his message to Putin, saying it is Putin’s obligation to ensure the safety of the innocent.

""The embassy of Russia, if you’re listening, I am not picking a quarrel with anybody. I said Putin is a friend of mine,"" he said. ""But … it is your moral obligation to see to it that the civilians, the innocent ones, children, the elderly, the women … They are too vulnerable.""

Some context: Russian troops have been accused of perpetrating a litany of alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Evidence is mounting of indiscriminate killings of civilians attempting to flee the violence and victims found with their hands tied behind their backs, as well as an attack on a maternity hospital and a theater-turned-shelter.

Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians, but CNN journalists on the ground in Ukraine have seen firsthand evidence of atrocities at multiple locations across the country.

The figure of 22,000 is based, Andriushchenko said, on the many contacts he and other town hall officials continue to have with officials trapped inside. But he believes the actual figure could be much higher.

Andriushchenko said that the process of reburying the dead has been complicated by Russian official insistence that reclaimed bodies be brought to a morgue and that a person claiming a body must agree to record a video in which the applicant says the deceased was killed by the Ukrainian military.

From CNN’s Inke Kappeler and Arnaud Siad 

Russia would remain a threat for peace in Europe even after a ceasefire in Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said on Tuesday.

“That Russia changes immediately after a ceasefire has been agreed is daydreaming. It would remain a danger for peace in Europe,” Rau said during a joint press conference with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock.

Rau said he feared a Russian invasion into Poland, as well as “the danger of an armed invasion of the countries in the NATO eastern flank.”

Poland and Germany must strive for Russia ""to suffer a strategic defeat and its occupation forces to leave Ukraine within the borders recognized by international law,"" Rau also said.

It is utterly astonishing how after 3 months the Russian public continues to show a level of passivity towards their government's action the beggars belief. 

Like many people, i've been watching some of the POW interviews that the Ukrainians released, and in almost all of them the soldiers and their families seem uncomfortable criticizing their government, uncomfortable when confronted with what their soldiers are doing in Ukraine.

I've watched some videos of Russian youtubers showing what life is like in Russia, and even those youtubers that clearly seem more aware about what is happening than their fellow citizens try to really bend over backwards to avoid saying anything too direct about the war in Ukraine, avoiding even mentioning the word ""war"" itself. Clearly out of fears about the real consequences that they may face for saying anything that their government disapproves of.

It is shocking to me, it's a world that i just can't even imagine living on. I should consider myself lucky, I live in Brazil, a relatively young democracy with many problems, but here I never felt afraid of speaking my mind about my government (I wasn't born during the dictatorship years). So i just can't imagine what is like to live in a society like Russia, where it seems most people want to avoid dealing with ""politics"" in order to protect themselves from being a target of their own government.

Yes I know that there have been protests, and there have been signs of real anger from people in the major cities against their government, but those seem to have died down in the past 3 months, it seems Russians just don't want to deal with their government, either because of fear or simple indifference.",1653368587.0,1653368254.0,t3_uwi6fr,t3_uwi6fr,,0,104,0,104,0,0,

This is the 3rd attempt by Russia to create a cauldron around the Donbass - two larger attempts have been abandoned and Russia have been forced to consolidate their force (and this is a large well trained force) around this 3rd pocket just to close out taking Luhanks Oblast - and there may well still be weeks left until that's fully taken.

It's easy to get lost on this focus point but some things to remember:

- Zoom out of your map. Russia have a huge ammount of ground to take still in Donetsk Oblast including the largest population centres.
- Ukraine continue to train large amounts of forces (goal of 1 million men).
- Russia have not mobilized fully, if they do it would take months for that manpower increase to reach the battlefield - Ukraine have been training new forces for 3 months. 
- Heavy weapon deliveries contine to increase to Ukraine and they become more effective with said weapons.
- A naval invasion of Odessa is out of the question now with the promised Harpoons/Brimstones so this frees up more Ukrainian force.
- Russia have to hold this land that does not want them, and Ukraine do not need to sit at a specified line so they don't break a treaty this time. How do Russia expect to hold this ground long term and make money from it?
- Sanctions are a slow moving cancer on Russian economy. Right now they're ignoring it but at some point larger symptoms will show. If they ignore this cancer for too long it will be terminal for Russia.

Yes land and battles are being lost, and it's fair to think Ukraine won't be able to retake it all, but as a war this is far from finished.",1653382227.0,1653382089.0,t3_uwi6fr,t3_uwi6fr,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

Poopface tries to take as much land as he can, then freeze the conflict with a negotiated ceasefire. He then waits to replenish forces, engage in disinformation and let the world turn.  He then tries again when the time is ripe (see Trump regime).

Fortunately Ukraine and the world, having seen this movie before, do not accept a proposed ceasefire. And, they have the means via global partnerships to continue to prosecute scale offensives until Russia finally cedes Ukraine after a long and bloody conflict.  

A DMZ is established and a massive defensive posture is developed supported directly by the allies. Reconstruction begins. Ukraine joins the EU and NATO benefitting all parties, much to RU chagrin. Tourism increases along with enhanced prosperity for farmers and burgeoning military manufacturing.  20 years down the road Ukrainians enjoy an exceptional lifestyle.

An intransigent RU in the meantime regresses more and more on multiple axes. Authoritarianism increases to maintain control until a sentinel event causes it to collapse completely under its own pressure. History repeats.

The YT video is very recent, posted just about an hour ago: 

>	Recap of today's livestream between A. Arestovych and M. Feygyn. Russians are pressing on the Ukrainian group located north of Sloviansk, pushing it into Siverskyi Donets river in an attempt to cut it into parts and defeat them.

>	Russians failed at Izyum direction but they have success in Lyman - reportedly half the town is now captured. Significant problems for Ukrainian group around Lisichansk and Severdonetsk which are under real threat of operational encirclement.

>	How is it all done? 5-6 fresh BTG's have been thrown in against exhausted Ukrainian troops, in addition to air and artillery superiority. Likewise, offensive towards Bahmut from Popasna continues. Bahmut is under very heavy aviation and artillery shelling.

>	Holding up for now but the situation is difficult and will get even more difficult. If Siverskyi Donets is crossed the ‘cauldron’ will start closing. Svetlodar has been abandoned by Ukrainian troops although the withdrawal was controlled.

>	It appears the Russian command set an objective to put all they have into reaching LPR and DPR borders. For that, they are bringing fresh BTGs formed from reservists, PMCs, units transferred from Far East, parts of BTG from Belgorod Oblast, Rosgvardia.

>	They continue accumulation and the group will be increased to around 10-12 more BTGs according to Arestovych’s estimates. So the situation is very difficult across the whole of frontline.

>	Something brewing up in Zaporizhye area as Russians formed 3 BTGs in Vasilyevka while attempting to reach Orekhov and Huliaipole, although for now no changes and Zaporizhye residents are not yet recommended to evacuate.

>	In Krivyi Rih direction Russians reached Belaya Krinitsa but it’s very difficult for them due to artillery and aviation strikes and lack of manpower. Mykolaiv and Kherson - no news to report.

>	Why is Russia in a hurry to conduct this offensive? Some crisis is likely brewing, but what exactly is not clear, and someone in Russia needs success. Arestovych believes it is certainly NOT linked to a potential upcoming UAF counter-offensive - it’s too much of a hurry.

>	The number of Russian emissaries in the West and open attempts to buy votes of politicians/lobbying show Russia’s desire to demonstrate its capability to pull Ukraine into Minsk-3 agreement.

>	Even though Russia suffered many defeats they want the West to believe the war will be long, Putin has ambitions, so they should be given what they want in Kherson and LDPR and then continue business as usual. But Ukraine says there will be no Minsk-3.

>	Gen. Major Kanamat Bitashiev who was taken down in Su-25 a few days ago. How did he end up there? Feygyn states he started from Krymsk, where nearly complete aircraft unit was destroyed. He is not alone like that.

>	This means Russian aviation is having terrible losses in personnel if they have to get in retired, PMC-style types. 

>	Also, Arestovych confirms that the Su-34 pilot with his co-pilot who were shot and ejected (we heard intercepted comms days ago), they both have perished.

>	While fall of Donetsk group will certainly be a very significant morale blow for Ukraine, the war won’t be lost. Just to reach Dneprovetrovsk border Russia would have to assault at least 3-4 similar localities, which will take 1,5-2 months each.

>	However, Russia is burning staff forces, and soon all they’ll have left will be PMCs, reservists, L/DPR, which will not even resemble a true army. With lend-lease coming within the next 2-3 months, this will reflect on Russia’s ability to defend Ukrainian counter-offensive. /end

More war crime cases to be prosecuted by Ukraine: AJE correspondent

After the sentencing of a Russian soldier to life in prison for allegedly shooting a Ukrainian civilian, more war crime cases are expected to be tried in Ukraine, Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi has said.

“What we are likely to see is many more such cases as this conflict continues,” Basravi said from Kyiv. “We’ve got two pilots possibly being seen in court in the coming days. That’s the next case on the horizon. And Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating more and more cases of what they’re calling alleged war crimes on a near-daily basis.”

I think those rumors are credible, the situation for Ukraine in that salient has been deteriorating quickly over the past week, staying in that city likely will result in an encirclement of the Ukrainian troops. 

 The problem for the Ukrainians will be to conduct an orderly retreat from the salient. Lets hope they are able to do that and evacuate the civilians with them and avoid another Mariupol situation, as much as it was heroic for the Ukrainian troops in Mariupol to hold down 15 thousand Russian soldiers for 2 months, the cost in lives will forever be a tragedy for the Ukrainian people.  
 Worth pointing out that the Russian troops that conducted the breakthrough in Popasna were the mercenaries of the Wagner group, they appear to be working far more effectively than the regular soldiers in the Russian army, probably due to better leadership that isn't rooted in the old soviet model. 

  
 It's also worth pointing out another smaller breakthrough south of Popasna, the Russian army in that sector effectively exploited gaps in the Ukrainian lines to threaten the Ukrainian troops with encirclement, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat from their defensive positions. 

  
 I'm pointing these out for those saying that the Russians haven't learn from their failures in the early phase of the war, you are making the same mistake the Russians made when they invaded Ukraine, which is of underestimating the enemy.   
 We need to remain realistic about the situation in the war, even though the Ukrainians have proven themselves to be a match for the Russian army, victory for Ukraine remains a difficulty and bloody affair that is certainly not a foregone conclusion, they need more weapons.

 I say this because over the past few weeks i think the urgency to support Ukraine has slowed down due to the failures of the Russian army giving people a false sense of security that Ukraine will be able to quickly deal with the Russian army basically on their own. The Russians may lack motivated men for the war, but they are making it up with sheer firepower in terms of artillery, tanks and airpower. Ukraine desperately needs more artillery, more tanks, more aircraft, more anti aircraft systems to be able to not only defend against the Russian offensives, but also to go on the offensive themselves and retake the occupied territories.",False,1653413787.0,t3_uwi6fr,t3_uwi6fr,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

The US will not renew this license. This means that the Russian Federation is still going to default.When will it happen?

The next dollar payments are coming to the Russian Federation on June 23-24. If the payments fail, the formal default of the Russian Federation may wait at the end of July.Why is it important?In recent months, the Russian authorities have tried their best to prevent a default. And they can be understood: the very word “default” evokes in Russians an instant association with August 1998 – the collapse of the ruble, the collapse of the banking system and the loss of savings. But the analogy is hardly applicable to 2022: in 1998, the default became the direct cause of the crisis, and now it will become just one of its formal signs. In the short term, the default effect is unlikely to be noticeable. The external debt of the Russian Federation after 2014 generally decreased and is now at a level below 30% of GDP. This year, the Ministry of Finance is not going to borrow, and the financial markets of the EU and the US are actually closed to the Russian Federation and without any default.What do I get from this?But all this does not mean that the default will pass unnoticed by the Russian Federation. Most likely, the US Treasury will keep the Russian Federation in default for a long time - at least until the war in Ukraine ends. This will mean high borrowing costs, low investment, slow economic growth, lowerstandard of living and general economic decline. Even Chinese creditors will not want to lend to the Russian Federation as long as it remains in default, and if they do, then at very high interest rates, one of the American managers predicted in a conversation with Bloomberg.",False,1653430031.0,t3_uwi6fr,t3_uwi6fr,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Hidden Russians will be able to slay Ukrainians as Ukrainians attempt to advance. Historically, wars basically trade lives 1:1 and you just try to be better than that. Russia, now fighting more cagily, is advancing less and drawing more Ukrainians in.

Both sides have established trenches manned by machine guns. Its amazing what an assault rifle does to trench warfare. You still need the same trench architecture, but far fewer soldiers to helm them. They are also difficult to see, low rises, fox holes etc. 

Often an advancing soldier only discovers the enemy after the defender has the ambush on said soldier. This is at the heart of why wars trade lives so equally. Only incredible overreach and hubris can lead to the wipe out the Russians suffered early in the war. America's vast advantages over their enemies, including things like vision correcting lenses, led lopsided conflicts. Russia does not have that advantage over Ukraine. 

If Russia does not commit overreaches, Ukraine's advantages dry up quickly too. Smart artillery is an enormous advantage, except that someone has to crawl up to those trenches and see what is around. Russia is capable of using thermal blankets etc to obscure heat sources, and take more hidden positions to be less visible to drones. However, Russia does not have Javelins or NLAWs. 

For Ukraine to push into these vipers nests -- similar to the ones Ukrainians deployed against Russia -- they need tanks. Tanks with close infantry support and forward operators to call artillery and air strikes. Tanks offer on hand overwhelming fire power exactly where you need it to be as an infantry pushing through defended enemy territory. 

Trenches are made up of a jagged series of short line segments. Turns in the trench serve to protect soldiers -- if an enemy gets a firing line down the trench, the turns take those lines down.

Immediately after the was started, I recall Zelensky implying he was willing to cede territory in exchange for sovereignty (basically that Russia drops the ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"" demands).

Now with Russia's failure in Ukraine and Ukraine stronger position, the position seems reversed. Russia apparently is willing to settle for Donbass but Zelensky is not willing to budge an inch. However the most contenious issue here is Crimea. I suppose that technically, it is possible for Ukraine to drive Russia out of Donbass, it will take a tremendous buildup of foreign weapons and huge mobilization, but it is not impossible. Ukraine in my opinion has reached a situation where it is steadily improving its position and Russia degrading it.

But Crimea, that one Ukraine can't militarily retake and Russia is not going to end the war without at least Ukranian recognition of Crimea. If things go so bad Ukraine drives Putin out of Donbass, I could see Putin trying to save face with excuses like saying they evacuated the Russian population or something like that. But Crimea they will never cede. Some people have mentioned that by controlling the rest of Ukraine, Ukraine can simply deny Crimea of water, while this is possible remember that during this conflict Russia opened up again the floodgates and even if Ukraine close the watter supply again, Crimea has likely attained enough water to last for a couple of years. Now, it is in doubt if this strategy would even work for taking back Crimea, but assuming it does, I don't see it happening in less than 10 years.

People REALLY underestimate how big of a problem this has caused Russia down the line.

When airlines want to expand operations, even state owned ones, they almost never do so by buying additional aircraft (which is heinously expensive), what they do is they lease aircraft owned by a consortium of some kind (imagine you and ten thousand of your friends chipping in for equal shares in a 747 which is leased out for millions a year). As time goes on, if the new routes turn out to be profitable for the long-term, then in the normal course of business with them purchasing a few new aircraft every year, they'll phase out the leased ones and switch to full-ownership.

There is no way any of the proper leasing entities are going to deal with Russia for the next decade or two. The only potential option I can see MIGHT be for a Chinese government owned entity going through with it, or the Chinese government issuing guarantees to their leasing entities.

Which means that there won't be hardly ANY new aircraft in Russian airlines for quite some time. Worse, the aircraft they've seized will almost CERTAINLY end up with a gap in their maintenance paperwork due to a lack of foreign produced spare parts. Even a day's gap in maintenance causes jetliners to become uninsurable without a full rework/inspection that's almost as costly as just buying a new plane. Which means these aircraft will more than likely NOT be allowed to fly in many foreign countries.

In short, that one decision has almost certainly destroyed or, best case for them, crippled beyond repair the Russian domestic airline industry.",1653444438.0,1653432087.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9usv8a,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

However, I don't think it's proven Ukraine can't counter-attack and I'm not sure Russia could sustain a strong defence long vs Ukraine. But it's hard make any clear predictions. Some ""experts"" predict a Russian economic collapse later in the fall but they could very well be wrong.

Also Russia could hope more nations or influential people in the west starts pushing for concessions. Kissinger as an example even said that a humiliated Russia would be bad for the entire world and they'd fall more into Chinese hands which USA doesn't want. Currently this doesn't see much support in the west but it could become a bigger factor as time goes on.

The perception of a weakening ruble is a political problem for Putin. People mistakenly believe exchange rates indicate how well sanctions are working, so by propping up the ruble, Putin can reduce confidence in sanctions.

I have heard people say, both on forums like these and in real life, that Zelenskyy should be more appreciative. I don’t think I have to point this out but I will anyway: that’s bullshit. They can fan and fawn over the West AFTER every Russian troop is out of its borders and they have security guarantees in place. 

They are doing their job and that job in some cases is ensuring their troops get what they need. I think it’s easy to get caught up and have this sense that “we” are winning but the truth is we aren’t. Losing 100 Ukrainian troops a day and countless civilian casualties says we aren’t.

It's too early to tell. We are very much entering into the longest part of the war now.

They were already fighting the separatists prior to February, who have now had Russia bolster their defence and dig in. This is very different from repelling attempted Russian advances away from their supply lines.

At the moment, Russia appears to be trying to consolidate its power by taking key Ukrainian strongholds in Donbas (Severodonetsk specifically, in which they are trying to surround and siege) because the key to Russia's goals now is to capture the east and south, hold it, and annex it.

Ukraine has seemingly been focusing on preparation for more large scale offensives, whilst pushing Russia out of Kharkiv and repelling Russian offensives where possible. It's going to take a lot of time and resources to push Russia out of the occupied areas.

Ukraine is obviously not a perfect example of western democracy. It suffers from corruption, more so in 2014. Yes, the constitutional requirement for impeachment requires a two thirds majority, and the rada was ten votes short. They then came up with another excuse to remove the current president. Ukraine was obviously not a stalwart bastion of stability in 2014. We should criticize them for what they did and urge them to be better. I think we can all agree “better” means become a better bastion for democracy and the following of constitutional rules and conventions. They will not do this if they backslide into Russian influence, a country that is immensely worse at following democratic ideals than Ukraine ever was.

It is also worth pointing out that there is quite a bit of a connotational difference between the word “coup” and what happened. The Ukrainian president was removed by a functional parliament that possessed a clear mandate by public support and operated within a relatively democratic, civil framework. The surveys showing the percentage of Ukrainians that supported his removal reveal that. Ukraine, by and large, wanted him gone. This is very, very different from how “coups” are usually undertaken. A coup involves seizure of power, when no particular group did so after his removal. The country held democratic elections. Calling it a full blown coup is disingenuous at best.

Negotiations at that point is giving Russia an opportunity to pull out, and Ukraine to regain their complete territories without sacrificing more lives. But everyone knows; If Ukraine has beaten Russia so soundly that all gains have been reversed, they will have the power to go further and take the rest of Donbas. And if they secure their original 2013 eastern borders, it will free up a massive army contigent, sufficient to take Crimea. For Russia to defend Crimea will be a nightmare for them. The bridge will be cut and they will hardly be able to get more hardware  in. And meanwhile Ukraine will be continously uparmed, while Russia suckles on their old USSR reserve material. Zelensky has no mandate in the Ukrainian people to sue for a peace that leaves Ukrainian territory on Russian hands, among the Ukrainian people, and he knows it. Irs pretty much the only thing he could do that would make them consider another leader.

So negotations make sense. Every day with a ceasefire buys Ukraine more time to prepare, more time to incorporate new weapons deliveries. The only thing Russia can threaten with is mobilization, which generally wouldnt save them at that point, and could make the population rise up. Ukraine will probably offer some token concessions, like pull demands for reperations, not join NATO the next 5 years and ask for sanctions on Russia to be lifted. Russia will throw a few leaders to the wolves, hoping this will save the top leadership, and otherwise not acknowledge defeat, but pull out if all of Ukraine. Reality of the matter is that Russia entwined itself into a deathmatch, and there is no scenario where Russia wins, and no scenario where the Ukrainian people accept anything less than a full victory. And the US and Europe both has committed to helping Ukraine until it achieves that win. I E; Russia in terms of its Ukrainian holdings is dead man walking. And what remains of the Russian armed forces after the execution is entirely up to when someone in Russia with power, who's first name is not Vladmir, acts to save the remnants.",1653424519.0,1653424084.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9uggm2,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

If anything it might be Russia's most well-defined long international border with another state...and Finland has a much larger army than Estonia if Russia tried to use force. It didn't in 2004, and if it did now it would be opening up a second front while Finland has security assurances. It would also be a new front right next to a founding NATO member (Norway).

> Hungary is an enemy of Ukraine, they fuel pro-Hungarian separatism in Ukraine's Transkarpatia

There is an ongoing diplomatic conflict due to Ukraine's language law negatively affecting the Hungarian minority, all 150k of them out of a population of 1250k just in the Zakarpatska oblast. That's about it.

The only thing more stupid and suicidal than Transcarpathian separatism would be Hungary actually annexing that area, inviting EU and NATO sanctions, diplomatic fallout with all of its neighbours, economic destruction, isolation and over 10% of Hungary's population being angry Ukrainians. Not Hungary has the army to do it.

> So this move, likely coordinated with Russia, aims to put extra pressure on Ukraine, by making Ukraine station some troops in that region, similar to threat from Belarus and Transnistria.

This is just bad alternative history. Any aggression from Hungary would invite most of what I wrote above, with what to gain?

The real reason is that Hungary has been in a state of emergency for about 2 years already due to covid. That is about to expire at the end of this month, and they needed a new excuse to prolong it. During emergency the government has more power and can issue decrees that make the life of opposition areas and mayors harder. That's about it.",False,1653417441.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9trvqd,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

However the small offensives are achieving tactical successes here and there, so whatever the situation is for Russia, it clearly isn't much better for Ukraine. However at the same time, we did see the Ukrainians making another big ambush against a Russian supply convoy during the Popasna offensive, so clearly the Russians haven't fixed all their issues that they faced in late February either.   


I think you are right, the big unknown remains the UA mobilization effort. Yesterday i heard from one of the people covering the war (WarInUkraine channel) someone that seems to have a decent amount of knowledge about Ukraine, and he was saying that though the Ukrainians have mobilized some 700 thousand troops, they don't have the equipment to properly arm all those soldiers yet, so they are mostly using that pool of troops to replenish losses rather than creating new divisions. If this is true, it paints a fairly bleak picture for the Ukrainian military chances of conducting a big counter offensive in the summer as some analysts are expecting to happen. It will also explain why we haven't seen a big stream of new divisions being sent to the front yet, in fact we've seen evidence that the Ukrainians are actually having to overstretch their lines when pulling exhausted divisions out of the fight, which explains why the Russians were able to have a bit more successes in the east over the past few weeks.

Attacking is necessary to actually win but defending always gives a force advantage. At the moment Russia (as the nominally more powerful force and still the initiator of the conflict) is attacking and the Ukraine is, quiet rightly, defending because that actually gives them the advantage in terms of exhaustion plus long established defensive lines and logistics.

The real question is when we get to the inflection point when Russia eases off and tries to consolidate its gains will Ukraine be able to mount an effective counterattack? Will they have enough fresh troops and equipment ready to go on location? Will Russia be able to dig in and cycle its troops effectively? 

We already saw around Kyiv and Kharkiv that the Ukrainians seemed capable of pushing the back father and faster than the Russians' seemed to expect and, while there was extreme disorganisation in the first instance, it does not indicate a strong capacity by the Russians to actually defend captured ground effectively. Plus there is the problem of partisan action behind captured lines and a broken infrastructure that makes securing territory behind an active frontline even more difficult.

For the moment though, because Russia is the attacker in the east, then any movement at all is going to be in its favour, Ukraine is simply not launching a large scale counter offensive to actually recover territory there at the moment.

1. Ukraine must now advance, and puts Russia in the ""defending"" role; which gives Russia an advantage.  Typically, you need numbers anywhere from 3:1 to 5:1, if you're attacking.  In order to achieve those advantages (locally), you need to outmaneuver your opponent, but this takes time to reposition, and reposition again.

2. The terrain in the South Eastern region is generally more flat and less trees than the northern region (Kyiv etc). So this also gives Russian equipment and tactics an advantage over what Ukraine did in the North.

3. Ukraine had some significant intel advantages that helped them during the first phase of the war (ie. they knew when and where Russia would try to strike, and Ukraine wiped out those attacking forces - these kinds of advantages will be more difficult to use as the Russians are not taking these risks anymore).

Ukraine has also stated that they're gearing up for a counterattack; likely in mid-June to late-July.  This should guide expectations on how this will go.   Long term.  The exception here is going to be that Russia is dealing with some huge deficiencies in equipment, and some recent heavy losses.  In the short term, there's a likelyhood that individual units are going to collapse and take worse losses, and even get deprived of their supplies by Ukrainian operations.  But longer-term, as Russia digs in and these terrible losses become fewer and farther between, this will bolster Russian morale.  Which will carry them through until the big Ukrainian counterattack.

Time is on Ukraine's side; they're getting more western weapons and sanctions are working against Russia, and popular support of the war is degrading.  The only thing Russia has going for it is that the leadership is not going to back down. Until they're forced to.",1653401645.0,1653401302.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9sxl0e,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

I have mixed feelings about that. I think this is very bad economically and financially.

In the long run this implies that the many many russian tourists, customers, rich and poor who bought our cheese, yachts, that came to many of our regions won't come anymore.

Rich people in countries that aren't US-NATO friendly will invest and spend much less in our countries to avoid them to happen what happened to Russian citizens. Why, I, a wealthy Iranian who sells cotton to the entire world would want to invest in Italy? Why I, a wealthy Chinese would invest in London rather than friendlier places?

There's regions in Poland that don't work anymore, because most of their agricultural export went to Russia. There's regions in Italy that literally depended on Russian tourism and where Russians accounted for far more than 20% of income. Some cities in Sardgena lived of the work that all the millionaires and billionares created. Plumbers, fishers, carpenters and many other.

Rimini, another city in Italy, saw more than 100k Russian tourists in 2019, already down from the 2014 era, but they literally represented the difference between being profitable and people losing their jobs and income.

I don't have much sympathy for those sanctions and seizures. They come late, they aren't preventing the war, they aren't preventing Ukraine from losing pieces day by day.

It will even be happy to “help” Russia by sending it’s military in on the Russian government’s request to keep any revolt from the Russian people. China is not adverse to owning Russia.

Actually no. Generally you need to heavily outnumber your opponent to successfully attack. This is why they quickly abandoned the entire north front to make a big build up around Izium (and maybe even give up on Odesa) because they quickly realized they were in for a much harder fight and had to find a more realistic goal.

But once they have the territory they want they can set up proper defenses which will require a lot less men and preferably around some easy to defend geographic element like a river. They'll still require a lot of men and it might be too much for them but being on the offensive vs defensive is a massive difference when it comes to needed manpower and logistics.

But if the Taliban wants to join the UN we can actually pressure them into more humane gouverning: let girls go to school, stop stoning as death penalty, learn to compromise, etc.. That all would actually be great achievements: no wars and still we managed to change the situation. 

Well that does sound like naive optimism as well, with the risk that the Taliban decides to revert back to the old ways once they are in, but that will have political fallout as well: they abviously can not be trusted.

Russia won Kherson, Melitopol, Mariupol and Izium. Ukraine won major victories at Kyiv, Cherniev, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. 

Now, Russia has pulled back from the offensive on all but one front, and is making modest gains. We've seen this before, in some of those places where Ukraine eventually won. We also saw this in places where Russia eventually won. We've also seen simultaneous exchanges of territory.

In the end, Ukraine may lose all of the South from Crimea to and including the Donbas. Or it may reclaim some of it. Or it may reclaim all of it. Or it may lose more territory to the South.

However, the survival of a homeland for Ukraine and the degradation of Russia's military and economic power are both enormous victories both for Ukraine and for the West - especially given how this war was *supposed* to play out and how it likely *should* have played out.",False,1653404222.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9t8j28,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

The (internationally unlawful) Russian annexation of Crimea preceded open hostilities in Donbas, which were instigated by Russian-backed separatists.

Yanukovych term may have been up in less than a year but had he stayed in power, Ukraine might have ended up a puppet state to Russia, as is the case with Belarus.  


The Russian regime is ethno-nationalist and imperialist. Breaking away from Kremlin orbit as soon as possible was a good thing. The uprising in 2014 prevented Ukraine from becoming a Russian puppet state. This was a good thing. Had Russia not annexed Crimea and not conducted a proxy war in Donbas, there would not have been conflict on Ukrainian soil. Russia was, and is, the aggressor in regards to Ukraine.  


I hope the current Russian regime falls sooner rather than later so that peaceful relations can resume. The Russian people are not enemies of Europe.

In all cases, it is a victory for the human spirit. It should have been particularly welcome to socialists, since a great enemy of socialism had at last collapsed. Like you, I was intrigued to see how people—including people who had considered themselves anti-Stalinist and anti-Leninist—were demoralized by the collapse of the tyranny.

This was taken as part of his critique on the underreporting of the US backed mass killings in East Timor by Indonesia which no one seemed to be aware of. 

He begins his explanation stating

>	“I mean the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot, 1975 through 1978 - that atrocity - I think it would be hard to find any example of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury.”-- 


So, that was taken as him claiming that a bunch of people didn’t get killed. 

That’s my understanding of the controversy but feel to post another source.

I have more issues with Chomsky downplaying the atrocities in the Balkans, which for some reason he acknowledges but doesn’t consider genocide.

> In late 1975, U.S. NSA and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told the Thai foreign minister: ""You should tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them. They are murderous thugs but we won't let that stand in our way.""[23] In 1998 Kissinger elaborated: ""The Thais and the Chinese did not want a Vietnamese-dominated Indochina. We didn't want the Vietnamese to dominate. I don't believe we did anything for Pol Pot. But I suspect we closed our eyes when some others did something for Pol Pot.""

Like, Chomsky's an asshat for the Ukraine stance, and probably took some stupid contrarian stance on the Khmer Rouge, but it's not like he had any diplomatic sway.

The #1 goal of Ukrainian defenders at Severodonetsk is to kill as many Russian invaders as possible, while minimizing Ukrainian loss-of-life as much as possible. That means to **retreat**, especially retreats to better defended locations, is incredibly important.

The land really isn't that important. Yes, its a river-crossing and has political value being the last city in Luhansk. But Ukraine needs to keep the big picture in mind, they can recapture the city later, during the offensive push.

-------

Ukraine certainly shouldn't give up Severodonetsk without a fight. They shouldn't ""unnecessarily"" retreat. But commanders on the ground must be given the option, and we cheerleaders on the side must understand the tradeoffs and long-term gameplan.",1653422388.0,1653421832.0,t3_uwi6fr,t1_i9uggk1,,4,8,0,8,0,0,

> The ultimate aim of an attack on a town area is to break the morale of the population which occupies it. To ensure this, we must achieve two things: first, we must make the town physically uninhabitable and, secondly, we must make the people conscious of constant personal danger. The immediate aim, is therefore, twofold, namely, to produce (i) destruction and (ii) fear of death.

There were bombings of factories and logistics centres but in parallel the allied also performed terror bombings. About half a million German civilians died.

There was a clear difference between American and British bombing here. Americans spent the equivalent of $20 billion to develop a way to do precision bombings, the Norden Bombsight. With it the plan was to safely hit factories from a high altitude. It did not really work and Americans ended up bombing huge areas around factories in the hope to also hit the factory. 

The British did not really attempt high altitude precision bombing. They realized it did not work, and instead used much of their strategic bomb fleet for terror bombings. 

All in all the allied spent vast amount of resources on the strategic bomb fleet. They released millions of bombs and lost tens of thousands of planes, and almost 160,000 people doing so.

To answer your question, they matter of course, that's why Ukraina has to retake these areas claimed by Russia to save people living there from misery (and getting their wealth spent on corruption, or to make Moscow people's live better).

From what I've seen in multiple countries I visited, the wealthy abuse the poor disproportionally more in Russia than in western countries.

That doesn't reduce the utility in being able to move quickly. Lets compare the situation in the early 80s (M270 started service) with the current situation in Ukraine.

Early 80's counter battery radar was in its infancy, so while counter battery itself has been a thing for a century or more at that point, it was still based on principles perfected in WWI, with slight revisions as aircraft and then satellites got better at spotting things. It was a time consuming process that still required manual corrections at nearly every step. 

Satellite recon was an established art, but still one that required a fairly limited number of satellites the size of a bus, which traveled on an equally limited number of routes with bus-like schedules.

Tactical aerial recon still existed but was in a bit of a nadir marked by changing priorities and ever improving defenses. 

Guided munitions of the type appropriate for counter battery existed in limited numbers, but were just coming into their own.

Artillery at that time could shoot, shoot again, maybe even shoot a third mission, and then have to leave the area before a known satellite pass or traditional means of spotting made the area too hot. If it did get hit in a strike, there was a reasonable chance it would be shrapnel or a small cluster munition that might be survived with a bit of armor and luck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Compare that to our current situation, 40 years later:

Every military worthy of the name has counter battery radar, some capable of tracking even individual mortar rounds.

Satellites have improved to the point that equivalent cameras can fit on a unit the size of a desk, and they are EVERYWHERE, even offering access to commercial concerns. It's not like catching a bus anymore, it's calling an orbital Uber with exactly when and where you want to look at things.

Aerial spotting is at an all time high, with individual soldiers able to control a variety of drones with the range and cameras needed to spot an artillery position.

Guided munitions aren't yet universal, but they are so prevalent that they MUST be accounted for and not just written off as a risk to be tolerated.

Anything that fires now must be able to move within minutes, and do so fast enough to escape the search zones of a horde of drones capable of calling in strikes that will bulls-eye the target from 10's of kilometers.

You need to be able to move immediately, with speed, and with the knowledge that no practical amount of armor is going to help you.

It's not like these people were getting saved by Russia, they lived under a governance that made their lives fair and wealthier than they have now under Russian governance.

To answer your question, they matter of course, that's why Ukraina has to retake these areas claimed by Russia to save people living there from misery (and getting their wealth spent on corruption, or to make Moscow people's live better).

From what I've seen in multiple countries I visited, the wealthy abuse the poor disproportionally more in Russia than in western countries. Also Moscow and St Petersburg are getting disproportionally more resources than other cities and areas in Russia, it is something even Soviets did, that's why no former eastern block country wants to go back to Russia. Just comparing the quality of living of ordinary people in Russia vs for example Czech Republic or Finland allows to see that. Being under Russia rule is a poor future that limits your freedom and options for you and your children, causes misery. Russia rule has issues because it is impossible to change your government, and the power is in the hands of a few wealthy that are subject to all human problems.

with language like that in your arsenal im not sure you're equipped for a counterargument. TBH you actually have to make an argument first, which your original comment was not. ill repeat it for you below here. as you can see its complete unfounded conjecture and tin foin hat rubbish. you even put military analysts in quotes.. bles your little heart.

>With all the recent Russian success, I'm wondering how long it will take people to realize that most of the ""military analysts"" so often quoted in the media have a massive agenda and are not really interested in the truth. The military industrial complex combined with neo-conservative think tanks basically hijacked the public conversation around the war. All the talk of imminent Ukrainian victory was vital for the interests of these people. Unfortunately now the truth is taking hold.

so ill go back to my original advice.

ISW is run by Kimberly Kagan, the wife of Fred Kagan, who is a key neo conservative thinker with ties all over the neocon landscape (I'm assuming of course that you know what the neo-conservative agenda is). ISW counts our good friends at General Dynamics among their financial supporters.

A great example of the sort of ""pundit"" that gets significant air time to talk about the war is Ben Hodges. Ben is the former commander of the US Army in Europe (no doubt he has many relationships in the arms industry because of this, but who cares). Ben currently holds some fancy chair title at another think tank, the Center for European Policy Analysis. They count among their funders such leading lights as General Atomics, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. 

The relationship between defense contractors and think tanks overall is quite strong, lest you think these are isolated cases, as is established here.
