Anyone who chooses the path of evil destroys himself.  Sends columns of soldiers to destroy the lives of another country - and cannot stop them from fleeing and betraying when life resists.

He terrorizes with rockets, and when they are shot down, he humiliates himself to give ""Shahed"".  He despises people and throws hundreds of thousands into the war - in order to eventually barricade himself in the Moscow region from those whom he himself armed.

For a long time, Russia used propaganda to mask its weakness and the stupidity of its government.  And now there is so much chaos that no lie can hide it.  And all this is one person, who again and again scares the year 1917, although he is not able to lead to anything else.

Russia's weakness is obvious.  Full-scale weakness.  And the longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain and problems it will have for itself later.  This is also obvious.  Ukraine is able to protect Europe from the spread of RU evil and chaos

We keep our strength, unity and strength.
 All our commanders, all our soldiers know what to do.

Also, if supply lines are disrupted, there’s the possibility that entire sections of the front run dangerously (for them) low on basic supplies.

2) It would be hard to conceive that Putin will be satisfied assuming Prigozhin acted alone or that he didn’t have sympathizers in high places - and the paranoia of dictators can be a very deadly and destabilizing thing.

1. President Putin made a televised speech calling the challenge by the Wagner mercenary force ""high treason"" and a ""stab in the back"". He appealed for unity and said authorities were acting quickly to contain the situation

2. Rebelling Wagner mercenaries say they have taken control of the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, a key military site.

3. BBC sources also say Wagner forces have now seized military facilities in a second city - Voronezh, which is halfway between Rostov-on-Don and Moscow.
Prigozhin has said he will march on the capital if top military figures don't meet with him.

4. Prigozhin appears to have responded to Putin in an audio message, saying his troops were not committing treason, but rather were ""patriots"" fighting for the future of the Motherland - calling out ""corruption, lies and bureaucracy""

He creates a private military more competent than his national military and then attempts to blow it up several times after they help his failing military almost take a single town.

He gave Wagner the choice of being massacred by the Russian Army by staying in Ukraine or leaving to attempt a coup. Then to make the choice to resist even easier, he names their leader an enemy of the state.

These actions show the mind of a person that only works in ‘loyalty’. The thing about loyalty is it must extend both ways for it to work. 

We like to imagine that loyalty is a unifying force but in reality loyalty is very brittle if used as the only principle of organization.

Putin views the West as weak because we tend to rule with compassion, trust, shared goals, personal freedom, as opposed to his rigid top down loyalty.

But one single failure to reciprocate a loyalty pledge to a person with just enough power on the sidelines is all it takes to collapse his entire hold on Russian power. The reason is simple, people only just tolerate an unfair power structure and when the loyalty or money runout so will the people under it.

But if Putin had instead built a country that tried to listen, serve, and ultimately better it’s people then every single Russian would be in the street fighting to protect what they love right now.

There is a reason why Zelenskyy keeps reminding the world of our ‘togetherness’ and ‘friendship’. He sees exactly what underlies a durable and lasting peace, and it’s simply just trying to help each other. Because compassion and togetherness are the root of our greatest strengths.

A system that is based on ‘enforced Loyalty’ is weakness and it fools weak minded leaders because it’s rigidity gives the illusion of strength. The longer this power system endures, the more lies are needed to keep the facade of the structure intact. In the end the only thing left is the beautiful papier-mâché facade of lies, the rest of the structure is completely corroded.",1687609381.0,1687608922.0,t3_14hp2a1,t3_14hp2a1,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

From this, I think it is quite certain that Russian authorities are taking into account the possibility that Wagner will be in Voronezh City soon enough (and not just racing northward on the M4 in Voronezh Province, which stretches southward for over 300KM.

So when you read 'Wagner in in Voronezh', they are not just in the Oblast (province), but probably headed to the city at break-neck speed.

The Wagner group is claiming to have taken control of all military facilities in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, and reports suggest it has taken sites in Voronezh - further north.

Rostov has played a key role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Located close to the Ukraine border, Rostov - with a population of just one million - houses the main headquarters of Russia's Southern Military District.

Russian troops are often stationed in the city before being sent on to Ukraine.

The regional capital has also been an important logistics hub for armoury and fuel deliveries.

Voronezh - another regional capital not far from the Ukrainian border - is roughly the same size as Rostov.

Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram: “More than 100 firefighters and 30 pieces of equipment are working at the site.” He added that there were no currently no reported casualties. 

Mr Gusev had previously informed residents that the army was taking “necessary military measures in the region” as part of a counter-terrorist operation in the area.

Reuters cited a Russian security source as saying on Saturday that Wagner fighters had taken control of all military facilities in the city of Voronezh, located approximately 500km from Moscow.

**Edit: Unabridged version…**

I mean obviously everyone has been wanting to see Putin go down but if Prigozhin is to be the replacement wouldn’t that be towards the bottom of the lists of possible replacement outcomes? Idk much about him only him being the head of Wagner and their terrible reputation. ~~From what I have been seeing it sounded like he is still dedicated to fighting Ukraine after this~~ and I think I would trust him even less with nukes. Seems like as much as Putin is hated perhaps then ideal scenario would be if Putin ended up pulling out of Ukraine to fight Wagner and eventually ended up winning allowing Ukraine to get their land back, Wagner to fall and in the end Putin to have completely exhausted all political influence and get forced to step down by the rest of the government rather than a PMC head which I find much more concerning. At the very least even if Putin was still in power surely he would lose support for the war with Ukraine especially if they did manage to take back all of their territory in the time of his fight with Wagner and were seen to immediately stop and secure their borders rather than advance into Russia accompanied by statements expressing no desire to do so and call for a cease fire. 

Of course I don’t find the above scenario to be very likely at all I just feel really uneasy about the idea of the head of Wagner taking over or otherwise gaining greater influence.

**Edit 2:**

Now I see it being said that Prigozhin has been on recording refuting Russias claims for the start of the war with Ukraine and even calling them liars outright so if thats the case maybe he wouldn’t want to continue the war?",1687616091.0,1687601887.0,t3_14hp2a1,t3_14hp2a1,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-24-23/index.html

""The Russian Foreign Ministry has issued a call for unity in Russia in order to prevent the potential threat of “civil strife.”

“We have one commander in chief [Vladimir Putin]. Not two, not three. One. And he urged everyone to unite,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Telegram post, echoing sentiments expressed by other government officials.

“The enemy is just waiting for our civil strife,” she added.

Zakharova urged the men of Russia to unite despite their differing views. “Behind you are children, women, your parents! Behind you is the country. Behind you is everything that you defend with weapons in your hands. Behind you are the graves of those who did not spare themselves. You are future generations. Hold on and don't give in.""

Zakharova concluded her message by urging Russians to stand strong.

“Today we are all being tempted, our strength tested. Don't give in! Together with the President! May God keep us!” she added.

Her words of defiance come as Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed Saturday to have seized control of key military facilities in Rostov and Voronezh, pledging to move on to Moscow if Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and top general Valery Gerasimov did not meet with him.""",False,1687607719.0,t3_14hp2a1,t3_14hp2a1,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

“The only true solution to achieve our victory is to consolidate around the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,” Denis Pushilin, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, said in a statement on Telegram.

The heads of the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, expressed similar support for Putin.

Pushilin said this “difficult stage for Russia” was “particularly painful” for him, given Wagner’s role in capturing “Artemivsk,” the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.

“Wagner's guys sometimes did the impossible,” Pushilin said. But, he said, “confrontations of any kind, both before and now, will never be able to lead to the achievement of our goals.”

>The hall of mirrors that Vladimir Putin has built around himself and within his country is so complex, and so multilayered, that on the eve of a genuine insurrection in Russia, I doubt very much if the Russian president himself believed it could be real.  
>  
>  
>  
>Certainly the rest of us still can’t know, less than a day after this mutiny began, the true motives of the key players, and especially not of the central figure, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group. Prigozhin, whose fighters have taken part in brutal conflicts all over Africa and the Middle East—in Syria, Sudan, Libya, Central Africa Republic—claims to command 25,000 men in Ukraine. In a statement on Friday afternoon, he accused the Russian army of killing “an enormous amount” of his mercenaries in a bombing raid on his base. Then he called for an armed rebellion, vowing to topple Russian military leaders.  
>  
>  
>  
>Prigozhin has been lobbing insults at Russia’s military leadership for many weeks, mocking Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defense, as lazy, and describing the chief of the general staff as prone to “paranoid tantrums.” On Friday, he broke with the official narrative and directly blamed them, and their oligarch friends, for launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukraine did not provoke Russia on February 24, he said: Instead, Russian elites had been pillaging the territories of Donbas they’ve occupied since 2014, and became greedy for more. His message was clear: The Russian military launched a pointless war, ran it incompetently, and killed tens of thousands of Russian soldiers unnecessarily.  
>  
>  
>  
>The “evil brought by the military leadership of the country must be stopped,” Prigozhin declared. He warned the Russian generals not to resist: “Everyone who will try to resist, we will consider them a danger and destroy them immediately, including any checkpoints on our way. And any aviation we see above our heads.” Given the snarling theatricality of Prigozhin’s statement, the baroque language, the very notion that 25,000 mercenaries were going to remove the commanders of the Russian army during an active war—all of that immediately led many to ask: Is this for real?Up until the moment it started, when actual Wagner vehicles were spotted on the road from Ukraine to Rostov, a Russian city a couple of miles from the border (and actual Wagner soldiers were spotted buying coffee in a Rostov fast food restaurant, formerly known as McDonalds), it seemed impossible. But once they appeared in the city—once Prigozhin posted a video of himself in the courtyard of the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov—and once they seemed poised to take control of Voronezh, a city between Rostov and Moscow, theories began to multiply.  
>  
>  
>  
>Maybe Prigozhin is collaborating with the Ukrainians, and this is all an elaborate plot to end the war. Maybe the Russian army really had been trying to put an end to Prigozhin’s operations, depriving his soldiers of weapons and ammunition. Maybe this is Prigozhin’s way of fighting not just for his job but for his life. Maybe Prigozhin, a convicted thief who lives by the moral code of Russia’s professional criminal caste, just feels dissed by the Russian military leadership and wants respect. And maybe, just maybe, he has good reason to believe that some Russian soldiers are willing to join him.

* What is Prigozhin end goal? ""talking"" with Shoigu and the other guy appears a bit supeficial.
* Did Prigozhin realize the the ruZZian army was such a clusterfuck that it simply couldn't respond/mobilze quickly enought to blunt this move within Russia?
* Prigozhin has avoided laying blame at putins feet but instead the russain MOD. Also is widely quoted as saying this is NOT a coup.
* However, Putin appears to have labeled this as a *mutiny and treason* makes it difficult for kaPutin or Prigozhin to back down or claim objectives achieved.
* Does this deteriorate into open battles in Russian cities. Or do local security forces just step aside and let Wagner/Prigozhin motor all the way to Moscow?

Red Square...4 days from now.

Aerial shot of a column of tanks arriving at Red Square.

Cut to crowd cheering the arrival of the column. Interspersed among the crowd noise, we hear news reports that Putin is in hiding, Shoigu captured, and most of the Moscow defense forces in Moscow have indicated that they are neutral in this event and will follow whoever is in charge of Moscow. 

The column stops...a few flowers are thrown onto the tanks.

Reports that a steady stream of Russian soldiers are stealing (mostly Russian) vehicles to make their way back East are coming in to the crowd...who are in a joyous mood.

The lead tank opens the top hatch...Anxious to hear the words of their liberator, the crowd leans in expectantly. A hush descends as they see first one hand, then two...And up pops...

Zelensky!

Honestly in my opinion... no*.

The caveat is complicated.  Did Russia send a bulk of its best troops to Ukraine already? In my opinion yes.  Did they really send the best of their equipment already, i believe this is yes as well.

On the other side, does prigozhin really have the support of the regular army and people.  I think more than people realize and less than he hoped for.

Ultimately Russia's war in Ukraine is effectively over and they will need to pull troops back to have a chance at stopping a civil war (this might already be too late).  No matter what that's doom for Putin.

So can the MOD mount a defense.  Not really in the way that people are thinking.  Sure there will be battles and blood, but the real war is now the one to stop the take over of prigozhin with enough support left over to hold on to power.",False,1687610466.0,t3_14hp2a1,t3_14hp2a1,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia absolutely fucked china on Taiwan. NATO became bigger, more unified and started beefing their militaries up. 

The U.S. was suddenly able to look at Russia and realize they weren't the biggest threat. Europe could most likely hold its own or fare a little better against Russia. This is terrible for china. 

One of china's biggest advantages when it'd come to Taiwan is that the U.S. would never be able to fully commit because Russia was always a threat in Europe. Suddenly that threat is greatly diminished. This would allow them to focus heavier on defending Taiwan, commit more resources to defending Taiwan.

They showed up, they were a bunch fat Maryland hicks, and they started to head up to the event but a group of scrawny 17 year olds and a few loud and bold middle aged moms formed a line.

They didn't start shit.  Because they're cowards.  They start shit when they outnumber people at a protest, or they can pick off individual people as they leave it, or when they think they have the backing of the state as they did during Jan 6th.

But for all their photo ops and tactical gear and bravado, they are desperately afraid of being outnumbered, and it doesn't matter if every single person who outnumbers them is physically unimposing.  It does not matter.  They back off.

Likewise Ukraine may be able to demand concession in exchange for peace in order to avoid more conflict, this would invariably be the return of most occupied land and if Pringles sees that as unacceptable then the fighting will continue.

But Ukraine could also try to take advantage of the chaos by doubling down on their counter offensive which would put the Kremlin in a very difficult place if they thought they had to pull troops back in to Russia to stop Wagner. 

Thirdly, if the fighting continued, would Prigozhin prove to be more effective at it than Putin was? I don't know how much experience he has actually leading an army and making strategies but I assume he has more than Putin does which may not be good for Ukraine. But then again even if the coup is successful he will have a lot to clean up and will then have to deal with all the other stuff that goes in to leading a country so he would still be occupied by other things, at least for a little while.

They are both despicable pieces of shit that seem to enjoy killing people. I am not sure if we can really tell which one is worse. What is known for sure is that successful military coups are ALWAYS bloody.

Admittedly it would probably be the end of the war of Ukraine however - weakened Russia involved in an internal conflict = they have to get their troops out and start clearing up within the nation. This could be a problem down the line but I think it's safe to say that Ukraine will still be receiving massive defensive aid making most attacks against it impractical.

> Obviously Western leaders are monitoring the situation. Do they just let Wagner take control (If that's possible)?

I can't imagine NATO interfering in Russia's domestic affairs. It's a nuclear power. Push some buttons, cushion the fall - yes, like USA did to USSR. Actively interfere through military power? No, that's not happening. 

China might however - but even then **only** if it's deemed safe aka no nukes flying in their direction.

You have to remember that Prigozhin isn't doing this from a position of strength. MoD was going to incorporate Wagner fully into military structures, losing Prigozhin all of his power and influence. He didn't just decide to make a play for power. This is a desperate action. 

It also sounds like their movement toward Moscow has been more of a mad dash than a safe advance. On one hand that makes sense given their goals. But their supply lines seem sketchy at best and they're leaving a whole lot of unsubjugated territory at their backs, which includes military bases. Again, it makes sense for more of a coup action than a civil war. But it really gives them only one shot at this, and I dont get the feeling that this is going to be a long drawn out civil war. 25,000 men isn't enough to control a country. 

If Prigozhin wants to be successful, he has to get massive defections, both mitarily and politically. We haven't seen that yet - I think at a certain point last night Wagner was bragging about 20 men defecting or something. If that's even accurate, it's obviously not the numbers they need to be seeing.

As things stand, I think the most likely outcome is a few days of fighting in the outskirts of Moscow. If Wagner gets bogged down even briefly during their advance, I don't think they'll see the defections they need as possible defectors lose faith in their ability to succeed.

 Russian troops are poorly trained and equipped. 

Wagner mercenaries are highly skilled and have much more and much better equipment. 

Wagner mercenaries have been fighting alongside Russia for a long time and I'd expect some Russian troops to join them. 

A lot of Russian troops are also already fighting a war in Ukraine. 

The goal is not to take over the whole country via territorial control, it's to reach Moscow and overthrow the government (or at least Putin). Think of it more as a military coup even though Wagner is not technically the Russian military.

Well, it's not immediately bad, at least. The West and Ukraine are watching the situation closely. However, there have been videos and reports of fighting between Wagner Group and Russian Forces, which directly benefits Ukraine because it means they have fewer troops to fight.

> What is the Wagner guys thoughts on Ukraine situation? Does he want to go harder in that Putin

Prigozhin (head of Wagner Group) is a lot more open about Russia's lack of success in Ukraine, often contradicting official Russian government narrative, and has openly criticized Russian generals for a while now. (However, he also thinks that the democratic Euromaidan protests in Ukraine in 2014 were a US-backed coup.) It's thought that if he were to overthrow the Kremlin (which I think is a big stretch) he would attempt to negotiate a ceasefire with Ukraine, but that's all speculation.

> What would he have to do to take over? Blow up the Kremlin?

I think the most realistic chance he has to take power is to get the regular Russian forces on his side.

If the war continues, it’ll be against a very shaky regime that could easily be countercouped if the war goes badly or Wagner doesn’t put a lot of resources into hunting down any potential Putin loyalists. That diversion of resources would favor Ukraine.

Of course, the long term is a huge unknown, since nobody can say how effective a Wagner-run Russia would be.

There are forces that may not interfere with taking Putin down, but might interfere with putting a particular person in.

The wisest choice for Wagner long term is to seize Moscow and take down Putin as a hero of the people, release Nelvany, and run against him and anyone else in a truly democratic election.

He could rightfully gain legitimacy by doing that both domestically and with foreign powers if he wins, and he'll be considered a hero of Russia in pretty much every other outcome of the race if he doesn't.

Trying to stick with tyranny isn't going to go well though - people in Russia have really soured to being treated like pawns in a chess game they have no interest in playing.

Prigozhin for months has been portraying Russian military as incapable. He said he tried to withdraw his troops but couldn't because they would be treated as traitors and shot. He was showing huge losses in his ranks and mass graves. In other words - they changed side NOT because of money but because **only** going in this direction gives them a chance of survival. Russian military was already trying to capture some of Wagner troops and apparently launched an artillery strike against them now. So they are probably quite desperate. How much of it is true remains to be seen but IF it is then I can see why they would rather try and seize Moscow versus being told to suicide on the trip to Kiev. 

Now an open question is if they will get any support NOW from NATO/Ukraine.

First of all, there isn’t some magical international law that prevents NATO from retaliating if Wagner did launch a nuke. It being Wagner doesn’t suddenly change their abilities. It will still be seen as Russia launching a nuke. They will still retaliate. 


Second of all, the intelligence community would know if this was fake. They’ve said it’s legit. It’s legit. 

Third of all, this is the natural result of a dictator making himself look weak by starting and losing a war. This was going to happen somehow.

And lastly, having possession of nukes doesn’t mean Wagner can fire them. Firing a nuke isn’t simple. It’s a multi step process.

On the other side, does prigozhin really have the support of the regular army and people.  I think more than people realize and less than he hoped for.

Ultimately Russia's war in Ukraine is effectively over and they will need to pull troops back to have a chance at stopping a civil war (this might already be too late).  No matter what that's doom for Putin.

Actually that does not at all matter in the case of Nuclear weapons. If the US president wants to launch a nuke, he can. Nobody can stop him.

Huh? Now you're no longer making any sense at all. It's a perfectly relevant comparison as you brought in blackwater.

Did you not read? 

Let me record this entire exchange for your sake. 

Me : Russia having nukes is better than PMC Wagner having nukes. 

You : No, Russia made PMC Wagner. Putin and Prighozin is the same. 

Me : Russia is a state that exists to serve its interests, PMC Wagner is a profit driven corporation. One is obviously more responsible than the other. 

You : [No, Russia created Wagner. Therefore they are equally iressponsible.](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14hp2a1/comment/jpc31oj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Actually here is the exact quote.

""My guy, there's that part about Russia somehow being more ""responsible"" than Wagner again. **They aren't.** That's the point. **They literally made Wagner, which proves how responsible they are**. Same with nukes. There's **nothing intrinsically more responsible about Putin** with those than there is with Prigozhin. They're basically the same person, a fucking mafia boss.""

Me : Thats a false equivalence. Just because Russia made PMC Wagner, doesnt mean they not more responsible than PMC Wagner with nukes. Same with Blackwater and the US. One is more responsible than the other, despite being cut from the same cloth. 

You : But but US checks and balances... US not bad. 

Me : Ok, if such checks and balances is relevant, why did the US employ and empower Blackwater? Because as you said previously about Wagner and Russia : **""They literally made Wagner, which proves how responsible they are.""** You are being a hypocrite. 

You : Huh? Im confused? But but Donald Trump. Whats hypocrisy?",False,1687607466.0,t3_14hp2a1,t1_jpc6lqf,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
