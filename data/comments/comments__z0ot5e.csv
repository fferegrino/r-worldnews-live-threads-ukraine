Day 271 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, there were some missile launches from Belgorod, but we didn‚Äôt even have a single air raid alert the entire day. The last one was active at 10pm yesterday, which is just weird. If we didn‚Äôt read our telegram channels, then we wouldn‚Äôt even know about an imminent missile strike.

They started launching missiles at 8:45pm and fired about 4 of them; they were S-300 missiles as usual, so they unloaded one entire launcher. This time they fired at Chuhuiv, we don‚Äôt know what was hit, but it was probably yet another residential building like yesterday, when they killed 1 civilian and injured 2 more after they hit a 2-story house in Shevchenkove.

Kherson is also starting to get shelled now. Today they hit an apartment building there, the shell landed inside someone‚Äôs flat, but we don‚Äôt know if there were any casualties yet. Fighting against civilians is all they know how to do, fucking bastards. Why they still don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs useless is beyond me, how can they be so stupid?

Over the last seven days, intense artillery exchanges have continued around the Svatove sector in Luhansk Oblast in north-eastern Ukraine.

As on other parts of the front, Russian forces continue to prioritise constructing defensive positions, almost certainly partially manned by poorly trained mobilised reservists.

With Russia‚Äôs south-western front line now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force.

As a significant population centre within Luhansk Oblast, Russian leaders will highly likely see retaining control of Svatove as a political priority.

 However, commanders are likely struggling with the military realities of maintaining a credible defence, while also attempting to resource offensive operations further south in Donetsk.

 Both Russian defensive and offensive capability continues to be hampered by severe shortages of munitions and skilled personnel.

When Saddam attacked Iran he did it knowing that Iran (right after the khomeini revolution) was already under heavy sanctions from western countries so he thought it would've been a fast war. Saddam had the support of Soviet Union but that support wasn't enough.

Now Iraq surprise attack failed also because Saddam was taking the lead despite his lack of military experience so he was too bold and made a tons of strategic mistakes. Iran had the chances to resist and counter attack. Nobody could correct Saddam bad tactics because he was killing anyone who had something to say. So the conflict turned into a long and bloody war of attrition ended with both sides claiming victory.

So there are some similarities with the current war but the big difference is that Ukraine is getting a huge military support from western countries while Russia is basically on its own.

Iran/Iraq war lasted almost 8 years only because Iran couldn't receive the kind of support Ukraine is getting now.

This war is not going to last that long and Putin (for multiple reasons) is probably not going to stay in power after the end of the war as Saddam did after 1988.

Putin managed to make even more mistakes than a delusional and crazy dictator as Saddam was who had on paper way higher chances to win that war considering Iran had lost US military support.

This constant misrepresentation here irks the hell out of me. It's been going on for months now.

Explicit statements by *the Republican Leader in the House* cannot be dismissed as *outliers*. He's not Bobert, he's the freaking *leader in the house*. 

Is he calling McCarthy's well-documented statements flat out lies? (in which case you can't believe him when he says something else; if he says one thing then another as it suits him, how can you discern what he'll actually do?)

If he was lying but isn't now (again, how can you be sure which is the lie?), McCarthy was playing games with Ukrainian lives for narrow political convenience. Not the sort of 'ally' you want when his next flip-flop on a whim will kill people.


Don't minimize his behavior, and that of other *very much mainstream republicans*, call it out. It's not a game.",1669079789.0,1669079042.0,t3_z0ot5e,t3_z0ot5e,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

It's getting especially bad as they're on their ""Look, we also have good guys who argue against nuking the world"" routine again and the clips are everywhere.

The goal of the Russian state TV is to test attitudes, create narratives and sow an opposition which they themselves manufacture, on their own terms and ideas.There is no real friction here, it's only acting.

They know that these clips get attention worldwide with millions of views - what you're seeing is what they want you to believe and what you're saying is what they know that you'll be saying.

Manufacturing an opposition gives them an opportunity to condition their home audience to make them seem more rational and balanced while the foreign audience is receiving calming news that there are no more nuke threats which makes the next week's nuclear threat more emotionally impactful as millions of people already saw clips that ""It's changing and now they want peace!""

You don't see any real, common sense but effective messaging like ""We need to remove Putin, gather in Moscow now and protest until we're free from oligarchy"" messaging which is the most obvious one that anyone against the war would suggest but obviously that would be terrible and truly harmful for them.

All these state media clip include offenses which put you in jail right now. Nobody non-sponsored can free-willingly say these things - it feels weird that it even has to be said, as it's so obvious. Even if someone would say something ""illegal"", then they obviously can edit and remove it from their program if it wasn't what they wanted you to see.

Spreading these clips just helps them spread their messaging to further their political goals in this war, even if they are losing.",1669044712.0,1669044205.0,t3_z0ot5e,t3_z0ot5e,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

For me the Marshall Plan had many objectives (Wiki?):
1/ to act against Stalin communism popularity still huge in Western countries                         

2/ to rebuild economies and open markets for the US industries                         

3/ to promote the US way of dealing with life                         

The plan was initially opened to Eastern countries but it was refused by CCCP       

For me Ukraine deserves help and will get it, furthermore will soon be part of the EU (with some conditions due to the inevitable modification to come of the rules because it is getting too big, especially the VETO rule) and NATO (if Erdogan and Orban don't fuck things up again).       
       
why? They have showed their will to be a functioning democratic country ... they will get rid of their internal corruption faster than Hungary (because I think it has helped them fight against Putin).                    
                      
Russia ?                

They have as a nation to make amend and help rebuild Ukraine.                  
The future Russia has to understand that we could have done things differently if Putin and his Mafia hadn't corrupted it all ... with the passivity of short sighted European Economic interests.                  

Just like West-Germany and Japan at the end of WWII they should get help at the condition of Putin's criminal system collapse and the creation of self-controlled Duma preventing the return of a third Stalin.           

You don't want a WWI Versailles treaty so we must help them, but it is clear that the Russian people have to understand that they are the counter power to the Oligarchic system and any Mafioso at every levels.                               

PS :I think that a democracy can find a way through Oligarchy by the power of its population. A balance must be found.                
      
PS2: If you check the US Oligarchs-like such as the 1%, they are really pushing hard to control the system but they need at least a market and a set of rules to make it work. So there is hope, right ?

Well, everyone knows the freaking system is corrupt and fascist, safe for a few people who are too dumb to realise.  
Now, both my parents and grandparents hated the Dicator (and the other one who replaced him for a short time in the end) But do you think they did anything ? people who spoke, even in home, against the System would be sent away by state police. heck, you neighbor could just make up a whole story of how he overheard you badmouthing Mr. Salazar and you'd be done for! No proof needed.  


My dad was one of the few brave ones that posted propagand against the regime and he got whipped, beaten and sent to prison for 3 months ...

b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,z0ot5e,ixakcsr,"It's definitely an interesting question as to how blast resilient solar panels are compared with standard windows. There's a few factors that are likely in favor of the panels though, but the biggest one is going to be geometry.

Windows are generally perpendicular to the ground. A blast at or near ground level is going to push out a spherical shockwave which in most cases will hit windows at or near a perpendicular orientation. The direction the glass will be weakest. Panels laying mostly on their backs, usually with some amount of tilt to them, will be largely concealed from the direct effects of a ground blast due to the building being in the way, and for blasts at a somewhat higher elevation (but not entirely directly over the panel) the blast is mostly hitting in line with the long (strong) axis of the panel.

Similarly, windows in a wall mount are secured fairly tightly on all sides, which means even if the shockwave itself doesn't stress the glass enough to break it, warping of the frame from structural damage might do the job. Panels on the roof, while fixed in place in their mounts, are less tightly constrained. If the roof warps, that may put odd stresses on the mounting brackets, but may not reach the actual panels in sufficient strength to break them.

Another point to consider, window glass is around 3/32 of an inch thick, but can be as thick as 1/8 inch. Ignoring the frame of a panel, all the stuff that makes up the panel itself is around 4-5 mm, or just under 1/5th of an inch. So solar panels are effectively a bit thicker than most common window glass.

One point to keep in mind about solar panel construction, is that the panels are designed to deal with direct (perpendicular) strikes from hail, something most windows don't have to deal with given their positioning.

A LOT of maybes and such there, but my bet would be that on average, solar panels will take less damage in a bombing environment from near misses than windows would.
