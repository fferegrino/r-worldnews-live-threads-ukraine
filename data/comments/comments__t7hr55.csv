On the way to Ukraine more police goods arrived from the German police. Ten vehicles where needed to deliver the supplies. 

From the article: The necessary phone calls had to be made to pass border controls and avoid bureaucracy. ‚ÄúBut we have such a great network in Europe that every problem was solved immediately. Then there was a text message or a phone call from a high-ranking Polish colleague, and then things could move on again. Without having to pay import duties anywhere,"" says Struijs.

Day 10 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today sound of explosions and aircrafts was constant, not too close to us mostly, until like an hour ago when it started getting pretty loud, so it probably was not too far away from us. Our governor says that for now every Russian attack is being repelled and even some counteroffensive is taking place. 

He even said that around Kharkiv alone they destroyed over 500 enemy vehicles, which is kind of hard to believe, but after the first time Russians managed to break inside the city there hasn‚Äôt been any more breaches, so I‚Äôm inclined to believe that there‚Äôs at least some truth to that number.

From people who were at train station in the past couple of days I heard that apparently Russians even shelled the train station itself, where there‚Äôs only civilians trying to get on the evacuation trains, so we will stay home for now, it‚Äôs most likely safer.

Also in the past 8-10 years we frequently watched Russian news and talk shows, there was always something that I just didn‚Äôt understand, that is - while our news pretty much never talked about Russia, on their channels almost every damn day they were talking about Ukraine as if there was nothing of note happening in Russia.

Only now after the war has started I finally understand why they were talking about Ukraine and our problems constantly, they were straight up brainwashing their people all this time so when they finally invaded Russians would be on their side, I mean at this point they are more invested in our country and our politics than most Ukrainians. Now they have this messiah complex and they really want to save us from Nazis, which we never asked for.

> A tank weighs 50 tonnes, and has a 1,000-1,500 hp engine. So they drink fuel, managing about 0.5mpg (500L/100km). A straight drive to Kyiv from the nearest supply base is about 200 miles, so at a minimum 10 tonnes of diesel.
For reference, a Russian military truck can carry about 5 tonnes.
Russia also relies on missile launchers. Missiles are big and heavy. A grad rocket is 3m long and weights 70kg. A grad missile launcher fires 40 of these in a single salvo. That's about 3 tonnes per salvo.
Russian battalions use a lot more tanks and missile launchers than typical NATO battalions, which rely on aircraft to deliver heavy firepower instead. Aircraft have the advantage of flying back to an airbase to rearm and refuel, so you don't need to send a truck out.
So you'd think the Russian army would use more trucks per battalion than NATO armies. Wrong. A typical American or British battalion has 400 trucks assigned to it, while the Russians each have 200.
With some simple maths, you can work out how far a battalion can go supplied by trucks. That 200 mile drive to Kyiv, for example, will take a truck 4 hours driving at 50 mph. Then 1 hour to unload, another 4 hour drive back to the supply base, and then another hour to load up again. That's 10 hours. With other delays, call it two trips per day assuming they have replacement drivers.
If it were only 50 miles away, it would only take 4 hours (1 hour drive, 1 hour unload, one our drive back, one hour reload) meaning 5 or 6 trips a day. By calculating a battalion's typical daily supply requirements, and the number of trucks available, you can calculate how far the battalion can travel while still being fully supplied. The answer for Russian battalions: 50 miles. This could be much lower if the battalion is engaged in heavy fighting.
As u/35Shitbag said, Russia relies heavily on rail to supply its forces instead. It's one of the only developed countries with a military that still does so. That's great until you run out of railroad. I'll add to what he said that not only is aerial supply ridiculously dangerous, it's incredibly inefficient, with their best transport helicopters maxing out at 4 tonnes. Russia only has a few hundred of these, enough to maybe supply 1 battalion if they went all out with it. Russia has about 100 battalions in Ukraine. Helicopters are a lot more expensive than trucks y'see, and need skilled pilots to fly them.
So it's back to trucks, which as well as being too few, many are old and prone to mechanical failures. Putting hundreds of vehicles on one narrow highway, as with the convoy of doom headed to Kyiv, doesn't leave a lot of margin of error if they start to break down.
Satellite photos show the convoy in 3 lanes: one for the combat vehicles themselves, one for trucks going in one direction, and one for trucks going in the other. Any breakdown means the whole thing comes to a stop.
Have I mentioned that they're driving through a warzone? No? Did you know, these Russian trucks don't even have bulletproof glass protecting the driver? Ukrainian snipers will tell you all about it. Also, there are these things called bridges, which allow vehicles to cross rivers and gorges with comparative ease, and which the Ukrainians have rather unsportingly decided to blow up.
All of this means the Ukrainians are left with the difficult decision whether to attack the convoy and get some awesome videos to post on reddit, or save their ammo and just leave it sitting there while they wait for the Russians to file into Kyiv waving white flags and asking for food. It's certainly a difficult choice.
The Russians have basically Stalingrad'ed themselves, without the Ukrainians even having to bother encircling them. I'm not sure the convoy even has the resources to retreat back to Russia at this point.

**US works with Poland to provide Ukraine with fighter jets
Demetri Sevastopulo and Stefania Palma in Washington** *14 minutes ago, 06/03/2022*


`The US is working with Warsaw on a deal to provide Ukraine with Polish fighter jets as Kyiv ratchets up the pressure on the west to help boost its air force capabilities so it can repel Russian air strikes.

The deal would involve Ukraine receiving Russian-made warplanes from Poland, which would then be given American F-16s by the US to refill its stocks. It comes amid fears Russia will increase aerial attacks given the slow progress of parts of its ground campaign.

The White House said it was negotiating with Poland and consulting other Nato allies but that there were ‚Äúa number of challenging practical questions, including how the planes could actually be transferred from Poland to Ukraine‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe are also working on the capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine,‚Äù a White House spokesperson said.

The Polish defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

The deal emerged following a day of intense pressure from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and his foreign minister, who both said that if Nato will not institute a no-fly zone over the country then it should provide its air force with fighter jets.

The Financial Times reported earlier on Saturday that Zelensky had made an emotional plea for the US to give Poland and other eastern European allies F-16 fighter jets that would then enable those countries to send their Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine.

In a call with almost 300 US lawmakers on Saturday morning, Zelensky said Ukraine badly needed more aircraft, particularly after Nato decided against creating a no-fly zone because it would risk a broader conflict with Russia, according to people familiar with the call.

Ukrainian pilots need Russian-made aircraft because those are the systems they have been trained to fly.

Washington is working to provide more support to Ukraine and this week started sending anti-aircraft stinger missiles ‚Äî the same weapon that the US provided the Mujahedeen to repel the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.

One US lawmaker who took part in the call said Zelensky had expressed appreciation for the stingers, but said they were insufficient because they were not able to fly high enough to take out some Russian aircraft.

While the US and allies have supplied a range of weapons to Ukraine, they are worried that Putin would view the provision of warplanes as an escalation that he might interpret as Nato effectively entering the conflict against Russia. Earlier on Saturday, Putin said Moscow would consider the institution of a no-fly zone by any third party as ‚Äúparticipation in the armed conflict‚Äù.

Ukraine said some eastern European nations had agreed to provide fighter jets, but the claims were denied. Polish president Andrzej Duda has previously said sending planes would be tantamount to interfering in the conflict.

One person familiar with the situation said the Biden administration had previously indicated to Poland that it could not provide American fighter jets. The White House denied that the US had opposed the idea to send Russian-made fighters to Ukraine, saying it was ‚Äúa sovereign decision for any country to make‚Äù.

Brendan Boyle, a Philadelphia Democratic congressman who participated in the zoom call, told the Financial Times that there was broad bipartisan support in Congress to find creative solutions. He pointed to the example of the US passing the Lend-Lease Act during the second world war to make it easier to provide countries with war supplies and weapons.

‚ÄúWe have to start looking at analogies to the Lend-Lease Act in terms of a 2022 version of it for Ukraine,‚Äù Boyle said. ‚ÄúThere is widespread bipartisan support in Congress and also popular American support for doing everything we can to arm the Ukrainians. Politically speaking, this is a relatively easy lift.‚Äù

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba made a similar plea during a meeting on Saturday with his US counterpart Antony Blinken along the Poland-Ukraine border, saying it was ‚Äúno secret that the highest demand that we have is in fighting jets, attack aircraft, and air defence systems‚Äù. 

Kuleba added: ‚ÄúIf we lose the skies, there will be much, much more blood on the ground, and that will be the blood of civilians.‚Äù

Asked if the US would consider the request, Blinken said ‚Äúwe are talking about and working on everything‚Äù, adding that US defence secretary Lloyd Austin was working closely with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov.

A senior US defence official on Friday said the Pentagon had provided Ukraine with $240mn in military assistance from the $350mn President Joe Biden recently approved. She said the remaining $110mn would likely arrive in Ukraine over the next week and that the administration was working with Congress to secure more funds.

There's a reason Russia put a lot of effort in seeing trump and Republicans elected, and preventing democrats from getting in.

There's a reason trump was floating total withdrawal from NATO.

If you want to play the game of speculation, it would go down something like this:

Trump gets reelected and immediately withdraws from NATO, using his previously planted seeds of motive that we spend the most on NATO defense (this is mostly bullshit half-truth).

Trump would proceed to say something dumb like:

>*""Iook I myself--It is time for a America to stand back and standby for America. We want America. First. Look, I have friends in Europe but ya gotta--they have to learn to defend themselves!""*

Putin seizes the moment and jumps into Ukraine. A fragmented NATO without months of coordination with foreign leaders by the Secretary of State and Biden, do not organize quickly enough. Ukraine capitulates or gets wiped off the map. One or the other. On the back channel, Putin promises increased funding to republican candidates through NRA laundering and increased disinformation campaigns via IRA troll farms promoting Republicans and smearing Democrats. Perhaps more republican congressmen fly to Moscow on 4th of July as they previously did to speak on sensitive matters in person behind closed doors. 

As this happens, Trump goes:

>*""Very terrible. Very terrible what happened to Ukrainians. But you know Putin has good points. So many good points. Good points on both sides. And you know--who can blame him!?

‚ÄúIf a no-fly zone was declared, someone would have to enforce it, and that would mean someone would have to then go and fight against Russian air forces,‚Äù Milley explained. ‚ÄúThat is not something that NATO Secretary [Jens] Stoltenberg, or member states‚Äô political leadership, has indicated they want to do.‚Äù

Milley made his remarks in an interview Saturday with Latvian journalists at a military base here, as part of a visit to Europe to assess the Ukraine conflict. His rejection of the no-fly zone echoes comments by other Biden administration officials, who have argued for weeks that although the United States wants to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it won‚Äôt make any moves that might place U.S. military forces, including Air Force planes, in direct conflict with Russia.

Despite Putin‚Äôs threatening language about nuclear weapons, Milley said, ‚Äúwe are not now seeing anything out there in the alert postures of the actual nuclear forces of Russia that would indicate any increased set of alerts.‚Äù He said the United States was monitoring the situation closely.

---

One of the insiders from the special services of the Russian Federation, I will publish it without edits and censorship, because it's hell: """"I'll be honest right away: I've hardly slept all these days, almost all the time at work, my head is slightly swimming, as in a fog. And from overwork, sometimes I already catch states, as if all this is not real.


To be honest, Pandora's box is open - a real world-scale horror will begin by the summer - global famine is inevitable (Russia and Ukraine were the main suppliers of grain in the world, this year there will be less harvest, and logistical problems will bring the catastrophe to a peak point).
I can't tell you what guided the decision on the operation at the top, but now all the dogs are being methodically released on us (the Service). We are being scolded for analytics - this is very much in my profile, so I will explain what is wrong.
Recently, we have been increasingly squeezed to adjust reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic. All these political consultants, politicians and their entourage, influence teams - all this created chaos. Strong.


The most important thing is that no one knew that there would be such a war, it was hidden from everyone. And here's an example for you: You are asked (conditionally) calculate the possibility of legal protection in different conditions, including the attack of prisons by meteorites. You specify about meteorites, they tell you - this is so, a reinsurance for calculations, nothing like that will happen. You understand that the report will be just for show, but you need to write in a victorious style so that there are no questions, they say, why do you have so many problems, did you work poorly. In general, a report is being written that when a meteorite falls, we have everything to eliminate the consequences, we are well done, everything is fine. And you concentrate on tasks that are real - we don't have enough forces anyway. And then suddenly they really throw meteorites and expect that everything will be according to your analytics, which they wrote from a fool.


That's why we have a total pis_ets - I don't even want to choose another word. There is no protection from sanctions for the same reason: well, Nabiullina is quite possible that negligence will be sewn on (rather, to the switchmen from her team), but what are they to blame for? No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one was preparing for such sanctions. This is the reverse side of secrecy: if no one was told, then who could calculate what no one told?


Kadyrov is going off the rails. Also, the conflict almost started with us: perhaps even the Ukrainians threw in a lie that we were the ones who handed over the routes of Kadyrov's special forces in the first days of the operation. They were covered there on the march in the most terrible way, they have not yet begun to fight, but they were simply torn in some places. And it went-it went: it was the FSB that leaked the routes to the Ukrainians. I do not have such information, I will leave 1-2% for reliability (it is also impossible to exclude it altogether).


The blitz-krieg failed. It is simply impossible to complete the task now: if Zelensky and the authorities had been captured in the first 1-3 days, all the key buildings in Kiev had been seized, they would have been given an order to surrender - yes, the resistance would have subsided to minimum values. Theoretically. But what's next? Even with this ideal option, there was an unsolvable problem: with whom to negotiate? If we demolish Zelensky - well, with whom to sign agreements? If with Zelensky, then after his demolition by us, these papers are worth nothing. OPZH refused to cooperate: Medvedchuk is a coward, he ran away. There is a second leader there - Boyko, but he refuses to work with us - even his own people will not understand him. They wanted to return Tsarev, so even our pro-Russian ones turned against him. Should I return Yanukovych? And how? If we say that it is impossible to occupy, then any of our authorities there will be killed in 10 minutes after we leave. Occupy? And where will we get so many people? Commandant's offices, military police, counterintelligence, security - even with minimal local resistance, we need 500 thousand or more people. Not counting the supply chain. And there is a rule that by covering the bad quality of management with quantity, you only spoil everything. And this, I repeat, would be the ideal option, which is not.
And now what? We cannot declare mobilization for two reasons:


1) Large-scale mobilization will undermine the situation inside the country: political, economic, social.
2) Our logistics is overstretched already today. We will drive a much larger contingent, and what will we get? Ukraine is a hefty country in terms of territory. And now the level of hatred towards us is off the scale. Our roads simply will not pull such supply caravans in terms of capacity - everything will stall. And we will not pull it out administratively - because it is chaos.


And these two reasons fall out at the same time, although even one is enough to break everything.
On losses: I do not know how many of them. No one knows. The first two days there was still control, now no one knows what's going on there. You can lose large units from communication. They may be found, or they may resolve due to falling under attack. And even the commanders there may not know how many of them are running around somewhere nearby, how many have died, how many are in captivity. The death toll is definitely in the thousands. Maybe 10 thousand, maybe 5, maybe only 2.  Even at headquarters they don't know for sure. But it should be closer to 10. And we don't count the LDNR corps now - they have their own accounting.


Now, even if you kill Zelensky, take him prisoner, nothing will change already. There is Chechnya by the level of hatred towards us. And now even those who were loyal to us are against it. Because they planned it at the top, because they told us that there would be no such option, unless we were attacked. Because they explained that it was necessary to create the most credible threat in order to peacefully negotiate on the right conditions. Because we initially prepared protests inside Ukraine against Zelensky. Without taking into account our direct entry. Invasion, to put it simply.


Further civilian losses will go exponentially - and the resistance to us will also only increase. They have already tried to enter the cities with infantry - out of twenty landing groups, only one had a conditional success. The storming of Mosul, remember - this is the rule, so all countries had, nothing new.
Keep them under siege? According to the experience of military conflicts in the same Europe in recent decades (Serbia is the largest range of experience here), cities can be under siege for years, and even function. Humanitarian convoys from Europe to there are a matter of time.

MOSCOW, March 5 - RIA Novosti. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decree ""On the temporary procedure for the fulfillment of obligations to certain foreign creditors"", which allows to repay debts in rubles.

The document defines the temporary procedure for the payment of debts of the subjects of the Federation, municipalities and residents who have obligations to foreign creditors who are residents of those countries that imposed sanctions against Russia,

This procedure applies to obligations in the amount of 10 million rubles per month or in an amount exceeding the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency at the official rate of the Bank of Russia, set on the 1st day of each month.

As follows from the decree, the debtor, in order to fulfill its obligations, has the right to send an application to the Russian bank to open an account of type ""C"" in the name of a foreign creditor or a nominal holder intended for settlements on these obligations. For obligations related to the issue of securities, the debtor has the right to send such an application to the central depository.

Type ""C"" accounts will include depot accounts opened before the entry into force of this decree in the name of a non-resident who is a foreign creditor or in the name of a foreign nominee holder.

The regime of the ""C"" type account is established by the decision of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia, the account itself is maintained in rubles.",False,1646518461.0,t3_t7hr55,t3_t7hr55,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Or saying that if you have X opinion you're uneducated.  The list goes on.

&#x200B;

If I had to guess why people say these things, for many folks it's **empathy.** Sitting on the sidelines and watching millions of people suffer isn't an easy thing for a lot of people, and the fact that they are personally completely safe isn't very much comfort to them.

&#x200B;

Caring about your fellow human beings and even feeling willingness to put yourself in real danger to help them is a very human thing, **even if it's sometimes misguided**. On Reddit, I think it's mostly pent-up frustration from watching innocent people suffer and die in realtime, and feeling helpless to stop it.  I don't get all the seething hate directed towards it here. I don't even get the people that straight up say that this war isn't our problem and we should back off for fear of consequences.  It makes a lot of people here come across as cold and selfish; almost narcissistic.

It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  The problem is, we are facing a real life ethical problem. It's called the Trolley Problem: 


>The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.  


https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/trolley-problem-moral-philosophy-ethics


In this case, Russia is the Trolley, the 5 people represent the world at large, and the 1 person represents Ukraine.  This is the decision the world faces in a very real sense.  


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

## FOR THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER.

### Sanitizing Water of Microorganisms:
***

**Note: This method will not work for water contaminated with chemicals or radiation!**

According to the the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water) you can sanitize water to make it safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene.

Please download this [PDF](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/documents/emergency_disinfection_of_drinking_water_sept2017.pdf) from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water) infographic and keep it with you and share it with whom you can.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/making-water-safe.html) also provides information on how to sanitize water of microorganisms to make it safe for use.

Here is the [PDF](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/pdf/make-water-safe-during-emergency-p.pdf) to the infographic from the CDC.

It‚Äôs just that people are having gotten overly soft. I wouldn‚Äôt want that guy in a bunker with me. 

They try so hard to project an image. It‚Äôs inauthentic. 

And there are Ukrainians (mainly women) who are not in Ukraine posting selfies of them in blue and gold (like makeup or clothes). While their countrymen are dying. It‚Äôs all about them. Or people posting a flag on their FB profile. It‚Äôs useless. Do something that will help but it‚Äôs still about virtue signaling. 

And that stupid video didn‚Äôt really answer anything. Just a stupid uninformed puff piece.

The issue is the Brain Drain that has been happening for a while.. But now its sped up way more now. On top of that the birth rates in Russia have fallen for a while. Economy is almost non recoverable if the West do not let go of the sanctions.

If I am NATO and lets say.. Ukraine stands its ground and holds on.. Russia would have to give up a lot of stuff to be welcomed back into the world. Living off of China, India, Syria and Iran and.. the DPRK.. is not going to keep them afloat. The Russian Ruble is now at .010

You see an uptick in the currency because Russia is throwing more weight at it. But at some point there won't be anything left to throw at it. Russia is sitting on Black Gold.. But if nobody wants it because your the asshole in the room, people will look elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Unless Russia changes their ways.. I mean.. Putin is thrown out, Denuclearize the entire country.. I don't see how the West will ever want to deal with Russia again.

The U.S. however is set up for a potential economic boom. The United States could hypnotically ram up its production of Oil and become the world leader in selling oil.

It just depends on how the Democrats want to go about it as they're in charge at the moment. However, I think most Americans know that the Dem's are on the verge of losing the House and the Senate. I don't play politics I just see what is going around me through years of experience with the economy. Biden has a 37% approval rating. He needs 40% to go into a election year (He has two more years to turn it around). But he runs the risk of becoming a lame duck and becoming the new Jimmy Carter.

I am very bearish on the Russian economy. I think the sanctions, the mistrust and how the government have threaten to hold foreign assets hostage.. Why would anyone want to do business with them. A decent of people in Russia also like Putin.

You think their troll farms are bad and their misformation here in the US and around the world is intense? Try living there. They've brainwashed the elderly and most adults. Also people are scared.

I‚Äôll be honest right away: I have hardly slept all these days. Almost all the time at work my head is floating, as if it were in a fog. And sometimes I'm overworked and convinced that none of this is real.

To be honest, Pandora's Box is open. A real global horror will begin by the summer - global famine is inevitable (Russia and Ukraine were the main suppliers of grain in the world, this year's harvest will be smaller, and logistical problems will bring the catastrophe to a peak point).

I can't tell you what guided those at the top when deciding on the operation, but now they are methodically lowering all the dogs on us (the FSB). We are scolded for analytics - this is very much up my wheelhouse, so let me explain.

Recently, we have been increasingly pressed to customize reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic.  All these political consultants, politicians and their retinue, influence teams - all this created strong chaos.

 Most importantly, no one knew that there would be such a war, they hid it from everyone. Here's an example for you: you are asked (conditionally) to calculate the possibility of human rights protection in different conditions, including if prisons were to be hit by meteorites. You specify meteorites as insurance for calculations, they tell you nothing like this will really happen.  You understand that the report will be just for show, but you need to write in a victorious style so that there are no questions. They ask, why do you have so many problems, did you really work badly?  In general, a report is being written that when a meteorite falls, we have everything to eliminate the consequences, we are great, everything is fine.  And you concentrate on tasks that are real - we don‚Äôt have enough strength anyway.  And then suddenly they really throw meteorites and expect that everything will be according to your analytics, which weren't to be taken seriously.

That is why we have a total clusterfuck - I don‚Äôt even want to pick another word. There is no protection from sanctions for the same reason: well, it‚Äôs quite possible that [Russian Central Bank head] Nabiullina will be accused of negligence (rather, the switchmen from her team), but what are they to blame for? No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one prepared for such sanctions. This is the reverse side of secrecy: since no one was told, then who could calculate what no one knew about?

[Chechen leader] Kadyrov is going crazy. And his anger almost started with us: perhaps even the Ukrainians threw in misinformation that it was we who handed over the routes of Kadyrov's special forces in the first days of the operation.  They were marching without cover, they had not yet begun to fight, and they were simply torn to pieces in some places. Off we go: it was the FSB that leaked the routes to the Ukrainians. I do not have such information, but I will still give it a 1-2% chance of being true (it cannot be ruled out at all either).

The blitzkrieg failed. It is simply impossible to complete the task now: if Zelensky and the authorities were captured in the first 1-3 days, they seized all the key buildings in Kyiv, they gave them the order to surrender - then yes, the resistance would subside.  In theory.  But what's next?  Even with this ideal scenario, there was an unsolvable problem: with whom to negotiate?  If we depose Zelensky, well, with whom should we sign agreements?  If we sign agreements with Zelensky before we depose him, those papers are worth nothing.  The opposition party refused to cooperate: [Ukrainian Opposition Leader] Medvedchuk is a coward, he fled.  There is a second leader in that party - Boyko, but he refuses to work with us - even his own people will not understand him.  They wanted to return [separatist leader] Tsarev, but even our pro-Russian people turned against him.  Return [former Russian puppet] Yanukovych?  But as?  If we say that Ukraine is impossible to occupy, then any of our authorities will be killed there in 10 minutes, as we leave.  Occupy?  Where are we going to get so many people?  Commandant's offices, military police, counterintelligence, security - even with minimal resistance from the locals, we need 500 thousand or more people.  And that's not even counting logistics.  There is a rule that by using a high quantity of management to make up for poor quality, you spoil everything.  And this, I repeat, would be with the ideal option, which does not exist.

 What now?  We cannot announce mobilization for two reasons:

 1. Large-scale mobilization will undermine the situation inside the country: political, economic, social.

 2. Our logistics are already overstretched today. Our contingent would be many times larger, and what will we get?  Ukraine is a hefty country in terms of territory.  And now the level of hatred towards us is going through the roof.  Our roads simply won't be able to handle such supply caravans - everything will come to a standstill.  And we won't manage to recover - because it's chaos.

And these two reasons occur at the same time, although even one is enough to break everything off.

Losses: I don't know how many there are.  Nobody knows.  For the first two days there was still control, now no one knows what is going on there.  You can lose large units in communication.  They can be found, or they can be attacked and dissolve.  Even the commanders may not know how many of them are running around somewhere nearby, how many died, how many are in captivity.  The number of deaths is definitely in the thousands.  Maybe 10 thousand, maybe 5, or maybe only 2. Even at the headquarters they don‚Äôt know for sure.  But it should be closer to 10.  And that's without counting the [separatist military] - they do their own accounting.

 Now, even if Zelensky is killed, captured, nothing will change. Ukraine is like Chechnya in terms of hatred towards us. Even those who were once loyal to us are now against us.  Because it was planned from above, because we were told that this wouldn't happen unless we were attacked.  Because they explained that it was necessary to create the most credible threat in order to peacefully agree on the right conditions.  Because we were initially preparing protests within Ukraine against Zelensky.  But these didn't account for our direct entry. Our invasion, to put it simply.

 Further civilian losses will increase exponentially - and resistance to us will also only increase.  They already tried to enter the cities with infantry - out of twenty landing groups, only one had a conditional success.  Remember the assault on Mosul - after all, this is the rule, it was the same for all countries, nothing new.

 Keep under siege?  According to the experience of military conflicts in the same Europe in recent decades (Serbia is the largest testing ground here), cities can be under siege for years, and even function.  Humanitarian convoys from Europe will arrive there in a matter of time.

 We have a conditional deadline of June.  Conditional - because in June we have no economy left. Nothing will remain.  By and large, next week there will be a turning point in one of the sides, simply because the situation is stressed to the breaking point.  There are no analytics - it is impossible to calculate the chaos, no one can say anything for sure.  Act intuitively, and even on emotions - but this is not poker.  Rates will rise, in the hope that suddenly some option will shoot through.  The trouble is that we, too, can now miscalculate and lose everything in one move.

[National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASAMS)

The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), combining Norwegian launchers and control systems with U.S.-built AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs), has also been suggested as a short-to-medium-range air defense solution. The radar-guided weapon has an engagement range of up to fifteen miles and up to 52,000 feet. NASAMS would still involve U.S. export controls but might be easier to integrate and faster to acquire than Patriot. But ‚Äúfaster‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúfewer years,‚Äù rather than, say, next month.  
However, in late November 2021, it was reported the Biden administration was considering an alternative: supplying man-portable FIM-92 Stinger missiles to Ukraine. These shoulder-launched weapons have a maximum range of five miles and an altitude of 11,000 feet and are guided by a combined infrared/negative-UV light seeker.  
Stingers can‚Äôt threaten high-flying warplanes nor stop ballistic missiles; however, they do threaten Russia‚Äôs surveillance drones used for targeting deadly missile and artillery strikes, as well as transport and attack helicopters, and may also be useable for last-ditch cruise missile defense. The Stinger threat might also compel Russian attack aircraft to release their predominantly unguided weapons from higher altitudes with lower accuracy as they did in the Syrian Civil War‚Äîor expend limited stocks of precision-guided munitions.

Sanctions means contracts wind down, incoming shipments stop, etc. So for example, a Russian factory that makes industrial controls might have a good chunk of microchips in inventory that can keep them going for a while. But eventually they'll run out and need to find an alternate supplier (either produced in Russia or from a country not participating in sanctions or that doesn't rely on Swift to trust that payments will go through), though this will come at a higher cost.

Meanwhile, as the costs of alternative suppliers goes up, the value of the Ruble is being hit by the central banking restrictions on foreign reserves held by Russia abroad. This means the effective price the factory will pay for the component will be even higher.

Meanwhile, if the company wants to try to raise money to help them pay for those shipments, they'll run into trouble. They can't issue stock publicly, since the Russian stock exchange has been frozen more or less indefinitely by regulators. And if they want to issue bonds/get a bank loan, they won't be able to get financing from anyone abroad (part of the sanctions package), and even if they did the interest rates would be sky high because of how risky investors would perceive it. Even without the risk perception, Ruble-denominated savings accounts are paying 20% per year right now. If you were investing in Russia, what company would you invest in that you think will grow your money faster than 20% or with the same amount of risk as a savings account? There is none.

By and large, next week a turn in one of the sides will begin, simply because the situation cannot be in such an overstrain. There are no analysts - it is impossible to calculate the chaos, no one can say anything for sure here. To act intuitively, and even on emotions - but this is not poker for you. The stakes will rise, in the hope that suddenly some option will shoot through. The trouble is that we can also miscalculate now and lose everything in one move.


By and large, the country has no way out. That's just there is no option of a possible victory, and defeat is everything, they sailed at all. They 100% repeated the beginning of the last century, when they decided to kick weak Japan and get a quick victory, then it turned out that there was trouble with the army. then they started the war to the bitter end, then they began to take the Bolsheviks for ""re-education"" in the army - they were marginals, no one was interested in the masses. And then the Bolsheviks, who were really unknown to anyone, picked up the anti-war slogans and this happened to them...


Of the advantages: we have done everything to prevent even a hint of the mass dispatch of ""penal guards"" to the front line. Send convicts and ""socially unreliable"" political prisoners there (so that the water is not spoiled inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go into negative. And the opponent is motivated, monstrously motivated. He knows how to fight, there are enough middle-level commanders there. There are weapons. They have support. We will simply create a precedent of human losses in the world. That's all.


What we are most afraid of: at the top they act according to the rule of overlapping the old problem with the new problem. In many ways, this is why the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in the Crimea, so the Donbass crisis seemed to have to draw all attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining. But even bigger problems started there. Then they decided to push Erdogan through 4 South Stream pipes and entered Syria - this was after Suleimani gave deliberately false introductory notes to solve his problems. As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung another firebrand (if we leave, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it is difficult and useless to sit).


I do not know who came up with the ""Ukrainian blitz-krieg"". If we were given real introductory notes, we would at least indicate that the original plan is controversial, that we need to double-check a lot. A lot of things. Now we're up to our necks in shit. And it is unclear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not analytical categories, because they do not have well-formed parameters by which it is possible to determine the level of fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the task.
Now it remains to wait for some fucked-up adviser to convince the top to start a conflict with Europe with a demand to reduce some sanctions. Either they reduce it, or the war. And if they refuse? Now I do not rule out that then we will get involved in a real international conflict, like Hitler in 1939. And then our Z with a swastika will be compared to us.


Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it will not do anything - this is a weapon of defense breakthrough), but in order to intimidate others. At the same time, the ground is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging the ground to prove that they secretly created nuclear weapons there. Bl_t, they are now hammering on what we have long studied and sorted out by the bones: it is impossible to draw evidence on the knee here, and the presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is about nothing. The production cycle there is such that you can't do it unnoticeably. You can't even make a ""dirty"" bomb unnoticed, but the fact that their old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (stations like EW-1000 give it in minimal quantities as a ""by-product"" of the reaction) - so there the Americans introduced such control with the connection of the IAEA that it's stupid to suck on the topic.
Do you know what will start in a week? Well, even in two weeks. We are now so covered that we will start to miss the hungry 90s. While the auction was being closed, Nabiullina seems to be making normal steps - but it's all like plugging a hole in a dam with your finger. It's going to burst anyway, and even harder. Nothing will be solved in 3, 5, or 10 days already.


Kadyrov beats his hoof for a reason - they have their own adventures there. He created an image of himself as the most influential and invincible. And if it falls once, it will be demolished by its own. He will no longer be the owner of the winning tape.
We go further. Syria. ""The guys will hold out, everything will end in Ukraine - and we will strengthen everything in positions there in Syria again."" And now, at any moment, they can wait for the contingent to run out of resources - and such a heat will go... Turkey is blocking the straits - to carry supplies there by planes, it's like heating a furnace with money.


Notice - all this is happening at the same time, we don't even have time to put everything in one pile. We have a situation like Germany in 43-44. At the start right away. Sometimes I get lost from this overwork, sometimes it seems that everything was a dream and it was a dream that everything is as before.
By the way, it will be worse in prisons. Now the nuts will begin to tighten so that to bloody sucrovitsa. Everywhere. To be honest, technically it remains the only chance to keep the situation - we are already in total mobilization mode. But it is impossible to be in this mode for a long time, and we have an ambiguity with the timing and it will only get worse for now. From mobilization, management always gets lost. And imagine: in a jerk, you can run a hundred meters, but to go to the marathon distance and give a jerk with all your might is bad. So we rushed with the Ukrainian question, as if for a hundred meters, and fit into a cross-country marathon.
And this I very, very briefly told about what is happening.


From the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that Vladimir Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.


Firstly, there is not one person who makes the decision, at least someone will jump off. And there are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".
Secondly, there are some doubts that everything is functioning successfully there. Experience shows that the higher the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. And where it is unclear who controls and how, but there are always bravura reports - everything is always wrong there. I am not sure that the red button system is functioning according to the stated data. In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.


Thirdly, and this is the most disgusting and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the willingness to sacrifice a person who does not allow members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers to get close to him. Because of the fear of coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter. If you are afraid to let the most trusted people come to you, then how will you decide to destroy yourself and your loved ones inclusive?


If anything, ask, but I can not answer for several days. We are in an emergency mode, and there are more and more tasks.

I feel that there should be some way for the West to alleviate the sanctions if and only if Russia pulls its forces out of Ukraine. Some will see this as still a way to ""rewarding bad behavior"", but we don't want to push them any further than we have to. 

All of these sanctions, some of which make no sense at all (shutting down cancer care operations in Russia) will make this situation a lot worse.

RussiaCO has to convert its rubles to dollars. This is done at a local bank electronically. The  local bank has dollars (mostly electronically) because it bought dollars from the Russian Central Bank who has dollars (mostly electronically) purchased from the US or elsewhere.

Relations started to sour after NATO intervention in Serbia. From their perspective, an alliance that was meant to be a defensive alliance interfered military in a sovereign country. A fellow Slav country with close bonds no less. The post-Soviet collapse period is seen from the Russian perspective as Americans taking advantage of a weak Russia. 

America from the Russian perspective is seen to have fueled the colour revolutions. Rose in Georiga, Orange in Ukraine etc. Seen as meddling in the Russian sphere of influence and overthrowing from the Russian perspective legitimate governments.  

This has also extended to Russia itself from the Russian viewpoint as Putin has suggested the 2005 dissenters march in Russia a period of mass opposition protest against Putin's regimen was fueled by America. How much of that is true we don't know.

After this period we see more NATO intervention. Iraq, Lybia, Syria. Russian sanctions in 2012. 

Overall from the Russian perspective, NATO doesn't look like a defensive alliance. It looks like an alliance that can interfere with the sovereignty of any country it sees fit. And, covertly support revolutions to foster regime change. Bringing NATO to Ukraine a country with deep ties and bonds to Russia is fundamentally different than bringing it to Lativa or Lithuania. 

A hostile Ukraine is seen as an existential threat to Russia. Something that can't stand. That's not a Putin idea, that's a Russian foreign policy idea. Something you would find even in the ""western liberal"" Alexi Navalny.

We potentially are at a historical crossroads of sorts, the very same previous generations have found themselves in, but are conducting ourselves very differently. In fact, had they not conducted themselves how they did, we may not even be in such a comfortable position. 

Relatively speaking we're so comfortable now in the West that all we want to do is bicker on social media over inane political/social issues, with that even spiking peoples adrenaline being a real serious conflict to them, while we sit and order food online and watch yet another new Netflix show or Marvel movie.

I'm genuinely not trying to sound edgy - I've got a 6 month old daughter and I know how brutal war can be, and obviously want to keep that side of the world away from her entirely.

It's hard but it's sadly out of our control. I will, however, say this for your peace of mind. Assuming that Putin is in a normal, rational state of mind and is thinking rationally, also assuming that there are multiple people in charge of launching a nuclear weapon in Russia as there are in the USA. This should mean that Putin won't use nukes. Why? He knows that if the USA or NATO deems his use of nuclear weapons an attack on more than Ukraine that they could invoke article 5 which simply says ""You attack one of us you attack all of us"", depending on how many and how big of nuclear weapons Putin would hypothetically use in this scenario, NATO would either stand by for a bit or go M.A.D. which is an acronym for Mutually Assured Destruction, that's an end of the world scenario when they're considering using Mutually Assured Destruction. But that alone should be enough to deter Putin from wanting to go nuclear because Russia cannot exist if the world doesn't exist, and if I'm not mistaken I believe the common consensus is that he's trying to ""restore Russia to its former glory"". 

I hope I was able to help a bit, whatever happens even if you feel alone and even if you're not around anyone, just know that we're all united in that one time.

Putin with this gamble has done more to harm Russia and its appeal to potential allies in a few short days, than anything in the history of any nation.  He has literally set his country back 50 years at least, possibly more once the sanctions hit.

 >The Dirlewanger Brigade, also known as the SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger (1944), or the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (German: 36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS), or Black Hunters, was a unit of the Waffen-SS during World War II. The unit, named after its commander Oskar Dirlewanger, consisted of convicted criminals who were not expected by Nazi Germany to survive their service with the unit. Originally formed in 1940 and first deployed for counter-insurgency duties against the Polish resistance movement, the brigade saw service in anti-partisan actions in German-occupied Eastern Europe.

At the time, each side had around 30,000 nuclear warheads, and many of these were very large ‚Äúcity buster‚Äù bombs estimated at 15 megatons yield. 
Scientists, including Carl Sagan, postulated that a nuclear war would have similar effects to the Asteroid impact that resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs.   
This resulted in a number of arms-reduction treaties‚Ä¶ And the current status quo is that both the US and Russia have about 2000 warheads in a ready state, and these are much smaller‚Ä¶. About .5 Megaton yield.   (Still much more powerful than the WWII fission bombs. 
I speculate that a nuclear ‚Äúexchange‚Äù between US/NATO and Russia would devastate both areas and result in the destruction of much of what we term ‚Äúmodern society‚Äù‚Ä¶. But would leave most all the Southern Hemisphere untouched.   
Why waste warheads on Africa, South America, The Pacific Islands, etc?

Those methods can be simple, like a password, or very sophisticated (air gapping comes to mind - where the secured network is not accessible via the internet, it's like its own mini-internet). 

One common way is to use dictionary attacks on different services where a dictionary of common passwords is used repeatedly to try and gain access. It's not elegant and usually easily stopped but not all networks are set up to deny brute force attacks. Some software has a default password and sometimes that doesn't get changed.


Another common approach  is to not try and authenticate but to find a vulnerability in the software being used. That could be the operating system, network switches that control traffic to the network, 3rd party software being run on computers or many other things.  If a company released some software with a security flaw and release an update, someone sometimes has to actually apply that update. Sometimes updates break other things so updates don't get installed. Sometimes network admins are not completely competent, other times they are completely overwhelmed and understaffed and underfunded.


Automated tools are often used to try and find a way to exploit a system - a program scans and attempts to gain access or the possibility of access. Once an exploit it found then it  can be a little like a movie, as you'll have someone actively on someone else's network and have the ability to break things, eavesdrop and access other networks.",False,1646514466.0,t3_t7hr55,t1_hzht5pf,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

It has no supporting evidence and it has been discredited by every single operational intelligence group monitoring the conflict.  Russia has sent in all their best stuff except a few next generation tanks that are still doing trials and a prototype multi role fighter. The lack of captured T-90's is more demonstrative of Russia's poverty and inability to build such equipment in quantity than any lack of involvement in the operation.  Some of the best trained and equipped Russian units have also been committed and have taken heavy losses.  We know from killed and captured Russians themselves.  What remains of the Russian forces outside Ukraine are mostly second tier battalions with inferior equipment and training to what has already been committed. This is not ""wishful thinking""  It is well sourced intelligence from professionals who know what they're doing.  Not some internet fanboy with delusions of better understanding. 

Secondly, as to your assertion that "" the troops and resources he's committed to Ukraine must succeed without further support"" is also likely false as we have well documented reports of Russian recalling reserves and transfer men and materiel from the south and eastern sectors.

 >National missile defense (NMD) is a generic term for a type of missile defense intended to shield an entire country against incoming missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) or other ballistic missiles. This is also used to refer to the American nationwide antimissile program the United States has had in development since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities. This article focuses mainly on this system and a brief history of earlier systems which led to it.

Aside from the fact that we no longer rely and have not relied on a single defense system for decades, we have worked hard to get systems in place throughout Europe and in mobile units that are not a part of the NMD assessment.

The reason for this is the international community, specifically China and Russia protested the US working in these systems (despite working to bypass our older systems), and so we simply stopped reporting on these capabilities.

Also, a major function of missile defense in the modern era is preventing known locations from being able to launch and disrupting capability, which is also not included in NMD assessments. These are different things, but all designed for the same purpose.

Like valuing justice and human dignity is a value I was taught growing up. It was part of what it meant to be American. Both a point of pride, and an aspiration. 

But in moments like now, it feels a bit like standing in front of a mirrior. All of a sudden ""valuing justice and liberty"" has a price tag. A very real one $100+ dollars for a barrel of oil, and $4+ for a gallon of gas. 

And so the question we find ourself having to answer is ""are these core values worth it."" 

Like is the bit we can do (sanctions, supplying weapons) worth $4+ for a gallon of 85-octane. 

I think each person has to answer that for themselves, and it's tough. Like ""I value liberty and democracy"" is a nice phrase, but ""I value liberty and human dignity  only at less then $4/gal."" Has a very different meaning.

We are all the same, in roundabout ways, we all live in democracies, we all have a deep history fighting Russian aggression, our societies fought together through not one but two of the worst wars in human history.  You can think it unsavoury, but that shared history and those connections matter a great deal. Eastern Europe is so interconnected that people in Baltic countries tend to have family right across the region. Hell, Europe as a whole is heavily interconnected. I'm British, my brother is from Finland, my Dad is Irish, and my step-mother is Romanian.  We clearly have a shared history, deep roots, and our destiny is inextricably linked (whatever it may be).

 >The Russian bounty program is an alleged project of Russian military intelligence to pay bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing American and other allied service members during the war in Afghanistan. The existence of the alleged program was reported in the media in 2020 and became an issue in the 2020 presidential election campaign. In June 2020, The Washington Post reported that intelligence suggesting the existence of a bounty operation dated to as early as 2018. The Washington Post and Associated Press both reported that Trump administration White House officials were informed of the intelligence reports in early 2019.

4b954d2569080147221f33fb85c8c702,t7hr55,hzidza3,"By and large, the country has no way out. There is no option for a possible victory. Ukraine 100% repeated the beginning of the last century [the Russo-Japanese War], when we decided to kick weak Japan and get a quick victory... then it turned out that our army was in trouble. They started the war to the bitter end, then they began to take the Bolsheviks for ""re-education"" into the army - after all, they were outcasts, uninteresting to anyone in the masses.  And then, the Bolsheviks, who were not really known to anyone, picked up anti-war slogans and it all started...

 From the pros: we did everything so that even a hint of the mass sending of ""penalty boxes"" to the front line did not pass.  If you send convicts and ""socially unreliable"" political prisoners there (so that they don't mess with public opinion inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go into the negative. The enemy is motivated, terribly motivated.  He knows how to fight, there are enough middle-level commanders there.  There are weapons.  They have support.  We will simply set a precedent for human loss in the world.  And that's it.

 What we are most afraid of: at the top, they act according to the rule of overlapping the old problem with a new problem.  Largely for this reason, the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis, it seems, should have drawn all the attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining.  But there were even bigger problems.  Then they decided to push Erdogan on 4 pipes of the South Stream [a Russian pipeline through Turkey] and we entered Syria - this is after Soleimani lied in order to solve his problems.  As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with the Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung with another headache (if we go out, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it‚Äôs also difficult and useless to sit).

 I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian Blitzkrieg"". If we were given real input on the original plan, we would at least indicate that it would be controversial, and that there is a lot to double-check. A lot. Now we're up to our neck in shit, and it's not clear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not clear goals, because they do not have clearly defined parameters by which one can determine the level of accomplishment or non-completion of the task.

 Now it remains to be seen if some fucking adviser will convince the top to start a conflict with Europe demanding they reduce sanctions or we declare war. But what if they refuse? I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like Hitler in 1939. Then our Z will turn into a new swastika.

Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike?  Yes.  Not for military purposes (it will not do anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others.  At the same time, the soil is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - [spymaster] Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging to prove that Ukraine secretly created nuclear weapons.  They are now hammering on what we have long studied and dismantled: you can‚Äôt draw evidence here on your knee. The presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is nothing. The production cycle is such that you can‚Äôt do it without someone noticing.  You can‚Äôt even make a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù bomb without someone noticing. Ukraine's old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (plants like REB-1000 produce it in minimal quantities as a ‚Äúby-product‚Äù of the reaction) - but the Americans got the IAEA involved, so sucking on that topic is stupid.

 Do you know what will happen in the next week or two?  Sanctions will hit us so hard that we will start to miss the hungry 90s.  While the stock market was closed, Nabiullina seemed to be taking normal steps - but this is all like plugging a hole in a dam with a finger.  It will still break through, and even stronger.  Nothing will be decided in 3, 5, or 10 days.

 Kadyrov beats his hoof for a reason - they have their own adventures there.  He created for himself the image of the most influential and invincible.  And if that image falls once, he will be taken down by its own people. He will no longer be the owner of the winning horse.

 We go further.  Syria.  ""The guys will hold out, everything will be over in Ukraine - and there in Syria we will again strengthen everything in positions.""  And now, at any moment, they can wait there for the contingent to run out of resources. Turkey blocks the straits - and to transport supplies there by air is like heating an oven with money.

 Notice that all this is happening at the same time. We don‚Äôt even have time to bring everything into one heap.  We're beginning this in a situation equivalent to Germany in 1943-1944. 

Sometimes I am already lost from overwork. Sometimes it seems that everything is a dream and it's all as it was before.

 In prisons, by the way, it will be worse.  Now the nuts will begin to tighten until we see bloody ichor, everywhere. To be honest, purely technically, this remains the only chance to keep the situation - we are already in the mode of total mobilization.  But you can‚Äôt stay in such a regime for a long time, and we have ambiguity with the timing and it will only get worse for now.  From mobilization, management always goes astray.  You can run a hundred meters in a sprint, but it‚Äôs bad to go to a marathon and begin sprinting with all your might.  Here we sprinted with the Ukrainian question as if we were running a hundred meters, but we are truly running a cross-country marathon.

 And that's what I said very, very briefly about what's going on.

For the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.

 Firstly, there is more than one person making a decision, at least someone will balk.  There are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".

 Secondly, there are some doubts that the nuclear arsenal is even functioning properly.  Experience shows that the greater the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. But there is no transparency. I'm not sure if the red button system works as advertised.  In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.

 Thirdly, and this is the most vile and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the readiness to sacrifice oneself of a person who does not let the members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers, come close to him.  For fear of the coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter.  If you are afraid to let the most trusted people near you, then how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones, inclusive?

 If anything - ask, but I can not answer for several days.  We are in a rush mode, and there are more and more tasks.

 In general, our reports are peppy, but everything flies into the clusterfuck.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

a2b1c10dd96de828c1eb9d012579dd27,t7hr55,hzi753c,"Lol, [my original comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t6yzjn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_352022/hzhkexh/) was broken down into nice paragraphs...:

A tank weighs 50 tonnes, and has a 1,000-1,500 hp engine. So they drink fuel, managing about 0.5mpg (500L/100km). A straight drive to Kyiv from the nearest supply base is about 200 miles, so at a minimum 10 tonnes of diesel. 

For reference, a Russian military truck can carry about 5 tonnes.

Russia also relies on missile launchers. Missiles are big and heavy. A grad rocket is 3m long and weights 70kg. A grad missile launcher fires 40 of these in a single salvo. That's about 3 tonnes per salvo.

Russian battalions use a lot more tanks and missile launchers than typical NATO battalions, which rely on aircraft to deliver heavy firepower instead. Aircraft have the advantage of flying back to an airbase to rearm and refuel, so you don't need to send a truck out.

So you'd think the Russian army would use more trucks per battalion than NATO armies. Wrong. A typical American or British battalion has 400 trucks assigned to it, while the Russians each have 200.

With some simple maths, you can work out how far a battalion can go supplied by trucks. That 200 mile drive to Kyiv, for example, will take a truck 4 hours driving at 50 mph. Then 1 hour to unload, another 4 hour drive back to the supply base, and then another hour to load up again. That's 10 hours. With other delays, call it two trips per day assuming they have replacement drivers.

If it were only 50 miles away, it would only take 4 hours (1 hour drive, 1 hour unload, one our drive back, one hour reload) meaning 5 or 6 trips a day. By calculating a battalion's typical daily supply requirements, and the number of trucks available, you can calculate how far the battalion can travel while still being fully supplied. The answer for Russian battalions: 50 miles. This could be much lower if the battalion is engaged in heavy fighting.

As u/35Shitbag said, Russia relies heavily on rail to supply its forces instead. It's one of the only developed countries with a military that still does so. That's great until you run out of railroad. I'll add to what he said that not only is aerial supply ridiculously dangerous, it's incredibly inefficient, with their best transport helicopters maxing out at 4 tonnes. Russia only has a few hundred of these, enough to maybe supply 1 battalion if they went all out with it. Russia has about 100 battalions in Ukraine. Helicopters are a lot more expensive than trucks y'see, and need skilled pilots to fly them.

So it's back to trucks, which as well as being too few, many are old and prone to mechanical failures. Putting hundreds of vehicles on one narrow highway, as with the convoy of doom headed to Kyiv, doesn't leave a lot of margin of error if they start to break down. 

Satellite photos show the convoy in 3 lanes: one for the combat vehicles themselves, one for trucks going in one direction, and one for trucks going in the other. Any breakdown means the whole thing comes to a stop.

Have I mentioned that they're driving through a warzone? No? Did you know, these Russian trucks don't even have bulletproof glass protecting the driver? Ukrainian snipers will tell you all about it. Also, there are these things called bridges, which allow vehicles to cross rivers and gorges with comparative ease, and which the Ukrainians have rather unsportingly decided to blow up.

All of this means the Ukrainians are left with the difficult decision whether to attack the convoy and get some awesome videos to post on reddit, or save their ammo and just leave it sitting there while they wait for the Russians to file into Kyiv waving white flags and asking for food. It's certainly a difficult choice. 

The Russians have basically Stalingrad'ed themselves, without the Ukrainians even having to bother encircling them. I'm not sure the convoy even has the resources to retreat back to Russia at this point.

This is what happens when you have an inflexible, top down command structure where any kind of initiative or criticism of plans are severely punished. Everyone just follows orders, without explaining why it can't work or attempting to fix problems themselves.

So what that leaves half, ok then why, as intelligence suggests, that if Putin wanted this over in weeks did he not use 1000 planes to destroy Ukraine?

2 reasons I can think of 

1-the drastic increase of SAMs provided by western countries, which has made a significant contribution in the downing of aircraft. 

2- the complete collapse of Russian logistics. The ill planning and maintenance deficiencies of their ground vehicle fleets has caused some of their convoys to literally grind to a halt. Many of them are out of gas and packed 3 wide on a 2 lane highway , afraid to go off road for fear of having their poorly maintained tires fail. Seeing as you can‚Äôt hold ground using AirPower alone there‚Äôs no use using your airforce to bomb targets if you don‚Äôt have ground troops to hold your gains 

Let‚Äôs remember, we are only on day 9 and Russia has lost (from estimates I can find) about 70 aircraft. If this rate keeps up after 100 days you are talking about 800 aircraft.

 >A Geobukseon (Korean: Í±∞Î∂ÅÏÑ†, Korean pronunciation: [k åbuks…ôn]), also known as turtle ship in western descriptions, was a type of large Korean warship that was used intermittently by the Royal Korean Navy during the Joseon dynasty from the early 15th century up until the 19th century. It was used alongside the panokseon warships in the fight against invading Japanese naval ships. The ship's name derives from its protective shell-like covering. One of a number of pre-industrial armoured ships developed in Europe and in East Asia, this design has been described by some as the first armored ship in the world.

""The facts as we know them: Putin was born in Leningrad in 1952, a city that lived under a nearly three-year siege by the Nazis during World War II that wiped out most of the population of more than three million people. One million people starved to death. The siege has been termed a genocide and is described as the world‚Äôs most destructive siege of a city. His father was badly injured in the war; his mother nearly died of starvation. Before Putin was born, his parents had lost two children, one from diphtheria. Leningrad had not yet recovered, and life was extremely difficult. His parents had a room in run-down apartment with two other families. The details are sketchy, but they had no hot water, no bathtub, perhaps little or no heat. Both parents worked as much as they could to support themselves and him, his father in a factory, his mother any odd job she could get. One report says they left him with another family. But it was clear that he was left to fend for himself in the company of other kids in the apartment building. He was bullied, no doubt severely.""",False,1646517331.0,t3_t7hr55,t1_hzi1of9,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Given what we do know about Russia and what we're learning, their mission capable rate for their air force is likely even lower than that 71.5% of the US.

 I can't tell you what guided those at the top when deciding on the operation, but now they are methodically lowering all the dogs on us (the Service).  We are scolded for analytics - this is very in my profile, so I will explain what is wrong.
 Recently, we have been increasingly pressed to customize reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic.  All these political consultants, politicians and their retinue, influence teams - all this created chaos.  Strong.
 Most importantly, no one knew that there would be such a war, they hid it from everyone.  And here's an example for you: you are asked (conditionally) to calculate the possibility of human rights protection in different conditions, including the attack of prisons by meteorites.  You specify about meteorites, they tell you - this is so, reinsurance for calculations, nothing like this will happen.  You understand that the report will be just for show, but you need to write in a victorious style so that there are no questions, they say, why do you have so many problems, did you really work badly.  In general, a report is being written that when a meteorite falls, we have everything to eliminate the consequences, we are great, everything is fine.  And you concentrate on tasks that are real - we don‚Äôt have enough strength anyway.  And then suddenly they really throw meteorites and expect that everything will be according to your analytics, which was written from the bulldozer.
 That is why we have a total piz_ets - I don‚Äôt even want to pick another word.  There is no protection from sanctions for the same reason: well, it‚Äôs quite possible that Nabiullina will be sewn up with negligence (rather, the switchmen from her team), but what are they to blame for?  No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one prepared for such sanctions.  This is the reverse side of secrecy: since no one was told, then who could calculate what no one told about?
 Kadyrov is going crazy.  And the conflict almost started with us: perhaps even the Ukrainians threw in misinformation that it was we who handed over the routes of Kadyrov's special forces in the first days of the operation.  They were covered there on the march in a terrible way, they had not yet begun to fight, but they were simply torn to pieces in some places.  And off we go: it was the FSB that leaked the routes to the Ukrainians.  I do not have such information, I will leave 1-2% for reliability (it cannot be completely ruled out either).
 Blitzkrieg failed.  It is simply impossible to complete the task now: if Zelensky and the authorities were captured in the first 1-3 days, they seized all the key buildings in Kyiv, they gave them the order to surrender - yes, the resistance would subside to the minimum values.  In theory.  But what's next?  Even with this ideal variant, there was an unsolvable problem: with whom to negotiate?  If we demolish Zelensky, well, with whom should we sign agreements?  If with Zelensky, then after we demolish it, these papers are worth nothing.  Opposition Platform for Life refused to cooperate: Medvedchuk is a coward, he fled.  There is a second leader there - Boyko, but he refuses to work with us - even his own people will not understand him.  They wanted to return Tsarev, so even our pro-Russians turned against him.  Return Yanukovych?  But as?  If we say that it is impossible to occupy, then any of our authorities will be killed there in 10 minutes, as we leave.  Occupy?  Where are we going to get so many people?  Commandant's offices, military police, counterintelligence, security - even with minimal resistance from the locals, we need 500 thousand or more people.  Not counting the supply system.  And there is a rule that by covering the poor quality of management with quantity, you only spoil everything.  And this, I repeat, would be with the ideal option, which does not exist.
 What now?  We cannot announce mobilization for two reasons:
 1) Large-scale mobilization will undermine the situation inside the country: political, economic, social.
 2) Our logistics are already overstretched today.  We will drive a many times larger contingent, and what will we get?  Ukraine is a hefty country in terms of territory.  And now the level of hatred towards us is going through the roof.  Our roads simply won't be able to handle such supply caravans - everything will come to a standstill.  And we won't manage to pull it out - because it's chaos.
 And these two reasons fall out at the same time, although even one is enough to break everything off.
 Losses: I don't know how many there are.  Nobody knows.  The first two days there was still control, now no one knows what is going on there.  You can lose large units in communication.  They can be found, or they can dissolve due to being attacked.  And there, even the commanders may not know how many of them are running around somewhere nearby, how many died, how many are in captivity.  The number of deaths is definitely in the thousands.  Maybe 10 thousand, maybe 5, or maybe only 2. Even at the headquarters they don‚Äôt know for sure.  But it should be closer to 10.  And now we don‚Äôt count the LDNR corps - they have their own accounting.
 Now, even if Zelensky is killed, captured, nothing will change.  There is Chechnya in terms of hatred towards us.  And now even those who were loyal to us are opposed.  Because it was planned from above, because we were told that there would be no such option, unless we were attacked.  Because they explained that it was necessary to create the most credible threat in order to peacefully agree on the right conditions.  Because we were initially preparing protests within Ukraine against Zelensky.  Excluding our direct entry.  Intrusions, to put it simply.
 Further civilian losses will go exponentially - and resistance to us will also only increase.  They already tried to enter the cities with infantry - out of twenty landing groups, only one had a conditional success.  Remember the assault on Mosul - after all, this is the rule, it was the same for all countries, nothing new.
 Keep under siege?  According to the experience of military conflicts in the same Europe in recent decades (Serbia is the largest testing ground here), cities can be under siege for years, and even function.  Humanitarian convoys from Europe there - a matter of time.
 We have a conditional deadline of June.  Conditional - because in June we have no economy left, nothing remains.  By and large, next week there will be a turning point in one of the sides, simply because the situation cannot be in such an overstrain.  There are no analytics - it is impossible to calculate the chaos, here no one can say anything for sure.  Act intuitively, and even on emotions - but this is not poker for you.  Rates will rise, in the hope that suddenly some option will shoot through.  The trouble is that we, too, can now miscalculate and lose everything in one move.
 By and large, the country has no way out.  It‚Äôs just that there is no option for a possible victory, and defeat is everything, sailed at all.  They 100% repeated the beginning of the last century, when they decided to kick weak Japan and get a quick victory, then it turned out that the army was in trouble.  then they started the war to the bitter end, then they began to take the Bolsheviks for ""re-education"" into the army - after all, they were outcasts, uninteresting to anyone in the masses.  And then, the Bolsheviks, who were not really known to anyone, picked up anti-war slogans and it started like this ...
 From the pros: we did everything so that even a hint of the mass sending of ""penalty boxes"" to the front line did not pass.  Send convicts and ""socially unreliable"" political prisoners there (so that they don't mess with the water inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go into the negative.  And the enemy is motivated, terribly motivated.  He knows how to fight, there are enough middle-level commanders there.  There are weapons.  They have support.  We will simply set a precedent for human loss in the world.  And that's all.
 What we are most afraid of: at the top, they act according to the rule of overlapping the old problem with a new problem.  Largely for this reason, the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis, it seems, should have drawn all the attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining.  But there were even bigger problems.  Then they decided to push Erdogan into 4 pipes of the South Stream and entered Syria - this is after Soleimani gave deliberately false inputs in order to solve his problems.  As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with the Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung with another headache (if we go out, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it‚Äôs also difficult and useless to sit).
 I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian Blitzkrieg"".

Basically, the country has no way out. There is simply no option for a possible victory, and if we lose - that's it, we're screwed. Then they decided to kick weak Japan and get a quick win, then it turned out that the army was a disaster. Then they started a war to the bitter end, then they took the Bolsheviks to ""re-educate"" them in the army - they were outcasts, nobody was interested in them in the masses. And then nobody really knew the Bolsheviks picked up anti-war slogans and they went crazy...
On the plus side: we did everything to prevent even a hint of mass sending of the ""fine men"" to the front line. Send there cons and ""socially unreliable"", political (so they don't muddy the water inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go down the drain. And the enemy is motivated, motivated monstrously. They know how to fight, they have enough middle-ranking commanders. They have weapons. They have support. We will simply create a precedent for human losses in the world. That's all.
What we fear the most: they are acting on the rule of overlapping an old problem with a new one. This was largely the reason why the Donbass conflict began in 2014 - it was necessary to draw the attention of Westerners away from the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis was supposed to draw all the attention to itself and become a bargaining chip. But even bigger problems started there. Then they decided to sell Erdogan on the four pipes of South Stream and went into Syria - this was after Suleimani gave deliberately false inputs to solve his problems. As a result, we failed to solve the problem with the Crimea, there are problems with Donbass too, South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria is another headache (if we go out, they will bring down Assad, which will make us look idiots, but it will be hard and useless to sit still). 
I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian blitzkrieg."" If we were given real inputs, we would at the very least point out that the original plan is moot, that we need to double-check a lot of things. A lot of things. Now we are up to our necks in shit. And it's not clear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not analytical categories, because they have no clearly formed parameters by which to determine the level of accomplishment or non-fulfillment of the assigned task.
Now all that remains is to wait for some fucked-up advisor to convince the upper echelons to start a conflict with Europe with a demand to lower some sanctions. Either they lower the sanctions or they go to war. And if they refuse? Now I don't rule out that then we'll get into a real international conflict like Hitler did in 1939. And we would then get our Z's flattened with a swastika.

Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it won't do anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but to intimidate others. At the same time the ground is being prepared to turn everything over to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging up the ground to prove that they secretly created nuclear weapons there. They are hammering on what we have studied and analysed on bones long time ago: the proofs cannot be drawn up on a knee-high, and the availability of specialists and uranium (Ukraine is full of depleted isotope 238) is of no importance. The production cycle there is such that it cannot be done unnoticed. ""The fact that their old NPPs can give weapon-grade plutonium (stations like REB-1000 give it in minimum quantities as a ""by-product"" of the reaction) - so the Americans have introduced such control with involvement of the IAEA that it's silly to discuss the topic.
Do you know what will start in a week? Well, even in two weeks. We're going to be so caught up that we're going to miss the hungry '90s. While the auction was closed, Nabiullina seems to be making normal steps - but it's like plugging a hole in the dam with a finger. It will still burst, and even stronger. Nothing will be solved in three, five or ten days. 
Kadyrov doesn't just hoof it for a reason - they have their own adventures there. He's created an image of himself as the most powerful and invincible. And if he falls once, he'll be brought down by his own people. He will no longer be the master of the victorious clan.
Let's move on. Syria. ""The guys will hold out, everything will be over in Ukraine - and there in Syria we will reinforce everything by positions again. And now at any moment they can wait there when the contingent runs out of resources - and such a heat will go... Turkey is blocking the straits - airlifting supplies there is like heating an oven with money.
Note - all this is happening at the same time, we do not even have time to put it all in one pile. Our situation is like Germany's in '43-'44. At the start all at once. Sometimes I am already lost in this overwork, sometimes it seems that everything was a dream, that everything is as it was before.
On prisons, by the way, it's going to get worse. Now they're going to tighten the screws until they bleed. Everywhere. To be honest, then purely technically it's the only chance of containing the situation - we're already in a total mobilization mode. But we can't stay in such a mode for long, and our timetable is unclear, and it will only get worse. Mobilization always makes management lose its way. And just imagine: you can run a hundred meters in a sprint, but to go into a marathon race and run as hard as you can is bad. Here we are with the Ukrainian question rushed, as on a hundred meters, and fit into a cross-country marathon. 
And that's a very, very brief description of what's going on. 
The only cynical thing I can add is that I do not believe that VV Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.
First of all, there is not one person who makes the decision, at least someone will jump out. And there are many people there - there is no ""single red button"".
Secondly, there are some doubts that everything successfully functions there. Experience shows that the higher the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify deficiencies. And where it is unclear who and how controls, but always bravura reports - everything is always wrong there. I am not sure that the red button system is functioning as declared. Besides, the plutonium charge has to be replaced every 10 years.
Thirdly, and most disgusting and sad, I personally do not believe in the willingness to sacrifice a man who does not let his closest representatives and ministers near him, nor the members of the Federation Council. Whether out of fear of coronavirus or attack, it doesn't matter. If you are afraid to let your most trusted ones near you, how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones inclusive? 

Ask me anything, but I may not answer for days at a time. We're in rush mode, and we're getting more and more tasked. 
On the whole, our reports are upbeat, but everything goes to hell.

And from overwork sometimes already catching states, as if it's all not real.
Frankly speaking, Pandora's Box is open - by summer a real horror of world scale will start - global famine is inevitable (Russia and Ukraine were the main grain suppliers in the world, this year's harvest will be smaller, and logistical problems will bring the disaster to its peak).
I cannot tell you what guided the decision to operate, but now all the dogs are methodically brought down on us (the Service). We are scolded for being analytical - this is very much in my line of work, so I will explain what is wrong.
We have been under increasing pressure lately to adjust reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this subject. All these political consultants, politicians and their entourage, influence teams - it's all been creating chaos. A lot of it.
Most importantly, no one knew that there would be such a war, it was hidden from everyone. And here is an example: You are asked (conventionally) to calculate the possibility of human rights in different conditions, including a prison attack by meteorites. You ask about meteorites, they tell you that this is just a reinsurance for calculations, there will be nothing like that. You understand that the report will be only for a tick, but it must be written in a victorious style, so that there would be no questions, saying, why do you have so many problems, did you not work well? In general, you write a report that in the fall of a meteorite, we have everything to eliminate the consequences, we are good, all is well. And you concentrate on the tasks that are real - we do not have enough strength. And then suddenly really throw meteorites and expect that everything will be on your analysis, which were written from the ball. 
That's why we have total fuck-ups - I don't even want to choose another word. There is no defense against sanctions for the same reason: Nabiullina may well be found guilty of negligence (more likely the point men on her team), but what is their fault? No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one was prepared for such sanctions. This is the flip side of secrecy: since no one told anyone, who could have calculated what no one told?
Kadyrov's going off the rails. There was almost a conflict with us, too: the Ukrainians may have planted the lie that we had given up the routes of Kadyrov's special units in the first days of the operation. They were killed in the most horrific way, they hadn't even begun to fight yet, and they were simply torn apart in some places. And so it went: the FSB leaked the routes to the Ukrainians. I do not have such information, I will leave 1-2% for reliability (you can not completely exclude it either).
The blitz has failed. It is simply impossible to accomplish the task now: if in the first 1-3 days they had captured Zelensky and government officials, seized all the key buildings in Kiev, let them read the order to surrender - yes, the resistance would have subsided to a minimum. Theoretically. But then what? Even with this ideal scenario, there was an unsolvable problem: with whom to negotiate? If we tear down Zelensky, all right, with whom would we sign agreements? If with Zelensky, then these papers won't be worth anything after his demolition. OPZJ refused to cooperate: Medvedchuk is a coward, he ran away. There is a second leader there - Boyko, but he refuses to work with us - even his own people won't understand him. We wanted to bring Tsarev back, but even our pro-Russian ones have turned against us. Should we bring back Yanukovych? How can we do that? If we say that we can't occupy him, then all our government will be killed 10 minutes after we leave. Occupy? And where are we going to get so many people? Commandant's office, military police, counterintelligence, guards - even with the minimum resistance from the locals we need 500 thousand or more people. Not counting the supply system. And there is a rule of thumb that by overriding quantity with poor management you only ruin everything. And that, I repeat, would be under an ideal scenario, which does not exist.
What about now? We can't declare a mobilization for two reasons:
1) Large-scale mobilization would undermine the situation inside the country: political, economic, social.
2) Our logistics are already overstretched today. We will send a much larger contingent, and what will we get? Ukraine is a huge country in terms of territory. And now the level of hatred towards us is off the charts. Our roads simply can't absorb such supply caravans - everything will come to a standstill. And we will not be able to manage it, because it is chaos.

And these two reasons we have fallen out at the same time, although even one is enough to ruin everything.
In terms of losses: I don't know how many. Nobody knows. The first two days there was still control, now no one knows what's going on there. It is possible to lose large units from communication. They may be found, or they may be dispersed because they came under attack. And even their commanders may not know how many are running around, how many have died, how many have been taken prisoner. The death toll is definitely in the thousands. It can be 10 thousand, it can be 5, and it can be only 2. Even the headquarters do not know exactly. But it must be closer to 10. And we are not counting the corps of the LDPR now - they have their own count.
Now, even if we kill Zelensky and take him prisoner, nothing will change. Chechnya is there by the level of hatred towards us. And now even those who were loyal to us are against it. Because they were planning on above, because we were told that such an option will not happen, unless we are attacked. Because we were told that we must create the most credible threat in order to agree peacefully on the right terms. Because we initially prepared protests inside Ukraine against Zelensky. Without regard to our direct entry. An invasion, to put it simply.
Further the civilian losses will go exponentially - and the resistance to us will also only increase. We have already tried to enter the cities with infantry - out of twenty landing groups, only one was a tentative success.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.
 
**[Dead Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand)** 
 
 >Dead Hand (Russian: –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ ¬´–ü–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ç—Ä¬ª, Systema ""Perimetr"", lit. ""Perimeter"" System, with the GRAU Index 15E601, Cyrillic: 15–≠601), also known as Perimeter, is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear weapons-control system (similar in concept to the American AN/DRC-8 Emergency Rocket Communications System) that was used by the Soviet Union. The system remains in use in the post-Soviet Russian Federation.
 
**[Nuclear holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust)** 
 
 >A nuclear holocaust, nuclear apocalypse or atomic holocaust is a theoretical scenario where the mass detonation of nuclear weapons causes globally widespread destruction and radioactive fallout. Such a scenario envisages large parts of the Earth becoming uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear warfare, potentially causing the collapse of civilization and, in the worst case, extinction of humanity and/or termination of life on earth.

So the only possibility was that he had mobile labs because neither UN nor US weapons inspectors could find any trace of WMDs. Hence the UN presentation with Powell showing a silly cartooned mock up of a mobile WMD lab that we knew the exact location of but refused to divulge the location of to the UN weapons inspectors.

The pretext of war over WMDs was false. It was always false. The war was about securing US interests in the Middle East before Russia did. Specifically oil.

**I was wrong about this part, as far as wikipedia provides information wise, the cheget does not allow for unilateral nuclear launch.**

Secondly, Russia employs an escalate to de escalate military doctrine. Officially, this means that the Russian military (putin) may use tactical low yield nukes on the battlefield in order to put them above their enemy at the negotiating table.

The first part is possibly speculation, but its pretty highly documented, the second is LITERALLY from the Russian military playbook.

I don't think Russia will use nukes, but we seriously need to dispel this myth that they aren't super easy to launch, because they are, and they are fucking apocalyptic.

Visa said transactions using Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work in Russia.

Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, has said sanctions announced by Visa and Mastercard will not affect users of the cards it issues in Russia, Tass news agency reported.

""These decisions will not affect Sberbank's Visa and Mastercards inside the country,"" the Russian news agency quoted the bank as saying.

Earlier we reported that Visa and Mastercard have said they were suspending operations in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

I'd argue the opposite. Say, hypothetically, NATO forces started fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. I'd suggest with numerical advantage Russian troops could be pushed back right to the border. At that point they dig in and fortify, defending from further invasions.

Sure, the Russians can still shell and bomb, but with decent weaponry NATO could fight back and destroy Russian artillery etc.

This would largely stop the slaughter of innocent Ukrainian civilians. Sure the Ukrainin army would still take casaulties.

There was a part of me that hoped, as awful as the situation was, that it could be that major reset; something that made the world take a step back and reconsider what was really important.   A great amount of pain for our society but one that made priorities clear for everyone.   Covid was (and is)  an unambiguous, apolitical enemy of every person.   Surely it wouldn't go the way that everything else in our society has, right?

&#x200B;

The world proved me wrong.

&#x200B;

Covid was picked apart, politicized, weaponized, and used to divide us further, when it's something that we all had no reason to be anything other than on the same side about.   And when people made bad decisions about it and people needlessly suffered--even when they suffered themselves--too rarely did anybody have the courage to take responsibility for their mistakes.   We've become too conditioned to pass the buck and blame the ""others"" rather than look inward at what we could be doing better.  

&#x200B;

And you're right; it's probably because looking inward and taking an honest assessment of your own decisions is intensely uncomfortable, and our society has over time become structured around avoiding discomfort wherever it can be found.   That's why online echo chambers exist; to shield people from having their opinions challenged.  Challenge is something even correct opinions need, because if they can't hold up to scrutiny then maybe they aren't correct after all.

&#x200B;

Like Covid, the war in Ukraine is something that we should all (or at least those of us with access to information) unambiguously be on the same side about.
