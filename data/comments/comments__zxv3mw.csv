Day 309 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The long awaited next big missile strike finally happened and it really wasn’t anything special, the number of missiles that was expected was vastly overblown, as it wasn’t the 120+ missiles that everyone was talking about, but only 69 and some Shaheds along with them. It doesn’t seem that it did too much damage to our infrastructure, the problems with electricity are not widespread right now, and some blackouts are not due to the missile strike, but because some cities turned off electricity as preventive measures to lessen any possible damage. 

Though I don’t think it’s the end of missile strikes for today yet, as just recently there was a second missile strike aimed at Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure, and apparently it wasn’t done by an S-300 missile, but a cruise missile, which they usually do not use on Kharkiv, because they can use the cheaper and more abundant S-300 missiles for it. Some people reported electricity being cut after that missile strike, but for us it’s stable for now. We had it the entire day with basically no interruptions despite the missile strike, though it did flicker for a couple of seconds right after the first missiles landed in Kharkiv in the morning.

They have been trying to destroy Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure starting from yesterday evening, when they launched 13 Shaheds at us, thankfully 11 of them were intercepted and it doesn’t look like the rest did any significant damage. Then they fired 4 S-300 missiles at us in the morning, which didn’t do much, and one of the missiles landed in a swamp, where it belongs. They did a third strike at our infrastructure about an hour or so ago, sadly they killed 1 civilian and injured 2 more with it, fucking terrorist scum.

Some good news is that while they were firing missiles at us the whole morning our forces didn’t sit idly, Russians reported that one of their S-300 launchers was destroyed by our strike right in the middle of the missile attack. There were also a bunch of other attacks on Russian positions on their side of the border, as well as another strike on Engels airbase, though I’m pretty sure this time they did actually manage to intercept our drone.

Roosevelt declared it “the day that will live in infamy” bc it was seen as downright evil and abdication of all honor to surprise attack.  Thats what Russia did.

>Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 29 December 2022

>In the early hours of 26 December 2022, Russia’s Engels Air Base was attacked for the second time in three weeks.

>Russian media reported that uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) were responsible for the strike on the facility, one of the main operating bases of Russia’s strategic bomber fleet.

She has criticised Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for participating in photo shoots and appearing around the world making speeches as part of a Washington PR campaign.

>She said lately the US has been trying to present Ukraine as democracy fighters and now as peacemakers while pumping Kyiv full of weapons and Nato command structures amid the killing of children. “We can’t talk about the serious peace initiative of Kyiv and its western sponsors,” she said, as “they don’t have anything serious about them”.

>She has gone on to list a series of human rights violations within Ukraine reported by the UN’s OHCHR, and said that the tally of abuse should not be counted from 24 February this year, when Russia launched its latest offensive on Ukraine, but should also take into account the previous eight years where she claims pro-Russian elements in the east of Ukraine were abused by the government in Kyiv.

Here we go! I've theorized that M2 Bradley is a __FAR__ more important vehicle than M1 Abrams tank for Ukraine.

M2 Bradley is an IFV, infantry fighting vehicle. Its primary goal is to provide infantry support. Squads can load / unload from the vehicle. Squads can shoot from inside the vehicle. A rocket-launcher (including Javelin-like systems) and small 30mm auto-cannon equip the main armament.

30mm autocannon is not a tank gun. But its a big gun, far bigger than any infantry can reasonably use. Because of its relatively small size (for a vehicle), it can fire 600+ rounds-per-minute (10 shots per second), more than enough firepower for any infantry related task.

10-shots per second of a huge ~~30mm~~ 25mm round each is also more useful than 1-tank shot every 5+ seconds, like from a proper M1 Abrams.

And yes, 30mm is pretty big. Here's 30mm (M2 Bradley) vs 5.56mm (typical pistol) (EDIT: I mean 25mm, whatever.. 25mm is close to 30mm): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber#/media/File:30mmvs556nato.jpg

The rounds are smaller (allowing the M2 Abrams to store hundreds-and-hundreds of shots). M1 Abrams only has ~50 shots (because the tank shell is just so freaking big). The chaingun still has fancy features: airburst and other such features. The rocket allows it to kill tanks (though not as well as a proper tank can).

M2 Bradley is a beast. I hope Ukraine actually gets it.",1672355601.0,1672354871.0,t3_zxv3mw,t3_zxv3mw,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

Also regarding size of the attack - cruise missiles were only a part of the attack. Around 70 Kalibrs and Kh-55/101s were detected but around 6 Kh-22, a few dozens of S-300. And again the attack had an escort of tactical aviation and Kh-31 anti radar missiles were used. 

So yes - we have reports of 70 cruise missiles, but total number of missiles launched was over a 100. 

It's interesting composition as usually the navy launches 24 Kalibrs. It would mean that ALCMs were just less than 50 this time and there were two waves of them, so even in 1:3 ratio of decoys to live ordnance it would mean they used just 36 Kh-101. 
Monthly production of this missile is less than 50 (last reports were saying about 30). So we will probably see a similar composition of attacks every 2-3 weeks.",False,1672314705.0,t3_zxv3mw,t1_j23cj3w,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

The way an AA missile works (in almost all types, with a few exceptions) is that it tracks onto the target, then points itself directly in the direction of the target as it gets near, then detonates by proximity, iow a few tens of feets away from the target. The explosion is shaped like a forwards expanding cone of shrapnel. 

&nbsp;

This way you have an expanding wall of shrapnel heading directly in the direction of the target. Its the easiest way to ensure a hit.
Effectively this makes it possible for the missile to always ensure the explosion is facing onto the target regardless of how it approaches the target, as it can even do last minute course corrections to respond to evasive manouvers to point its head back onto the target.

&nbsp;

With an AA shell, you'd need more accurate and constant target aquisition from the gun battery (which also puts it at risk of counterfire due to its radar emitting signals) and more advanced real-time calculation to ensure the shell ends up pointing in the direction of the target as it releases its explosive cone, and there's no chance of course correction other than having a constant release of shells.

&nbsp;

Its doable, and the ammunition is cheaper, but it poses higher risk to the shooters and takes more advanced equipment on the gun vehicle.

This is from the Mueller Report:

>Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a ""backdoor"" way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate Trump's assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.

It is good comedy.  Lets just say they do not draw the same conclusion that you did.  

Also it is 25mm cannon not 30mm.  Tow missiles not Javelin.  200 rpm is more common than 600 rpm for the bushmaster machine gun.  That is overkill anyway.  The M2 has a regular machine gun that shoots 7.62 rounds at a higher rate.  25mm rounds are a bit pricey/heavy to use as a spray.  Though i do remember news clips where it looked like US soldiers were doing that. 

Whether or not the M2 is a dream machine none of it is compatible with Ukrainian parts.  Different fuel, different caliber ammunition, different engine.  Maybe they can work out the logistics. 

Just for fun lets call out for comment from any US Marines (or US Army, allies).  See what they think of: 

>cut half of the Marine Corps M1 Abrams numbers and substitute with M2 Bradleys.

I have never been to Ukraine but i am confident the power lines come in sets of three.  There might be a fourth or fifth thinner wire which is a ground wire and does not count.

tl;dr by me: there are 4 kinds of guilt, applied differently with different kinds of responsibility.

First is the ""criminal"" guilt - on those who killed, who raped, who gave the orders and others directly responsible for the atrocities. This one does not apply to your citizen.

Second is the ""political"" guilt, or guilt by association. The associated punishment is not as harsh as prison, but real nevertheless. Applies to your citizen. Manifests in Russians not being trusted for decades to come, banned from international efforts, etc. I have relatives in Russia, to whom I send a Christmas card every year. This year the card came back due to Canada Post suspending service to Russia. My aged relatives do not support the war directly, yet guilty enough to not get a Christmas card.

There are 2 more kinds of guilt. One of them applies to me - I did not do enough to prevent Russian's crimes. There is no punishment for this one, just the weight on one's consciousness. But it exists.

Russia is the country, that spent the most time learning how to suppress any opposition. At this point, only truly massive dissatisfaction with the govenrment, that would lead to widespread and massive unrest, could change something.

To answer your question - it's complicated. They all have some responsibility for the actions of their government, but they have few tools to effectively influence them. That's why I don't blame Russians as much as others do for their passivity.

A government cannot function without the active participation of their citizens.  

Half the function of a tyrannical government is convincing people there's nothing they can do, so they may as well just do what they are told.

Enough of the population of Russia supports this war to enable their government to keep functioning and keep producing all the material necessary to keep the war ongoing.

But the support required for transporting and maintaining them are very high level logistics, and you could get a lot more Bradleys out of the amount of logistics than you could tanks.

He clearly follows the war closely, so I figure there are 3 reasonable explanations for the timing of his thread:

1. The region was just on his mind for some reason. Coincidences happen.
1. The island was on his mind because Russia had been shipping Ukrainians there for what is effectively slave labor (they take their passports, etc)
1. He had some insider knowledge that something was about to go down out there.

There have been several of those coincidences. That's just one example. He is either very, very good at reading tea leaves, or he has some level of insider knowledge.

Antiaircraft guns can still be very, very effective, and have surprisingly good range.  Anti-missile defense isn't just 20mms; 35mms (Gepard, Oerlikon), 76mms (Oto Melaras) and 127s (US ones) are common.  After WW2 the US introduced *autoloading radar guided 8in gun turrets* on the USS Salem\*.\*  And self-detonating fuses are a given on every shell, since even the first VT fuses' later versions.

Even WW2 AAA was actually very accurate, it's why bombers flew so high, moved around so much in flight (hence all the wild puffs; bombers would change altitude/heading repeatedly so that the AAA had to guess where they'd be or just saturate really wide areas.  If they didn't...well look at Japanese air attack loss rates against US naval formations.  Every attack was basically a suicide attack whether or not they were intended as such; 50-75% casualty rates in 1942, up to 95+%).  When radar and good autoloaders got added, it got much, much worse, and modern tactics for missiles against gun-defended targets is to send entire waves to try to overwhelm them.

This is a subject I was quite curious about and looked into, and was **floored** at how capable the tech of the time was.  Missiles are just light and have insane range if the target can be spotted and tracked; a modern Stinger has the range of a decent-size AAA gun and is, currently, so incredibly dirt cheap for Ukraine they can expend them at will.  The issue is coverage area, but it's definitely not accuracy, and even if it was, shells are cheap and can be easily coordinated for coverage.

^(Come to think of it, the engineer brain in me says that with proper software, you could use 155mm howitzers to shoot down high altitude missiles probably.)

^(edit: for a bit of context, the guns of WW2 battleships and their fire control systems were seen as accurate enough that when they were reactivated for the 80s and 90s, they weren't upgraded because they couldn't be improved.  If you get deep into the physics of the problems, the only real advancements since were A being able to realtime simulate the shells instead of tables, B barrel distortion calculation, C being able to, in some rare cases, evaluate meteorological data from multiple layers of the atmosphere, which is essential for extreme long-range gunnery over very high arcs, and D reduction in stepsize of runge-kutta.  Barrel distortion calculation wasn't even added on modern tanks until the 70s or 80s, and C is a very modern advancement that may not be even integrated now into ballistic computational models.  For example, most CIWS guns just guess when they start, then track their own shells in radar, and try to ""walk"" their shots on target.)

For vehicles and equipment, the GC rules are mostly written so that you can't disguise military vehicles as ambulances, red cross vehicles, or civilian traffic to conduct an attack. This is the GC breakdown of Perfidy which might be the closest, but I can't see it matching the four clauses:

>  (a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;

>  (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;

>  (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and

>  (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.


But there are other treaties and coverings of perfidy which are more open:

>Article 37(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I provides:
Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.

If you could argue that a ground SAM operator, had reason of good faith not to act, as his confidence to act had been betrayed by an adversary, and then that adversary used that good faith to act against him. That could well constitute perfidy. I could see using an incorrect IFF as an issue in that regard.

If it constitutes a 'Ruse of War' then that would be allowed, and that covers:

> camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation. 

Now if you were to define an IFF signal to be an 'Emblem of nationality', then this would apply:

> It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations.


My gut feeling is that using an enemy IFF to breach confidence to act and then attack would be a violation of protocol 1's definition of perfidy via the wording of the IHL.

 >The United States invasion of Grenada began at dawn on 25 October 1983. The United States and a coalition of six Caribbean nations invaded the island nation of Grenada, 100 miles (160 km) north of Venezuela. Codenamed Operation Urgent Fury by the U.S. military, it resulted in military occupation within a few days. It was triggered by the strife within the People's Revolutionary Government which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada Maurice Bishop, and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with Hudson Austin as Chairman.
 
**[United States invasion of Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama)** 
 
 >The United States invasion of Panama, codenamed Operation Just Cause, lasted over a month between mid-December 1989 and late January 1990. It occurred during the administration of President George H. W. Bush and ten years after the Torrijos–Carter Treaties were ratified to transfer control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama by January 1, 2000. The primary purpose of the invasion was to depose the de facto Panamanian leader, General Manuel Noriega. He was wanted by the United States for racketeering and drug trafficking.

There's no good reason for a properly supplied and disciplined army to gather like this.  The problem is that the Russian army is neither properly supplied or disciplined.  

The officers don't care that the recent conscripts, convicts, and non-Russians are being slaughtered.  In fact, they support it.  Russians have been systematically eliminating native populations within Russia for hundreds of years and most of the conscripts come from these native populations. This is just part of a long reaching scheme.

To that end, the Russian military did not give their conscripts proper gear to stay warm in the freezing Ukraine winter.

>In January 2019, Manafort's lawyers submitted a filing to the court in response to the accusation that he had lied to investigators. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is believed to be linked to Russian intelligence. The filing says Manafort gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him.\[114\] In a hearing on February 7, 2019, prosecutors speculated that Manafort had concealed facts about his activities to enhance the possibility of his receiving a pardon. They said that Manafort's work with Ukraine had continued and he met with Gates, and also with Kilimnik, in an exclusive New York cigar bar. Gates said the three left the premises separately, each using different exits.\[115\]

If you look at what he wast convicted for it's pretty dry stuff:

>Manafort was found guilty on eight counts (covering filing false tax returns, bank fraud, and failing to disclose a foreign bank account), but a mistrial was declared on the remaining ten counts due to a single juror harboring reasonable doubts.\[9\]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II  
  
Even though it was a hugely terrible event estimated to have killed 25,000 people, “ *the German government ordered its press to publish a falsified casualty figure of 200,000 for the Dresden raids, and death tolls as high as 500,000 have been claimed* “.  Also, somewhat ironically in today’s world, the justification for the raid was to support the Soviet advance in the east - the western allies were concerned about that getting stalled.  

And I didn’t know this until I read the article but apparently “ *The US Air Force Historical Division wrote a report in response to the international concern about the bombing that remained classified until December 1978.  It said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the German war effort at the time of the raid* “   That seems like the type of report which would’ve been better to declassified earlier since the common view of the Dresden raid is that it was primarily against non-combatant citizens who weren’t really doing anything to support the war effort.
  
Not to over-quote that report, but it also said “ *that two of Dresden's traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east–west along the central European uplands.  The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines.  Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that ""I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russian* “.",False,1672332542.0,t3_zxv3mw,t1_j2423gb,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia may be incompetent at fighting wars, but that's because foreign countries were never really the threat to Putin and his regime - internal dissent was. 

Much more important than sheer numbers, I think, is the ability to organize. If Russians were able to organize and coordinate actions against the government safely and without them knowing about it, it would only require a small number. As it is, though, widespread coordination is impossible. They watch all the telegram groups, social media, and I wouldn't be surprised if they can even monitor secret telegram chats / conversations for key words. That's why protest organizers like Vesna operate outside Russia. 

But speaking of Vesna, the second most important thing for effective protests, still more than numbers, is being able to trust the leadership and people who organize them. It's widely speculated here in Petersburg that Vesna is just an FSB operation, and there are good reasons to think so. The organization of protests for the last few years have been abysmally bad - picking several different locations that are convenient or easy for police to quickly set up shop and pick off arriving protestors one by one, and also by congratulating protestors as heroes and saying they've done everything they can even when a group wasn't wasn't able to form and grew like max to a few dozen people large. They don't seem all that serious about effective protests, or smart about it. And more's the point that it's hard to trust or risk your life for someone sitting comfortably in a foreign country. 

Essentially, the problem I see with unrest in Russia is lack of ability to coordinate, and lack of leaders who people will rally behind and risk themselves. Navalny came the closest to that, but we all know what happened to him. Unless these issues can be overcome, or the military moves against the government (next to zero chance), it's basically completely pointless and ineffective to protest, especially when 90 plus percent of the population don't even care, or will even cheer as you get dragged off to prison or the frontline",False,1672324720.0,t3_zxv3mw,t1_j23svon,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

It's kind of dumb, and the only advantage is if one is trying to use economies of scale in manufacturing missiles; which might be advantageous.

I do not know anyone in USA who became pro-Sadaam Hussein.  Between 2003 and 2008 there was a decisive shift from war support to war opposition.    Even in '04 the resentment was starting to show.",False,1672363701.0,t3_zxv3mw,t1_j268fzs,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

They did ring the alarms last minute, which is evident by Ukrainian air planes evading targeted missile strikes.

>General Budanov outlined his nightmare vision of a Russian invasion that would begin with airstrikes and rocket attacks aimed initially at ammunition depots and trench-bound troops.
