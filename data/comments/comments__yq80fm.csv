> One woman, Natasha from NTV, told me so pathetically: ""What right do you have to talk about Stalingrad?!"" 

> “Because my own grandfather defended Stalingrad—that's why. He participated in the most brutal battles, at the tractor factory. I am proud of him. As a man, as a warrior.”

> ""And how would your grandfather, who fought against Nazism, react to the fact that..."" she continued.

> “You know, my grandfather would be very shocked that Russia attacked Ukraine. But, probably, he would have said: ‘Well done, grandson, protect the homeland!’""

He explains that intellectuals and academics and propagandaists were sent—they’d read his dissertation! He thoughtfully engaged with them, and as a result, he and the guys stopped being beaten. 

> “Of course, they wanted to convince me [that we’re Nazis]They also wanted to understand why I am like that. Why does Russian propaganda, on which crazy money is spent, not work on Ukrainians?

> They came to Olenivka with a clear task—to show a ‘stubborn Nazi.’ In their imagination, this is a person who squints, is covered in tattoos and is not very smart. I don't have any tattoos (smiles), in discussions I presented counterarguments, behave respectfully. Therefore, I became not very interesting for propagandists. 

*he then shares something that seems like a deleted scene from Shawshank*:

> Once an FSB officer, who was interested in talking to me, came with two books by Buzyna and asked: ""Why did you kill him?"" I say, “we didn't kill him. It's not up to us. Besides, he would’ve been interesting to talk to. Okay, I'll take it to read, "" I continue. "" But if you give us the Ukrainophobe Buzyna, give me the Ukrainophobe Bulgakov. Do you want to instill in us a love for Russian literature? Give Tolstoy, for example. But not Leo, but Oleksiy—he is more interesting—Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin, Walking on Torment.

> The FSBnik saw that I was not such a ""stubborn Nazi"" as he would like to think. And it was clear to me: yes, now they will not beat, they want to talk because they are interested.

He got 40 books for his guys to read in captivity, although, he points out, some of them were the Russians trolling.  They trolled back, but because the Russians hadn’t even read their Russian books, they didn’t realize it. 

He was stubborn in his beliefs, though:
> “How can we accept the fact that we do not have the right to individuality, to our self? There will be problems until Russians recognize our right to be different. As long as they will consider us ‘one people,’ we will have problems.”

> I asked them, ""Why did you need this war? You could have bought our beloved politicians—they were mostly corrupt.  You’ve bought our politicians for years, and now you decide to break the nation.  Impose your paradigm. But Ukrainians organically do not accept it, won’t see things your way. When something is imposed on them, they start to rebel. Maidan begins. That’s what you’ll have.”",1667979164.0,1667976357.0,t3_yq80fm,t3_yq80fm,,0,138,0,138,0,0,

One batch of complaints involved the third set of contractors hired to hide the massacre at the Drama Theatre (first batch couldn’t remove the bodies, initially too precarious, then people saw children, photographed the removal, and ordered to stop; second batch ordered to construct *over* the bones of the dead—but they weren’t paid, couldn’t secure the materials, left). The third batch of contractors complained that they were ordered to bulldoze over the dead, then lay concrete/cement of their remains, but the putrid smell of the dead seeped through layers of concrete. It was decided the lingering odor was untenable. 

These contractors have all returned to Russia, and told about the cementing-over of the dead, and that the smell lingered.

Now, the fourth round of contractors are on scene, to desecrate the remains once again. It’s possible that they will revert to trying to remove the remains.

Day 259 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day; we had no missile strikes or drones, just a couple of uneventful air raid alerts. Yesterday just as I posted, saying that everything was quiet; we actually had a new air raid alert start almost immediately after, and missiles were launched from Belgorod too, but we don’t know where they went, no explosions were reported anywhere afterwards.

Today was definitely an important day, Russians retreating from Kherson is amazing news, and while the situation is still pretty uncertain, more and more towns are starting to go back under our control in Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts by the hour, so I don’t think they are lying about running away this time. 

Abandoning Kherson is a huge loss for them, which is why Russians are crying all over their social media about betrayal. It was the only “win” they had in this war, it was the only regional center city that they managed to capture (and they only managed to do it because of our traitors), so them running away without even fighting for it is pretty surprising. 

I didn’t think they would kill Stremousov either; it was definitely not an accident. Who would even believe that a Russian-appointed official would have an accident on the day Russians announce their sudden retreat from the place that he was running? It just shows what they think about our traitors that switched to their side. They don’t intend to let those puppets live once they become useless to them. It’s a mystery to me why would anyone betray their own country to go work for the Russians of all people. They don’t even care about their own people, so why do they think that Russians would care about some traitor?

Further, he had aligned with the GRU in the internal FSB-GRU conflict for control in Kherson earlier in the war, but was provided security by the FSB, but with the city no longer under their command, he’s disposable.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 09 November

- Russian efforts to repair the Crimean Bridge continue but it is unlikely to be fully operational until at least September 2023. On 8 November the road bridge was due to be closed to allow the movement and installation of a replacement 64-metre span. Three more spans will be required to replace the damaged road sections.

- Although Crimean officials have claimed these additional spans will be in place by 20 December, a briefing provided to President Putin added that works to the other carriageway would cause disruption to road traffic until March 2023.

- Replacement of the damaged rail bridge has been contracted for completion by September 2023, although Russia's Deputy Prime Minister stated the repair timeline would be expedited. One track is open, but rail transport remains restricted. Repair activity will be heavily dependent on weather conditions through the winter months.

- The Crimean bridge attack has disrupted Russian logistics supplies for Crimea and southern Ukraine, reducing Russia's ability to move military equipment and troops into the area by rail or road. The damage to the bridge, the recent attack on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and the probable withdrawal from Kherson all complicate the Russian government's ability to paint a picture of military success.",False,1667980339.0,t3_yq80fm,t3_yq80fm,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

c6bd60b5ef54fbab17f27a93e46f384e,yq80fm,ivotlf4,"Here's a scenario for a new  ""The Hangover"" movie.

The gang gets back together for a new trip in Finland. They get drunk once again and wake up in an alley. First Phil wakes up and discover Phil sleeping in a trash container. Stu is wearing some fur coat and Doug as always is missing. Then a phone ring and a woman is screaming asking where the hell they are. They eventually all leave the alley to realize they're next to the red square.

Then suddenly someone notice them and tell them they're lucky he found them first. They head back to the woman screaming on the phone. There they find out videos on a phone that remained in the flat they were. At first it's doug getting an Ukrainian trident tattoo on the chest. Then they got in a fight between Russians and Ukrainians. And the last video is how Doug is leaving with Ukrainians guys as they were crossing the border to Russia.

The woman starts to explain what she remember but gets interrupted as police officers knock the door down and starts arresting everyone. But at this point, Alan starts speaking in perfect Russia with the police officers and then very politely free the gang and asks them to follow him. Later Alan explains that his family was in fact Russian spies all along and his real name is in fact Ilya and his sister is Tatianna and Doug is in fact married to a Russian sleeping agent. When asked what he told to the officer, he quietly tell them that he told the police officer that he has been gathering a team and they're ready for an assignment.

The gang is being sent to Donbass given basically nothing to survive and thrown in the forest. Alan starts to explain that his PTSD really originate from his training as a child. 

They all starts moving as they don't have much to survive very long. Then Alan remembers he forgot to tell them that the Ukrainians guys they met in Finland were in fact Ukrainian soldiers and Doug got convinced to join the international legion. 

Bomb start raining from the sky. They run away and eventually reach a Russian defence line that tell them that if they will shot deserters. Stu starts to argue with a soldier and they all started to get very stressed... but at some point they can hear Mr. Chow from afar. Mr. Chow proceed to take his friends with him as soldiers were forced to bow down their weapons. 

When asked Mr. Chow what the hell he was doing there... He told them he was doing business in Russia as a weapons trafficker. When he's being told that Doug is likely on the Ukrainian side of the conflict. He tells them that if they go by foot, they'll become minced meat. But they're lucky because he received a new batch of shahed-136  he'll attach them to a plane and program a route to get them somewhere to parachute from the sky. 

As they fly toward the Ukrainian side of the conflict, they get shot at by anti-air. They're all forced to jump and eventually land in a village that got apparently just freed. Alan which apparently is also fluent in Ukrainian explain that his mother is in fact Ukrainian and they landed not far from where he used to live as a child. They get to a house and meet with an old woman that apparently still remember Alan as a child. They proceed to show the picture of Doug. Suddenly she starts crying and kiss/hug all of the guys and point to a direction.

They move from village and village with everyone with more or less the same reaction... But as they moved, the sound of fight was also intensifying. They start crossing path with soldiers and when shown the picture of Doug everyone starts to scream out of joy laugh and point to a direction. House would have Doug's face painted here and there in every village they got through.

It's still in the morning and there's a bit of fog. Doug can be seen coming out of nowhere with a group of soldiers looking like Che Guevara. Doug then reveal that he was in fact a URSS sleeping agent that was tracking other sleeping agent. He also was from Ukraine but never wanted to bother's Alan family by reminding them about their old history.

So, surprisingly, this war is already more than twice as deadly per capita day as WWI. Wow, that's depressing.

-----

In WWI, it was a combination of both battlefield realities and domestic politics that lead to earnest negotiation which unfortunately lead to the Treaty of Versailles.

All wars end in negotiation, even if the only thing to negotiate about is what will eventually happen to this pile of rubble.

Gopnik definition from Wikipedia:
A gopnik (Russian: гопник, romanized: gopnik, pronounced [ˈɡopnʲɪk]; Ukrainian: гопник, romanized: hopnyk; Belarusian: гопнік, romanized: hopnik)[1] is a member of a delinquent subculture in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and in other former Soviet republics — a young man (or a woman, a gopnitsa) of working-class background who usually lives in Russian suburban areas[2] and comes from a family of poor education and income.[3] The collective noun is gopota (Russian: гопота). The subculture of gopota has its roots in working-class communities in the late Russian Empire and gradually emerged underground during the later half of the 20th century in many cities in the Soviet Union,[4][5] but it was in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, during the collapse of the Soviet Union and its associated rise in poverty that saw the gopota subculture truly come to fruition and flourish.[6] These years - between the late 1980s and roughly 2001 - were the time when the gopota subculture was at its greatest extent, though it remained prevalent, albeit in decline, throughout much of the former Soviet space into the 2000s. As of the late 2010s, the subculture has faded for the most part, although youth gangs (such as the A.U.E.) that resemble gopota still exist in Russia and in other Slavic and Baltic countries.",False,1668030636.0,t3_yq80fm,t1_ivqixbm,,3,10,0,10,0,0,

Trump won the district, which propelled Boebert to her seat.  Like I said, it's a fairly wealthy district, so they are almost always going to go for the folks who want to cut their taxes.

The other thing I think totally sunk her is the fact that very few of those folks support the GOP's stances on social issues. Wanting to ban abortion, for example, is not something I believe those folks support.  To top it off, the issues that the GOP strongly pursued during the midterms are issues that the wealthy folks of that district are largely insolated from.  People leave their shit unlocked and have never even heard of a crime happening up there.
