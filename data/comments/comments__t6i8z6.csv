In a statement posted on Facebook, the ministry said the Zaporizhzhya NPP and Chernobyl NPP are currently under the control of Russian armed forces.

As a result of the shelling on the territory of the (Zaporizhzhya) nuclear power plant, a fire broke out, killing and injuring several people. The fire has now been extinguished.

It warned that if the cooling of the nuclear fuel within the Zaporizhzhya plant is disturbed, it could cause radioactive damage and have “irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment”.

The ministry added that it was disappointed by the reaction of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and demanded “clear and decisive action” from the UN atomic agency.

Even if Russia takes Ukraine, its going to be the richest / largest insurgency there ever was. Russia will continue to bleed resources making this whole invasion nothing but a huge net loss.

Sanctions applied are going to make it extremely hard to replace all of their lost military hardware...coupled by a massive brain drain in their society.

I think of most us here who cheer for Ukraine, who want them to win, are still being realists. We know very well that Ukraine is in an extremely tough spot, that things are extremely crappy. 
But we have to also look at Russia's failures and appreciate them.

I thought I'd share from an eastern perspective why Ukraine isn't just ready to roll over and admit defeat, even in the face of ""Russia is big and can just keep throwing their men and equipment at them"". 
So many here don't seem to know history of Eastern Europe in 20th century - which is perfectly acceptable - so let me recap it very quickly. 

WWII in Europe for many means D-Day, Holocaust, fall of Berlin and death of Hitler. WWII for Eastern Europe meant being invaded both by Soviets and Nazis, sometimes multiple times, and being punished - killed, deported, raped, drafted into the army - for it every time the power changed. If the Nazis forcibly drafted you, you could bet that Soviets would send you to prison in Siberia for collaborating and vice versa. There were no good guys - the Nazis were bad, the Soviets were bad, nobody was our ""saviour"" even if people thought so in the beginning. 

The reason you all see Eastern European states doing everything they can for Ukraine (just short of actual military intervention) is because we lived in a crappy hell for 50 years, watching as the W-Europe and W-Germany prospered and enjoyed their freedoms, while we either had nothing or had to live with getting glimpses, being denied everything ""normal"". Anecdote, but: bananas were very coveted and you hardly ever got any here, so plenty of people, who managed to travel abroad, would buy bananas with the little exchange currency they had, to bring back home as a gift for themselves and family. East Germany and Czechoslovakia were seen as ""the west"" by us, so-much-so that we joked that we could ""smell the free air"" due to the nearness of W-Germany and W-Europe and clothing, furniture, electronics from those countries were seen as ""the good stuff"".  

USSR wasn't North Korea, but nobody with a sound mind and westernised outlook wants to return to that fold, and Russia looks increasingly more like USSR 2.0. Many of us lost our independence BECAUSE we didn't fight back in WWII, or because we thought that we would be helped by our allies and we weren't, or the agreements formed (Yalta) preferred the large powers and left us out of the decisions that were made about us.

Ukraine is fighting because it has no other choice, however stupid it seems to many people who compare Russia's numbers and Ukraine's numbers. By not rolling over, Ukrainians have already pissed Russia off and  it may be a question of die fighting or die because you will be considered the enemy of the public by Russian authorities if they should take over your country. Many here do not believe that Russia would publicly execute someone or that Russia wouldn't start just killing civilian population. Well - they did it in Chechnya; they also bombed their own people in an apartment block to have an excuse to invade Chechnya. Russia doesn't want Ukraine for nothing more than for some stupid made-up reason; they will not care for its people, its land, its culture, its language. They will, however, repress all of those. It will be a strangled suffocated ""hands tied behind your back"" peace that can come if Ukraine is ""given"" to Russia, with a guerilla war happening for the next two decades, and millions, maybe even ten or more, refugees escaping from Ukraine.

""A woman died in one house, they didn't even find her body, only her hand,"" one of the locals told the staff.

Stomatová and the cameraman visited the bombed-out village of Yakovlivka. It is located on the Moldovan border near Odessa. ""At night, it became the target of an air raid. Everything is destroyed here. About 600 people live here. So far, we have information that at least four people should have died,"" said reporter of the CNN Prima NEWS

""We also asked the people in Sokolov, which is not far from us, why the Russians could have headed to this place when there are no military facilities. We have not confirmed this, but there should have been diversionists who said that the Ukrainian army was located in this place. But at the time of the attack, there were no more soldiers, ""Stomatová explained.

""We can hardly see anyone here. There are no rescuers who would pull people out of the rubble, for example. We see craters here. According to locals who have friends and acquaintances here, the pressure wave swept away six to seven houses at the time of the crash. We see that to be true. The devastation, which is huge, ""said Stomatová.

They only found a hand

The CNN Prima NEWS staff went through the whole village. ""There was a grave silence at the beginning of it, but here is something going on"" the reporter continued, who also spoke to the locals. ""It was an air raid. They are vacuum bombs. A woman died in one house, they didn't even find her body, only her hand. The man didn't survive either"" one local shared the terrible experiences.

The village is also working to restore power lines. ""At least today we will try to save part of the power line. We will continue to work in the coming days,"" said the repairman.

“Almost every house has a cellar where you can hide. The problem is that no one in Yakovlivka could have guessed that there would be a raid, even though the front was some 50 kilometers away. People couldn't be ready. What we also found in Sokolov, they don't even have a siren there. They hear explosions and only that is a sign for them to hide in the shelter,"" said Stomatová.

The loop is tightening

The Russians are also in the city of Balakleja. ""About 30 to 40 kilometers from the towns of Sokolov and Zmijov is the town of Balakleja, where Russian soldiers are at the moment. As far as I have information, the Russians drove into the city on tanks. The mayor said he would not cooperate with them. At the moment, the soldiers are allegedly looting, but they are leaving the civilians alone,"" said Stomatová.

""The mood here is absolutely indescribable. We asked about the moods of the people in Sokolov and said that the worst thing is the uncertainty and how the loop is starting to shrink around them and they will be another target of attacks, ""the reporter added.

Remember I am a human being, inhabiting this earth, breathing oxygen just like you. Any SANE person, would be heavily against what is happening in Ukraine Right now. 

The rest who condone it? They are sick, insane animals and there is no saving them - they are brainwashed beyond repair and not human. 
We protest? We’re beaten & arrested, we vote? Our votes are burnt. 
The final straw for me was when Putin decriminalised domestic violence, I knew my future babies could never be safe in a country where basic human rights are not prohibited. I was a lucky one who got out when I did.

Just because I was spat out onto the patch of land called Russia does not mean I am a Putin fan. 

It’s an oxymoron for the very people to be against the war and xenophobia to wish death & such things on innocent Russian people. It makes no sense. 
The views of Putin to not equate the the whole 40 million + population, that’s barbaric to say and makes no sense. 


A good 60% of us Russians are related to Ukrainians, killing them is like killing our own.

What happens if a nuclear plant is bombed?

If it's **OFF/ON STANDBY:** This is what would be ""expected"" if a reactor is in a war zone. Here the control rods are fully in the reactor and fission is NOT occurring. Fission isn't just an explosion, it's a critical balance of splitting atoms and collecting the thermal energy as they do so. If this process is not happening when the disturbance (bomb, fire, ect) it can not begin as a result. This would be at worst a large dirty bomb, blowing the material in the core out but NOT a nuclear process, just a conventional explosion with some nasty ash

If its **ON:** This is worst case. Ukraine uses PWR type reactors (Pressurized Water Reactors) where the water is pressurized to control the amount of heat it can carry while remaining liquid. This is important because if pressure is lost, the water is hot enough to become steam on the spot. So if an explosion were to breach the core of the reactor, all of the piping would detonate as the water instantly turned to steam. This would lead to a massive heat surge in the core, and possible meltdown if fission was already occurring in the reactor. Bad bad bad",False,1646401783.0,t3_t6i8z6,t3_t6i8z6,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

* Russia is censoring all media in order to maintain support from the Russian people
* Criminalizing opposing speech regarding the war in order to maintain support
* Originally planned this invasion as a low-risk, quick turn around engagement

Putin isn't insane, he's just evil and is sacrificing others in an attempt to save his dying country.  Creating a situation where everything he is killing others to gain is wiped out, is certainly not in his best interest.

If NATO engages and Putin uses nukes, he knows he has one shot.  US intel knows exactly where he is at all times as well as the inner workings of his command and control infrastructure.  The retaliation will be swift and result in the complete destruction of Putin, his regime and any hopes of Russia ever re-establishing itself as a world superpower. 

Granted, there would be significant NATO casualties assuming his warheads aren't shot down, but there is a clearly a tipping point where that risk becomes viable.  The longer civilian casualties continue to stack up in Ukraine, the closer NATO gets to that point and they will engage.

Nuclear weapons are terrifying and anyone advocating any action that increases the chances of these being used is a complete moron. They aren't like other weapons. The suffering they cause is immeasurable.

Bear in mind this has a bit of specificity to the comment but my overall tone is that we shouldn't be so quick to think that the two events lining up mean anything.  I am still of the opinion those captured plans were designed to be short-lived and updated later in the first place and the supposed opening of the market has no bearing on what was planned for Ukraine militarily.  

""They're just going to delay the opening again.  It was supposed to open Wednesday, then Thursday, then today.  Well, let me rephrase, the thought was it was going to open because they were taking it on a day-by-day basis and announcing each evening before that they were going to be closed the next day.  So the assumption was it was closed Wednesday but would probably open Thursday, and then it closed yesterday with the assumption it would open today, etc.  According to those battle plans (but are they real is the question?  As in are they not purposely planted or only short-lived plans meant to detail the initial phase of the invasion), yes, the invasion would have been finished this coming week, and successfully.  Which does tie into the opening of the market.  

However, I have to really question the validity of those plans, honestly.  No military operation that I am aware of, apart from the Blitzkrieg of Poland during WWII has been that quick that was designed to topple an entire country.  While Russia's military is filled with people who like to cozy up to Putin to avoid his wrath, surely someone would have thought to themselves that this is going to take a heck of a lot longer than that.  Even the war in Chechnya (battle of Grozny) took a couple of months and that was against basically just one main city (I am oversimplifying a bit).

That's why I am thinking those plans were fakes or were meant to be changed out once things started to fall into place and new plans released.  For instance, let's take the D-Day landings.  NCOs and officers on the ground were probably not given specific battle plans of where they needed to walk them through how to take Paris, then spread out into the Netherlands, Poland, and Germany.  Their initial plans would have been ""okay, storm the beaches, give them hell and push them back to these known choke points in these towns.  We will update as needed based on the outcomes of the other landings, but you need to have all your attention here and this immediate area to neutralize the threats so we can continue bringing the forces in.""

Of course this is a gross oversimplification on my part, but you get the drift.  The overall plan was obviously to topple the German army, but the immediate short term plans would not have been that detailed to go all the way to Germany and knock on 101 Hitler Lane in Berlin asking for the keys to the army and for him to step down.""",False,1646399220.0,t3_t6i8z6,t3_t6i8z6,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

I was trying to comment before on the fact that this problem would likley not occur if Russia was part of NATO. 

you had enough nations to NATO and you essentially have a declaration of world peace.

My understanding is that in the past Russia wanted to join NATO long before this was happening after the dismantling of the Soviet union. I have heard that it was the world police soda say that discouraged other NATO members from allowing Russia to join.

Likley fuelled by money and the money that could be made off of the Cold War continuing forever. Which apparently it more or less has been.

If Russia was part of NATO what would any NATO states ever have to fear from anyone else? Would they not control 3/5 of the worlds armies and the seven overwhelming majority over any opposing force from any countries that are not part of NATO?

Would a NATO country invade another NATO country? 

Would a NATO country be allowed to invade a non-NATO country?

Stage 1 - send in the conscripts with the out of date cold war era equipment to soften targets

I believe they're establishing up a stream line of equipment to be quickly transported back/forth to the front line.

Stage 3 - the Southern advance will meet up with the Northern forces and fortify their positions all around the city. 

Stage 4 - we'll likely see another massive wave of Russians invading West while Kyiv is under constant bombardment. 

I think the plan here is to get zelensky to surrender in Kyiv and pressuring him to do so while the 'real' advances go west.

Pooter has nukes, yes. He wants Ukraine today. And NATO can't do anything, because nukes. Tomorrow, Pooter still has nukes, and will want Moldova. Again, NATO can't do anything, because nukes. And so on, for Baltic states, central Asian states, etc. And NATO can't do anything, because Pooter still has nukes.

Pooter is already moving nukes to Belarus, which already suffered Ukraine's fate, with a Russian takeover and puppet government. So will all these newly-captured states. Millions are dead, at this point, by the way. Then what happens? Well, Pooter decides he wants Poland and East Germany back. What are you gonna do? He still has nukes. Those exact same nukes that prevented NATO from acting in Ukraine, in Moldova, in Georgia, etc. So they will act, to protect Germany, or Poland or whoever, under the threat of those exact same nukes? If they do, why not do it now? While nukes are still mostly in Russia, and not spread out all over Eastern Europe and central Asia? Because  Pooters ain't gonna stop.

In short, yes, I'd rather have a \*potential\* nuclear conflict, than a \*guaranteed, currently-ongoing\* conventional one. Especially since the currently-ongoing conventional one, where civilians are being murdered and democratically elected leaders are dodging multiple assassination attempts a week.

If these nukes are stopping NATO now, then these same nukes, logically, MUST stop NATO when Poland and Germany get invaded.

Putin has failed on every factor of success. He didn't gain a thing. I am not sure what you think ""empire"" building in the 21st century means, but it isn't like Rome or the Ottomans. Those days are over.

- He pretty much made sure the EU expands and builds out it defenses.

- NATO is going to expand and all the damage done by Trump is fixed in one week.

- 1 million Ukrainians are now going to integrate in western Europe and tie that entire country to the west.

- The Russia military proved it was 3rd rate at best and without Nukes it would be destroyed by any modern integrated military.

- Putin got his Vietnam. This is going to be a very costly occupation. The time to have taken Ukraine was 20 years ago. It doesn't see itself as Russian and this action by Putin just cemented their resolve.

- The Russia economy is done. The sanctions and trade embargoes will cripple Russia.

- Finally Russia is in what is called Terminal Demographic decline. The older generation is larger than the new one. The population is aging and there aren't enough people to fill the roles to grow.

It is 1000% this and ONLY this. I don't think people understand what nuclear war means. Life on this planet ends if NATO and Russia go to a nuclear war. The US would get involve and everyone else with nukes most likely. Once that happens the human race as we know it is over. Billions will die. I can't stress this enough. Life ends on this planet except for a few miserable survivors. There was a military study that was declassified that showed the scenario of MAD nuclear war. The end result is the world population is brought down to a few million with the survivors having a harsh life and subsequent generations suffering from cancer and mutations. So yes, the ONLY thing that matters is not going to nuclear war.

For non-NATO that Russia is interested in - most of these countries, with the exception of Ukraine and Finland (I'm only talking about bordering states right now), are small and have a small population. So presumably, for non-NATO his argument is probably that ""why would anybody care? they're small, weak, not in NATO, not in EU"", because remember - Putin appreciates showing of power, but these states in his eyes and mindset have none. 

For NATO countries, the rational assumption is that he has given up thoughts about these countries, but gladly uses various ways for stirring up shit like flying into their airspace with planes for like 1 minute every week or something like that. The other assumptions some make is that would NATO really come and help if he'd go after one of the smaller NATO states in the Baltics, but this is different now, because pre-2014, NATO had no plans and no equipment, men or vehicles whatsoever in this area, just air policing. That changed with Crimea, so that actually showed that yes, the alliance WOULD care about smaller NATO members too. 

Attacking a NATO state would be irrational, and we have until now assumed that Putin was a rational, albeit completely nuts otherwise, leader. Now some people question his rationality. 

As for would the world actually step up if he goes beyond Ukraine - your guess is as good as ours. If he goes against a NATO state, and if NATO doesn't respond, it is dead. That presumes that someone like Trump doesn't get to hold the presidency, because supposedly he was supposed to announce US leaving NATO during his 2nd term (widely speculated, of course, but he was a russian asset and had grumbled about the point of being in NATO before).

1. Provide even more advanced weapons systems. From more SAM batteries, to planes, to tanks. Ukraine needs more material to win this war. We have been providing arms and trucks, we can and should be doing more there. 
2. Have NATO troops go on “vacation” to Ukraine. I know this is out of the kremlins playbook, but fuck em. This could include a couple of F-16 or F-22 pilots and their planes and the appropriate crew. Seriously if Ukraine can get more planes and air supports this war would be over quickly.

Basically, you shoot down the ICBMs in orbit.  That's a super hard problem though, which is why our tests doing that with normal missiles have been very spotty.  So instead of shooting at the incoming nuke with a missle that has to hit it or get really close, you shoot it with a high yield nuclear warhead of your own and blow up everything at all close to the incoming enemy nuke.

Putin knows this and that’s why he’s so terrified of NATO in the first place - he’s always wanted to invade Ukraine and NATO membership would kill that dream forever. After NATO retakes Ukraine, they will forever prevent him from achieving any of his political aims. Russia will be completely neutered on the world stage until the last of the oligarchs are replaced with democratically elected leaders. 

So what does Putin do, backed into a corner? He lashes out with his last attack. A preemptive strike against his own shame. Nukes. 

3,000, each far bigger than what we dropped on Japan, launched all at once, against every population center in the West. Every city flattened, the sky blotted out for years, billions dead. 

Now he might not do that. It’s suicide, because 3,000 more nukes will fall on Russia as well. But he’s dead anyway - the oligarchs and security state that prop him up will not tolerate his complete and utter failure to protect their money and security or bring glory to their country. He might just be blustering, but what chance are you personally willing to take here?

If you want to bet your life on Putin’s ability to graciously accept defeat, then you might want to avoid casinos.

As others have pointed out, even without nukes, NATO joining in here would definitely change the world’s perception of NATO as a defensive pact. It would escalate Russia which can now claim that he was right all along that NATO expansion is an aggressive move with the ultimate intention of overpowering Russia and its allies.

Realistically Putin is bluffing and he would cower after being beaten back. The issue is that the risk of being wrong is so god damn high.

Everytime someone brings up, but nuclear war, all you're doing is telling the people of Ukraine and those with connections to Ukraine that you don't value them.

Crimea has been historically Russian (empire's, then USSR's, now Russia's) port and vacation area. It holds Sevastopol, which is a very important warm water port for Russia. 
Back in early 2010s, Ukraine was seriously considering no longer leasing the Sevastopol area to Russia, for example. That was discussed back then when there was a chance that Ukraine was going to sign the association agreement with the EU. Of course, the corrupt president at the time happily reverted back to Russia, ditched the AA, signed a cooperative agreement with Russia, and I think also extended the contract for lease for Sevastopol. 

Crimea held Russian armed forces (still does) back then and when the whole thing happened in 2014, Ukrainian forces were in a pitiful state - they were basically overrun, there was little to no resistance. 

Since then Ukraine has been rebuilding and reorganising its army and territorial guard, that's why it's much different this time. 

As for international reaction - there was outrage, but admittedly it wasn't even half as strong as now. First because like I said, Crimea has been often cited as ""Russian"" and it has a history according to which it was ""given"" to Ukraine during USSR. 

And the international community saw that, heard that there were people who spoke Russian there, and pretty much kind of... let it go. The West sanctioned it, but Russia didn't really care and those sanctions were not that strong either. 

The Russian puppet states did shoot down a passenger plane though, and that caused enormous outrage - especially because the puppet leaders had originally thought they had shot a ukrainian cargo plane and gloated about it on Twitter, before quickly taking it down, when it started to emerge that people were walking about wreckage, filming broken suitcases, dead bodies and dead kids, taking pictures of the passports etc. 

But sadly, I must say it sometimes sounds like a lot of people have forgotten that a russian rocket was used to bring down a plane of 240 something people, all of whom died.",False,1646407024.0,t3_t6i8z6,t1_hzbn6sm,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Problem was, Putin must have thought Ukraine would be something like that. In the early days of the invasion Russia was trying to push the story that they were being welcomed as liberators; they're not even trying to push that story anymore.

Taiwan supplies over 90% of the worlds advanced semiconductors. Companies like Apple, AMD, Intel, Nvidia, ARM, all the various OEM's such as Dell and HP, along with just about every car manufacturer depends on Taiwan. 

You think the US, or the rest of the world, would just sit on their hands if China tried to make a move on Taiwan with literally trillions of dollars and the world economy at stake?

If anything, I would be looking at how China is reacting to the Russian economy getting decimated. Their state media may be singing a pro-Russia tune for now but the CCP and Chinese banks certainly don't look like they plan on bailing out Putin any time soon.

I think theis is slightly different in that it is an imperial invasion whereby the threat of nuclear war is heing used to try and prevent any form of western intervention. There is also a geopolitical factor in that Russia is Europe's neighbour, the obvious history and the fact Russia gets far more media attention than other countries (compounded by the economic interlinkages). I think there is a perception at least that allowing Russia to do this sets a dangerous precedent (for example, the expectation of expansion by China into adjouning territories eg India, Taiwan), and there is no doubt there is a subtext that non-democratic countries being invaded isnt as awful as 'free' nation invasion. But I do agree, all of these conflicts are horrific and there is a double standard in the west regarding acceptance of Ukrainian refugees vs acceptance of refugees from Syria for example (unfortunately 9/11 really did mark a colossol global shift toward fear of muslims for many and that fire has been stoked by many politicians for cheap gains over the last 20 years).

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Look, all of these new sanctions are occurring now.  Why now? Why not last month? Why not last year.  Why not in 2014?  Each inch we give to Putin increases the cost to stop him. Putin invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014. There was not enough *political will* for the West to do anything about it, it happened so quickly, and just as quickly was forgotten. 

The reason you see these sanctions now are because the will of the people demand it. They demand it due to the amazing leadership of Zelensky and the courage of the Ukrainian people being put on massive display. Without the incredible fight from the Ukrainian people. There would be no political will. Without political will, the NATO countries would possibly sit by again, providing Putin more confidence and additional power to expand his terror. 

We are now assuming (rightfully so it seems) that arming Ukraine will not sufficiently trigger Putin to cause MAD.  How did we know that?  How do we know engaging Putin will lead to nuclear war?  We are choosing the lower risk option today yet tomorrow will see a higher risk that we may have to pay. Putin likely will not stop until his ultimate goals are met or he is killed. Again a nuance that we cannot confirm or deny. And it is unclear who will lead Russia after Putin. 

So do we continue to minimize risk today to create a larger risk tomorrow?  At what cost?

And what does ""capture"" mean, encircled, moved through, or occupied? Depends who is making the claim. 

Basically social media is giving the impression there is a lot more independent information than there really is because of how quickly a small claim will spread and become the trending news of the hour.

Pretty much since the Tsars it’s been serfs/working class taking the brunt of whatever action the moron in power decided was a brilliant idea. 

Stalin murdered millions of Ukrainians during the Holodomor with his fucked up farming scheme.

The Tsars went into WWI with an underequipped army and got their shit pushed in by Germany, then the army mutinied and the Bolsheviks murdered their way into power.

Once the USSR collapsed under its own weight, there was a grab by the oligarchs to snatch up any industry of value and enrich themselves.

That even though we both remember times being tough, we couldn't say our childhoods were completely horrible, you know?

But her experiences say that people outside of EE - they just don't understand - the immediately presume that anything pre-EU must've been unimaginable hell.

 >Operation Cottage was a tactical maneuver which completed the Aleutian Islands campaign. On August 15, 1943, Allied military forces landed on Kiska Island, which had been occupied by Japanese forces since June 1942. The Japanese, however, had secretly abandoned the island two weeks earlier, and so the Allied landings were unopposed. Allied forces suffered over 313 casualties in total during the operation, due to stray Japanese landmines and booby traps, friendly fire incidents, and vehicle accidents.

Clearly ‘all is fair in war’, but manual labourers have a saying which is ‘worse than a man off’; it means that a worker is such a liability that it would be better that he was not there, rather than having him present.

What is happening in Ukraine now is horrible, but what if 10 years down the line - assuming the dictator lives that long - Russia has rebuilt its army and part of its economy and tries again? This time with better weaponry, lessons learned from this conflict and the will the sustain losses that would make the West quail in its boots to even contemplate. Sure - it might/will lose - but if that costs half of Europe - we're all losers. 

&#x200B;

Russia can and will economically disconnect eventually from the West - the Russian people might suffer, but at this point nobody in their leadership really cares about them. China will supply them with tech in exchange for dirt cheap resources, they will rebuild their military complex and be ready for round 2. Only this time they might not have a buffer state such as Ukraine to go through first.

&#x200B;

Hitting them now makes sense in a way - if Russia won't use nukes as long as we don't invade Russia proper, we can destroy their army and force them to negotiate a peace. Of course, it might also be possible that this triggers WW3 - but if WW3 isn't nuclear then it's going to be a very short war for Russia.

There is no right answer. Part of me wishes NATO did something right for once, but I'm also aware that it might lead to something far more destructive than ""just"" the annihilation of Ukraine.

 [Stages of grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief#Stages_of_grief) 
 
 >Kübler-Ross originally developed stages to describe the process patients with terminal illness go through as they come to terms with their own deaths; it was later applied to grieving friends and family as well, who seemed to undergo a similar process. The stages, popularly known by the acronym DABDA, include: Denial – The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality. Anger – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

I mean, the idea that people *don't* care about those other tragedies in itself doesn't pass the sniff test. The whole reason you can namedrop them and people recognise them is *because* people care, but trying to make them sound equivalent to UKR/RU conflict is... Problematic. Like, what does the commenter want us to do? Send anti-tank weaponry to the slave camps in China, to fight China..? This is not to say one tragedy is greater/lesser than the other, but there is a **stark** difference in ability for our leaders to respond/control the situation there whereas with UKR much of the Westernised world can actually exert control/influence and us wanting the leaders that we elect to *do* something is only a good thing.

And let's assume for a second that the commenter is right, that we care more about this tragedy than others... What exactly would the point be in pointing that out in this thread? Just looking at their comment history for a minute, it's abundantly clear that they're a troll/bought account/useful idiot (at best), and their narrative is *not* 'you should care about other tragedies more, too' but instead they're angling it as 'you should care about this tragedy less'. Let me think for a moment, *who* would want Western demographics to care less about war in Ukraine..?

For me, as a young private citizen, there is just the question that remains which is centered around the fact that the biggest reason for why NATO cant intervene, is the likely result of a nuclear war.

This in turn would also beg the valid question for what happens if Russia indeed invaded a NATO country - if it came to this, would we really see NATO be decisive or would it still try to prevent a conflict because of the threat of nuclear war?

You know what i mean? Putin will always have nukes at his disposal, so it is a very fine line between giving him basically free reign to do what he wants.

Stoltenberg said it in his presser that Putin was warned of severe economic sanctions if he invaded - and he did it anyways. I genuinely do not think that Putin thinks that we, the West, have it in us to meet him head on... and he could be right.

Its not just about Ukraine either, over the years there have been so many instances where Putin acted out of line hut essentially always got away with it because again, people were afraid of his nukes -but this only emboldened him.

""Most of these wargames, such as RAND’s Baltic study, focus on fait accompli, an attack by the Russian government aimed at seizing terrain — then quickly digging in. This creates a dilemma for NATO: launch a costly counter-attack and risk heavy casualties and possibly a nuclear crisis or accept a Russian fait accompli and undermine faith in the credibility of the alliance. Some analysts have argued that these seizures are much more likely to be small in size, limited to one or two towns. While that scenario should, of course, be studied, the concern about the feasibility of a fait accompli in the form of a major invasion still stands.""

Russia will be crushed by these sanctions. We don't need full failure of the Russian government. We just need a partial failure or a coup. 

Don't forget. They went after Nazis. Not Germans. This is the same. Going after Putin and his cronies. Not Russians. 

His cronies are already feeling the burn and know it's solely for Putin's ego this is happening. 

Rich men don't like it when they don't get richer. They have killed before to prevent that from happening. Yet now they are bleeding money. 

I see a possible avenue here where the military or some other arm of the Russian government ousts Putin. Then they can very easily roll back sanctions by saying ""here he is arrest him and try him yourselves."" Then it looks like Russia has been cleansed from the evil.

IPC President Andrew Parsons said the body underestimated the negative reaction to letting Russians and Belarusians compete – even as neutral athletes. The Athletes Village, which Parsons hoped would be a place of harmony, he now depicted as a tinderbox.

A Study of Jewish Identity Politics: ""Gilad Atzmon has written a fascinating and provocative book on Jewish identity in the modern world. He shows how assimilation and liberalism are making it increasingly difficult for Jews in the Diaspora to maintain a powerful sense of their 'Jewishness.' Panicked Jewish leaders, he argues, have turned to Zionism (blind loyalty to Israel) and scaremongering (the threat of another Holocaust) to keep the tribe united and distinct from the surrounding goyim. As Atzmon's own case demonstrates, this strategy is not working and is causing many Jews great anguish. The Wandering Who? should be widely read by Jews and non-Jews alike.""\[48\]  
  
Mearsheimer's endorsement of Atzmon's book was met with accusations of antisemitism by prominent Jewish writers and intellectuals. Alan Dershowitz wrote an article in response, ""Why are John Mearsheimer and Richard Falk Endorsing a Blatantly Anti-Semitic Book?"" It stated that the book ""argues that Jews seek to control the world.""\[49\]  
  
Mearsheimer denied the charges of antisemitism in that he had ""no reason to amend it or embellish"" his blurb\[50\] and defended his position. Writing in regard to the charge by Goldberg that Atzmon is anti-Semitic and, by implication, so is his positive review of Atzmon's book, Mearsheimer responded: ""Atzmon's basic point is that Jews often talk in universalistic terms, but many of them think and act in particularistic terms. One might say they talk like liberals but act like nationalists.... It is in this context that he discusses what he calls the 'Holocaust religion,' Zionism, and Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Again, to be perfectly clear, he has no animus toward Judaism as a religion or with individuals who are Jewish by birth.""\[48\]
