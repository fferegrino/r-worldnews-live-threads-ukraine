04 Jul 2023
Vienna, Austria

Ukraine‚Äôs Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost the connection to its main external power line early this morning, forcing it to rely on recently restored back-up power supplies for the electricity it needs for essential nuclear safety and security functions, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.

The ZNPP‚Äôs sole remaining 750 kilovolt (kV) power line ‚Äì out of four available before the conflict ‚Äì was disconnected at 01:21am local time today. It was not immediately known what had prompted the power cut or how long it would last.

Europe‚Äôs largest nuclear power plant has been experiencing major off-site power problems since the conflict began in early 2022, exacerbating the nuclear safety and security risks facing the site currently located on the frontline.

The disconnection of the 750 kV power line meant the ZNPP had to switch to its only available 330 kV back-up power line for off-site electricity that is required, for example, to pump cooling water for the plant. This 330 kV line was only reconnected to the plant on 1 July after being damaged four months ago.

‚ÄúThis time the plant avoided a complete loss of all external power ‚Äì which has happened seven times previously during the conflict ‚Äì but the latest power line cut again demonstrates the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the plant,‚Äù Director General Grossi said.""

EDIT: Formatting is broken, everything below is a quote.

What a birthday present for me today from Moscow üòÅ

Russia dropped the requirement for NATO to ""exit"" to the 1997 borders.

Russia's top leadership is withdrawing from the ""ultimatum"" to NATO it issued a few weeks before the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022.

2/ And even better, who wrote about it? Dima ‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅ (Medvedev)

The requirement to move the bloc's military infrastructure to the borders of 1997, which de facto liquidated bases in 14 countries of the alliance, is no longer on the list of conditions for Moscow's negotiations with the West

3/ Quote: ""We have never tried to stop NATO,"" Medvedev writes, adding that Finland's already completed entry, as well as Sweden's planned entry, are no loss for Russia, as these two countries ""were already associated with NATO.""

Cool üòâ

4/ ""We have always asked for only one thing - to take into account our concerns and not to invite the former parts of our country to join NATO,"" Medvedev continues. "".

5/ And here he was telling the truth. Because without regulating the borders and in a dispute with Russia, Ukraine will not be able to join NATO. But it turns out that we managed to eradicate Satanism on our own ü§≠

6/ Dimitry believes that Russia will ""achieve"" this goal one way or another, and that its international isolation is an illusion. ""Political contacts with Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing most actively"" - emphasizing that Western companies that have lost üá∑üá∫ the market ""bite their elbows""

7/ Although more seriously, yes. Western companies are counting losses. However, for the vast majority, these will be small losses (Russia is only 1.7% of the global market). I would like them to calculate their own losses.

Although you can see from the content of the entry that they probably fired up their calculators.

8/ Since the rhetoric changes from ""we'll drop the atom on the seat of satanism"" to ... ""This Finland and Sweden are actually quite cool that they are in NATO and Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia are also quite cool üòâ

9/ We, as Poland, are of course the archenemy. I'm waiting for Medvedev to start writing about us as distant cousins ‚Äã‚Äãand hatchets that need to be buried. Then it will be known that it is already very bad ü§≠

10/ And the rhetoric changes to ""we don't mind at all"" to downplay your failures in the eyes of your supporters. At least that's what one of the political scientists, Mr. Abbas Galyamov, said.

11/ It's cool for me. And for you? Do you have ideas for Dima's next posts? What will stop bothering him in the near future? ü§≠

""Rosenergoatom is in constant contact with the IAEA against the backdrop of Kiev preparing an emergency at the ZNPP

July 5, 2023, 00:00
Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, said that the concern is in constant contact with the IAEA against the backdrop of the Ukrainian authorities preparing an attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZNPP).
Earlier, Karchaa said that Ukraine on the night of July 5 is going to attack the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant using high-precision weapons and kamikaze drones.

‚ÄúContact with the IAEA is constant, interaction is constant,‚Äù he said in an interview with RT.

Karchaa stressed that the concern informs the IAEA about all emerging threats at the nuclear facility. He urged not to overestimate the role and capabilities of the IAEA.

‚ÄúThis is a non-military institution, not about war, it is an institution about nuclear security. This is an institution with a limited mandate, which does not allow influencing the military and military-political leadership in a strict prohibitive format, especially those suffering from a serious form of psychological pathology, ‚Äùhe said.

According to the head of the public movement ""We are with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov, the Russian Armed Forces are blocking attempts to advance the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are  trying to attack in the Zaporozhye region in order to reach Tokmok and Melitopol , as well as to the road to the ZNPP.

He stressed that  the Russian Armed Forces have switched to active defense on the front line in the Zaporozhye region , while they are also conducting counterattacks.""",False,1688504566.0,t3_14q48ts,t3_14q48ts,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

So no need to panic even if some incident happens. Unless you are close to the plant. Radiation is only dangerous if you are extremely close to it (meters) or the exposure is very long or the radiation very strong. Thats why people must not breathe radioactive dust.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin rejected suggestions that Ukraine‚Äôs counter-offensive was proceeding slowly, arguing that the pushback against Russia was ‚Äúnever a singular act‚Äù, and that Kyiv‚Äôs military strategy to ‚Äústarve, stretch and strike‚Äù was gradually breaking down Russian defensive lines.

Ukraine has struggled to puncture Russia‚Äôs heavily fortified defences in its counter-attack launched a month ago, deflating hopes among some of Kyiv‚Äôs western allies that Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces would achieve a rapid breakthrough.

‚ÄúThe question is, how do you take a front line that is more than a thousand kilometres long and turn it into more of a problem for Russia than for Ukraine?‚Äù Radakin told a parliamentary hearing. ‚ÄúThat is why you are seeing multiple axes being probed and feints by Ukraine.‚Äù

Radakin acknowledged that the ‚Äústronger than expected‚Äù density of Russian minefields, a lack of Ukrainian air cover and ‚Äúnot all the [military] equipment that they [Kyiv] desired‚Äù had complicated the campaign.

But he also said it was unfair to hold Ukraine to a specific timeline and that ‚ÄúRussia is now so weak that it does not have the strength for [its own] counter-offensive.‚Äù

‚ÄúRussia has lost nearly half the combat effectiveness of its army,‚Äù Radakin said. ‚ÄúLast year it fired 10mn artillery shells but at best can produce 1mn shells a year. It has lost 2,500 tanks and at best can produce 200 [new] tanks a year,‚Äù he said.

The UK is the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine after the US, and has been at the vanguard in terms of providing Kyiv with advanced military equipment, including main battle tanks and long range cruise missiles.

In an often testy series of exchanges with members of the UK parliament‚Äôs defence committee, Radakin also defended the British armed forces‚Äô own state of readiness ‚Äî although he acknowledged the army was using armoured vehicles that are ‚Äúreally old‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe need to have deeper stockpiles, we need to be more lethal and we need to increase our productivity,‚Äù Radakin said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù

The ministry of defence is due to issue a long-delayed command paper on how the British armed forces will spend its annual defence budget of about ¬£50bn.

Presumably they have something like 400 warheads, which is enough to do enormous damage.  They also have ICBMs, long range bombers, and nuclear missile submarines, but not in the same quantities as Russia, so most likely many/most of those warheads would not actually reach their targets.

Basically, China's weapons are very dangerous but they probably aren't on the same civilization-ending level as an all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia would be.  And China would probably come out a lot worse in that sort of exchange than the U.S. would, which means they have less of an incentive to pull the trigger.

For example, regarding Tanks, Russia had an estimated 3000 active tanks, and they already lost 4000. This means that they're taking tanks out of long-term storage, and starting to use old tanks. 

Not only is the number of currently active tanks a question, but also how many of those 'long term storage'-tanks are actually still recoverable. 

On the other hand, Ukraine had hundreds of tanks, received several hundred more, and also captured hundreds of Russian tanks, some of which have been repaired and are in combat.

The number of tanks available for either side is thus a big unknown mess, but given that Russia has started bringing T-55 tanks into battle, i really don't think we can assume Russia has more tanks available.

---

Similarly, while Russia of course has more manpower if we would assume that the entire country picks up a gun and starts fighting, they are not currently doing a full mobilization. Nor, say analysts, would a full blown mobilization help them all that much, since they'll still be limited in how many they can effectively train, and logistics for bringing them to the frontline should also be taken into account.

Meanwhile, Ukraine *did* mobilize, and their defense minister has stated that they currently have about 700.000 troops active. Moreover, from all the evidence we've heard, they are training their troops far better than the russians - especially if we include the troops trained by western countries, which they are currently actively doing. 

both short term and long term, i don't think the assumption that Russia has more troops is correct. Moreover, even *if* Russia did start mobilizing *and* solve all the logistic problems that would come from that, untrained mobilized troops are not equivalent to well-trained Ukrainian troops.

They've lost a huge amount of materiel and manpower, but they've also been adapting slowly but surely and have progressively been making things more and more difficult for Ukrainian forces with the assets they have left. One key area they've substantially improved upon is electronic warfare, which is having a variety of significant effects on the battlefield that are touched on in articles like these.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-electronic-warfare-interfering-with-ukrainian-radios-bombs-2023-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-electronic-warfare-interfering-with-ukrainian-radios-bombs-2023-7)

They're adapting in a variety of other ways, too. Russian air assets, especially attack helicopters and long-range bombers, are asserting themselves with more force and are significantly impacting Ukrainian armor and supply lines, and there's very little Ukraine can do about it except absorb those losses and hope they aren't too critical; those leaked Pentagon documents revealed critical shortcomings in Ukrainian air defenses, and we're seeing very real, very damaging consequences as a result of that. This isn't an easy obstacle to overcome since western militaries just don't have significant amounts of mobile medium-range air defense assets that could effectively solve the problem. It's a known gap in western militaries, and it's a gap that's being exploited heavily by Russian forces.

This isn't to say that Russia has the steam to mount effective offensives any time soon, but the fact that it's been able to adapt to the extent that it has is having a demonstrable impact on Ukraine's ability to successfully execute its own offensive operations. On the whole, Russia is slowly becoming more adept and lethal on the modern battlefield as it learns painful lessons over and over, and it still has an enormous quantity of materiel left to capitalize on those lessons.",False,1688504211.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqobjrd,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

And while rare earth mineral production is currently over concentrated in China that is slowly changing and China has their own glowing weaknesses. They are a massive importer of both food and energy sources like gas, oil and coal. If trade is cut off China will not be able to feed their people or keep their electrical and transportation grid running as it now is. How is Chinese military production going to be affected if people are starving, factories only gets electricity for 4 hours a day and they can't move parts between manufacturing facilities because there is a fuel shortage for trucks?

Yes the US and others should seek to ensure that they are not solely reliant on Chinese raw materials or parts for military equipment production but that is a problem that can be mitigated over time. China simply cannot produce enough food or energy on its own. If trade is shut down because of a conflict over Taiwan the clock immediately starts ticking on how long it is before Chinese food and fuel reserves run out and people start to go hungry and the energy and transportation infrastructure starts to suffer drastically. Not to mention that the Chinese economy is also hugely dependent on manufactured goods that are exported, if they're not exporting because there is a war their economy will be reeling from that on top of a shortage of food and fuel.

To start, the condition here for any NATO involvement would be Russia taking an action that directly impacts NATO states. Anything less than that would not warrant a NATO response. So, moving forward, we‚Äôre assuming that‚Äôs what happens.

In that case, Russia would be the one risking nuclear war. They‚Äôre attacking NATO - a nuclear alliance - at that point, which is forcing a direct response. And I do mean forcing. There would need to be a response or you‚Äôre risking the collapse of NATO itself. You can‚Äôt attack citizens of a NATO state, then expect NATO to itself survive as an alliance without responding. To not respond is to throw the world‚Äôs balance of power off its axis, greatly increasing the risk of nuclear war - the exact thing you‚Äôre repeatedly stating you‚Äôre worried about. When European countries no longer feel NATO is protecting them, and they start taking actions into their own hands in responding to an attack from Russia, that is when chaos descends and the risk of a global conflict greatly increases.

Next, you‚Äôre suggesting moving nukes to Poland. That‚Äôa not a response by any definition. Even if it were, it also accomplishes absolutely nothing in terms of pressuring Russia. There are nukes in Italy, Belgium, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, and Netherlands already. Why would Russia fold to this behaviour, as you claim? They‚Äôve been living with nuclear weapons in close proximity for a long time now. Nukes in Poland isn‚Äôt going to change that. Lastly, there‚Äôs no world where a largely symbolic action is adequate to European countries that have, in this scenario,  had their population attacked by Russia. Once again, we revert to NATO facing a collapse and all the resulting consequences.

No, there would need to be a conventional attack. What form that takes is uncertain, but it would be exclusively on military targets. The least risky, in terms of responding while minimizing further escalation, would be attacking Russian military targets in Ukraine. This could also include striking military bases in Russia, though obviously this poses an increased risk. 

It would then be Russia‚Äôs choice as to whether to escalate further. It doesn‚Äôt mean nuclear war is guaranteed, but it does mean NATO and Russia are in conflict, and the risk is increased . But again, this would be a scenario Russia themselves created and forced. There aren‚Äôt any other reasonable outcomes beyond NATO responding with a conventional attack in some form, unfortunately, and I‚Äôm certain Russia is well aware of that. Not responding isn‚Äôt an option for the reasons I‚Äôve mentioned.

On the bright side, because I‚Äôm certain they‚Äôre well aware of that, I highly doubt they‚Äôll attack ZNPP  - either at all, or at least in a way that impacts NATO states.",False,1688531111.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqozfhn,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

It's kinda crass but my response to people that think the US will lose interest is that they spent 20 years in a losing effort in Afghanistan propping up their government and now they're going to abandon Ukraine when it looks like they're winning and sticking it to the Russian's at the same time? That just seems really unlikely to me. And like you say unlike Afghanistan, or Iraq before it, this war isn't costing US lives.

Another issue is that ""but republicans!"" crowd misses is that many senior leaders in the party fully support Ukraine because a lot of their major donors are in the military industrial complex. And like you said they are definitely enjoying massively increased sales. People accuse the Republicans of only caring about themselves, well if that's true you think they're going to let the Democrats end up with those donations from defense contractors because they support aid to Ukraine? No, that money is staying with the Republicans and that means they're going to support aid to Ukraine.

People listen far too much to the MAGA republicans because they're loud and think they have more influence than they do, they have less influence than a few years ago because so many of them got pasted in the midterms. Also everyone was like ""McCarthy winning speaker means the end of aid to Ukraine, he just won't let the bills through!"" Has any of that happened? Again no because he knows who is a major funder of the party and him remaining speaker rests on continued approval from senior Republican's, which as discussed mostly support aid to Ukraine. And the older Republicans  that actually vote mostly support aid to Ukraine because they grew up hearing ""The Russians might kill as all"" and so now they think ""well they were right, god dam Russians.""",False,1688514318.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqp0bu3,,4,2,0,2,0,0,
