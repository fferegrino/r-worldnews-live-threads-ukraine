04 Jul 2023
Vienna, Austria

Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost the connection to its main external power line early this morning, forcing it to rely on recently restored back-up power supplies for the electricity it needs for essential nuclear safety and security functions, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.

The ZNPP’s sole remaining 750 kilovolt (kV) power line – out of four available before the conflict – was disconnected at 01:21am local time today. It was not immediately known what had prompted the power cut or how long it would last.

Europe’s largest nuclear power plant has been experiencing major off-site power problems since the conflict began in early 2022, exacerbating the nuclear safety and security risks facing the site currently located on the frontline.

The disconnection of the 750 kV power line meant the ZNPP had to switch to its only available 330 kV back-up power line for off-site electricity that is required, for example, to pump cooling water for the plant. This 330 kV line was only reconnected to the plant on 1 July after being damaged four months ago.

“This time the plant avoided a complete loss of all external power – which has happened seven times previously during the conflict – but the latest power line cut again demonstrates the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the plant,” Director General Grossi said.""

EDIT: Formatting is broken, everything below is a quote.

What a birthday present for me today from Moscow 😁

Russia dropped the requirement for NATO to ""exit"" to the 1997 borders.

Russia's top leadership is withdrawing from the ""ultimatum"" to NATO it issued a few weeks before the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022.

2/ And even better, who wrote about it? Dima ♥️😁 (Medvedev)

The requirement to move the bloc's military infrastructure to the borders of 1997, which de facto liquidated bases in 14 countries of the alliance, is no longer on the list of conditions for Moscow's negotiations with the West

3/ Quote: ""We have never tried to stop NATO,"" Medvedev writes, adding that Finland's already completed entry, as well as Sweden's planned entry, are no loss for Russia, as these two countries ""were already associated with NATO.""

Cool 😉

4/ ""We have always asked for only one thing - to take into account our concerns and not to invite the former parts of our country to join NATO,"" Medvedev continues. "".

5/ And here he was telling the truth. Because without regulating the borders and in a dispute with Russia, Ukraine will not be able to join NATO. But it turns out that we managed to eradicate Satanism on our own 🤭

6/ Dimitry believes that Russia will ""achieve"" this goal one way or another, and that its international isolation is an illusion. ""Political contacts with Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing most actively"" - emphasizing that Western companies that have lost 🇷🇺 the market ""bite their elbows""

7/ Although more seriously, yes. Western companies are counting losses. However, for the vast majority, these will be small losses (Russia is only 1.7% of the global market). I would like them to calculate their own losses.

Although you can see from the content of the entry that they probably fired up their calculators.

8/ Since the rhetoric changes from ""we'll drop the atom on the seat of satanism"" to ... ""This Finland and Sweden are actually quite cool that they are in NATO and Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia are also quite cool 😉

9/ We, as Poland, are of course the archenemy. I'm waiting for Medvedev to start writing about us as distant cousins ​​and hatchets that need to be buried. Then it will be known that it is already very bad 🤭

10/ And the rhetoric changes to ""we don't mind at all"" to downplay your failures in the eyes of your supporters. At least that's what one of the political scientists, Mr. Abbas Galyamov, said.

11/ It's cool for me. And for you? Do you have ideas for Dima's next posts? What will stop bothering him in the near future? 🤭

Modern day Russia is not a manufacturing power or an intellectual power and the quality of life is horrific especially given their resource advantages. Putin is largely fine with this because his power comes from plundering his own people and modernization is a threat. Russia’s greatest problem isn’t that they are losing the war in Ukraine but rather that they are losing the 21st century. 

While I don’t always agree with Zakaria’s takes I found this one quite interesting and I think many in the west still have this idea that Russia has a near infinite population, near infinite resources, near infinite military stockpiles and an infinite appetite for cruelty which, collectively, makes Russian victory almost guaranteed.

""Rosenergoatom is in constant contact with the IAEA against the backdrop of Kiev preparing an emergency at the ZNPP

July 5, 2023, 00:00
Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, said that the concern is in constant contact with the IAEA against the backdrop of the Ukrainian authorities preparing an attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZNPP).
Earlier, Karchaa said that Ukraine on the night of July 5 is going to attack the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant using high-precision weapons and kamikaze drones.

“Contact with the IAEA is constant, interaction is constant,” he said in an interview with RT.

Karchaa stressed that the concern informs the IAEA about all emerging threats at the nuclear facility. He urged not to overestimate the role and capabilities of the IAEA.

“This is a non-military institution, not about war, it is an institution about nuclear security. This is an institution with a limited mandate, which does not allow influencing the military and military-political leadership in a strict prohibitive format, especially those suffering from a serious form of psychological pathology, ”he said.

According to the head of the public movement ""We are with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov, the Russian Armed Forces are blocking attempts to advance the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are  trying to attack in the Zaporozhye region in order to reach Tokmok and Melitopol , as well as to the road to the ZNPP.

He stressed that  the Russian Armed Forces have switched to active defense on the front line in the Zaporozhye region , while they are also conducting counterattacks.""",False,1688504566.0,t3_14q48ts,t3_14q48ts,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

This fallout level will not be the case here unless Russia tries to replicate it which would be the equivalent of detonating a dirty bomb. 

So no need to panic even if some incident happens. Unless you are close to the plant. Radiation is only dangerous if you are extremely close to it (meters) or the exposure is very long or the radiation very strong. Thats why people must not breathe radioactive dust.

(2/4) The core of this approach has been Russia’s very heavy use of anti-tank mines. In some areas the density of its minefields indicate that it has likely used many more mines than laid down in its military doctrine.

(3/4) Having slowed the Ukrainian advance, Russia has then attempted to strike Ukrainian armoured vehicles with one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles, attack helicopters and artillery.

(4/4) Although Russia has achieved some success with this approach in the early stages of Ukraine’s counter-offensive, its forces continue to suffer from key weaknesses, especially overstretched units and a shortage of artillery munitions.",False,1688478052.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqmp2f6,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

That is not true. All radiation is dangerous there is no safe level of radiation any level can give you cancer. Yes even the background 'normal amount'. Any radiology student, radiotherapist, oncologist or nuclear scientist worth their salt will tell you this. Even a small amount of expose can effect you. It really comes down to probability.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin rejected suggestions that Ukraine’s counter-offensive was proceeding slowly, arguing that the pushback against Russia was “never a singular act”, and that Kyiv’s military strategy to “starve, stretch and strike” was gradually breaking down Russian defensive lines.

Ukraine has struggled to puncture Russia’s heavily fortified defences in its counter-attack launched a month ago, deflating hopes among some of Kyiv’s western allies that Ukraine’s armed forces would achieve a rapid breakthrough.

“The question is, how do you take a front line that is more than a thousand kilometres long and turn it into more of a problem for Russia than for Ukraine?” Radakin told a parliamentary hearing. “That is why you are seeing multiple axes being probed and feints by Ukraine.”

Radakin acknowledged that the “stronger than expected” density of Russian minefields, a lack of Ukrainian air cover and “not all the [military] equipment that they [Kyiv] desired” had complicated the campaign.

But he also said it was unfair to hold Ukraine to a specific timeline and that “Russia is now so weak that it does not have the strength for [its own] counter-offensive.”

“Russia has lost nearly half the combat effectiveness of its army,” Radakin said. “Last year it fired 10mn artillery shells but at best can produce 1mn shells a year. It has lost 2,500 tanks and at best can produce 200 [new] tanks a year,” he said.

The UK is the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine after the US, and has been at the vanguard in terms of providing Kyiv with advanced military equipment, including main battle tanks and long range cruise missiles.

In an often testy series of exchanges with members of the UK parliament’s defence committee, Radakin also defended the British armed forces’ own state of readiness — although he acknowledged the army was using armoured vehicles that are “really old”.

“We need to have deeper stockpiles, we need to be more lethal and we need to increase our productivity,” Radakin said. “I wouldn’t say I’m happy.”

The ministry of defence is due to issue a long-delayed command paper on how the British armed forces will spend its annual defence budget of about £50bn.

Presumably they have something like 400 warheads, which is enough to do enormous damage.  They also have ICBMs, long range bombers, and nuclear missile submarines, but not in the same quantities as Russia, so most likely many/most of those warheads would not actually reach their targets.

Basically, China's weapons are very dangerous but they probably aren't on the same civilization-ending level as an all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia would be.  And China would probably come out a lot worse in that sort of exchange than the U.S. would, which means they have less of an incentive to pull the trigger.

For example, regarding Tanks, Russia had an estimated 3000 active tanks, and they already lost 4000. This means that they're taking tanks out of long-term storage, and starting to use old tanks. 

Not only is the number of currently active tanks a question, but also how many of those 'long term storage'-tanks are actually still recoverable. 

On the other hand, Ukraine had hundreds of tanks, received several hundred more, and also captured hundreds of Russian tanks, some of which have been repaired and are in combat.

The number of tanks available for either side is thus a big unknown mess, but given that Russia has started bringing T-55 tanks into battle, i really don't think we can assume Russia has more tanks available.

---

Similarly, while Russia of course has more manpower if we would assume that the entire country picks up a gun and starts fighting, they are not currently doing a full mobilization. Nor, say analysts, would a full blown mobilization help them all that much, since they'll still be limited in how many they can effectively train, and logistics for bringing them to the frontline should also be taken into account.

Meanwhile, Ukraine *did* mobilize, and their defense minister has stated that they currently have about 700.000 troops active. Moreover, from all the evidence we've heard, they are training their troops far better than the russians - especially if we include the troops trained by western countries, which they are currently actively doing. 

both short term and long term, i don't think the assumption that Russia has more troops is correct. Moreover, even *if* Russia did start mobilizing *and* solve all the logistic problems that would come from that, untrained mobilized troops are not equivalent to well-trained Ukrainian troops.

The Foxbat had gained almost mystical status for its feared capabilities. After the defection the US was relieved to find the plane somewhat primitive, with hand welds, low G rating, nickel-steel alloy construction rather than fancy titanium, and its purported high speeds not sustainable for the airframe.

They've lost a huge amount of materiel and manpower, but they've also been adapting slowly but surely and have progressively been making things more and more difficult for Ukrainian forces with the assets they have left. One key area they've substantially improved upon is electronic warfare, which is having a variety of significant effects on the battlefield that are touched on in articles like these.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-electronic-warfare-interfering-with-ukrainian-radios-bombs-2023-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-electronic-warfare-interfering-with-ukrainian-radios-bombs-2023-7)

They're adapting in a variety of other ways, too. Russian air assets, especially attack helicopters and long-range bombers, are asserting themselves with more force and are significantly impacting Ukrainian armor and supply lines, and there's very little Ukraine can do about it except absorb those losses and hope they aren't too critical; those leaked Pentagon documents revealed critical shortcomings in Ukrainian air defenses, and we're seeing very real, very damaging consequences as a result of that. This isn't an easy obstacle to overcome since western militaries just don't have significant amounts of mobile medium-range air defense assets that could effectively solve the problem. It's a known gap in western militaries, and it's a gap that's being exploited heavily by Russian forces.

This isn't to say that Russia has the steam to mount effective offensives any time soon, but the fact that it's been able to adapt to the extent that it has is having a demonstrable impact on Ukraine's ability to successfully execute its own offensive operations. On the whole, Russia is slowly becoming more adept and lethal on the modern battlefield as it learns painful lessons over and over, and it still has an enormous quantity of materiel left to capitalize on those lessons.",False,1688504211.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqobjrd,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

And while rare earth mineral production is currently over concentrated in China that is slowly changing and China has their own glowing weaknesses. They are a massive importer of both food and energy sources like gas, oil and coal. If trade is cut off China will not be able to feed their people or keep their electrical and transportation grid running as it now is. How is Chinese military production going to be affected if people are starving, factories only gets electricity for 4 hours a day and they can't move parts between manufacturing facilities because there is a fuel shortage for trucks?

Yes the US and others should seek to ensure that they are not solely reliant on Chinese raw materials or parts for military equipment production but that is a problem that can be mitigated over time. China simply cannot produce enough food or energy on its own. If trade is shut down because of a conflict over Taiwan the clock immediately starts ticking on how long it is before Chinese food and fuel reserves run out and people start to go hungry and the energy and transportation infrastructure starts to suffer drastically. Not to mention that the Chinese economy is also hugely dependent on manufactured goods that are exported, if they're not exporting because there is a war their economy will be reeling from that on top of a shortage of food and fuel.

It's fine to mention the risks of relying on China for parts and material destined for military equipment but if it was cut off it would never occur in a vacuum where there is no response against the Chinese.

There would need to be a response or you’re risking the collapse of NATO itself. You can’t attack citizens of a NATO state, then expect NATO to itself survive as an alliance without responding. To not respond is to throw the world’s balance of power off its axis, greatly increasing the risk of nuclear war - the exact thing you’re repeatedly stating you’re worried about. When European countries no longer feel NATO is protecting them, and they start taking actions into their own hands in responding to an attack from Russia, that is when chaos descends and the risk of a global conflict greatly increases.

Next, you’re suggesting moving nukes to Poland. That’a not a response by any definition. Even if it were, it also accomplishes absolutely nothing in terms of pressuring Russia. There are nukes in Italy, Belgium, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, and Netherlands already. Why would Russia fold to this behaviour, as you claim? They’ve been living with nuclear weapons in close proximity for a long time now. Nukes in Poland isn’t going to change that. Lastly, there’s no world where a largely symbolic action is adequate to European countries that have, in this scenario,  had their population attacked by Russia. Once again, we revert to NATO facing a collapse and all the resulting consequences.

No, there would need to be a conventional attack. What form that takes is uncertain, but it would be exclusively on military targets. The least risky, in terms of responding while minimizing further escalation, would be attacking Russian military targets in Ukraine. This could also include striking military bases in Russia, though obviously this poses an increased risk. 

It would then be Russia’s choice as to whether to escalate further. It doesn’t mean nuclear war is guaranteed, but it does mean NATO and Russia are in conflict, and the risk is increased . But again, this would be a scenario Russia themselves created and forced. There aren’t any other reasonable outcomes beyond NATO responding with a conventional attack in some form, unfortunately, and I’m certain Russia is well aware of that. Not responding isn’t an option for the reasons I’ve mentioned.

On the bright side, because I’m certain they’re well aware of that, I highly doubt they’ll attack ZNPP  - either at all, or at least in a way that impacts NATO states.",False,1688531111.0,t3_14q48ts,t1_jqozfhn,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

It's kinda crass but my response to people that think the US will lose interest is that they spent 20 years in a losing effort in Afghanistan propping up their government and now they're going to abandon Ukraine when it looks like they're winning and sticking it to the Russian's at the same time?

Do you realize what you’re saying? You care more about one singular country than you do about the entire planet?

That’s the problem. This is bigger than one tiny dot on the globe. And if you honestly think NATO going gloves off would “help” Ukraine, you’re high. That’s how you start WW3 and create immense suffering for everyone.

You should be ashamed of yourself for being so selfish to place the needs of the few above the needs of the many.

So yeah. Concentrating on one singular country without regard for the rest of the world is selfish.

And the West is a bad ally apparently because they are trying look out for the entire planet, while still giving enough aid to Ukraine (which has been one of the most corrupt countries in Europe for the last 30 years) to basically be the reason they haven’t been overrun. 

The West has been bankrolling Ukraine since the 90s, not to mention training them and providing them with technology and intelligence information. But according to you they’re a bad ally because they want to try to keep the country with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world “stable” instead of “humiliating” them.
