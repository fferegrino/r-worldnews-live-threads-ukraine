Day 54 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It appears that the battle for Donbass has finally started. Just now pretty much everyone confirmed it, including government officials, Russians started their offensive on every front and there are reports of missile attacks and constant shelling. They are saying that the hell is unfolding all throughout the whole Donbass line with the worst artillery fire they have seen yet. This is basically the final battle, and whoever wins it will win the whole war.

Right now there are videos popping up of Russians firing their MLRSs from occupied territories, straight from residential districts of Donetsk and Kherson. Kharkiv is also under shelling, especially Saltivka, and just to put it into perspective, there are over 400 000 people living in that district, that is basically the whole population of Mariupol living in a single district. It’s also the district that was destroyed the most and is being shelled right now.

They are saying that the worst shelling will begin now and it will last until the end of the battle for Donbass. They are shelling Kharkiv and Mykolaiv to stop our forces from advancing on those directions, but it won’t stop them. Now we can only hope for the best, and believe in our victory.

Translation of the video from yesterday, where a seemingly well-known Russian nationalist openly admitted to Russia losing this 'special military operation'.

- de-militarisation failed, because now there are more weapons in Ukraine than before. 

- De-nazification (for Russia, everyone is a fascist or Nazi who is ""anti-Russian"") also failed, because Ukraine now hates Russia more than before. 

- Moskva's sinking is a disgrace, but he does not go to the reasons for that

- Russia is now isolated from everything, technological chains broken, kicked out of almost all organizations

- says that some deluded Russians still claim that they are fighting NATO, but he admits that there is no NATO in Ukraine. Just weapons and some advisors and intelligence, so they are not even directly fighting NATO or the West

- also admits that the former ""unity"" between Russia and Ukraine is now absolutely gone because they will not forget

- says that thanks to Russia, there is now more unity in the EU and NATO, which has a ""second birth""",1650274201.0,1650273607.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,271,0,271,0,0,

An air raid alarm sounded about 45 minutes before the blast. Such sirens are common in Lviv though - many people were still on the streets, and we were in the hotel restaurant on the top floor when we saw the plumes of smoke in the distance.

>Hey its Donetsk dave here. Updating all my Reddit friends on some things that have nort been getting media attention, but very important. Its true The spokesman of the Defense Ministry of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Eduard Basurin, has been detained by Russian military. The ""reason"" Russia gave was vague, apparently talking about Chemical attacks however it could be something more interesting. Ive mentioned earlier in this Sub During the last 2 weeks there has been numerous accounts of DPR male residents who were called up for conscription as well as runaways from the front lines have escaped to the border regions in Russia. There has been a huge mission to retain these runaways by DPR and Russian police. This has resulted in a revolt against these units. A DPR truck was blown up in Kursk and a shootout with a runaway. There has also been reports of explosions in random houses, believed to be holding facilities for forced conscripts. Russia has raised the Terror level in Kursk than a week later to all border regions. There was also an explosion at a Gas depot apparently which was being used by military trucks. Russia has blacked out this information, blaming it on Ukrainian nationals, but that narrative does not make sense. The arrest of Basurin could be a wake up call for the DPR to get their house in order. Also UAF has been pushing around the east of Izyum and reports from friends Telegram who said they are now in the east side of the city and artillery is hitting russian forces in the west. So great news on holding Russia back. Also, no OPSEC here but strange things happen when Western Equipment is transferred to Ukraine. Cell phone turn off and on and blackouts and some kind of jamming of Russian radar and issues with flying inside airspace. Anything used is beyond my comprehension .Thank you USA!

MONDAY, APRIL 18, 2022, 11:00 P.M.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russian generals have killed too many of their soldiers, so they are being more careful during the new offensive.

Source: Zelensky's video address .

Direct speech: ""In the east and south of our state, the occupiers are trying to attack in recent times a little more deliberately than it was before.

Apparently, Russian generals, accustomed to not counting any casualties, have already killed so many Russian servicemen that even they have to be more careful, because there is no one left to attack. 

However, let them not hope that this will help them. It is only a matter of time before the whole territory of our state is liberated. "" 

What is even more important: Zelensky stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time: a very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive.

Direct speech: ""No matter how many Russian soldiers are expelled there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day. We will not give anything Ukrainian, and we do not need someone else's.

And I am grateful to all our fighters, to all our heroic cities in Donbass, Mariupol, and also to the cities of the Kharkiv region which hold. Protecting the fate of the whole state, restraining the forces of invaders. Rubizhne, Popasna, Zolote, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk and all others who have been with Ukraine all these years and forever. """"

>**Many Ukrainians are often sent to distant regions of Russia**. Lomakina says they know of Ukrainians who have been deported to Samara, Kursk, Tula, Cheboksary, and other impoverished Russian cities.

Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko has said that “no parts of Ukraine should be on the negotiating table” as the country continues its resistance, despite Russia's bombardment of cities across the country Monday.

Vasylenko, a Member of Parliament for the Holos Party who was elected in 2019, was speaking to CNN after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine was not willing to give up territory in eastern Ukraine to end the war with Russia.

“Ukraine is writing its own, new history and it’s also writing the new history of the world as it goes,” Vasylenko told CNN New Day from Prague, Czech Republic.

“If under any circumstances Ukraine is made to give up territories, it’s going to be a risk not just to Ukrainians living in Ukraine, but to the whole world,"" she added.

The 611 foot cruiser was the third largest vessel in Russia's fleet and one of its most heavily defended assets. 8 key points from the BBC World Service:

1) “Moskva” had an advanced radar system crucial for anti-air support for the entire Black Sea fleet.
2) Russia has only three tier 1 naval vessels, and now there are none in the Black Sea. It’s a disaster for them.
3) Turkey will not let new Russian vessels enter the Black Sea, so it's not possible to replace the Moskva.
4) The flagship had an elite crew of over 500 sailors and only 54 appear to have been rescued.
5) There is also a morale and public impact. A large ship named Moscow has sunk.
For a similar public relations reason, the Nazis changed the name of the heavy cruiser “Deutschland” to “Lützow” in 1940.
6) The sinking is a real surprise because Moskva was equipped with a triple-tiered air defense system.
That should have given it three opportunities to defend itself from the Neptune missile attack.
The Moskva system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser. Why the Ukrainian missiles got through is a real mystery.
7) This is the biggest Russian/Soviet navy setback since the loss of “Marat” in 1941.
8 ) The missile strike raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the modernization of Russia's entire fleet.",False,1650312344.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

I think it could be a good idea if at least some of Ukraine's current fighter pilots were moved out of the country to do training with F-16's, and then Ukraine would get the F-16's through the new US lend-lease. After that group is trained, the next group comes in. By the end of the year, Ukraine can have an air force with better planes and with pilots (and aircraft mechanics) that know how to work with them. As brand new pilots with zero experience join, they can train for longer in a safer place, like the US. The US has thousands of F-16s in storage that have been properly modernized, maintained, and taken care of. Even two to three squadrons would be materially possible. Maybe the training could be 6 to 8 weeks per group of pilots/mechanics? Would that be enough time for already experienced pilots and mechanics to adapt to a new aircraft?

It would be fantastic not only for the Mig29 and Su27 pilots to be trained on the F-16, but for the Su24 and Su25 pilots to be trained with the A-10.

[The text was about Bucha massacre, I used online photo translation to you.  Look at these «brave» «Russian» faces.](https://imgur.com/gallery/2VUPSnv)

I’ve found a good Ukrainian article about them and translate a part of it.

the killers responsible for these crimes. This is the military unit 51460, based in the settlement of Knyaze-Volkonskoe in the Khabarovsk region of the Russian Federation. The people who did this should know about it: we are coming after you,"" Tsymbaluk said on his Youtube channel.

""Kniaze-Volkonskoe is a small town with a population of less than 10,000 people. Its residents are engaged in agriculture, mining and logging. In the center of the village there is a cesspool, from which ""all this is safely dispersed and spread out. The military unit 51460 can be considered the town's major enterprises. The latter, just like the city itself, has not been known for anything positive for a long time,"" Belsat writes.

Local residents also say that ""not a year has passed without anyone being killed or raped in the city.

""This place is really something abnormal. Not a year goes by that someone isn't killed or raped there. When we lived in Knyaz-Volkonk, I never went out alone in the evenings. And how many rumors I heard from the locals. Now there's a lynx invasion in the village, or a cannibal bear wanders in. And there were times when the officers of the division went crazy. Maybe it's mysticism, but there's definitely a thickening of evil forces there!"" - The Amur Meridian newspaper quoted a former local resident as saying in 2014.

Journalists also say that in the winter of 2014 there was a series of attacks on women and teenagers in Knyaz-Volkonsky. It is noted that there were also people killed. It was also said that potential victims were caught by a ""man in a military uniform,"" who offered them a ride.

""The alleged murderer turned out to be a captain of the Russian army, Artem Grabovoy. After investigators got on his trail the officer hanged himself. After him his friend and fellow serviceman of Grabovoy committed suicide. There was an opinion that he was an accomplice,"" writes ""Belsat"".

The publication said that another emergency case involving the military occurred in Kniaze-Volkonski in December 2015.

Then about 15 young soldiers right near the checkpoint of the military unit beat a man to death. The victim was a reserve officer and lived in this town. A friend of the killed man who tried to intercede for him was also almost killed.

According to the survivor, officers also took part in the beating, while the military police simply observed the incident. According to some reports, the reason for the conflict was interethnic discord.

""The most offensive thing is that most of these officers have already been released and are quietly walking down the street and drinking beer outside the store,"" local residents write in comments to the news.

 It is also reported that from January to May 2014, nine people were killed in military units of Knyaze-Volkonsky and the neighboring village of Anastasievka. In addition to the aforementioned Captain Grabovoy, these were five privates, two junior sergeants, and one lieutenant. Five committed suicide, three were killed in a tank explosion and one in connection with a violation of personnel transportation rules.

It is noted that the inspection revealed ""violations of the law in the sphere of accommodation, material and domestic and medical support of servicemen, protection of their lives and health, ensuring law and order in units 30632 and 51460, committed by officials of these military units as well as of the higher military administration.

""But only one of the commanders of the ""hanged"" soldiers received a real sentence, and that after years of pressure from the ""Mother's Right"" foundation. It was noted that Major Nikolai Chabanov, ""feeling impunity, was beating the soldier, forcing him to wear a bulletproof vest and gas mask 24 hours a day, and shortly before his death he 'put the soldier on a meter meter,' ordering him to buy a new computer. The body of the deceased had multiple bruises and on the chin there was a mark from the handle of the plastic broom, with which the major had beaten him,"" the journalists point out.

A total of 12 Russian soldiers died in Khabarovsk Krai in 2014. At least one other soldier was discharged after the brutal beating because it was ""the only chance to stay alive,"" the piece emphasized.

Belsat also recalls that deputy Sergei Furgal, who initiated the inspection in military units, was elected governor of the Khabarovsk region in 2018 as a result of a protest vote. In 2020, he was arrested on instructions from Moscow, which sparked numerous and sustained protests in the region. Furgal is now on trial.

It is also noted that the facts of hazing in Knyaz-Volkonsky are also evidenced by numerous comments from 2015 and 2016 under the news about the murder of a man near the checkpoint. Journalists cite only some of them.",1650318550.0,1650316590.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

1. Given that the main fighting between the two armies is in Donbas a lot of cities and villages will change hands back and forth. This isn't like a video game where you capture one city and the level ends and you can not lose that city. What is important is who will end up victorious in Donbas over the long run. Which brings me to my next point.
2. This will be a multi month campaign and the long run favours Ukraine since it is receiving increasing amounts of weaponry from the West while Russia's economy is expected to go bankrupt by June. A lot of Russian weapons factories have already stopped working due to lack of imported parts. Ukraine can afford a prolonged war of attrition much better than Russia. Oh and land and lease starts when the US congress gets back from recess :)
3. The Russian army sucks as always while the UKR army is more motivated than ever. Zelinsky already said the east will not be given to Russia.
4. The Kherson front looking very promising for Ukraine.

So all of you Russian agents here who propagate that capturing a village in Donbas is a great victory and means Zelinsky should come to the negotiation table let's wait until June and see what happens until then.",False,1650313493.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

My perspective: Putin the grand master strategists decision to invade, even if you accept the premise that this *had* to happen because of security concerns or believe in the Novorossiya project was 8 years too late. While Igor Girkin (the disgraced infamous ""Defence Secretary"" of the DNR) is a war criminal and lunatic, I definitely think accepting his premise, he has been vindicated. For all the salivating weirdos do over Putin, this invasion was the worst option possible at one of the worst times ever to do it - although later obviously would have been worse.

Since you wouldn't believe me about kinetic energy, here's some actual numbers for you.   
   
I'm going to use TNT as the theoretical explosive because I don't know what actual HE is used (and other explosives are often measured in ""TNT equivalent"") and model a *Neptune*'s warhead going *Mach 10* for the sake of this exercise (because I'm not trying to fear-monger, just illustrate how much of a difference kinetic energy makes at higher speeds). We're going to assume that the warhead separates because it makes the math simpler, but know that the extra mass due to not-separating would increase the kinetic energy without increasing the chemical potential energy (further exacerbating my point)       
   
Mach 10 is [3313 m/s](https://www.calculateme.com/speed/mach/to-meters-per-second/10)   
TNT energy density is [4.184 MJ/kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT)  
Neptune warhead mass is [150 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360_Neptune)  
  
The kinetic energy of the warhead just by itself would then be  
  
K.E = (1/2)×150×(3313^2 ) = 823.2 MJ  
P.E (chemical) = 4.184×150 = 627.6 MJ  
  
What this tells us is that at Mach 10, in fact, the *velocity of the warhead does more damage than the explosives in it*   
   
So where does that leave us? Well, let's play with some variables to feel it out:  
\- Doubling the warhead's *mass* **doubles both K.E and P.E**. That is, they will increase at the same rate.   
\- Doubling the warhead's explosive's *energy density* will **double P.E without touching K.E.**  
\- Doubling the warhead's *velocity* will **quadruple K.E without touching P.E**.   
   
Since you can't just invent denser and denser explosives by snapping your fingers, no matter what explosive you use, once you get to the Mach ~10 range, velocity likely becomes the main killer. If you use an explosive that is 2x denser than TNT, you could have gotten the same energy by instead making the warhead go 1.414x faster. If you use an explosive 4x denser than TNT, you could have gotten the same energy by instead making the warhead go 2x as fast.    
   
Again, not trying to fear-monger, but rather inform.",1650263347.0,1650262852.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

I had a really fascinating conversation with my partner's parents tonight. They are Romanian, and lived through both the USSR, the rebellion and revolt of 1989, and the fall of the Berlin wall. They've seen just about everything. What really surprised me was that they believed Zelensky should have negotiated for peace; or at the very least made concessions for peace to save lives.

I thought this was a bit strange, but their perspective and experience as Romanians no doubt left them with the impression that peace must come at all costs. Indeed, Germany invades Romania, Romanian capitulates and fights for Germany until Soviet Russia invades Romania and they become a bit of a satellite state.

At the end of the day, they retained their culture, right? They had no defence against Germany, despite France's promises to protect them, and definitely no defense against Soviet Russia. 

I did argue that the will of the Ukrainian people was to fight. The 2014 Maiden protests, their ongoing fight to reclaim Crimea, separatism, etc. makes that very clear. They want to fight. Who is Zelensky to say no to them?

But this conversation left me with a better idea of why some people think Zelensky should have sued for peace, even if it cost Ukraine her independence -- their culture remains intact and people's lives are saved. 

They absolutely hate Russia, but I thought it was interesting that they both thought Ukrainians and Russians were no different -- it's clearly experience they've gained over their years in Communist Romania, behind the Berlin wall.",1650256017.0,1650255363.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,-18,0,-18,0,0,

So it seems that the increase in the military budget due to Ukraine and Russia is rather modest. And that the increase is due to China. I had always hoped that ending our involvement in places like Afghanistan would bring a peace dividend. That we could cut back on military spending and use that money for Medicaid for example. 

And yet here we are yet again increasing our military budget. If it is truly China that worries the Biden administration for increasing the military budget than we need to cool tensions immediately in order to cut back on our commitments. We have been antagonizing China by making stronger diplomatic overtures to Taiwan for example. It’s time to immediately stop doing so.

Still it seems like America for a brief period of time favored lowering the military budget after our disastrous quagmires in Afghanistan and Iraq. Ukraine and Russia seems to have erased that. What a shame. 

At the end of the day the military industrial complex and the pentagon being able to squeeze more money out of the American taxpayer is the true tragedy of this war for me. I know people will ask how can you say that when when people are dying and there are war crimes being committed. I will answer because I am a patriot. I care more for my own fellow citizens than a people thousands of miles away. Unlike our politicians I put America first. It’s why I opposed Biden cutting off Russian energy because even though it would help Ukrainians win the war; winning the war isn’t as important as the well-being of our own people. This is why the public’s shift on military spending is the true tragedy of the war.

Lastly please spare me your moralizing about how we have to help the Ukrainian people being bombed by Russians and that’s worth higher gas prices and more money for the pentagon and the military industrial complex. Our ally in Saudi Arabia have been maiming and starving Yemeni children for years now and we directly support it by selling them billions of dollars in weapons and buying their oil. Why has there been no sanctions against bone saw Salaman? Why do we continue to sell them weapons to kill Yemeni children? 

It’s time to start cutting down on our foreign obligations and responsibilities. It’s time to turn inwards and focus on the vulnerable and downtrodden of our society. It’s time to put America first.",1650257911.0,1650257672.0,t3_u64789,t3_u64789,,0,-104,0,-104,0,0,

It should be noted that of the 76 in Ukraine currently, it's not like they are 76 of what came out of the initial 120.  Their equipment is substantially worse off after a month of war, and some of their best newest stuff is in smoldering ruins around Ukraine (or in Ukraine's hands).  So the 76 there now might be more akin to 60 of the pre-invasion BTGs in terms of capability.  

Meanwhile Ukraine has more tanks now, more artillery, more ATGW, more AA with more of all the aforementioned to come.  I am also hearing reports that Moscow is planning to have to start to step in wrt to the local Russian economy in May (and no not just from the winds of change letter or whatever it is called), which is rapidly approach.

Russia has a small finite window to do something here.

The US's target countries aren't as vulnerable to propaganda efforts and likely have little serious defense against cyber espionage.  So I suspect the US sees cyber war as a strategic extension of the armed forces for the most part.  So, being able to see where malware is installed and planning on how to cripple it is something I'd expect.  Beyond that, I'd not be at all surprised if they have most of Russia's online infrastructure surveyed and have explored how to access and attack critical elements all the way up and down the chain.  Then they just sit back, keep the list up to date and make sure that if the day ever comes, they can bring Russia to it's knees, at least the parts connected to the internet.

>The measures of the European Union's fifth sanctions package published on 8 April will take effect on Easter Sunday morning, 17 April, at 0:00. The package includes a prohibition on access to ports in the territory of the European Union for vessels registered under the flag of Russia (1).

>The sanctions package contains exceptions for certain types of cargo. Vessels sailing under the flag of Russia but falling within the exceptions may therefore still be allowed access to port. The exceptions relate to cargo such as oil and gas, refined petroleum products and a number of ores, pharmaceutical and medical products, agricultural and food products, and products for civil nuclear applications, as well as extending to vessels where humanitarian grounds apply (2).

>A Russian vessel's master, agent, owner and cargo owner must ascertain whether the vessel falls within exceptions under which it can be allowed access. However, the Harbour Master will remain responsible for implementing the port access policy. Separately from this sanctions package, the European Union published a list of natural persons and entities against which restrictive measures have been imposed in the fourth sanctions package. That list also includes a number of vessels, to which certain exceptions apply (3).

>If the situation changes, the information on this website will be updated accordingly.

>(1) For the text of the European Regulation in its entirety, please see Publications Office (europa.eu), Ukraine and Russia (rvo.nl) (in Dutch only).

>(2) The exception provisions are set out on pages 3 and 4 of the EU Regulation: Article 3ea(5)(a) to (e). This also refers to annexes with specific cargo numbers (CN Codes, set out in Annex XXII on page 33 and Annex XXIV on page 66).

Liberals believe it is important to teach Children:

- Curiosity
- Empathy
- Tolerance

Whereas Conservatives believe it's important to teach:

- Obedience
- Faith

It's right here where you see the divide being sown. Empathy—a high-level emotion—needs to be fostered and learned just like any high-level logic techniques. If the mother and/or father fails in doing this, it leads to long-term issues in behavioral development. [Teachers have also widely called for bolstering teaching empathy:](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/17/497827991/a-sesame-study-in-kindness)

>How can a child be kind without being helpful or thoughtful? By being polite. It turns out that manners were very important to parents. When given a choice between having manners and having empathy and asked, ""Which of these is more important for your child to be right now?"" 58 percent chose manners compared with just 41 percent who chose empathy.

>Kotler Clarke suggests that some parents may assume that teaching a child manners is a good way of building empathy. But, she says, ""**There's really no great evidence around that. In fact, bullies are very good at having manners around adults.**""

>On this point, teachers broke with parents, overwhelmingly preferring empathy (63 percent) over manners (37 percent). And teachers can see the disconnect in their classrooms. Thirty-four percent say, of the children they teach, that all or most of their parents are raising kids to be empathetic and kind, while just 30 percent say all or most parents are raising children with values consistent with their teachers'.

There is another interesting correlation, if not a causal-factor, in that those identifying as conservatives are likely to have elevated testosterone levels compared to their left-wing counterparts. Testosterone, the predominant male hormone is known to elevate rage and aggression while muting emotional sensitivities like empathy. On the surface, conservatives may cheer over this, but consider respect for a rabid wild animal / loose-cannon is not the same respect for someone posing intelligent arguments. This is why one frequently sees conservatives substituting aggression and intimidation for a lack of substantive reasoning -- [Example](https://youtu.be/ups4FeSuHvY).

Now imagine if you will that you are decades past your college years (IF you went to college at all) where you were once exposed to a variety of cultures, your preconceived beliefs challenged and you're humbled by how little you do not know (so goes the adage, 'the more you know, the more you realize you *don't* know*'). Add to this that you are at your peak mental fitness—you pick things up quickly. You also have more time focused on ""learning"" and being ""aware."" You are less afraid of change, albeit perhaps naive at times, but you almost look forward to change and progress.

In older years, your free-time dwindles, your priorities change. You can no longer spend as much time reading a book and focusing on current-events. Your time is spent on immediate concerns rather than the abstract and worldly, such as:

- Likely raising a family
- Focusing on your career/work/income
- Your mental capacity likely has deteriorated since your early years
- Your peers are all in the same boat, which then feeds back into itself

Now, instead of reading long-form journalist pieces, timely non-fictional books, researching academic journals—you're limited to ""bite-sized"" pieces of news via talk radio (Rush) or TV (Fox) as you're eating breakfast before work, then you've got the evening news and your social media feed. This is all you've got. Such a shallow understanding of what's going on makes you malleable, more susceptible to ""common-sense"" rhetoric when all variables are not known to you. 

Because of this, you become more shortsighted. You may be more stressed because you have a family to support, and so you become more selfish—making you hate ""all the taxes"" that are impacting your bottom-line. Instead of progress, you just want things to ""stay the same,"" and be ""stable"" because it's harder to adapt in older years. No longer are you looking at the long-term game, but the immediate return. 

I contest the correlation with age is not a result of wisdom, but a lack of time to understand issues at depth, or await the return on investment. Compounding this:

[Peak Hours Worked By Age](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-average-hours-per-week-worked-in-the-us-2060631)

[Educational Activities by Age](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/time-spent-in-educational-activities-in-2016.htm)

[Fluid intelligence degradation](http://alzheimers.emory.edu/healthy_aging/cognitive-skills-normal-aging.html)

>""“Chrystalized” intelligence, i.e., knowledge or experience accumulated over time, actually remains stable with age.  **On the other hand, “fluid” intelligence or abilities not based on experience or education tend to decline.**""

In short, Occam's Razor suggests that—surprise—education makes you more informed, and is not some liberal conspiracy. Perhaps we need to start considering the possibility that it's not that education is biased with liberalism, but that liberalism is a result of being educated.

By the way, I say this as a former Republican conservative. But the good news is that they change! My family did! Peace, love, tolerance, curiosity—these aren't exactly bad things. By the way, can you call me a bleeding heart hippie tree-hugger SJW? I wear that badge with honor.

Russia's early incompetence means it's trapped in a scenario where it needs meaningful gains to sell the war as a victory to the public and will grow increasingly desperate to obtain that outcome, as anything less means the total end of Russia as a superpower.

The only common point between this situation and syria is russia also committed atrocities there.

Unlike the situation in syria, ukraine is united in the struggle against russia, has a modernised, professional army, more than twice the population and roughly four times the surface area of syria and major western backing both in terms of weaponry and sanctions.

You put those things together and they mean there is just no conceivable way russia can afford for this war to drag on for years. Their losses, in terms of men, material and money are on a totally different scale to syria or even afghanistan and the impact of sanctions is progressive and cumulative over time.

However good Putin's domestic propaganda apparatus, the idea that russia is going to be still fighting this war on the same trajectory after 12 months is impossible. 

At the current rates, after a year we would be talking about 90-100 000 dead russians predominantly aged 20 to 30, 4 or 5 times that number wounded,  losses which would be utterly incomprehensible in any first world country.

We are also talking about 6 plus months of debt default with assets overseas seized (see for example all of Gazprom's infrastructure in europe, and the $450 billion odd of russian currency holdings that western countries have frozen) and cascading corporate collapses. And even countries which are not remotely interested in sanctions against russia for moral reasons are going to think very hard before doing business with a country in default, with a junk credit rating.

We are also talking about an economy which will have lost its capacity to build or service anything which needs advanced parts and equipment- ie a country where airlines stop flying, tanks and missiles are no longer rolling off the assembly line, and any complicated machinery which breaks down stays broken because they can't get the parts needed to repair it. 

Whatever the initial public support for the war, and most expeditionary wars, like vietnam, afghanistan, iraq, etc are initially publically popular, that changes when the consequences bite people in a personal direct way. Even if you are the most rabid putiniphile, when your mum can't get chemotherapy and her cancer metastases  because the drugs she needs are foreign imports, or your son and your nephew are both missing presumed dead and the teenager next door is hobbling around on one leg, or hubby just lost his job because his factory can't build TVs anymore because they can't get the parts, and there's no end in sight to the war which could obviously end as soon as russian troops packed up and went home, public opinion will start to turn savagely.

Of course things will get dreadful in Ukraine as well, but they have western financial backing to keep them solvent and because the war is being fought on their soil they also have the stark knowledge that this is genuinely an existential conflict for them- they have to keep fighting, whatever the cost, because if they don't their loved ones will be raped or murdered and their country will cease to exist. So their threshold for resistance is much higher.

With all that in mind, I would be astonished if this war is still going on in 6 months time- by that time either russia will have successfully broken conventional ukrainian resistance and made peace on terms acceptable to russia, or failed to make meaningful progress and concluded peace on terms very favorable to ukraine (to prevent russian government collapse) or in fact faced russian government collapse.

Hell if putin is genuinely a lunatic it would be more likely that he would completely lose his shit and drop nukes on every major city in ukraine than continue to grind out a conventional conflict which will almost inevitably lead to his government's collapse if it continues on its current trajectory.",1650274848.0,1650274482.0,t3_u64789,t1_i56om6h,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

No way these two wars are remotely comparable. Russia does't have that much time. It cannot sustain this war for years.

During the fall draft alone, two of my compatriots were injured, one was set on fire and spent two days in hospital, another was beaten up for two days, is that normal?

""It's time to disband this unit, it's really already gloomy and not funny,"" the journalists quoted another Internet user.

""It's some kind of menagerie in Knyaz-Volkonsk, honestly! Soldiers are blue in the hospital, and no one cares! It's horrible! The parents are afraid to make a fuss - they should get TV to take pictures of these bruises and let them figure out where they came from! A soldier hasn't even taken the oath of allegiance yet, and his hair was set on fire by four people against one; is that normal? And no noise"", - said another user of the network.

""Better to flatten the military unit with all its contents. They are of no use as defenders. No one will even notice"", says another comment.

""The worst part is that there will be no proceedings, much less any consequences. The reason? The command of the unit has long felt impunity. It refers to some epidemic of ""accidents"" with corpses and cripples. It also concerns, to put it mildly, the free handling of funds,"" another author of the commentary is convinced.

""The 'defenders' walk around drunk as fuck all year round without taking part in combat operations, the commanders turn a blind eye, and more often just drink vodka with their subordinates, and then cover up their mistakes for money afterwards,"" adds another comment author.

""Yes... It's high time these Prince Volkonskii units were disbanded. There has been a lot of criminal activity there lately. When I was an enlisted soldier in the late '90s at the height of hazing there was nothing like what is going on in the Volkonskaia unit today,"" says another user.

On various thematic forums one can also find many negative reviews of military unit 51460. They speak, in particular, about theft, extortion, ""hazing,"" poor material support and violence.

""I served in this unit and I would rather die than go to the MPP (regiment medical station - ""DS""),"" the report noted.

""Theft is rampant in this unit, commanders and all superiors demand bribes from children! Contractors withdraw money from their cards. They are fed poorly. Lawlessness is rampant,"" complained one of the Russians.

""Some of it is crap. The Yakuts, Tuvans and the like are oppressing the guys. I wish I'd met them, those scumbags! I'd make fun of them all year long. They walk in crowds, all with knives,"" adds his compatriot.

""In some platoons, soldiers don't get their pay cards, they get their money taken out by lieutenants or other non-human people. If they find a soldier's phone at the wrong time, they can take it away, smash it, nail it to the wall, offer to buy it back. (...) Uniforms, boots, physical condition leave much to be desired (...) Water quality is bad, they periodically turn it off. Skin diseases are more frequent in summer,"" one of the witnesses also said.

The situation of Knyaze-Volkonsky troops has not changed for the better in recent years. According to the Russian newspaper URA.RU, on the night of February 16 this year - actually a week before the start of the war in Ukraine - a senior warrant officer and a sergeant beat up six soldiers. Two of them ended up in the hospital.


According to the victims, at night the drunken Chief Warrant Officer began checking the numbers on the slippers and nightstands of the soldiers. Those who didn't match, he lined them up and started beating them with a stick. But according to Svetlana Golub, head of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers association, ""the division deputy commander advised to talk less about it.

""They are now presenting this story as a mass scuffle between fellow soldiers: supposedly they became participants in non-statutory relations with each other, and the two men who were beating them were actually separating them,"" Golub reported.

According to UA Dynamics officials cited in various press reports, the Punisher has carried out at least 60 successful drone missions against Russian armed forces since they began their invasion – several with considerably outsize effects.

>The craft are described as having a 7.5-foot wingspan, and capacities to fly at 1,300-foot altitudes for missions of up to three hours long. That small size allows the UAV to get deep behind enemy lines with little risk of detection before or during strikes, *then return for super-fast seven-minute redeployment servicing*. That mix has reportedly allowed Punisher drones to furtively attack supply lines supporting Russian forces, strike trains transporting fuel to troops, and blast munition reserves.

Russia isn't supporting their tanks as well as they should be and combined arm tanks probably still have a role within war. I don't think there's a clear answer for tanks.

What I think there is a clear answer for is drones and autonomous vehicles though. At least according to [one expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ8Oq7010W0), connected devices in war to mine information about the area is extremely important - so much so that planes without payload were refueled due to their role in providing intelligence.

It would make a lot more sense to have an unmanned drone take that role. It's cheaper and there's a lot more safety for the pilot of said drone so that experience in combat is not lost. IMO, tanks may be in similar situations. [Lithuania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6XyfoZ5jHA) has shirked expensive tanks to use more mobile mechanized infantry with a significant array of sensors so that it can hopefully hit the tank with an ATGM before the tank can hit it. Again, sensors and information can trump armor if you can hit the enemy before you're noticed.

Human driven tanks are expensive to train, maintain, field, repair, and losing one is a tragedy. Therefore, I can see an argument for smaller, unmanned, armored, all-terrain drones that run on cheap energy (battery or gas) to collect information about the region for other platforms to rain firepower down on. If the drone is lost in the attack, not as big of a deal as the human tank team. If a turret and auto loader are attached to the drone, then it can be called a tank and you could have a team driving a bunch of them around gathering info in contested regions (air and land).",1650259080.0,1650257733.0,t3_u64789,t1_i5645k6,,1,4,0,4,0,0,
e416229c530635c789aa5ed866a0a3af,u64789,i56h603,"# Absolutely not.

The main tank-killers we see in this conflict are: 

1) over-extended supply lines -> supply your army so they don't abandon equipment (duh!)

2) top-attack ATGMs -> provide active/passive defenses and (within reason) roof armor; most current tank roofs are just 2in of steel withotu any decoys

3) artillery -> don't park out in the open and dig in (Western armies use ""berm drills"" so this isn't an issue)

4) direct-attack ATGMs -> passive/active defenses, armor, and tactics

While some of it is useless vs a Javelin or other self-guided top-attack missile, Russian tankers in particular seem to have *no* anti-missile defenses or tactics.  They sit out in the open firing instead of popping out to fire & then scurrying back into cover, they don't use much concealment, they seem to have no idea how to conceal their thermal signature, they fire from the same location repeatedly, they drive very slow through ambush-prone areas because they're uncomfortable handling their vehicles, they tend to go hull-down when they should be turret-down (leaving the turret exposed to attack), etc.  *Russian tankers make more basic tactical mistakes than Syrian rebels who taught themselves from Youtube videos and old manuals.*

You're seeing 20-40 year old tanks driven by people with basically worthless training, at a moment of technological ebb and flow, go against the most high-tech antitank weapons in the world used by a battle-hardened army that spent almost a decade preparing for exactly this moment.

7f4ba30edcecf92e78b0783e5cfa5435,u64789,i568o85,"No. Why is it every 3 days someone posts this? 

1. NATO has literally flooded Ukraine with ATGMs, to the point where the US alone has sent 1/3 of it's total stockpile. It will take a year to replenish that amount. That many missiles is an aberration. If you include all the ATGMs Ukraine has gotten it comes out to about 20 missiles for every tank invaded with. If you add up all the contributed ATGMs it's probably about as much as the entire US military had before the conflict started. Despite this Russia still has armored vehicles conducting operations.
2. Javelins weigh 40 lbs. For infantry soldiers that's on top of the weight they normally carry - body armor, helmets, weapons, water, ammo, food, clothing. They aren't bad if you're digging in and holding an area, but straight leg infantry aren't going anywhere fast with them. 
3. Modern armies have anti-missile systems that work, not the Russian fraudware systems. They actually test these systems against weapons enemies use, and what they themselves use. So when the Israelis, the US, or other NATO countries say their systems are 90%, 75%, or 50% effective, they generally are. That being said, no system is going to stop a point blank missile attack (which will also kill the launcher).
4. Missile crews are fragile. Artillery, mortars, snipers, helicopters, infantry not to mention armored vehicles can kill them pretty easily. If the Russians did more than roll armor down roads without recon or helicopters flying above they wouldn't have been getting butchered in such large numbers.

The biggest things that the Russians have in their favour compared to the first few weeks of the war are that they've had a chance to learn from their mistakes, and that the railheads in the Donbas are nearer to the front. The latter's a genuine advantage, but I dunno if the Russian military are insitutionally capable of adapting on the fly like they'd have to if they want to actually, y'know, not get slaughtered.

If Russia is using WMDs then NATO moves in because otherwise it's not fighting a war it just got involved in. It's not complex. It's literally Russia's own doctrine used against them, escalate to de-escalate. It won't cause WW3. It will show Russia that the path of WMDs equals a Russian loss.

If NATO engages, there are multiple pathways but it's pure game theory:

1. Russia withdraws, immediately. NATO backs down. Russian army survives and Russia doesn't win but nor does it lose. Its army and regime survive.

2. Russia keeps fighting. NATO drives it out of Ukraine but no further, offers surrender, with one of two outcomes:

    a. Option 1 by delay, Russia surrenders with a slightly bigger loss. Probably, it has no standing army, potentially terms of surrender are much less favourable. Regime change is probable.

    b. Option 3's outcome by delay. Russia declines the surrender so NATO moves on Moscow. Russia is destroyed in one form or another. Possibly through nuclear war, possibly simply politically.

3. Russia uses WMDs against NATO, and receives a nuclear response. It's irrelevant to Russia what happens to NATO because in this scenario, Russia loses and hard.

b7e7f05dadc6e5b4034e45cc72754535,u64789,i584r12,"Slim. This war doesn't end until Ukraine decides that it does, so Russia won't stop until they have something defensible.

Even if Russia takes Mariupol today and declares a Novorossiya statelet that stretches from Kherson in the Southwest, running south of Zaporizhia towards Donetsk, then up the current line of contact to the Russian border, none of those lines are defensible except that chunk of land south of the Dnipro River between Kherson and Melitopol. All across the rest of the border would be flat land - difficult to control, easy to permeate.

What's Russia going to do if they declare an end to their offensives on those lines and dig in - start building gas fields, pipelines, factories, rail yards, or port expansion projects within Ukrainian artillery and missile range? Not so long as there's still a government in Ukraine contesting the territory, and not while the west is helping them do it.

Slightly more stable borders for Russia here might look like a withdrawal from Kherson across back across the river, a successful Russian push from the South or East on Dnipro, and then something like the line cut by highway E105 northeast towards Belgorod, either enveloping and retreating from Kharkiv.

But even with that, the whole stretch would look like a modern-day Maginot line - i.e. the current Donbas front x10, which wasn't sustainable either. Anything less than that and Russia is destined to walk away from this with almost nothing strategic or material. The Donbas, an industrial heartland, is fucked. Mariupol, an Azov seaport and industrial town, is fucked. Melitopol, their biggest prize so far, is a city of just 150k not inclined to collaborate. The value they can extract here is unlikely to pay for the militarization needed on the front to keep the Ukrainians from recapturing their territory.

This is because the economics don't work. Ukraine still holds Odessa and has proven that they can keep the Russian navy at bay with land-based missiles to re-establish civilian access to the seas. Though even without that, land links to the west remain effective for supply and maintaining economic activity. They could continue to supply and fight along the front line indefinitely, as long as western will and interest holds up. Russia, it seems, cannot.

The only *actually* stable border here would be Russia taking (or Balkanizing) everything east of the Dnipro. The problem is, they've been categorically unable to do so, because they haven't been able to take cities like Kiev or Chernihiv or Sumy or Kharkiv, or break out of the Donbas. Instead, they tried to go around them and quickly found that they couldn't maintain their supply lines. The current new offensive is designed to do exactly that - to concentrate power in the Southeast and break out of Donbas to give them the ability to push west.",1650300812.0,1650299182.0,t3_u64789,t1_i57mo63,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

A historical almost- parallel is the British blockade of the Norwegian coast during the Napoleonic war, after Britain forced neutral Denmark-Norway into the war by raiding Copenhagen harbor and stealing virtually the whole fleet.
Now bereft of any real naval ships, Norway hastily built lots of small rowing boats with a cannon at each end. More maneuverable than sailing ships and able to take cover in narrow waters, these rowing boats together with coastal artillery were able to prevent the large British navy from carrying out many attacks on harbour towns. However they were unable to pursue and attack the larger vessels out in open sea, so the Brits effectively blockaded the coast and prevented grain etc from being imported.

>journalists have consistently overestimated the Russian military’s ability to execute encirclements throughout the invasion.

>This could be because Russia’s military doctrine is all about identifying weaknesses and breaking through. They pound the weak point with artillery and then shove tanks in to hold the gap open and then redirect a lot more armor toward it. Once a breach is successful, the light Russian vehicles are free to attack supply lines, encircle enemy troops etc.

>If you look at any of Russia’s battle plans at any time, then, it would seem that UA’s army is always under threat of getting surrounded.

>However just because they can perform these maneuvers in a textbook doesn’t mean they are ever successful at it in practice. You need a lot of things to successfully break through enemy defenses. You need units that can quickly react to changes in a dynamic battle space. Secure, efficient comms. Secure logistics lines. Reliable equipment. Air superiority or air supremacy makes a huge difference too. You know... all the things Russia has struggled with so far.

>Not to mention Ukraine has employed a “defense in depth” strategy throughout the war. Rather than concentrating all their available forces in a solid front line, they have several layers of defensive lines and have consistently allowed Russian armor to over penetrate and make itself vulnerable to anti-armor counter attacks.

If that doesn't work - and I fully expect it won't - the West will likely double down with actual military units in some sort of defense of Ukraine (likely from the air) but try and keep the battlefield limited to that theater and part of that signaling will be to not put boots on the ground.

Also, funny things to note. I checked up on her Wiki and it talks about these nice things:

>Simonyan was born in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, into an Armenian family. Both of her parents are descendants of Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire. Her father's family, originally from Trabzon, settled in Crimea during the Armenian genocide of 1915. During World War II, they were deported to the Urals along with thousands of other Hamshen Armenians. While her father was born in Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk), her mother was born in Sochi to an Armenian family that had fled the massacres of the Armenians by the Turks in the late 19th century.

>In 2002, she became a regional correspondent for Russia's national Rossiya television channel and covered the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis. Simonyan, one of the first journalists to arrive at the scene, witnessed the killing of 334, 186 of them children. She told an interviewer ""It was the worst thing that ever happened to me,"" and that she cried frequently while trying to write about it. She then moved to Moscow and joined the Russian pool of Kremlin reporters.

Ain't that interesting? Born into a family that fled a massacre and genocide, later become a journalist that 'cried frequently' while witnessing the murder of 334 people including 186 children, and now works for RT where she makes comments [like this](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/russian-media-coverage-ukraine-genocidal-streak).

They see internal criticism as a weakness - a failure of the state to silence critics - rather than a strength - the strength to keep standing in spite of the criticism.

They see weak sanctions as a failure to muster up a stronger response, rather than as a warning - we will escalate if you do.

After years of 'getting away' with things, they have concluded that the west is weak, divided, and after every step all they do is worthless small sanctions and warn and warn they'll get serious next time. Without realizing that because of our strength we can afford not to start with serious consequences right away. Because of our strength we can afford to give them yet another opportunity to change course and stop being contrarian.

Putin thought he had in front of him a divided west that couldn't act. A west that had shown nothing but weakness in the face of his moves in Crimea, Donbas, Georgia. And from his point of view, out of nowhere the west united against him and hit him with *serious* sanctions and provided weapons.

Their current gains mean nothing since you have to ask yourself the age old question: who will stay longer, the invaders or the people who live there. The answer is always the latter.

Russia has no hope of taking Ukraine at this point, which means there will always be a cogent military force being re-supplied by NATO. For NATO, this is the greatest thing to happen to the organization in its existence: Russia now permanently bogged down in an unwinnable war that makes it an international pariah, its army getting constantly chewed up.

An invader taking a few miles of land at the start of a “surprise” invasion isn’t surprising. But there is a zero percent chance they manage to hold onto any gains in the medium and long term.

Trump,brexit,right wing parties, covid conspiracies and the resulting infighting all were heavily pushed by putin and some of that just plain wouldnt have happened.

I'm certainly not going to understate the impact of Russian propaganda in the west, but I think my argument has more to do with the strength of the Ukrainian military and the Nationalist sentiment in the country that was fostered by Poroshenko. I think Zelensky staying had a huge morale effect and more importantly, he's such a good figurehead for the state but him staying was enabled by the strength of the Ukrainian military. I also don't think *all* of those things you mentioned wouldn't have happened without Russian propaganda.

And if putin just fell down the stairs 20 years ago russia could je a rich free country and MANY bad things never wouldve happened. History is like that.

My argument is that he basically should have done this 8 years ago (again accepting the premise he *had* to do this) because the Ukrainian governments legitimacy was in a much weaker position post-Euromaidan than it was now. The military obviously and the nationalist sentiment was much weaker. 

> And if putin just fell down the stairs 20 years ago russia could je a rich free country and MANY bad things never wouldve happened.

Totally disagree, I think Putin is awful but I think westerners totally underestimate just how strong and how deep the Russian Nationalist sentiment is.

The TLDR of it is that American Wall Street actually bailed out Germany in the early 1920s. The barrels of marks used to buy a loaf of bread thing happened very early on during Germany's collapse in 1918/1919 but did not continue as a reality for long. What economically fucked Germany was the worldwide Great Depression of 1929. 

So where did sentimentality come from that would eventually lead Germany to commit vengeance on Europe? Mostly branding by extremist political groups throughout the 1920s, who tried to convince Germans throughout that period that their lives were worse than they really were.

Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites, and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Russia apparently is looking to potentially use smaller yield tactical nukes to gain an advantage. A Simple 1 kiloton airblast above lets say, a factory with many tunnels? Would take out that entire industrial complex. But thats it. 

It won't take out the whole city, although there will be a lot of blown out windows. 

Go to nuke map, you'll see a 1 kiloton blast is all thats needed to really ruin their day at the factory leaving the city intact. Being an airblast the radiation exposure is minimal, barely any. 

This sort of attack won't initiate an instant nuclear response, this is a relatively small bomb in a warzone that was inflicted upon an industrial complex full of enemies, not over the city. Although i'm not denying tensions would rise QUICK!!

While there is some quasi slave labor going on in Chinese prisons and in Xinjiang I imagine you’re not referring to those, but rather China as a whole and the perception that it’s cheap labor driving manufacturing in China. 

This couldn’t be more wrong. Today the average Chinese worker has higher wages than the average Mexican worker. While cheap labor driving manufacturing China may have been true some decades ago that’s no longer the case. 

Don’t take it from me take it from [Tim Cook](https://www.inc.com/glenn-leibowitz/apple-ceo-tim-cook-this-is-number-1-reason-we-make-iphones-in-china-its-not-what-you-think.html).

> There’s a confusion about China. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. And that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill in one location and the type of skill it is.

Ukraine is doing its best to train additional troops and obtain extra equipment. However, its best of each right now is in Donbas.

 >Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (; Russian: Владимир Владимирович Путин; [vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr vlɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪtɕ ˈputʲɪn] (listen); born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who is the president of Russia, a position he has filled since 2012, and previously from 2000 until 2008. He was also the prime minister from 1999 to 2000, and again from 2008 to 2012. Putin is the second-longest currently serving European president after Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. He worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg.
 
**[Escape trunk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_trunk)** 
 
 >An escape trunk is a small compartment on a submarine which provides a means for crew to escape from a downed submarine; it operates on a principle similar to an airlock, in that it allows the transfer of persons or objects between two areas of different pressure.
 
**[Compartment (ship)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_\(ship\))** 
 
 >A compartment is a portion of the space within a ship defined vertically between decks and horizontally between bulkheads. It is analogous to a room within a building, and may provide watertight subdivision of the ship's hull important in retaining buoyancy if the hull is damaged. Subdivision of a ship's hull into watertight compartments is called compartmentation.

At least in the context of the Holocaust, the six extermination camps- Auschwitz, Bełżec, Chełmno, Majdanek, Sobibór, and Treblinka- were even acknowledged by the Nazis themselves as existing for the sole purpose of killing as many people as possible as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the concentration camps, while they were certainly home to things like inhumane conditions and human experimentation, were at least ostensibly still work camps. Essentially, if you were sent to a concentration camp, it was still *theoretically* survivable, but if you were sent to an extermination camp, unless you were selected for the attached work camp at Auschwitz, you were already as good as dead. As an example of how brutally efficient the Nazis were to drive this point home, ~~Treblinka~~ Chełmno was presented as a transfer station where you'd get on a different van to take you to the actual camp... except it would actually fill with carbon monoxide as it drove, so that everyone in the back would be dead by the time the van reached the mass grave.

Concentration camps are certainly *bad* (and I'd argue properly include non-Nazi camps) and frequently amount to genocide, but extermination camps are an entirely different level of genocide, where you're just killing people en masse

EDIT: Also, for clarity, I'm mainly referring to the concentration camps the US sent Japanese-Americans to when I say they only *frequently* amount to genocide. Basically every other notable example throughout history, like the camps China's sending the Uyghurs to or the ones Britain sent the Boers to during the Second Boer War (which were actually the *origin* of the term) actually rises to that level.

The award is supposed to go to the person who gets the most media attention that year, as per the Post 9-11 debate, where the shortlist included both Rudy Giuliani and Osama Bin Laden.


Wikipedia suggests that Bin Laden didn't get it, because they didn't want a repeat of the backlash against the Khomeini cover, which I completely understand how fucked up it would be to give Bin Laden Person Of The Year, but I've seen their Greatest Hits and it comes off as hypocritical anyway.

Going back much further, there was a run of years that went to Franklin Roosevelt (again) followed by Haile Sellasi, Wallace Simpson, Chang Kai Shek, Soong Mei Ling, Adolf Hitler, and Josef Stalin.

Hell, we have Newt Gingrich, followed by David Ho the pioneering AIDS researcher, which is a swing hard enough to give an editor whiplash.

I don't know enough to accuse Time of having any real agenda behind the awards, beyond wanting to recap the events that sold the most newspapers, and leaning a bit far into Great Man Territory, by putting them on one person.

And even the Great Man thing is counterbalanced by the time they picked entire groups like the US Army, or Middle America.

You're now looking at a plane that is different from the enemy opposed to exactly what the enemy flies. You'll need to learn how to maximize the benefits of your aircraft vs the enemies as well minimize their benefits.

Taking out your experienced/veteran pilots on a, let's say 9 months, hail mary to train in a completely new aircraft doesn't seem like a good idea. 

You need planes in the sky now, not in 9 months. 

You don't even know if the war is still going to be fought in 9 months. Your expensive training will be for nought given that ukraine would likely get fancy 'new' nato aircraft should it be victorious instead of our old ones (f-35 are again a completely different beast from the f16 and will once again require a lot of training). And if they aren't... well no purpose in the training either. 

It's much more efficient, and quicker, to find the aircraft that they are accustomed to. 

NATO countries should just have the balls to deliver these aircraft to Ukraine. And with them supplying heavier and heavier weapons and now that offensive weapons like tanks are on the table, maybe there will be room for this type of transaction after all.

But let's say no one in NATO is able or willing, for neutralities sake, to provide ukraine with those planes. Even then they can be widely sourced from countries that do, or used to fly them that are not NATO members.

NATO could then provide financial assistance for the purchase and allow ukraine to 'buy' the aircraft itself instead of being given the aircraft. The country that then supplies the aircraft could then hide behind the 'they bought it' argument and still claim neutrality.

I think Zelensky staying had a huge morale effect and more importantly, he's such a good figurehead for the state but him staying was enabled by the strength of the Ukrainian military. I also don't think all of those things you mentioned wouldn't have happened without Russian propaganda. 

Im not saying nothing of that wouldnt have happened. Its all of it was heavily supported by putin.
I think alot of the modern problems in the us are made by russian money. See moscow mitch, gop members visiting russia on july4th etc and trumps win was damn close. Without putins meddling i dont think he wouldve won.
Ofc covid conspiracies still wouldve existed but there is a reason why like 80% of the crazy antivaxxers i know also support russia now. Cause they get their ""information"" from russian channels on facebook,telegram etc
Also the rise of right wing extremist autocrats overall has many reasons but its no coincidence that they all lick daddy putins boots.

>My argument is that he basically should have done this 8 years ago (again accepting the premise he had to do this) because the Ukrainian governments legitimacy was in a much weaker position post-Euromaidan than it was now. The military obviously and the nationalist sentiment was much weaker. 

Its really hard to say. What you say is def right. But the world was a different place back then. How would the us and eu reacted? Ukraine definitly was way weaker in evry way tho and his 2/3 day plan hat huge chances of success. But maybe even putin wasnt so far gone back then to risk it all. Proxy wars and cyberwarfare are one thing. Just randomly starting a war in a country is a different beast.
I really dont know how things wouldve turned out and its 2am and im sleepy so my brain cant even fully wrap around all the different factors back then.

>Totally disagree, I think Putin is awful but I think westerners totally underestimate just how strong and how deep the Russian Nationalist sentiment is.

Navalny is the face of the opposition in the West but really his biggest critics are people who just want him to invade Poland for example. Russian ultranationalist lunatics.

They've handed it down to their troops, and they execute along that plan.   As long as the assault stays on plan, they're able to push deep into territory.

The inflexion point, however, is invariably when something goes off of plan.  The Russian battlefield communications are spotty (unless they use unsecured communication lines, which are risky on their own), so they can't get the orders, support requests, and other essential bits of information beyond what they can see.  They don't have a core of experienced, independent leadership on the field, which means they are left to guess at what to do until they talk to their headquarters units for new plans.

That pretty much means that for us to know for sure whether the Russian attacks are effective, we have to wait a few days since the Ukrainians are more likely to adjust on the fly, hit the tactical objectives they need to, get the support they need and leave the Russian units stranded.

“Appeasement” is being overused here. This is NOT WW2, which I don’t feel like getting into again tonight but most experts believe the time to have stopped the Nazi’s, and been able to actually do so, would have been when they re-militarized the Rhineland, which was in 1936 and too little to actually justify direct military involvement in Germany again. People obviously did not have the benefits of hindsight in 1936… By the time they invaded Poland, or even threatened to forcibly take parts of Czechoslovakia it was too late (Czech - May/March ‘39, invasion of Poland Sep/Oct ‘39 nvm with Soviet help, and France with UK help got spanked 8 short months later May/June ‘40….) It was simply too late by the time Hitler started showing outward aggression. 

Appeasement gets used a lot in that context too, but invading Germany in ‘36 would have been seen as aggression by France/UK (remember no hindsight this is 1936) and by ‘39 it was too late.

 >Ukraina is a Ukrainian  Slava-class cruiser originally ordered by the Soviet Union in the early 1980s under the name Admiral Flota Lobov. After the Soviet Union disbanded in the early 1990s, the ship passed on to Russia and then to Ukraine, assuming the name Ukraina. In 2010 the Ukrainian parliament stripped the ship of its name. The ship remains unfinished and is currently moored at the Mykolayiv Shipyard (former 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant).

The god of logistics doesn't care if you're a ruthless dictator or not.

- Troops who aren't fed won't fight.

- Tanks without fuel won't move.

- Tanks, planes and helicopters are useless without people trained to operate them.

- As long as they have good supply lines, well trained and motivated troops supported by drones, armor and artillery can hold off unmotivated, untrained conscripts essentially forever.

Russia's big problem isn't just that its suffered very heavy casualties, but those casualties have been  amongst their most experienced and professional troops. This is far more of a problem now than it might have been 30 or 60 years ago, because the amount of firepower and equipment a technically skilled infantry squad can utilise (think stingers, guided anti tank missiles, drone guided artillery, night vision attacks) is so out of proportion to conscripts with assault rifles.

Unfortunately, it was already too late by that point because there was already a new elite in power and no protest or sincere political movement could change it. So they either emigrated or resigned themselves to accepting the situation. 

Of course, these western-minded Russians are not the majority, not by a long shot.

* Concentration camp: Older term, dating back to the Second Boer War, and more broadly refers to places where people are sent for no other supposed crime than who they are. (Paraphrased from a joint statement by the American Jewish League and the Japanese-American National Museum) These always rise to at least the level of violence on the Pyramid of Hate, with many, like the Nazi concentration camps and the camps China's currently sending the Uyghurs to, rising further to the level of genocide

* Extermination camp: More recent term, actually borrowed from the Nazis. Refers to the six camps the Nazis acknowledged as existing for the sole purpose of killing as many people as possible as quickly as possible, although if, God forbid, any country rose to that level of genocide again, I think it'd be reasonable to extend usage of the term

Also, because this is always contentious. I think it's important to use the term ""concentration camp"" for more things than just the Nazi camps and lookalikes, because it helps prevent the normalization of ""lesser"" forms of hatred, which makes it harder for societies to rise to Nazi levels of genocide again. Focusing on the American camps from WW2, because they're at the heart of this debate, we should be happy that we didn't rise to the level of genocide, but we should also be appalled that anti-Asian sentiments were already so rampant that it only took 2 months from Pearl Harbor for EO 9066 to be issued.

Even going as far as to confirm the deaths of crewmembers, even the CO of the ship.  Note the mood has changed somewhat, with apparent revenge attacks being carried out.  I'm not sure where it went down, or exactly when, but I'm confident the ship was lost.

I'm no expert, but for a ship to be listing as heavily as it is in the leaked photos and video clips, with multiple holes in the side at (or below) water level, tells me she's taking on water - not sure what proper repair / fire control procedure would be for a ship that is taking on water as well as being on fire, but adding water to a ship that is taking on water doesn't seem like a good plan.

I'd imagine warships having pumps on board to pump out seawater in the event of a hull breach (like I said, I'm no expert but this does seem like a logical type of equipment for them to have), but I'd also imagine the fire having the potential to take out the power source and/or control systems for those pumps, if not the pumps themselves.

EDIT:  I don't reckon we'll ever see proof of the sinking of the Moskva unless the Russian government shows it, or some other navy finds the wreck on the seabed.  But my feeling is that the damage was too severe for them to be able to repair it at sea, or to tow it back to port, and that it sank as a result of damage sustained.  I strongly suspect the Ukrainians destroyed the Moskva as claimed, judging purely on the reactions of the Russians (retaliatory strikes), but again, I have no proof.

German debt to GDP was 82% in 2010, went down to 60% in 2019 and is back up at 72% now after the Pandemic, that's still a reduction of 8% in 10 years. Meanwhile other major European economies are up above 100% and increased debt by >20% of GDP over the course of the pandemic.

It's a rule they only added in 2009 and is very misguided anyways, you're supposed to reduce debt in good times so you can increase it if needed during bad times (like a Pandemic), and that's exactly what Germany is doing.
They increased it from 60% to 82% between 2000 and 2010, decreased it to 60% until 2019 and increased it to 72% over the Pandemic. Can you spell out what exactly about this is ""out of control""?",False,1650307786.0,t3_u64789,t1_i58gnod,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

Ofc they wouldnt. Was just hyperbole to show that you dont have to be in the blast radius to die/suffer and that an event on that scale can still have worldwide effects.

>Third, youre implying nukes would target cities. This mostly wouldn't be the case unless a city was strategic in some kind of way. Like a port or a strategic chokepoint. You can't win a war by bombing civilians.

You dont think berlin,paris,washington etc etc would be on the list of targets in case of a major escalation? Thats a little bit naive dont you think?

I fail to see how the war has any bearing on any of this. Invasions happen kind of semi-regularly and sovereignty must be defended. We've been dealing with unsavory actors with oil/gas and hostile nuclear armed nations for decades. Russian propaganda has been going on for the better part of a century. 

> It’d promote countries to give up the ideas of cooperation and mutual support (well no one helped Ukraine how can i know they’ll help me?),

Uh. I must be missing something here. Ukraine, a country that isn't a part of a mutual defense alliance and likely wouldn't have been invaded if they were part of one, would be used as an example as to why one shouldn't join a mutual defense alliance because no one went to war to defend them when they got invaded?

Am I getting that right?

A swimming pool with a capacity of 200,000L is 50% filled at 100,000L, and a glass with a capacity of 1L is 50% filled at 0.5L

If you add 50,000L to the pool it can easily absorb it, if you add 50,000L to a glass it will overflow very dramatically.

If you have a glass of 1L at 50% full and you increase the glasses size by a factor of two, it will suddenly be 25% full.

If a county has a GDP of $4T and $2T in debt it has a 50% debt to GDP ratio, and taking on another $1T in debt isn't crippling.

A country with a GDP of $0.5T and $0.25T in debt has a 50% debt to GDP ratio, but taking on another $1T in debt will raise its ratio to 250% and is a crippling blow.

Meanwhile a country with a GDP of $50T and $25T of debt has a 50% debt to GDP ratio as well, but taking on another $1T of debt is barely noticeable and raises its debt to GDP ratio only up to 52%.

Someone who makes $1 a day and ows someone $100 is severely in debt, but someone who makes $500 a day and ows someone $100 has barely any debt at all. To have the same debt load as the other guy he would have to owe $50,000.

It doesn't matter if you're talking about single digit dollars or trillions of dollars. Ratios matter.

I'm in the telegram chats, I comment in every thread, I changed my tune from ""Ukraine will probably lose"" to ""Ukraine will probably win.""

Do you want me to say Ukraine hasn't lost a single soldier the entire war? Is that good enough for you?

If victory is not annexing a large chunk of a country, what is? Is the only victory in your mind when a nation completely annex another nation? Because if so, you need to spend some time reading about actual wars and less time playing paradox games.",1650312689.0,1650312358.0,t3_u64789,t1_i5913k5,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
