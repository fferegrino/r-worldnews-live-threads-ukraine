Day 292 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another very quiet day with nothing much happening. There was just a single air raid alert which was activated at 1am and ended at 2am. The border towns continue to get shelled as usual, but I don’t think Kupiansk was shelled today, or at least it wasn’t reported and it doesn’t always get reported.

It looks like Kherson is now getting shelled pretty much non-stop every single day, just as it was with Kharkiv while Russians were still close enough for their artillery to reach us. Sadly, there are reports of shelling in Kherson multiple times per day and it is civilians that get targeted every single time. 

Remember when Russians were saying that we are shelling our own cities in the first months of the war? It sounded extremely stupid back then, but it looks even more stupid now, because Kherson was basically untouched by shelling while Russians were occupying it, but as soon as they left it started to get shelled mercilessly, almost exclusively targeting civilians too.

— The Kyiv Independent 


As I've said many times: The best security guarantee Russia can have is to be surrounded by NATO members.  Since NATO is a defensive alliance, Russia knows it will never be attacked.  Furthermore, Russia also can't be impulsive, and just fly off and attack a neighbor with disastrous results. Because they know if they attack a neighbor, they're a NATO member and it will be curtains for Russia. 

Anyway, Russia's doing all it can to make sure all its neighbors fucking WANT to join NATO. So I think Russia understands that this will be better for them, in the long run.

Vladimir Putin has no soul, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden concluded after meeting with the Russian leader at the Kremlin in 2011, according to an article in the New Yorker published online on Monday.

Biden told the magazine about his 2011 visit with Putin, who at the time was prime minister, and said he found himself just inches away from the Russian leader.

“I said, ‘Mr. Prime Minister, I’m looking into your eyes, and I don’t think you have a soul,’” Biden told the magazine. “He looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, ‘We understand one another.’”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-biden/u-s-vice-president-biden-says-putin-has-no-soul-new-yorker-idUSKBN0FQ1CU20140721

And in 2021:  You can’t accuse President Joe Biden of holding back on what he truly thinks of Vladimir Putin. In pretty extraordinarily frank comments to ABC News, Biden described Putin as a “killer” devoid of a human soul.

Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, who asked: “So, you know Vladimir Putin. You think he’s a killer?” Without hesitation, the president replied, “Mmm hmm, I do.”

Well would you look at that, time to cut military aid under some insane pretenses, to make sure Ukraine CANNOT mount more offensive action and liberate more land. 

As much as i dislike Arestovich, he translated an opinion, shared by people in our military, that US does not help us with weapons, or stocks for operation. They are all slow and planned deliveries, and now, for whatever reason, US wants Ukraine to slow down. So they are limiting help that is providing, making sure that winter months will not see any major action, just like Milley and others wanted.

People are saying this is happening because US does not want Russia defeated fast. Because they are afraid of fallout, or nuclear escalation. That this slow, eroding style is “dealing” with Russia, and neutralizing them safely. Well for one, I am not sure US “wants” to “deal” or “neutralize” Russia at all.

This works psychologically in many ways for the ground soldier. They know that a priority is going to be given to them. The main thing is they know won't be abandoned or forgotten about. That someone will at least try to help and save them. Then to know that if the worst does happen. Their body won't be left to rot on the side of some road. That there will at least be a serious attempt to recover their remains for their families.

Margins are so high companies are more than happy to pay for access to markets. Something like a thousand billion dollars worth of oil has been shipped from Iraq since 2003, there is plenty to go around, especially for multinationals. At the time it was estimated that 90% of Iraq's oil was unexplored. What they can't abide by is an administration not friendly to the West just sitting on those reserves and potentially using it for nefarious purposes. I kind of like this take on it by the Brookings Inst [2002]:

>As conventionally understood, the American strategy is based on a resolve to assure the flow of oil to the West at reasonable prices—a resolve that extends to mitigating short-term interruptions in oil supply and subsequent spikes in pricing by relying on states, notably Saudi Arabia, that have excess capacity. (This alone requires Saudi-U.S. cooperation to assure that the Saudi capacity is used as a moderating force on the oil market.) But for more than half a century a central drive behind the American military strategy in the oil-rich region—one that has been not fully understood by most analysts—has been to deny the control of such vast resources to powerful enemies who would thereby become even more powerful and thus more threatening.",False,1670891284.0,t3_zjmbux,t1_izzhjfk,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
