Day 373-374 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Not much has happened in these past 2 days, other than some air raid alerts it was almost completely quiet here. Though we did actually have quite a lot of alerts, 8 alerts today and 5 yesterday, most of them were pretty uneventful, but apparently during one of them Zaporizhzhia was hit with missiles yet again.

Looks like they aimed at energy infrastructure this time, as there were some reports of blackouts in some districts of Zaporizhzhia. Those bastards still think they can terrorize civilians by targeting us, they really just never learn. Sadly, the death toll from the previous attack on an apartment building in the same city just a couple of days ago has increased by a lot. There were only 2 confirmed deaths at first, but now the number of deaths is already up to 11, including 1 child, and the rubble is still not completely cleared, so there could be even more casualties.

It’s honestly pretty sad that a tragedy like this is barely even talked about, but in a way it’s kind of understandable, because there were so many of those terror strikes that we just got very used to seeing them by this point. So, when a new one happens it gets a bit of outrage, a telegram post and a news article (if even that). It's ridiculous that something like this can pretty much become normalized, but here we are, seeing it happen right before our eyes in real time.",False,1677968927.0,t3_11howbd,t3_11howbd,,0,140,0,140,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 04 March 2023  


* The Ukrainian defence of the Donbas town of Bakhmut is under increasingly severe pressure, with intense fighting taking place in and around the city.  

* Regular Russian Army and Wagner Group forces have made further advances into the northern suburbs of the city, which is now a Ukrainian-held salient, vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides.  

* Ukraine is reinforcing the area with elite units, and within the last 36 hours two key bridges in Bakhmut have been destroyed, including a vital bridge connecting the city to the last main supply route from Bakhmut to the city of Chasiv Yar.  

* Ukrainian-held resupply routes out of the town are increasingly limited.

&nbsp;

I'll try to explain what I'm thinking about here. 
First, Bakhmut. That battle has been ongoing for half a year. Throughout its been pretty clear that the battles are hard, close and intense. A lot of the reason for that is that Bakhmut had been heavily fortified before the Russians got there. Its also because relatively quickly it became apparent that the Russians could not punch through there with mechanized units in manouver warfare, so it devolved into a slugfest with artillery, storminfantry and fortified positions.

&nbsp;

That situation is not complex to evaluate; when it comes to artillery, the russians had numerical advantage, but this has been offset by the Ukrainians both having got access to more precise artillery systems, but also having demonstrated better ability with artillery overall. We know this is the case, because in a battle of that character, any side that gains complete superiority in artillery simply wins after a while. So for artillery; relative parity. Infantry: the Russians have had the advantage. As they had to. You can not attack any fortified position unless you outnumber your enemy by a factor of 4 to 1. We know the Russians gave resorted to mass infantry attacks, we know they had huge losses, so yes they had the advantage. Air; almost inconsequential for both sides. None of them do much flying and its mostly unguided rockets being used. Drones; The Ukrainians have the advantage, by far. They are also using it integrated with command and control, for artillery spotting and for recon, not just grenade drops. Tanks: The Russians have been using more, but it has not worked well for them. Most likely, the Ukrainians have not even needed to use theirs as much. They have access to far better ATGM's and tons of it. Plus their artillery guys being both good and being supplied specialiced anti-armor ammo. Plus prolific use of mines.

&nbsp;

Even so, the Russians have crept forward. And we see a lot of effort from the Russian side to whip up a panic. There's also quite a few both Ukrainians and westerners who are distraught at the conditions in Bakhmut and why Ukraine just don't pull back and defend further back without danger of a developing encirclement.

&nbsp;

So what of the rest of Ukraine? Well, there's plenty of fighting going on. Its easy to get a feeling that 800 Russians and God knows how many Ukrainians die in Bakhmut ever day. This is however not the case. There's fighting along large portions of the entire front. And yet there's almost no one worried about Ukraine imminently losing there. I don't even see anyone suggesting that if Bakhmut falls the entire frontline might collapse in and signal an imminent collapse.

&nbsp;

Why is that? Its because no one thinks this is the case. Pessimists predict frozen frontlines everywhere else and collapse at Bakhmut locally will lead to having to negotiate. Moderates believe Bakhmut possibly can hold, will be offset later by an offensive. Optimists think an offensive is coming and will be succesful.

&nbsp;

The thing is, if you look aside from the worst pessimists and the outright kremlin fanboys...we know a few things are indisputable.

&nbsp;

Ukraine started mobilising long before the Russians did. Their troops have had ample time to have thorough training done. We know they had to refuse a lot of volunteers. So they got a very large influx of troops more than 10 months ago, have not been seen to need any new large mobilisation rounds outside a controlled ongoing mobilisation. They also have recieved *a shitton* of western gear now, that has almost without exceptions hardly been seen in battle. And I'm talking about when they started getting tracked IFV's and onwards. We've seen a very moderate use of artillery, despite them having recieved **a lot**. 

&nbsp;

Its very very obvious, the Ukrainians have been building reserves. And logic deduction simply tells us they are large, well trained, well equipped and forming into a mechanized force (or forces) we have not seen on that scale since the Gulf war.

&nbsp;

Something is coming. Something large. And yet even suspecting this, we question the wisdom of continuing the Bakhmut fight.

&nbsp;

Its fairly obvious to me at least, that the reason Bakhmut has been so hard a fight, isnt because the Ukrainians are constantly almost on the verge of losing it and can not affect that situation. We *know* they habe reserves and gear that could make a difference.

&nbsp;

So why then?

&nbsp;

Because when you're fighting an invader, its hellishly advantageous to have him hitting a hardpoint of your choosing. It ties down his forces, it bleeds him and it takes his attention away from other places you may be weak. Or quite the opposite, where you are becoming very strong. So if you can present a target that looks tempting, you can give the impression you are loosing a lot of troops, and ideally almost continously are on the verge of breaking, that is a trap it is hard for an attacker to resist. Is it going to be hard for your troops there? Yes. Will you have to replenish a minimum of reinforcements now and then? Yes. Do you run the risk of troops and population being demoralized? Yes.

&nbsp;

But if you manage to inflict *at minimum* the usual loss ratios of attackers vs defenders on him, it may still be worth it, if you can prevent him from that victory for a long time. I can't source this because its just my impression from all osint, military and various other sources I follow...Ukraine is doing better than minimum.

&nbsp;

So yeah, I don't get the despair over Bakhmut. I think its worked exactly as designed and presented to the enemy. Its almost too clear that Ukraine had material and troops and strategic advantages that could have been employed to strenghten Bakhmut at almost any point during the last 6 months, but has chosen not to. I also happend to think Ukraine now has reserves readying that should make Russuan commanders piss themselves when they start moving, and I think that wether or not Ukraine has to finally pull back a bit from Bakhmut in the coming weeks or not is *inconsequential*.

&nbsp;

Because I'm fairly certain now a storm is coming. And its going to be the storm of a century. And for the Russians its already too late to start to react to it. They have a few weeks of spring thaw left as a grace period. And then it starts....

&nbsp;

EDIT;
I'm also going to toss in a small handgrenade into the debate regarding western aid, how fast its coming and if we could have helped Ukraine win faster. This one is very cynical, but I think it has to be at least considered and debated.

&nbsp;

Lets say we had done so. If we had set Ukraine up for a situation where they beat the Russian forces in Ukraine much faster. Lets say they beat them back in Donbas last September, then used the winter campaigning season to assault Crimea and were about to take that now. Lets assume this presented Putin finally with a fait accompli; He'd have to trust that Ukraine stuck to the 91' borders and did not enter Russia proper. Lets say he then did pull them back, defending that however he would come up with back home. And lets say everyone was rational and no nukes were tried.

So it ended.

&nbsp;

Would that be the best ending of the war for Ukraine? Speaking *very* cynically, that would have left Russia with a lot more ballistic and cruise missiles, a lot more armor, artillery, ammunition, planes, IFV's and of course manpower. A lot more material to rebuild your armed forces and go again quite simply. And that *is* a thing Russia does. Has done. Will do again.

&nbsp;

So if you knew you had control enough that you knew you'd win...you could start running numbers on wether the best thing for your country and how many soldiers and civilians you're bound to lose to this conflict and the next might not be an argument to draw your win out a while...to savage Russia so she wouldnt be a threat again for a lot longer. That is a very cynical play. A hasardous one too. But probably one a state leader and army command would have to at least visit once in a discussion of options.

Of course the answer to this is to win as soon as possible, and then get into NATO. The problem with that is NATO has a few fickle members that would make it a little hard for you to trust a fixed timeline for entry.",1677988777.0,1677987086.0,t3_11howbd,t3_11howbd,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

>!For an IR seeker-head system, first you activate the coolant bottle on the front (usually with a button switch) to cool the seeker.  After a brief period it'll beep/click/light up a light/etc to let you know it's good usually.  Then you aim it at the contrails or shape you see in the sky; you don't have to be on target, just ""in the area"".  Do NOT aim in the 10-20d area of the sun or you'll flash-blind the bloody IR seeker and it's now a 10 kilo club!!<

>!Next, press button to uncage the seeker; a tone will begin or the system will begin to vibrate.  At this point track the target smoothly, with the appropriate lead-off if/as indicated by the sighting system of your system of choice (Igla, Strela, Stinger, etc).  Some like a little lead, some none, it's more ""nice to have"".!<

>!The system will indicate by change of state (audible, haptic, and/or sight; you will unambiguously know) that it's got a solid lock, its sensor has found the target amidst the background via contrast seeking.  Hold the tube STEADY AND SMOOTHLY as you depress the trigger, as with any recoilless device.  The first stage motor will eject the missile to a safe distance, at which point, it will fire the sustaining motor and seek in, usually with APN guidance and a thermal sensor.  Arming's usually a bit downrange so don't worry if you're in a treeline.!<

>!Past that you should relocate.  Fast.  Like really really fast.  As in, ""you are going to be shot at very very soon by a lot of people with a lot of weapons"" fast.  The missile will rapidly determine an angle that the target has from its own center, and attempt to keep the target at this relative angle as it flies; if it does this, it will automatically lead the target.  It only has to get close, since like an old WW2 AA shell, SAMs have proximity fuses (usually several lasers like ""tripwires"", and directional fragmentation warheads of long strips of steel or tungsten).!<

^(Note1: none of this applies to Starstreak.  I have no idea the specific sequence for it, but I believe it's the same as an ATGM--basically, point, track target smoothly, squeeze trigger, wait until target no longer exists.  It fires 3 darts that operate as kinetic ATGMs basically, but so fast they can beam-ride onto aircraft.)

^(Note2: for those who are worried this is somehow ""forbidden knowledge"", it is all publicly available.  US Army manuals should be available, Soviet manuals almost certainly are, and training vids and such were posted in the early days of the war to help Ukrainian civilians and guerillas.

It btw sees farther ahead in the sky than your eyes usually can and you'll be prewarned by radards in the area of incoming direction most often.

>Carrying a 60ft metal bridge, the Armoured Vehicle-Launched Bridge tank could help Ukraine if they launch an offensive.

>It is the first time such a vehicle has been supplied to the country, which can fire a bridge forward over difficult terrain.
""This is probably 90% an offensive [weapon],"" said security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke. 

>""Because if you're on the defence, if you're falling back, you blow up the bridges and get on the other side of them.

>""If you're moving forward, you need something to get over small obstacles pretty quickly, so this is what troops use,"" he said, adding he expects the US to send eight of the vehicles.

>He continued: ""The Ukrainians will need them for the offensive that they're planning. It hasn't started yet but when it does start, it will be conducted with some of the best equipment in the world - including the launched bridge.""

So far according to Oryx, what has been delivered/pledged: 700+ tanks, 400+ IFVs, thousands of APCs, and 800+ artillery pieces. Only a fraction of that is being deployed, which means those 10+ brigades are likely being trained. And that's not even to mention the hundreds of captured tanks, IFVs, and APCs from Russia, which are more than enough to offset current Ukrainian equipment losses.

After the early days of the war, I think almost every piece of ground russia has gained has always been ""russia grinds itself against Ukrainian defenses until Ukraine withdraws in an orderly fashion"". Sievierodonetsk , Lysychansk, Soledar, from the rumours it sounds like Bakhmut too. I'm not sure about ""baiting"" and such, but Ukraine is definitely using ""defense in depth"" very well. Defend when it's advantageous to you, pull back when pulling to the next positions is more beneficial to you.

In a sense those are victories for russia, for sure, since technically capturing the front line cities is the first step towards conquering the whole country.

However, at the pace and with the losses they've taken to capture those cities, it is not a sustainable strategy (technically what they did with Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk maybe could have been sustainable, but that was pre-HIMARS when they still had plenty of ammo available for artillery - that's no longer possible). They've been fighting over Bakhmut for what, 8 months? And it's still just one city, and not a very large city either (I think it ranked something like #35 by pre-war population - not nothing, but not huge either). 

The difference with Kherson is that Ukraine would have liked to keep Bakhmut because they don't want to give _anything_ up, but it's not hugely important strategically otherwise. Kherson however was the foothold russia had on the other side of the Dniepr, and losing that means they can't even try to assault Ukraine in that direction anymore. 

It was definitely a big strategic loss for russia in that sense even if the tactical retreat itself went ok. I guess it was not possible to do any offensives through there anyway since Ukraine had fire control over the river crossings for a long time, but Kherson definitely had a lot more strategic importance than Bakhmut, for example.

It's a few things compounding.

- they went from an attempt at modern maneuver warfare with combined arms tactics in the first 2 months to an artillery war

- they used a TON of their shell stockpile and something that is very rarely spoken about - powder bags.

- to get max range out of your artillery you need additional explosive charges

- these, like everything else the Russians have, were not well stored

- they work but cause heavy fouling of the barrels

- the # of rounds, shittiness of the shells and powder, and firing them at max range GREATLY reduced barrel life

- Russia, just like with it's tanks, can't replace the barrels fast enough

- the only way to preserve the artillery, accuracy and barrels they have remaining is to use less charge 

- less charge = less distance

- NATO/West has been supplying VERY accurate artillery and artillery radar for counter-battery work

Although, I S W said was to halt RF advance while UA pulled back.

Africans can see a black president in the US (recently), black/colored top politicians in the US (e.g. vice president Kamala Harris), Indian prime minister in the UK (parents immigrated from Africa), women leaders in the EU etc.

But they want to support the white male racist with imperial ambitions, who hates black people (Julia Ioffe's words, not mine), in the Kremlin. A country who would never let a black person anywhere *near* an official office of importance. They want to support that instead. Mkaaaaayyyyy.

But yea, the Kremlin's disinformation campaign in Africa is working. I think that's the main takeaway.

If the West started actively running campaigns, as a counter-narrative, showing Africans that in the US and Europe you can become president/prime minister because you are seen as equal, unlike in Russia where blacks are treated as inferior, sentiments could change.

>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener. 

More of the blurb:  
>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children.

They do have a value and a role in a modern battlefield. Russia actually showcased some of that value in the early days of the war, with what was a bold (and at least initially) successful airborne operation that relied heavily on transport helicopters alongside attack helicopters for CAS missions. Though their mission ultimately failed, the failures were more likely due to the utterly inadequate planning by the Russian MoD than to the assets that were used in those airborne operations.  


Also worth pointing out that during the siege of Mariupol, Ukraine was using helicopters as a way to evacuate wounded personel out of the city as well as to bring in more supplies, apparently they sustained heavy losses in those operations but it may have been worth it for the Ukrainians, because each day that the Ukrainians held at Mariupol was one extra day for the Ukrainians in the donbas to improve their defenses in order to meet the next Russian offensive in the Donbas. 

Attack helicopters do very much have a role to play in the modern battlefield, even in a situation like this where they are being used heavily as a way to launch unguided rockets at enemy positions, they may not be cost effective, like i'm sure that nobody will buy a Helicopter if all they want that helicopter to do is to launch unguided rockets at enemy positions, but that is not the only thing these helicopters do. They do other missions as well, it's just not usually well reported, or captured on camera. Like for example that ukrainian raid on Belgorod, we only know it was Ukrainian helicopters that did that mission because of a security camera that captured the helicopters firing rockets at the fuel tanks. What these videos show is that attack helicopters, and even transport helicopters can be very versatile, and adapted to different missions if their intended mission proves to be too difficult, there are always other missions that they can do as well.",False,1677984339.0,t3_11howbd,t1_jayo7m5,,4,3,0,3,0,0,
