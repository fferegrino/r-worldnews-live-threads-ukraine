Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 9 April 2023.

On 5 April 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a full session of Russia‚Äôs Security Council, the first such event since October 2022.

The main report was presented by Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, and discussed reconstruction, law enforcement and public order in the illegally-annexed areas of Ukraine.

The choice of Kolokoltsev as the main speaker is likely an attempt by the Kremlin to portray the situation in those territories as being normalised.

In reality, much of the area remains an active combat zone, subject to partisan attacks, and with extremely limited access to basic services for many citizens.

Basically, it's an AI that fuses different data together from satellites and other sources to determine where the next images would be taken from. It tells satellites to take certain images it believes will be valuable.

For instance, a satellite sees that there are fewer planes than usual at an airbase. Then the AI estimates the most likely position of the planes to see them in flight and confirm their intent.

Another scenario could be a specific military vehicle is seen by a member of the pubic and they post a video online. Then the AI does it's best to direct satellite assets to observe and follow the vehicle.

Seems to be plausible, given that sounds like a logical evolution of the system we already knew about that was used in Iraq/Afghanistan. I forgot the direct name, but it started as a way to splice video from multiple drone cameras together (on the same drone) on the map. With the miniaturization of camera modules via smartphones, BAE System made one with something like 128 cameras -- the frame by frame data load was massive (something like 1Tbps), so they developed an algorithm that segmented the map into a grid and detected changes in motion on that grid, then saved just the changing fields, cutting data load tremendously. 

The UI allows a centcom to see and rewind the changes throughout the observational periods. They were using it in Iraq to detect IED placement. It's truly ""Enemy of the State"" (movie) type stuff.

This new capability seems to be an evolution to automate even more of it and integrate with wider array of sensors/observers to push to a master intelligence map, and most likely categorize the changes (e.g. vehicle, vehicle category, person) so a person doesn't have to.

My main takeaway from these polls is that both Biden and Trump are incredibly weak, disliked candidates.

The last time we had two strongly disliked candidates was Hillary and Trump, and we know what happened there. 

Trump is the same awful person as always, but for whatever reason that doesn't seem to cut into his bedrock support. Meanwhile, Biden's lost a lot of approval and popularity after going into office.

I don't believe there's a precedent for NATO admitting a nation actively at war with a major NATO adversary - presumably if Ukraine were to join NATO prior to the cessation of hostilities it would come at the cost of not being able to invoke Article 5. It would also raise the question of whether NATO, by admitting Ukraine, was tacit declaring war on Russia.

Only a very small number of countries objected to Finland joining and it was mostly over political jostling, not really Finland themselves.

Ukraine have shown themselves to be more than worthy, and more than capable, of NATO membership. They're already a strategic partner. They already are moving fast towards NATO standardisation in their military. They would absolutely be prepared to repay any perceived ""debt"" to existing NATO members calling for aid in the future.

It depends, simply, on how this war ends. The better Ukraine's position at the end of it, the better their chances of NATO admission.

If it ends in a negotiation where Ukraine concedes territory, and Russia remains armed and aggressive, then no, Ukraine aren't getting in. The risk of a second invasion by Russia triggering WW3 will panic certain other countries into saying no. If it ends with Ukraine taking back everything and Russia capitulating or backing down, there's a good chance they get in. If it ends with outright collapse of Russia and overwhelming Ukrainian victory then it's almost a case of NATO joining Ukraine rather than the other way around, and yeah, they get in pretty much automatically. 

Basically, if Ukraine single-handedly (pretty much) neutralises one of the largest threats to NATO (and the threat NATO was originally formed to counter), then the risk of anything needing a major NATO response drops to almost nil and there's no risk to admitting Ukraine.

IIRC such celebrations have been going on at least 3000-4000 years in some places. It's not hard to find evidence of other such celebrations going back around as far. e.g. I believe it was something like a festival of Dionysus (Ancient Greece) roughly correlating to Christmas/Winter solstice.

Some types of holidays, while taking on religious meaning are also celebrated by non-religious or other religious peoples in various countries these days, thus taking on a more cultural rather religious observance.

In Australia for example, public holidays are often in line with Christian holidays but we are not that Christian and very secular and multicultural but almost everyone celebrates them regardless.

That's simply not true; you're being hyperbolic. ""Completely unreliable"" is *literally* untrue and is a different beast from 'not completely accurate' which was the reality. The polls always characterized a close election, which is what we got. The polls predicted most elections correctly. The polls not being able to resolve a difference within 5% is a valid concern, but that was not my point. My point was the election is likely to be close again.

Additionally, you are not honoring *the direction of the bias* in which the polls tended to be wrong. They tended to under-estimate conservative performance. Therefore, all of the available evidence we have suggests we ignore a potentially close election at our peril.

> You're better off looking at betting sites.

So completely ignore any polling methodology and survey bias? Have you stopped to ask yourself what the population composition of the betting sites is? The gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status of the participants? What data could you possibly have that suggests it will be less prone to long term errors and bias than current polling?

There was less voter suppression so Trump got more votes in 2020 than in 2016? Trump voters aren't the usual crowd that's being suppressed. 

Also, isn't it more likely that there would have been more voter suppression when Trump was in power, than when Obama was in power?


>his demographics are shrinking. That is an unarguable fact.

People have been saying the GOP voter base will die off for decades, but they're still raising shitty young people.

Also, him having more votes in 2020 than 2016 after his continuous fuckups would indicate the point can be argued. (As well as just population growth in general.)

It's fun how easily things you want to be true graduate to fact.
