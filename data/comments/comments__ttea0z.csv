The teenagers in the southern city of Penza are said to have recorded a conversation with Irina Gen, their English teacher, on 18 March.  


  
They were apparently upset that a planned sports trip to the Czech Republic was not going ahead and asked Ms Gen for her opinion.  


  
According to an alleged transcript of the conversation published by the Meduza website, she said it was right that the trip had been cancelled and that such things would continue until Russia ""started behaving in a civilised way"".

Day 36 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was actually pretty quiet in my area the whole day. We don’t even count the sound of our artillery as “dangerous” sound anymore, and there was plenty of it throughout the day. But from the reports Saltivka was yet again shelled relentlessly, well not just Saltivka but more the whole east part of Kharkiv.

By comparison the west part of our city where I live is very safe, some people from destroyed districts have already moved here. Our counteroffensives here seem effective as we rarely hear combat close to the city. There is an explanation as to why east Kharkiv is being shelled so much. First is that it’s basically on the path to Izyum which Russians need to control to be able to flank our forces in Donbass. Second is that almost the whole east part of Kharkiv is industrial zone full of all kinds of factories which Russians explicitly target.

But for them it seems like a residential buildings is just as good of a target as a tank factory. Just 2 days ago our mayor updated us on the number of destroyed residential buildings (which include civilian infrastructure as far as I can tell). It is now at 1531 damaged or destroyed buildings. That’s around 15% of the whole city destroyed. Out of those 1531 buildings - 1292 are apartment complexes and private houses, 70 are schools, 54 are kindergartens and 16 are hospitals. 

Who caused all this destruction? Well, “Nazis” of course, with their “nationalistic flying squadrons of death” (now that is a nice name, the one who came up with it better get a raise). The funny thing is most Russians would never protest against the war but the second we hear about war ending not on Russian terms there will be millions protesting on the streets against ending the war. This is just a fact, this will absolutely happen, Russians have nothing to lose but their pride. They don’t care about people dying, they only care about looking “strong”.

One of the grossest aspects of a large part of Russian society is them being upset at the rest of the world for not giving Russia credit for defeating the Nazis. This has been going for years.

Yes, Russia defeated the Nazis, the greatest evil in Europe. And then Russia replaced it with the second greatest evil - suffocating Eastern Europe for over fifty years. Russia cannot claim they deserve adulation for defeating the Nazis without acknowledging the horrors they then inflicted on Eastern Europe immediately after. The two are inseparable.

“Russification” in the baltics, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and all the now independent countries of the former Soviet Union. Trying to destroy local culture, identity, and language. Shipping locals out to Siberia by the tens of thousands and importing in Russians - who got all the leadership positions in government and business. Non-ethnic Russians treated like second class citizens and dissent meant 10 years in Siberia. 

Eastern Europe countries got deprived of freedom for half a century, ruled with an iron fist behind the iron curtain. Russia literally rolling in tanks to suppress protests for independence.

It is really fucking shocking to see Russians seeing themselves as victims. If you ever hear a Russian say, “Why doesn’t anybody thank us for defeating the Nazis?”, the correct response is “Because you weren’t really any better.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed Australia will send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to Ukraine after a direct plea from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday.

Earlier today Defence Minister Peter Dutton said his department was examining how to transport the armoured vehicles to Ukraine.

Speaking at a press conference in western Sydney, Mr Morrison said Australia would meet Mr Zelenskyy's request.

""Yesterday we announced $25 million and further support, military support, not just sending our prayers, we are sending our guns, we're sending our munitions, we're sending our humanitarian aid, we're sending all of this, our body armour, all of these things and we're going to be sending our armoured vehicles, our Bushmasters as well,"" he said.

""We'll be flying them over there on our C-17s to make sure they can be there to support [Ukraine].

""I thank President Zelenskyy for coming and addressing our Parliament and reminding not just all of us who were in the Parliament last night but all the Australians of what is at stake here.

""When you have one nation bullying and other, a democratic nation whose territorial sovereignty has been violated and war crimes being committed in Ukraine by Russia, this is something Australians will never stand for.""

Mr Morrison did not say how many of the armoured vehicles would be sent to Ukraine, or when they [will be] flown there.

**In Ukraine**

👉🆕 Severodonetsk under bombardment again today, with damage of utility infrastructure and multiple fires, according to Luhansk's Governor. He also stated a few hours ago that Russian forces had mined the evacuation bus route from Lysychansk, luckily with no tragedy, and that ceasefire was violated during evacuation from 6 settlements in Luhansk

👉🆕 Residents in Bucha claim that Ukrainian forces have entered the city, a suburb to Kyiv, this afternoon. No official confirmations exist yet

👉🆕 Ukrainian soldiers have allegedly arrived in Ivankiv, north-west of Kyiv. Footage purportedly depicting the aftermath of ambushes against retreating Russian units last night show heavy losses for the Russians

👉🆕 Ukraine's General Staff have announced retaking control of at least 14 settlements in Kyiv & Chernihiv Oblasts. Izyum is currently under Russian control. Russian forces south of Izyum are attacking the village of Mala Komyshuvakha, and have also advanced in the Sloviansk direction across pontoon bridges built over the Siversky Donets river to Tikhotske, where Ukrainian forces are reportedly raining down artillery on Russian positions.  Tikhotske is roughly one third of the way to Sloviansk from the center of Izyum

👉🆕 Presidential adviser Arestovich claims Ukrainian forces are conducting counter-offensives in the Kharkiv direction, with ""tactical actions"" performed in Kherson Oblast, and that the situation is all in all ""quite optimistic"". Mariupol is getting ""some help"", but he says it's too early to speak of the details. He also mentions that Chernihiv is almost being turned into a second Mariupol, and that Russian forces firmly hold their positions in the Donbas

👉🆕 Melitopol's Mayor, Ivan Federov, says about 75 000 people remain in the occupied city, and claims that Russian forces are preventing people from leaving, only allowing evacuation towards Crimea. He has also reported that all school principals, without exception, resigned from their jobs yesterday in protest of Russian attempts to change all education plans. Russian troops also allegedly have seized 14 tons of food and medicine delivered to the city

👉🆕 Rubizhne, Popasna, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk are all completely or partially without water supply due to Russian shelling and advancement in the Donbas region

👉🆕 Kyiv's City Council has temporarily lifted the alcohol restrictions previously in effect, allowing for limited purchases of alcohol during a short number of hours, but also warn people of overindulging and to respect curfews

👉🆕 State Emergency Services updated the death toll again from the Russian attack on Mykolaiv's government building on March 29, now at 28 bodies

👉🆕 Zaporizhzhia State Police says they suspect the Mayor in occupied Berdyansk of collaborating with the occupiers

👉🆕 The Mayor of Brovary confirmed today that the Russian soldiers have left all settlements in the Brovary area, with clean-up operations ongoing to find stragglers and mines. Nova Basan, a village about 90km east of Kyiv, was liberated yesterday according to footage showing Ukrainian forces arriving to cheering villagers

👉🆕 The convoy of buses that left yesterday for occupied Berdyansk to assist Mariupol residents evacuating, has now left with about 2 000 civilians toward Ukrainian-held Zaporizhzhia, accommpanied by several hundred cars. 1,458 Ukrainians were evacuated from occupied or besieged areas yesterday according to Ukraine's deputy PM, 631 of them being from Mariupol

👉🆕 British intelligence confirmed in their morning update that Ukrainian forces have retaken Sloboda and Lukashiva south of Chernihiv, located along one of the main supply routes to the city from Kyiv. Ukraine is also making successful but limited counter attacks to the east and north east of Kyiv

👉🆕 Ukraine's Air Force, in a social media post late yesterday evening, stressed that air superiority remains key to win this war, with Russia's air force many times larger and more advanced, that their need for fighters & air defences grow, and that Stinger missiles aren't enough. Their wish list includes Patriot systems from the U.S, or the cheaper but more mobile NASAMS from Norway. They could also use more Soviet-era S-300 and BUK-M1 systems

👉🆕 Kharkiv's Governor claims air defence units in the region shot down 3 Russian bombers and 1 fighter jet yesterday

👉🆕 SBU's Andriy Naumov, now ex-chief of internal security, and Serhiy Kryvoruchko, ex-head of SBU's Kherson Directorate, were fired by President Zelenskyy yesterday, accused of being traitors not defending their country. Journalists from Novaya Gazeta, writing for Meduza, released an in-depth report on March 30 detailing how the invasion of Kherson went down, suggesting SBU abandoned the city and state immediately when the invasion began, along with many other officials who also fled without thought of defending the city or helping the civilians living there. SBU has had a long history with turncoats and double agents


**Politics/Diplomacy**

👉🆕 The latest round of negotiations have started and is being held online today via videolink

👉🆕 China's Premier, Li Keqiang, says that China will push for peace between Russia and Ukraine ""in its own way""

👉🆕 President Erdogan says a face-to-face meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin could take place in Istanbul, that the talks previously held in Istanbul added ""meaningful impetus"" to achieving peace. Turkey is also ready, ""in principle"", to act as a security guarantor of Ukraine

👉🆕 Kremlin spokesman Peskov says Putin has been briefed on the alleged Ukrainian helicopter strikes against an oil depot in Belgorod, Russia, and that this could complicate negotiations. Ukraine's Foreign Minister says he can neither confirm nor deny since he does not ""possess all the military information""

👉🆕 Norway's PM spoke on the phone with Putin today, trying to appeal to his conscience by emphasizing how many Russians had lost their lives so far, that ""10-20% of your soldiers have been killed or wounded"". Putin reportedly replied that ""there are casualties in military conflicts""

👉🆕 Netherlands freezes another €515m Russian funds, and have blocked sanctioned transactions of €154m according to Dutch media

**Other notable events**

👉🆕 An oil depot in Belgorod, Russia, was according to Russia attacked late last night by Ukrainian helicopters. Ukraine's General Staff have denied it was Ukraine.

👉🆕 According to Russian investigative site Proekt (or ""Project"", also known as Agentstvo), which has been declared undesirable and banned in Russia, Putin was visited by a thyroid cancer specialist 35 times in Sochi alone. This and other records of doctors visiting or accompanying Putin on trips were published today. They allege that President Putin is taking anabolic steroids to increase physical performance, and to normalize appearance, which has caused collateral effects further damaging his health beyond the cancer itself

👉🆕 U.S and EU officials are discussing how to meet Ukraine's requests for security guarantees should the country forgo its NATO membership bid as a concession to Russia in peace talks. The discussions remain in very early phases however, as no-one is convinced Russian negotiations are anything but a smokescreen. Multiple sources to CNN claim that it'd unlikely that the U.S and its allies would ultimately offer Ukraine the kind of legally binding protections it needs

👉🆕 Russia Today in an article published yesterday claims Russia's reasons for the attack on Ukraine is that Ukraine failed to implement the terms of the 2014 Minsk agreement, and due to Russia's eventual recognition of the ""Donbass Republics"".

* Pullback is due to Ukraine's success in defending Kyiv
* Impossible to 'rapidly reposition' these withdrawing troops and 'integrate them into Donbas fight'. Eventually, yes...possibly in a month from now.
* Russia will continue intermittent shelling of cities in the north/northeast to support withdrawal and keep Ukrainian forces occupied but is unlikely to want to reduce them to ruins.
* Russia's immediate focus for repositioned troops will be Mariupol ... close fight there could last for weeks.
* Few chances for a cease-fire in the near future; lot of fighting still left. [But ultimately] this ends with a political solution.

Putin ‘Just Threw Over the Chess Board,’ and Russians Feel Shame and Dismay

March 31, 2022

By Serge Schmemann

Mr. Schmemann, a member of the editorial board, was the Times Moscow bureau chief in the 1980s and 1990s and is the author of “Echoes of a Native Land: Two Centuries of a Russian Village.”

It is hard to feel sorry for Russia today, when its army is savaging Ukraine. But for those of us who were in Moscow on that August morning in 1991 when a warm sun rose over people massed outside the “White House,” the embattled seat of the Russian government, and we realized that the tanks were not coming, that the coup had failed, that the Soviet yoke had been lifted, it’s also hard to escape a deep sense of grief that Russia has come full circle.

Russia’s potential is being set back by decades; the young, educated and creative are leaving; and the hard men are ascendant. Once again, Russia has become a pariah spreading lies and death.

Even back then, amid the elation of witnessing a victory over tyranny, those of us covering the demise of the Soviet empire knew that its dismemberment would not be quick or pretty. But it didn’t have to come to this.

In the weeks since Mr. Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the reactions within Russia have been muffled. Many foreign correspondents, including those from The Times, have left Russia, and anyone who says anything publicly that contradicts the falsehoods put out by the Kremlin about the “special military operation” faces the threat of up to 15 years in prison for spreading “false information.” (The Soviet-style contraction for the invasion is “spetz operatsiya.”)

I have been reaching out to friends who are still in Russia. Most were understandably cautious about talking to a journalist online, but their pain and sense of helplessness were tangible. One spoke of acute “shame and bitterness” among students and staff at a graduate school when word spread that the invasion had begun. “Nobody, nobody anticipated that he would ever do this,” my friend said. “We had ridiculed the reports in your newspaper that an invasion was imminent.”

Reports from Russia, and from some friends I’ve reached, speak to a widespread dismay and shame among younger, educated, urban Russians. Dismay because of the thousands who have been arrested in Russia for protesting the war; thousands of intellectuals and cultural figures have signed petitions against the invasion and carried out individual acts of courageous resistance. Novaya Gazeta, which was until this week the last functioning major opposition news outlet, wrote about a priest who dared to preach, “Brothers and sisters, this is a fratricidal war,” and was denounced to the police.

Novaya Gazeta itself announced that it was suspending publication after being warned against publishing an interview with President Volodomyr Zelensky of Ukraine. “There is no other choice,” said the editor, Dmitri Muratov, who was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. One of Novaya Gazeta’s last issues showed ballet dancers silhouetted in front of a mushroom cloud with the caption, “A copy of Novaya, created in accordance with all the rules of Russia’s amended criminal code.” The allusion was clear: During the failed 1991 putsch, Russian state TV had looped “Swan Lake,” establishing a lasting meme.

The shame is because these were Russians who had refused to believe that Mr. Putin would actually invade Ukraine, even though they had pushed back against his oppressive rule. They had assumed, as many in the United States and Europe did, that however great Mr. Putin’s hatreds and grievances, however much he resented Ukraine’s independence, he was sufficiently rational not to do something so criminal and self-destructive. And then, as my friend told me, “he just threw over the chess board” and condemned Russia to another cycle of repression and isolation.

Like the large majority of Russians, the intelligentsia had supported Mr. Putin when he first came to power in 2000. He restored a measure of order to the chaos of the early post-Soviet years, and the economy rapidly expanded, and with it the wealth and standard of living for many people in Russia’s big cities.

But over the years Mr. Putin became increasingly less tolerant of dissent, especially as “color” revolutions and pro-Western leanings swept through Ukraine and Georgia and protests over dubious elections filled Russian streets. Independent media was steadily choked off, and nonprofit groups receiving funding from outside the country were required to identity themselves as “foreign agents.”

A growing number of educated Russians began flowing out of Russia, some to Kyiv. When I visited there some years ago, I met several prominent Russian journalists who were, in effect, living in exile, such as Yevgeny Kiselyov, a pioneering Russian television journalist in the 1990s. One Russian reporter told me then that his dream was to build in Ukraine the democracy they were now blocked from building in Russia.

When the word spread that the invasion had begun, the brain drain became a rush for the doors. With flights to more than 30 countries stopped, the twice-daily trains to Finland were full, and many more Russians fled south to Georgia, where they don’t need a visa, or through Gulf States. Their stories are painfully similar, a sense that they have no future in a Russia that has been cast out of the civilized world, and that they are helpless to stop Mr. Putin. One friend, who had been visiting the United States, is applying for political asylum.

Not that Mr. Putin cares. He wields his power through a coterie of strongmen, the “siloviki,” who still view the world through the old Soviet prism of paranoia and ignorance. Many, like Mr. Putin, were officers in the security services, the elite shock troops of the omnipotent State. They never reconciled themselves to the loss of Russia’s status as a great power or bought into the notion that the people, the faceless “narod,” could be anything other than their subjects. And if the nettlesome liberal intelligentsia, or the new breed of wealthy business tycoons, didn’t like it, let them go.

If the polling figures are right, a majority of Russians accept the tough line of their leaders. Unlike the urban intelligentsia, many people spread across Russia’s vast expanse, and especially the elderly, get their information solely from the government’s television stations. The support is not only in the provinces: Thousands of Russians, according to the Moscow police, packed the Luzhniki stadium there for a pro-war rally on March 18, with banners reading “For a world without Nazism.”

However strong that support looks on paper, it could be brittle. A provincial Russian knows the right answer when asked by a pollster whether he supports the president, and many of the participants at the Luzhniki rally were likely state employees or nationalist groups bused in by the Kremlin. And Mr. Putin’s extraordinary efforts to deny there is any war and to minimize Russian casualties speaks to his awareness that if the truth about the “special military operation” and its cost came out, support would likely crumble.

When Mr. Putin recently met with women employed by Russian airlines, they all loyally declared full support for the “military operation,” but their questions reflected disquiet. What is in store for us at the end of this road? Will there be martial law? Will people employed in the private sector receive support? What will we do now that many Russian carriers can’t fly abroad?

How Mr. Putin will respond to this kind of quiet challenge by ordinary Russians is, in some ways, as important as the abstract arguments about whether the Russian leader might be unhinged or out of touch, or whether the West is somehow to blame for this conflict. There are many forces within Russia that turned a low-ranking K.G.B. officer into a grievance-driven tyrant obsessed with restoring an empire. While Western policies or Russian history are no doubt among them, I believe that opportunity — the corrupting allure of power and obscene wealth — is more to the point.

None of it can justify or explain Mr. Putin’s galling decision to launch a scorched-earth invasion of Ukraine, and to condemn his own people to isolation, hardship and contempt. What Russians are enduring, of course, comes nowhere close to the suffering and destruction of Ukraine. But looking back to the promise of that sweet victory more than 30 years ago, it is heart-wrenching to witness what Mr. Putin has wrought on his own country.",False,1648843060.0,t3_ttea0z,t3_ttea0z,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

Chernobyl director: Impossible to determine level of radiation exposure of Russian troops

The director of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant said it was impossible  
 to determine the degree of radiation Russian troops were exposed to   
while occupying the territory. 

In a statement on the Telegram channel of Energoatom, the state-owned   
operator of Ukraine's nuclear power plants, Chernobyl director Valery   
Seida said, ""On the territory of the station itself, the occupiers did   
not dig anything, but the thick dust raised by passing vehicles and the   
radiation particles in it may have entered the body of rashists   
\[racist-fascists, a Ukrainian slur for Russian troops\] through the   
lungs.""

It was unclear what Russian troops were doing in the so-called ""Red   
Forest,"" a contaminated area, and it is possible they could have   
received significant radiation exposure when digging or entrenching   
there, according to the statement.

""At the same time, all the staff who were at the station during this   
period did not receive radiation, because people worked, albeit under   
great pressure, on a regular basis,"" Seida said.

Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, fell into the  
 hands of Russian troops in the first week of the war in   
Ukraine. Energoatom said Thursday that Russian forces had withdrawn   
from the plant and its territory.",False,1648823183.0,t3_ttea0z,t3_ttea0z,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

The Russian strategy of regrouping also seems to be highly risky. A retreat through contested territory (as well as through the red forest) is likely to result in non effective combat units. 

We do see more and more reports of APCs from Sweden, Australia, etc. Many have commented that these are not tanks, but there are numerous reports of UA soldiers arriving by private vehicle. APCs would be a considerable upgrade.

> This top-down approach means that Moscow transmits instructions to generals in the field, who then transmit them to troops, who are told to follow those instructions no matter the situation on the ground.

> Describing the incident, General [Wesley] Clark asked: “Who would be crazy enough to dock a ship in a port” before first securing the area?

> That the Russian planners who sent the Orsk into the port were inattentive to the potential danger shows that no one is questioning decisions coming from the top, officials said. The troops at the bottom are not empowered to point out flaws in strategy that should be obvious, they said.

> In the case of the deaths of some of the Russian generals, for instance, the problem originated far away from the battlefield, when Moscow did not respond quickly enough after Ukraine jammed Russian communications, the analysts said.

> Mr. Putin’s decision to send the Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov to the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol this week for a victory lap despite the fact that Mariupol has not fallen yet demonstrates the Russian president’s continued belief that the biggest battle is the information one, said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian security services expert.

The frontlines frozen in a ceasefire set the conditions for the negotiations and reconstruction that follow. They also set conditions for future conflict. Those seeking enduring peace in Ukraine must resist the temptation to accept a Russian ceasefire offer that sets conditions for renewed conflict on Russia’s terms or gives Russia leverage on Ukraine with which to force concessions and surrenders.*

“We have a very clear objective, to not give up anything and to intensify our efforts until a total ceasefire across the whole of Ukraine’s territory and real negotiations.""

Le Drian said that France wants to show to partners “on every continent” that “because the Russian war in Ukraine is the negation of the principles and commitments that protect us all, it is everyone’s business.”

He also warned against trusting promises of a reduction in fighting, saying, ""We can only judge acts and for the moment we are not there.""

China accuses US of being ‘leading instigator of Ukraine crisis’

China has accused the United States of instigating the war in Ukraine and said NATO should have been disbanded following the break-up of the Soviet Union.

“As the culprit and leading instigator of the Ukraine crisis, the US has led NATO to engage in five rounds of eastward expansion in the last two decades after 1999,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing.

“The number of NATO members increased from 16 to 30, and they have moved eastward more than 1,000km (600 miles) to somewhere near the Russian border, pushing Russia to the wall step by step,” he added.",1648825786.0,1648825703.0,t3_ttea0z,t3_ttea0z,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Apparently Russia pulled out of the city, rather than getting pushed out. I see no reason why they would sacrifice such a strategic location if they were intending to come back. Similarly they retreated from the eastern side of Kyiv, and Chernihiv is saying that they are pulling back there too.

Russia may be giving up the entire northern front to focus on the south. To that end, Izyum has apparently fallen (according to the general staff of Ukraine, but I can't actually verify where they say this) which would imply the continued push to encircle the Sievierodonetsk front. But they still have a few more towns to go through including the city of Sloviansk to get there, so it will not be easy.

Edit: I'm finding it hard to actually verify that Izyum fell from an actual person in the army. I've found articles saying ""The General Staff said..."" But can't actually find where or when they said it.

Given the obviously outdated state of Russian equipment, I wonder how that works in detail and how easy it is to spoof these days. It's hard to intercept and replicate - say - a key card, because when the challenge is sent out it can be variable and the key card does a 'computation' and sends back the proper response. 

To super simplify it, the door your key card opens will send out the number 10. The key card is programmed to subtract 6 and answer back with '4'. The door security system knows that 4 is the right answer to the challenge and then the door is unlocked. It doesn't always have to be '10' that is sent out, could be any number, but the key card will always do the proper calculation and respond with the expected answer. That's why it's not so easy to intercept, because the challenge and response can be different every time. 

But the Russians are obviously using severely outdated stuff. I wonder how long it would take for modern signals intelligence to crack it, especially if you have working IFF bits scavenged from one of the many fallen aircraft that are littering the Ukrainian landscape. And maybe unexploded Russian missiles.

 If you have both bits of the equation you can start to reverse engineer it, and then do clever stuff like spoof their IFF to fool their weapons into thinking you're a friendly. Have to be careful to make sure that doesn't open you up to actual friendly fire of course.  

Anyway, I thought this was interesting. There is so much equipment from Russia in this war that is not just intercepted as wreckage, but just straight up abandoned intact. if Ukraine (with outside help...) could crack IFF in secret and use it offensively, it would be a tactical advantage akin to the British keeping mum about the fact that they had radar in WW2.",False,1648779221.0,t3_ttea0z,t3_ttea0z,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Here’s a [link](https://twitter.com/ralee85/status/1509956742922313738?s=21&t=6ar8NeT0QTG_HRshi3KUTw)

I realize there will be disagreement on this. This is a discussion thread, so discuss away! 

Just my personal line of thought. It doesn’t make sense. If Russia is as low on fuel as we are led to believe, them bombing a bunch of it near the front makes less than zero sense. And they are using fuel to pull out their troops from Kyiv area. They need it to salvage those units. And what would the false flag be for? To use chemical weapons? Makes no sense. No one even died in the attack (from last report I saw). To use nukes? Makes no sense. To attack Ukraine? Already doing that. To get Allie’s involved? Not happening, especially for one fuel depot hit near the border. Like none of it seems to check out logically. 

Then you have Ukraine who has said they didn’t do and also said they won’t confirm or deny it. And if Ukraine is trying to stop Russian units from withdrawing so they can cut them off and/or smash them, taking away their fuel make sense. 

I’m undecided right now but leaning towards it was Ukraine (the can’t confirm or deny is an indicator IMO). It’s so hard to tell though. It’s certainly another interesting story in a war full of them so far.",False,1648837986.0,t3_ttea0z,t3_ttea0z,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

And there were ‘soft’ currencies, like the Ruble. There were also a lot of ‘pegged’ currencies, which were set at fixed exchange rates to ‘hard’ currencies, like the CFA Franc.



Soft currencies had an official exchange rate that was set by their governments, but that had no relation to ‘real’ value. It was just a number that a government would pull out of its ass. To maintain that fiction, trading had to be extremely limited and controlled. When you entered a country that had a soft currency, typically you would be required to purchase some of it at the official exchange-rate. Also, sometimes, if it wasn’t a complete police-state, it wouldn’t be very hard to find people who would sell you local currency at the real exchange-rate. Sometimes that meant as much as 100-times the amount of local currency that you got from the government. But usually it was just a better deal.



But some countries punished black-market currency trading extremely harshly, only allowed businesses to use their funny-money, and there wasn’t much else to do but to get the hell out of that country just as fast as you could because $100 bottles of Coke and $1,000 for a stinky hotel room was a tad much.



So that leads me to some questions. Can people in Russia legally pay for things with currencies other than the Ruble? Is there a currency black-market?  And if so, what is the spread between official and black-market rates?

	1.	Russia is not controlling Ukrainian airspace and they are not fully using all of the planes they have. So the planes are not really something that is going to be that helpful.
	2.	The Russian army is running out of ammunition and they are unable to effectively re-supply. They are already out of food and having to loot to feed themselves.
	3.	Retired US General Hodges has estimated that Russia can last another 10 days. He might be wrong, but I think this reflects what military strategists are thinking - no need to poke the bear when it is already dying.

'Brussels targets oligarchs' family circle to prevent them from evading sanctions


Five weeks after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and after a European summit dominated by energy issues and without tangible results in terms of sanctions, the European Commission is multiplying these days its contacts with its allies to fine-tune a fifth package of sanctions. 

Or almost better - to use the terminology used in the Community Executive - an ""intermediate package"" focused on reinforcing the four blows already dealt against Russia, to prevent companies, oligarchs and their relatives from evading the measures and the Russian Central Bank from being able to carry out transactions using its gold reserves.'

> **As countries across Europe let families flee without a visa, the Home Office is overwhelmed by paperwork. Will Priti Patel be around to fix it?**

> Thousands of people were due to arrive within the first week of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, the refugees minister told MPs on March 16. The upbeat prediction from Lord Harrington of Watford was based on internal Home Office estimates that they would be able to process 10,000 visas in the first week.

> By the time that week had come and gone the Home Office had processed barely a tenth of that figure.

> It was a stark reminder of how slowly the cogs of government turn for Harrington, the former MP who had been happily pursuing a career in the private sector until Boris Johnson called, begging him to return to Westminster to turn around his government’s ailing policy on Ukrainian refugees.

> For ministers already working on efforts to offer sanctuary to Ukrainians, they said it was the latest example of Home Office officials overpromising on what could be delivered.
Fast-forward to today and fewer than 5,000 visas have been granted and the number of applications has topped 32,000. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” one government insider working on the Homes for Ukraine scheme said.

> This is why the second phase of the scheme, which will allow companies and organisations to offer accommodation and is expected to give a “rocket-booster” to the numbers offered rooms in the UK, will not be introduced until after Easter at the earliest, government sources say. “It is getting worse because each day more people are applying than getting processed, which is creating a growing backlog,” one said.

> The total number of visas issued under the Ukraine Family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme has reached 29,100, but a further 35,800 applications are waiting to be processed.

I'm really starting to fall in love with the idea of NATO (or countries within NATO) setting up a ""safe zone"" in western Ukraine where peacekeepers from neighboring European countries could declare the prohibition of combat activities taking place there. This area would be limited to not include any areas currently seeing fighting, and could begin to be enforced without initiating any attacks. Enforcing a safe zone where there isn't any fighting isn't the same thing as entering a warzone and trying to stop fighting already in progress (like declaring a no-fly zone). Russia would not be able to prevent this move and it would send a strong message that Russia will never be able to conquer Ukraine.

This could free up Ukrainian soldiers to focus on the southeast, while NATO forces could help coordinate humanitarian assistance and aid logistics within Ukraine (while consolidating the defense of western Ukraine).

Also why people who think that ""China won't invade Taiwan because the economic consequences will be too high for the Chinese economy"" are wrong.

In a dictatorship such as Russia and China power is gained and maintained through one fundamental means only: violence. The dictatorial class stays in power because they control the army, police and secret service which in turn kill anyone trying to oppose the dictatorship. In contrast in a democracy the ruling class stays in power due to consent of the people which means they have to assure a high quality of life for the people of their country in order to get their consent.

In dictatorships such as China and Russia the wellbeing provided by a free market system are just a bonus that the benevolent dictatorial class gives to the people not a fundamental part of the system. The dictator can take that bonus away as he pleases. This is why Putin did this war in spite of the obvious economic consequences: because even if Russia falls to the life standard of Iran or North Korea he can still maintain power until the end of his biological life because the police, army and secret service will always have more funds than other categories. This is why China will eventually invade Taiwan in spite of the the obvious damage to their economy:  because even if China falls to the life standard of Iran or North Korea the communist party will still maintain power because the police, army and secret service will always be funded. If anyone tries to protest or rebel they get imprisoned or murdered in cold blood and that is the end of it.

> Possible use of nuclear weapons got normalized. Conversations about consequences of war often trigger the nukes threat. “They will lift all these sanctions b/c we have nukes” “They will give in anyway, otherwise we will try our nukes on them”

... and the conclusion:

> It is difficult to say what the reaction would be if the “few months theory” fails. It is possible that a significant part of society will conclude that it is too late to stop, and this war will finally be perceived as existential, to be won at any cost

... which makes me hope an agreement is reached before that point (and that sanctions are increased until then and can continue until reparations are made to Ukraine - which is likely not going to happen any time soon - so that they would still be effective without an active armed conflict to increase the willingness/likelihood of WMDs being used).

The nuclear threat is Putin's power, so they have been threatening to escalate since the start, saying things like Russia could legitimately use nuclear weapons under 'existential threat' to ward off decapitation strategy.

Biden's 'gaffe' (how can this man remain in power?) and now the Ukrainians with this attack is to escalate the situation themselves, before the Russian's can, but in a way that Russia cannot respond (Putin, you going to nuke us after an old man's gaffe). You're not really under existential threat, Vlad, it was a gaffe! But you are, though. This is nothing new. Everybody has known that for a while, Vlad, since Biden said you had to go. But, of course, he didn't say that. It was a gaffe!

This is the same thing. If Ukraine had intelligence that Russia was going to launch a false flag on itself, Ukraine should attack something militarily valuable with zero casualties. Everyone can ask 'Are they crazy?' or 'Is it a false flag?' Russia cannot retaliate to this in an escalatory way because it is just another pathetic military defeat for them everyone can see is permitted in the laws of war. Now their original false flag plan is spoiled, and nobody is galvanized to revenge a fuel depot, especially in a totalitarian state that criminalizes wasting fuel to retrieve fallen comrades.

Fuel is the blood of a totalitarian state just as disappearance is its symbolic act of violence. The fascist vein into the Russian Army's leadership also feels the loss of the fuel more strongly than the loss of their cannon meat. It is their communion wine. It powers the pornography of their violent spectacle. Fascism is not a religion, though. It is anti-sacred. When the scientific and poetic axes converge, blood turns to fuel, and the noose becomes disappearance.

You can see this is a spiritual war. Reddit is a Skinner Box where karma is a punishment or reward stimulus. Fascists will put you in a Skinner Box, so state actors, like FSB, have turned their techniques in classical and operant conditioning, and cognitive learning, priming, assimilation and accommodation outward in global production.

That was always going to happen. I didnt expect it to rise quite so much. Was paying $1.80L now $3L

The US may not be feeling it as much, but the Global economic sanctions are being paid for effectively everywhere around the world that uses fossil fuel transportation.

It might just drive the Electric and Hybrid vehicle market a lot of quicker. Personally we are looking to sell the gas guzzling 6 cyl. Possibly a positive to come out of the conflict, provided Ukraine maintains sovereignty. More E cars or Hybrid the better. Down under we have an ozone hold with the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, caused by all the global fuel burns. Ive had 5 cut out already.

I cant imagine owning something like an f150. The worst for me is our car has to run on 98RON. 91RON is substantially cheaper. I believe in Japan their cars have to run on 100RON........

But, whatever it takes, although I see Ukraine cirticising the sanctions saying they should have occurred in 2014. Perhaps but the majority of that region wanted reunification, which is why there was not a major battle over it then?

They want to move beyond the limited operation that Putin claimed to have set in motion to something more absolutist. Ukraine must be defeated, and seen to be defeated, no matter what the costs.

Stick a camera, arduino, and a grenade on a drone. You can have it fly forward and even dodge obstacles pretty easily until it matches a particular face. When it matches the face, fly straight toward it and release the grenade. You would expect things like switchblades with high end gear instead of a consumer drone from best buy would make that easier, right?

But that's still going to be really limited. Drones have limited range and limited loiter time. You can't just say ""fly around until you find Putin"" or ""fly around until you find someone with stars on their collar"" because the drone will probably run out of steam before it finds them. And when you're filming high off the ground you're not going to get high enough resolution for facial comparison. You'd have to get closer... at which point people on the ground will say ""oh, look, a drone!"" and either take it out, or at least have VIPs stay in shelter for a few minutes before the drone dies.

Someone else mentioned gait analysis, but that's not actually all that good in practice. Gait analysis only works decently if you have similar video. Meaning, you can't just take any old video of Putin and compare it to what the drone sees, you'd have to compare it to a decent amount of footage from other drones flying at similar altitudes at similar angles with similar cameras.

Throughout all of this, the Russians could easily be deploying antidrone measures. It's not super likely they can counter drones at the front all that well. It's way more likely that they have measures set up near command centers. So the calculus becomes ""try to assassinate some important official and almost certainly fail"" or ""try to take out a fuel truck driving to the front lines and almost certainly succeed.""",False,1648781388.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i2xjlrj,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Even a fuel rod fragment from the accident wouldn't cause this though, so, who knows what is going on. One of the related waste fuel sites might be involved, they are still used to store active nuclear waste.

The ICSRM comprises four facilities. 'Lot 0' is temporary storage for low- and intermediate-level long-lived waste as well as high-level waste. This is within the Liquid and Solid Waste Storage Facility and was commissioned in 2010.

'Lot 1' will retrieve solid wastes from an existing solid waste storage facility. It will handle 3 cubic metres of waste per day over an operational life of 30 years.

'Lot 2' will sort solid wastes and process low- and intermediate-level wastes at the rate of 20 cubic metres per day. Some solid and liquid wastes will be incinerated, and some will be cemented.

It's strange to me how everybody assumes there's this massive plan to retake Kherson and they expect it to happen any day now.  It won't happen for months, if ever.  Ukraine is not planning this, because planning this would be stupid.  

Not to mention that Kherson is a top priority for Russia and that they have a navy parked outside it.  The city is too big to be adequately occupied, so some unscrupulous reportage sites are labeling it 'contested', but it's not.  It's just been isolated because the population is too large to bother with.

I definitely think that this is a reason why it *could* be a real attack from Ukrainians, but its definitely not enough to lead me to draw conclusions. Russia is not entirely reliant on this gas plant, and also I'd imagine if they wanted to create a convincing mass casualty false flag attack that they should at least establish that Ukraine not only is capable of attacking over the border, but there is a clear record of it happening.


I think it could go either way but there is a bigger picture here and I feel people who are ready to jump the gun and conclude that its 100% not a false flag are not looking at the larger picture. Putin has been working to justify using weapons of mass destruction for the entirety of the war. You know what is directly within their military doctrine that would justify a WMD attack? A direct attack against them. Russia's estranged economic partners like India or China aren't going to sit back idly and accept Russia's reasoning for using WMDs is predicated on nonsense.

>The soldier was part of a team that captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 65 miles north of Kyiv, in the first days of the war.

>They then occupied the 20-mile exclusion zone around the plant, where people are banned from living, dug trenches into radioactive mud and drove their trucks along dirt roads, kicking up radioactive dust.

>Now ill and exhausted, they have retreated to Belarus.

>""The Russian occupiers have left the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,"" said Ukraine's Defence Ministry. ""Two key reasons: losses caused by the Ukrainian army and radiation exposure.""

>While the disaster of the nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 is well documented in the West and was the subject of an award-winning BBC drama in 2019, it is relatively unknown in Russia.

>It is unlikely that the Russian soldiers, mainly conscripts from the poorer fringes of Russia, would have known anything about the dark history of the abandoned power plant that they had been ordered to capture. 

>They did not even know that they were going to war when they were told to invade Ukraine on February 24. Their officers had told them that they were still on a military exercise and they were not issued with any nuclear protection suits.

>After capturing the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear power station, the Russian soldiers were ordered to camp in the wood, known locally as the Red Wood because of the colour it turned after soaking up radiation from the nuclear explosion.

>Russian commanders may not have known about the wood's reputation as a radiation hotbed, or may not have cared.

>Either way, it points yet again to poor planning and poor leadership within the Russian army.

>Its reputation for competence and as an effective modern fighting force has been ripped apart over the past five weeks of war in Ukraine, in which thousands of conscripts have been killed.

>The Kremlin has tried to suppress news of the Russian army's casualties and military blunders. Many of the injured and dead soldiers from its failed assault on Kyiv are being treated in Gomel, a border town in Belarus, where doctors and nurses have previously told The Telegraph that they have been sworn to secrecy.

I'm honestly having trouble believing that a soldier died this quickly from radiation poisoning.

Edit:  I'm being downvoted but I'd like you to read about the radiation deaths during the Chernobyl meltdown.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster

25 deaths occurred that were attributed to ARS in the same amount of time (5 weeks) that these troops have been in the Red Forest.  If you sort the table on the wiki page, you'll see that the job titles of all of these people indicate they were all at ground zero of the meltdown and took incredible amounts of radiation as they tried to stop this catastrophe.  It seems nearly impossible that any of these soldiers could be exposed to similar levels of radiation unless they went inside the sarcophagus looking for souvenirs or something.",1648851649.0,1648850248.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i31b6c0,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Plenty of countries still buying it. Even without it being discounted India would've still bought some as they are their traditional supplier. Just like India doesn't care about sanctions on Iran because that's one of their traditional supplier.

People on Reddit are literally hyper emotional and exagerrating how wide the sanctions are. If you actually bothered to look into everything that Russia exports you would see large swath's of Russian exports are not touched by sanctions due to their impact on the global market.

Facts don't lie and only **half of Russian oligarchs** have any sanctions and plenty of nations only made feeble attempts to sanction those, largely to virtue signal.

This is old hat.

We know this.  Or I should say this is well known.

A benevolent dictator is one of the best forms of government (for smallish systems, nations or empires).  One person able to assess the information quickly and decide upon the course of action often is far more effective and often more efficient than the messiness of democracy, bureaucracy and the like.

But... this entire argument hinges on so many assumptions that it's often dead on arrival.  By far the most important assumption is that of **benevolence**.  Even assuming one leader is such, you have absolutely no guarantees the next one will be.  Next, you're also assuming one person efficiently making the ""best"" decision... well... works.  This isn't just an issue of the kindness of heart of the dictator.  This depends upon having access to all relevant and correct and up-to-date information.  That means you're depending upon the benevolence of all the information gatherers, analysts, etc.  You *might* be able to argue the truly benevolent leader will model, lead and inspire benevolence in their followers.  But I imagine any student of history would consider one good person a statistical oddity and a ""good"" society a myth.  A dictator likely means an entrenched bureaucracy.  But assuming everyone's goodness, there are probably tons of scenarios where the complexity surpasses the ability of a single dictator and wise/good counselors to make an efficient decision that benefits all citizens well.  Instead you get a ham-fisted solution all are forced to acclaim as great lest they run the risk of the dictator who could have them killed... but wouldn't (at least not publicly... private is so much better since nobody'd suspect the good leader).

All of this is a bit of red herring.

Well, they have collapsed around Kyiv anyway. I predicted a month ago in a different comment, that Putin would start turning on his own advisors and that is happening as well. My further prediction was that the siloviki would see this as an existential threat, enough of them might band together to try and oust Putin. That is still a long shot and hasn’t happened yet. But the oligarchs were never going to do it. They are little more than Putin’s money launderers and agents in the West. They can’t control the various security and military agencies so they have no teeth. Keeping everyone in their silos is both Putin’s strength and greatest weakness.

Shall I put myself out there with a new predication? Reports are that Putin has not fully given up on regime change in Kyiv, that Russia is doing a head fake and is going to take some time to regroup and then go after Kyiv again. In the meantime, they have just ordered up 134K new conscripts that they claim won’t be going into Ukraine.My take is that they are lying and they are planning to give these poor fuckers about 1 month’s worth of training and indoctrination and send them into Ukraine. By withdrawing from Kyiv, they are giving Ukraine an opportunity to redeploy their best people away from Kyiv to the east and south, and maybe making an opening to attack Kyiv again. In the meantime, Russia is going do their best to fix their logistical problems and to hold territory in Donbass, especially Mariupol. Mariupol is extremely important to Russia because of its key location to form a land bridge to Crimea and because of gas deposits in the region. However, they can never securely hold this region unless they have control of Kyiv, which is why I think they haven’t given up on regime change and taking Kyiv.

Some people think that Russia has time on its side and greater resources, but that is questionable. For one, the clock is running out on propaganda. 1000 of their national security forces have refused to be sent to Ukraine and are actually suing the Kremlin, citing the law that national security forces are not to be sent into foreign territory. Soldiers are calling their moms and wives and telling them what a shit show the invasion is. The reality of the situation is slowly sinking in. Sure, Russia has more people to throw at the situation, but the more he does that, the more he loses support, which is why he was trying to get mercenaries to Ukraine. Not to mention that Russian ‘soldiers’ pretty much trip over their own feet and what leadership they had is being picked off. 7 generals taken out by Ukraine so far? I can’t see Russian military officers wanting to step up to lead in Ukraine.

Further, there are reports that Russia has apparently committed a very large percentage of their total functioning military resources and this is going to weaken them in other regions like Georgia, so they run the risk of Georgia trying to take back territory there.

Resupplying military equipment is also a huge problem. The big question is whether China is going to supply them or not. This is where time is not on Ukraine’s side. The longer this goes on, the better Russia and other greedy types will be able to figure out sneaky work-arounds to sanctions. In the meantime, Europe is still sending billions to Russia for oil and gas.

So now the question is what will the West do during the next month or two while Russia is re-grouping. If the West uses the time to supply Ukraine with more offensive capability, Ukraine could kick Russia out altogether. Ukraine is not short of manpower. They have been turning away volunteers (Ukrainians, not just foreigners) because there are just too many. On the other hand if the West believes that Russia has truly given up on Kyiv and believes that the Kremlin is negotiating for peace in good faith, they might back off on sending offensive weapons and enacting more sanctions. This would be the exact wrong move, in my opinion. Ukraine needs to decisively kick the Russians out of eastern and southern regions and Crimea. If they don’t take back Crimea, Russia will always have an incentive to go back into Ukraine, imo.

This morning Ukraine put out a series of tweets making a very strong argument as to why they need planes. Will Western leadership change its view and use this relative break in hostilities to get better and more offensive equipment to Ukraine? Certainly Ukraine has earned it. I suspect it will happen, but relatively quietly, so we won’t know about it unless Russia comes in with a new offensive force.

So my prediction - I think the West changes its view that sending planes/offensive equipment to Ukraine is a bad idea and steps up with more offensive equipment, Ukraine can divisively rout Russia from its territory in a few months or sooner and possibly take back Crimea, depending on sentiment in Crimea. Putin will still be in power and claiming victory over the “Nazis.” I believe this will be the outcome because the West now understands that it overestimated Russia’s strength and underestimated Ukraine’s ability to wisely and creatively use their resources. I think it gets done quietly so as not to prompt more nuclear threats from Russia and relatively quickly while Russia is experiencing weakness and disarray.

If I’m wrong and the West remains timid about supplying offensive equipment, this war could continue on a limited basis for years as a stalemate as it has for the last 8 years until Putin dies or until the Russian Federation either collapses or adapts to sanctions. Given the history, Russia tends to collapse and not adapt.

Consider everything that's happened since Rabin was assassinated.   In the context of rising RF influence and Putin's rise to power starting in 1999.

Rabin's death (at the hands of an Israeli rightwing extremist - probably part of a larger conspiracy) was the end of the Palestinian peace process.

They're not downplaying Russia's aggression, they're not calling for Ukraine to give anything up, they're calling for de-escalation through negotiations because they fear a spillover of hostilities and enormous escalation. They are not wrong that this is still a not insignificant risk, and that Western actions and rhetoric can worse the situation. 

That doesn't mean they are ""right"" however, nor that the Biden administration is ""wrong"", it means we're in a hugely complicated and unpredictable situation and that all points of view must be considered. Right now the bandwidth for what are deemed responsible actions has lessened tremendously. Do too little and Russia can win in Ukraine and can continue to threaten the safety of Europe in the future, do too much and Russia may feel the need to escalate. Finding that perfect middle road is complicated and too much rhetoric and overt aggressive actions is dangerous.

Currently we are getting signals that Russia, both the population and the leadership is digging in mentally. They view this as an ""existential situation"", because if they lose this they are hugely diminished on the world stage. This article gives a [good insight](https://postsocialism.org/2022/03/04/defensive-consolidation-in-russia-not-rally-around-the-flag/) into their mindset right now, calling it ""defensive consolidation"". To overly threaten and humiliate them now will cause a collective willingness to strike back. 

Give it a couple of months and that support will crumble. The real impact of the sanctions will become evident. The propaganda can't hide the coffins and bodybags being sent home, nor the empty spaces at the dining table. Russia must be given a slow and soft defeat, in order to never present an opportunity for escalation.

More complex answer: *maybe*.

That's the big difference, Japan is already in a number of pacts that mean it doesn't necessarily need NATO - a bunch of predominantly European based land-fighting armies really aren't much use to Japan.

>**Attack on a nuclear reactor is ""not a probable scenario"" in Russia-Ukraine conflict, IAEA chief tells CNN**

>*From CNN’s Adam Pourahmadi*  

>Beginning next week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will start assisting Ukraine in preserving the safety of nuclear installations, including Chernobyl, Director-General of IAEA Rafael Grossi told CNN.

>Returning from a trip to Ukraine and Russia, where he visited the closest nuclear reactors to the war zone, Grossi said the operations continue in a “satisfactory way.”

>An attack on a nuclear reactor is “not a probable scenario,” and “nuclear facilities have not been targeted,"" he said Friday.

>The Director-General said there was an occurrence in sight of a nuclear reactor, which was “quite concerning,” adding it was an exchange of fire, probably shelling, that targeted an administrative building. 

>“Any attack on a nuclear facility is against international law. I think everybody including Russia is very clear about it. And trust or no trust is something that is, of course, objective. We are going to be [doing] everything possible to prevent that occurrence,” he added.  

>On the reports of Russian troops being exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, Grossi said the agency has contacted its Russian counterparts for more information.

>""In general terms, I would say that the radiation levels around the Chernobyl site are low. At the beginning when the Russian troops occupied the site because of the movement of heavy armored vehicles approaching the site, some areas, the moving of the ground released some radiation there, and there was a slight increase in the levels,"" he said.

>“It is probably that the same thing happened when the same vehicles or similar ones were on their way out, that there was dust in the air that contained some radiation that was lying on the ground,” he added.",1648838679.0,1648834603.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i30b5al,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Its become clear to me that both Nato and Putin are putting each other in very aggressive situations. Many people forget that the US/NATO, Held joint military exercises in Ukraine in September of last year, easy situation to make a crazy insecure Putin react. He probably had intent from the get go to go after Ukraine, this just further escalated it. Personally, once this is over, i expect politicians to lay down and pretend nothing happened based on the opportunity cost of oil and a lack of spine. The only way we would avoid trade with them would require the below to be cleaned up. 

Wars, while some are fought over religion/politics, are usually fought over resources. Russia is a premier energy supplier, and unless someone else steps up on production (Biden has reached out to Iran and Venezuela, both allies of Russia and arguably worse than Putin with their own human rights violations), theirs really no alternative to keep gas prices down unless we drill more in America and supply to Europe, which as much as people want to pretend its the companies not doing it, has so many agencies you have to get approval from with inspections and bureaucratic processes that its actually a less likely alternative.  You can have a lease, but unless Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Interior Bureau of land management, Department of Transportation pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, and quite a few more regulatory bodies approve, theirs no point of mentioning the 9,000 leases since they're basically a ""you can have this one you go through 1,000 steps"" process. 

Basically its artificially slowed down, and theirs not going to be an ease at the pumps anytime soon. I saw some states suspend the tax on gas to help alleviate it, but as you can see its slowly going up more and it is a band aid, not a permanent fix. 

Than you have oil companies who need multiple leases to justify renting/paying for the equipment to drill, since theirs no point in drilling if its not cost effective and doesnt make financial sense. Are the companies greedy? Absolutely, but this is a multiple pronged problem, not being helped by the situation in Russia.

It is very likely that this can not even end without Ukraine agreeing to some sort of compromise in regards to their own territory (which is godawful but unfortunately likely).

The best case scenario is basically right now IMO that Russia withdraws to the pre-war state and that there will be a very creative solution to the Crimea and Donbas issue (something like it remains a disputed territory for 5 years and then there will be an internationally supervised referendum or some bs like that). I hope they can somehow get Donbas back completely but I absolutely can not see it unfortunately. Crimea is lost completely unfortunately IMO.

At the end of the day the Ukrainians are amazing people that have beaten all of our expectations. But there is a vast difference between defending and holding your territory and going on the offense and actually pushing the Russians about Ukraine. The Ukrainians are not able to this unless NATO/US/EU completely change their current approach now. They would have to not only massively increase the sanctions (energy embargo most importantly) but also be willing to deliver F16s (or atleast a shitton of MiGs), Patriots and Tanks as well as other stuff for that to be possible. And they won't do that because they fear what Putin might do if that happens and if NATO gear is involved in driving himand his forces out of Donbas and Crimea as well as what these sanctions would do to their economies.

Edit: 
Didn’t realize how hardened that aircraft is. From Wikipedia: 

The A-10 is battle-hardened to an exceptional degree, being able to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23 mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a backup if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to be able to fly with one engine, half of the tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.",1648801025.0,1648800809.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i2yiibh,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Especially considering that during war it's not unusual for a jet to burn a lot of fuel due to things like dogfighting. And carrying a lot of fuel prepared for the returnflight also weights a jet down, thus reducing its combat effectiveness.

Finally, considering the distance that they'd need to cover Russia would've much more time to scramble their own jets for defense.

If you lose a tail rotor, the counter rotational force from the blades will spin that Helicopter around and around. 

Typically you just drop RPM/Collective and Auto Rotate the save your arse. Any Engine power would make you rotate. 

&#x200B;

The Russian Helicopters that use dual tandem rotors (im a fixed wing guy, not sure of the correct terminology), they don't need a tail rotor. One blade spins one way, the other blade spins the other way thus no rotational torque on helicopter.

There are even Slightly tilted tail rotors, ""provides a teeny bit of lift and counters the slight rotation from engine torque"".

* 50% of your friends and coworkers are either wounded or dead in the Kyiv axis (no lie, some units were battered this badly). IE: out of a battalion of 800, 400 are casualties.

* You yourself are nearly frostbitten, or mildly frostbitten, but otherwise fine. After spending 1 month out in Ukraine in freezing temperatures and under low-food conditions (possibly surviving by raiding nearby Ukrainian homes for food), you are not exactly feeling happy about your current life situation.

* You finally get the retreat order from the top, so you're back home, safe and sound and out of Ukraine's meat-grinder.

* You receive a new order to refuel, and drive to the east-side of Ukraine and begin a new attack.

------

At this point, you're thinking of maybe blowing up the fuel depo. If the fuel depo doesn't exist anymore, you don't have to drive to Ukraine and do everything all over again.

And also remember: if you were on the Kyiv axis of attack, you were stationed in Belarus for a 2-week training exercise and directly lied to by Putin. A lot of the low-level soldiers/conscripts didn't even believe the Ukrainian attack would happen.

A last step of blowing up bridges into Kherson was not done. Had this happened, to defend Kherson, Ukraine troops would have needed to just shoot anybody attempting to cross the river. With the bridges up, it was easy for Russian troops to roll into Kherson.

India does not traditionally buy much in Russian oil. A non-zero amount, yes.

Anyway:

On the open market Russia's primary export grade is currently trading at about a $30/barrel discount to benchmark (Brent) grade. Usually it's a <$5/barrel difference.

https://www.neste.com/investors/market-data/urals-brent-price-difference

I wouldn't be surprised if India might be getting a slightly larger discount than that for major purchasing/contracts, as well.

Russian oil is estimated to cost [$32-45/barrel to produce](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/12/russian-oil-production-most-expensive-world-saudi-aramco-ipo-a68132).

Sanctions are taking roughly 30% of the price off Russia's oil, and roughly 50% of the profit margin off Russia's oil. That's pretty significant.

You are wrong in saying that is morally equivalent to war. No - it is clearly not.  It is on a spectrum of policy tools of which war is at one extreme. 

You are wrong that the only aim of sanctions is to break a regime or force regime change. Sanctions are also used to reduce the ability of a regime to wage war or repress its citizens. 

Your example of North Korea is a good example. Sanctions haven’t forced regime change, true - but was always unlikely. What sanctions have done though is to massively reduce the military threat that NK pose to its neighbors. 

Similarly with Russia. Sanctions in place from 2014 have prevented Russia from modernizing its military using western technology. In that sense, sanctions have been effective at achieving a policy aim.",False,1648778260.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i2xelut,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

No. Its that Russians are insufferably incompetent. There's tactics and strategies designed for these things.

Infantry, for the most part, can only ""carry"" one weapon. Its a rifle, a ATGM, or a machine gun, etc. etc. You use combinations of weapons to handle combinations of foes.

Chornobyl had a 200 tons of uranium fuel burn and melt; getting scattered distributed all over the small area of the plant site and a few dozens of miles of surrounding forest. (ie. A LOT of shit, concentrated in a very small area). 

Whereas the primary Castle Bravo device weighed about 830 kg (that's the entire primary device, not just the plutonium and uranium fuel - plus the fusion component of enriched lithium, which wouldn't even produce the cs-137 and sr-90 in the fallout).  Consider that when the Castle Bravo test was conducted, the resulting unplanned fallout contamination spread across 7000 miles of pacific ocean, including several small islands. 

So much less actual contaminates, spread over a much much wider area.

The inhabitants of those islands were famously evacuated.

When some of those inhabitants were brought back in 1970, they had to be evacuated AGAIN, because the island STILL contained deadly radiation in the soil and well, and it was making people sick.

I think that it's still not considered safe to live there, but some inhabitants have since returned.

There's a bit of a calculus here.  Ukraine obviously has legitimate interests in attacking Russian capabilities.  But there are legitimate attacks that could be counterproductive: they could do more to rally the Russian people behind the war than to inhibit Russian military operations.

Ukraine needs a political solution.  Given enough time and bodies to feed into the meatgrinder, Russia wins this militarily.  The key aim is to make it costly enough for Russia that Russian national resolve breaks (perhaps with regime change) and Ukraine prevails in that way.

That said, I think taking out fuel resources behind enemy lines is quite clearly OK.

I kind of think this is due to systemic problems. It is a lot easier to get into debt now, partly because some of those debts are subsidized by the government to encourage getting into debt (I mean, buying a house or going to college), which just makes things more expensive because debt gives you more money to spend now than hard cash, and the market adjusts the price for what people are willing to pay.

The motivations might not be bad. College does a lot to raise the standard of living, so there is some merit to the idea of wanting more people to go to college. There are more people going to college now than in the 1970s. But the equilibrium price goes up with with increased demand. But, on the flip side, a bigger supply of people with college degrees somewhat reduces the value of the degree...

Also, have you compared modern houses to houses built in the 1970s? I bought a starter home in the $200k range which is way better than the $90k house that my parents bought in the 1980s that I grew up in. People these days also expect way more.

The fact that the bridge to Kherson over the Dnieper wasn't blown is criminal, as that would have pretty much stifled any attack towards Odessa and allowed defenders to concentrate around the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant/bridge and freed up a lot of resources that could have gone elsewhere.

 >Jerry John Rawlings (22 June 1947 – 12 November 2020) was a Ghanaian military officer and politician who led the country from 1981 to 2001 and also for a brief period in 1979. He led a military junta until 1992, and then served two terms as the democratically elected President of Ghana. Rawlings came to power in Ghana as a flight lieutenant of the Ghana Air Force following a coup d'état in 1979. Prior to that, he led an unsuccessful coup attempt against the ruling military government on 15 May 1979, just five weeks before scheduled democratic elections were due to take place.

Everyone in the West would want that Russia gets kicked out of Ukraine completely.

But there is a difference between wanting something and realistically believing that it could happen.

The West is not going to give Ukraine the type of support that would actually allow them to re-take Donbas and especially not Crimea. I actually believe they might even step in if Russia were in danger of losing that badly (which they are not right now).

As you said. They will do everything in their power to prevent this conflict from spiralling out of control. And Ukraine actually pushing the Russians out of what they ""conquered"" in 2014 is such an escalation IMO.

Putin is already getting a ton of (unexpected) criticism from some of his more vocal allies because he announced the decision that they will retreat from Kyiv for now.

He realistically can not afford to withdraw from Donbas/Crimea without completely losing face and risking his stranglehold on the country basically. IMO its likely he would even rather start to use chemical weapons and maybe even tactical nukes to prevent that from happening.

That is why ultimately this will probably drag on for a long time (with hopefully Ukraine holding their ground and hopefully demoralize them to a point where they go for some sort of ceasefire agreement/frozen conflict that is done well enough to prevent any attempts to start a full scale attack in the future.",False,1648855818.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i31o9sb,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Even Putins lapdog Kadyrov has criticized Putin indirectly (or rather his chief negotiator who is acting on his behalf) for agreeing to cease attacking Kyiv. They announced it as part of the peace efforts so they could criticize the negotiatiors and didn't have to go after Putin (who is making that decision obviously). Its actually astonishing how critical Putins ""fans"" have been of that decision.

They don't care about sanctions/ how fucked their economy is or how evil their soldiers are behaving in Ukraine or how much Putin is lying to them about this war. The only thing they care about is winning and Putin fulfilling their dreams of restoring their former power/relevance. He can't ""lose"".

Getting kicked out of Donbas/Crimea is not something you can sell as anything but losing even in Russia right now with the whole media under your control. Thats why Putin will escalate it as far as he has to to prevent this. Maybe not nukes (but I wouldn't rule it out) but basically everything else.

I fully agree that he can not win a war (atleast in the longterm) against Ukraine but realistically he also can not afford to ""lose(aka not have something to show for it he can sell at home)"" and has the means and motivation to prevent that from happening.

So ultimately the realistic end to this is either some sort of frozen conflict a la Minsk or a full scale mobilization of Russia that ends in a total war (with a decent chance of it turning into WWIII).

any attack that is directed primarily at russian civilians will likely have the opposite effect. ukraine is trying to inform the russian public they aren't the bad guy.  it'd send the wrong message.

however, i wouldn't be opposed to them attacking select public/civilian targets, though.  the bridge across the kerch strait into crimea, for example.  i know it cost a lot of money to build and is still likely the main route for reinforcement and supply into crimea.  i'd be very tempted to knock a few chunks of it into the sea, in the middle of the night, to avoid any collateral damage. it could probably be done with 0 civilian casualties, but frankly even if a car or two is crossing, is it a worthwhile target? my argument is yes, infrastructure has always been a target in war. a lot of the stuff sieging Mariupol comes over that bridge.  

similarly, the Dresden raid mentioned earlier didn't really accelerate the end of the war.  the doolittle raids and the abombs had military benefits.. an impact on both sides' morale in the case of the former, and a factor in actually surrendering in the latter.  its very hard to argue 'necessary' because even in the abombs case, its a small single event in a major war.",1648823939.0,1648823668.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i2zgsgq,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

This Russian military presence dates back to 1992, when the Soviet 14th Guards Army intervened in the Transnistria War in support of the Transnistrian separatist forces. Following the end of the war, which ended in a Russian-backed Transnistrian victory and in the de facto independence of the region, the Russian forces stayed in a purportedly peacekeeping mission and reorganized in 1995 into the Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF), part of which is currently guarding the Cobasna ammunition depot.

>How did they take Kherson? “Stupidity or betrayal, perhaps both,” says Andrey Gordeev, former governor of the Kherson region:

>So we have four lines of defense. The first is the isthmus between the Kherson region and the Crimea, it should have been completely mined. And by the way, they told me that a week before the attack, some dick cleared it.

>Next are the border guards, but the task of the border guards is not to engage in battle, but to see the fact of aggression, give a signal and retreat, move back, and so on. Then comes our irrigation system. Irrigation system - it was designed in the Soviet Union by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Agriculture. The structure itself - as it were, the shape of the channel - does not provide for its crossing by any mode of transport. In any case, this is a complication of movement. That is, the logic is as follows: bridges explode, they all stop, and our artillery simply destroys them, otherwise.

>Then the third line of defense is the Dnieper River itself. The Dnieper, the Antonovsky bridge, is held to the last, if anything, it explodes, and Kherson, as it were, is out of hostilities altogether, there is no bridge, we only guard the water line. Whoever crosses it, that Dnieper.

>And the last line of defense is the Kakhovka bridgehead. New Kakhovka is being evacuated, people are being evicted there, and the Kakhovka bridgehead is being held. Redoubts and caponiers are made there. All this takes a day. These days we had to stop them at the entrance. Did not work out.

>The current governor, Gennady Laguta, according to his colleagues, on the first day of the war put the keys on the mayor's table with the words: ""I'm not participating in this,"" and left the region.

It makes no sense because it's unnecessary. Why destroy an oil depot, which appears to have actually happened? 

1. The thing is everybody who knows knows that Russia is already at war, so it's not going to convince anyone in the West, and in fact we're saying ""Go Ukraine!"" We know they lie. 

2. As for the countries tha don't know, you could just lie and say something terrible happened and fake it. This would be enough of countries with motivated thinking like India; they want a pretense to believe what they want and actual facts don't matter. Motivated thinking is a powerful force. 

3. Countries that don't care don't care. So there's no reason to convince them, and geopolitically they probably don't matter in the big picture. 

So those are the cases. What, then is the reason to stage a false flag? For their own pride? They are the biggest liars to their own selves and facts matter least in that arena. 

So the *real* reasons they do what they do remain unchanged, which was my original analysis. Not to say they aren't being outright  just making bad decisions, which is always possible.

Its painful as its the perfect vehicle for touring, so much space inside, and can tow a 1000kg boat no probs, or 2750kg braked. But it is not fuel efficient in the suburbs. On the motorway it does about 10km to the L. Around suburbs that drops to 7km per L, at $3  a litre, its a $180 tank now. 

There is a Lexus model here that is really cheap, like $10k USD for a good condition 80kkm SUV. I forget the model name. Basically Japan and Singapore offload them as they can only be kept 3 years from memory in Singapore, something like that I forget the details.

IFVs can survive, and they also have a 30mm gun to shoot back. (Turns out that the vehicle can carry lots of ammo and a really big gun).

Also consistent with the Russian kleptocracy.  

Now... if the troops go marching off to war and come back victorious, nobody is going to care if a few non-existent tanks ""went missing"" by virtue of not coming back.  War destroys things.   But if they slink back after losing, then they are going to have to explain why they were not victorious. Which will include explaining that they didn't have food, they didn't have equipment, and they didn't have fuel.  And then the witch-hunt begins!

So, if you can think critically, and put yourselves in the shoes of an enterprising, creative, but not entirely trustworthy kleptocratic administrator of a FUEL DEPOT for the past ten years, it might have occurred to you that millions of gallons of fuel could be sold on the black market over a decade.  And you too might aspire to have the same kind of yachts and dachas as your peers who are responsible for tank depots and meals and other things (which are also being robbed blind).  In which case you and your buddies would help yourself to the spoils of a war that will never happen.  Until it does.  

And now, you and your co-conspirators, buddies and other partners in crime (which may include some people qualified to fly helicopters) are about to get caught with your pants down.  And possibly executed.  If you are lucky.

 >The rapture is an eschatological theological position held by some Christians, particularly within branches of American evangelicalism, consisting of an end-time event when all Christian believers who are alive, along with resurrected believers, would rise ""in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air"". The origin of the term extends from Paul the Apostle's First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the Bible, in which he uses the Greek word harpazo (Ancient Greek: ἁρπάζω), meaning ""to snatch away"" or ""to seize,"" and explains that believers in Jesus Christ would be snatched away from earth into the air.

But losing Donbas or Crimea is not an option in that regard. Everyone could see through that spin if the Ukrainians would take it back.

I have changed my mind on this over the last 48 hours. I now believe Putin can simply not afford to be seen as having lost this war in Russia. So he would rather risk everything instead of admitting defeat to his own people. There is a reason why these loons on state TV keep talking about nuking everything and why Kadyrov of all people is going hard after the chief negotiatior (who he blames for the decision to withdraw the troops from Kyiv). His voters don't care about their economy, dead soldiers or what they are doing to Ukrainian children or how that is perceived in the world.

I think Putin can sell a defeat at home to a certain extent. He won't be able to sell a retreat from Donbas (or atleast not from the parts that were under Russian control basically pre-Invasion) and especially not from Crimea.

If Ukraine would actually try to kick the Russians out from Crimea (and probably even certain parts of Donbas but I am not so sure here), Putin would IMO escalate this as far as he has to to prevent it from happening.

Thats why I unfortunately believe it is not all that realistic. Nobody wants to see chemical weapons or tactical nukes. But IMO Putin would rather take that risk then face the humiliation of basically admitting to a full scale defeat by ""losing"" Donbas and Crimea to Ukraine. This would be an existential threat to his regime that he might not survive and therefore will not allow to happen. More likely he would mobilize Russia and go for a ""total war"" approach first (which probably would be too much for Ukraine to handle) but I doubt that he would stop at that if push came to shove and that wouldn't be enough.

IMO the best case scenario is for Ukraine to take back parts of Donbas and agree to some sort of fudge in regards to the rest of Donbas and Crimea in exchange for security guarantees that are iron clad enough to prevent Putin from ever trying again in his lifetime. That fudge is also what Zelenskyy seems to have been offering in those negotiations (aka leaving the Crimea question unresolved for now).",1648857361.0,1648857168.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i31r4wp,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Ukraine using easily identifiable helicopters, and flying them over large nonmilitarized population centers so they could be seen and filmed, was not an accident imo. The Mi-24's combat radius is like, 150-200km, and they certainly didn't take off from Kharkiv or right on the border.

And Ukraine hasn't had 'immense' western support since 2014, it has had some, the training in particular has paid off.

And this is not as simple as 'poor planning'. The simple fact that Russia has been unable to effectively enforce Air Superiority is another alarming point.

And I don't deny it will last years, but the longer it lasts, the worse it gets for Russia.

I really wish to emphasise the C3 issues. It's all good and well to have a plan, but when things deviate and change, effective command and control allows a force element to adjust to the new conditions.

Russia has not demonstrated this well in many places.

This is further amplified by Comms. The fact they are even using off-the-shelf CB radios should speak volumes. To then have poor coordination between different force elements further compounds on their command issues.

The ONLY thing that Russia has going for it at the moment is their artillery/bombing... This is not having a notable effect on Ukrainian combat power, the height of folly.

Correct he used nationalist pride and anger at losing the war (which included being shamed in the treaty), and Trump also used national pride, but that has nothing to do with your own point... 

> They do have a way to make us hurt if we make them hurt too badly and are already talking about feeling like Germany after WW1.

Getting back to the that point you made that I objected to, the treaty didn't actually hurt Germany terribly, and the economic pressure from it was not what caused WW2. Nor do I have any idea of what you think we should have done when the Soviet Union fell.

All that said, unlike the treaty of Versailles, these sanctions are actually crippling Russia's economy, and yeah, it could cause a lot of resentment. And that's a price we're going to have to pay, as Putin won't take anything else seriously. I'm very much for leaving them in place and seeing if it puts pressure on Putin. 

If there's any lesson from WW2 (though admittedly a wildly different scenario that really has no place in this discussion...), it's the mistake of punishing Germany just enough to annoy them, but not enough to stop them from starting another major conflict.

Their military capability is nowhere near what it was thought to be, and it is shrinking rapidly as they chew through impossible-to-replace parts in the Ukrainian meatgrinder.

So that's my argument as to why they just don't qualify anymore. Can you imagine if Japan decided to re-take those islands they've been eyeing for a few weeks now? They'd fall apart entirely. This is failed state territory.",False,1648824874.0,t3_ttea0z,t1_i2zm296,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Did they get rid of their president and built stronger ties with the west - yes. Here's a positive example. Belarus was less lucky, because Russia interfered. Pretty sure if we didn't, they'd achieve their goals as well. 

Sitting and complaining or finding excuses, like oh, let's just blame it all on propaganda won't help. When people don't think and just blindly believe what their government says and don't protest en masse, it means they're comfortable enough with the current situation. There are more people than police or rosgvardia all together, even 4-5 millions would be enough to make a difference.
