Day 241 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there were no missiles fired at our city, but the same can’t be said about other cities. Starting at 8am, which is the same time they fired their missiles at Kharkiv the day before, there was another big batch of missiles fired at our energy infrastructure, half of them were intercepted, but the rest did get through. A couple of cities were left with no electricity, and I’m not sure if it has been restored yet.

I’m pretty sure all of the missiles that were aimed at Kyiv did get shot down, proving that Iris-T is very effective, so that’s great, but apparently we are already running low on missiles for it, because it has only been about a week since we got it, and we are already requesting more missiles. Either we are using a lot of them, or not enough were sent initially.

They are also aiming their missiles at cities where there are less air defenses, if instead of cities in the west, they sent more missiles to Kyiv or Odesa they would have probably also been intercepted. Hopefully we get NASAMS soon, because we really need more air defenses. Having one Iris-T is great, but it’s not nearly enough to stop all the Russian missiles, though it’s good that it’s at least enough to protect one city. If we don't run out of missiles for it that is.",False,1666487028.0,t3_yadiph,t3_yadiph,,0,135,0,135,1,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 October 2022


- Russian forces continue to reinforce crossing points over the Dnipro River, and have completed a barge bridge alongside the damaged Antonovskiy bridge in Kherson.

- Although the use of heavy barge bridges was almost certainly included in Soviet-era planning for operations in Europe, it is likely this is the first time the Russian military have needed to utilise this type of bridge for decades. Using civilian barges likely provides Russia additional material and logistics benefits, having lost significant quantities of military bridging equipment and engineering personnel during its invasion.

- If the barge bridge sustains damage, it is almost certain Russia will seek to repair or replace damaged sections quickly, as their forces and crossing points over the Dnipro river come under increasing pressure in Kherson.",False,1666429474.0,t3_yadiph,t3_yadiph,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

Grey Zone post:

>There are only two questions, how to withdraw Russian soldiers from the front line to the left bank, and how to explain all this to the people later? The situation is to some extent even worse than in comparison with the retreat from the Kharkov region after the breakthrough to Balakleya. In fact, the implementation of an organized withdrawal of the first line troops is virtually impossible. And I will be very glad to be mistaken, as in everything written below.
>The first problem gives rise to the answer to the second question - how? What how? And how can we just take and leave the territory of Russia? And that is why, I grit my teeth strongly, I do not exclude that some troops will remain on the right bank, which will become modern ""Panfilov's"", and the battle will be presented almost like Stalingrad.
>You should also contact the Institute of Law and History. First, it must be remembered that the mere possibility does not justify the irrefutability of the commission of an act - the motive is also inherently important. Secondly, it is worth remembering that history already painfully compares has a similar experience, so, for example, in 1941, when Soviet troops retreated to the left bank of the Dnieper from the Germans, the former blew up the Dnieper hydroelectric power station in order to prevent the advance of the latter. It is not possible to estimate the scale of the dead to this day, but not about that.
>The enemy has absolutely no motive to blow up the hydroelectric power station. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have in order to take Melitopol in the spring, the front of the battle for it is planned too be opened from the Zaporozhye region, and also, in fact, to attack from Kherson. So I subjectively believe that the enemy has no goals to destroy the already abandoned city, which we simply do not have the opportunity to defend, not so much due to the smallness of forces and means, but in broken logistics. This, by the way, is about the fact that the enemy stubbornly hit the bridge for three months, while we rejoice at the arrivals of ""Geraniums"" that do not affect absolutely anything.

Take heed of this major rhetorical shift from Putin’s senior political advisor, Sergey Kiriyenko who spoke at length a forum of educators and school administrators:

*“We are all well aware that a war is being waged against Russia today, a real open war. And this war consists of hot fighting on the territory of Ukraine. But it’s not a war with Ukraine, Russia is not at war with Ukraine.*

*The united NATO countries are fighting against Russia today. The purpose of this war is an attempt to eliminate Russia as an independent sovereign state. To eliminate the historical roots of our country, its culture and traditions. It’s being waged against Russian culture, against Russian traditions, against Russian history.*

*Russia has always won any war if that war became a people’s war. That’s how it’s always been. We will also definitely win this war, too. Both the ‘hot’ one and the economic one and the psychological one and the information one that’s being waged against us. This requires it to be a people’s war, so that everyone feels a part of it.”*

Kiriyenko goes on to stress the need for every single person to make their contribution to Russia’s victory by writing letters to soldiers, making essential equipment, etc.

From what I can see, Iran has purchased a lot over the years (lot of middle east countries are overly impressed with anything ""big""), and they've been cannibalizing for a long time.

The other issue is that they can't get much use out of the aircraft they have, so it's easier to keep a small number functional with very low flight hours. The thing is that most airports in the world don't want to have commercial aircraft landing there that don't meet industry standards for maintenance and upkeep. Liability issues, and possibility of losing business from companies that follow those standards and don't want the risk. So Iranian aircraft don't have a lot of places they can fly to anymore.

This is part of the long term effects of major sanctions.

Even under sanctions, many countries are still able to do this because of the benefits that global aviation provides.

2.

Secondly, it is worth remembering that history already painfully compares has a similar experience, so, for example, in 1941, when Soviet troops retreated to the left bank of the Dnieper from the Germans, the former blew up the Dnieper hydroelectric power station in order to prevent the advance of the latter. It is not possible to estimate the scale of the dead to this day, but not about that. The enemy has absolutely no motive to blow up the hydroelectric power station.

A shotgun can bring down a bird weighing less than 10kg at relatively close range, definitely under 100m if you want clean kills. The projectiles are small with low muzzle velocity compared to a rifled bullet, and so lose speed vertically very quickly. They're also easily stopped by metal plate.

You could try a slug, sabot, or flechette round, all used with shotguns against larger ground targets (including as a combat not hunting weapon, or where hunting rifles are restricted) but all of them sacrifice range for additional mass. None would be likely to make contact with a flying target at all.

The Shahed-136 is 200kg, 3 metres long, and flying at 120mph/190kph), and it's capable of flying at light aircraft heights if it wants to. It's definitely not skimming at treetop height. It has, apparently, a full aircraft sized combustion engine powering it, not an electric motor or RC style glow engine.

At best the war is a stalemate, realistically Russia is slowly losing territory. Domestic stability is increasingly fractured. While Ukraine has it worse than Russia in terms of costs of the war, Ukraine has no choice. Russia does. In time Russia gives up and leaves, settling for peace. 

Whether this liberates Crimea or not is largely a function of western and Ukrainian willingness to continue prosecuting the war.

The problem with your frustration is that western systems are more advanced than Iranian, so they take relatively longer to produce.

On top of that, even if the west were to double Iran's speed of manufacturing to transfer, they'd still not be able to reach the ""thousands"" you want.

These drones, loitering munitions, missile systems all require chips and semi conductors, both of which have seen shortages of the last few years and are only just barely recovering.

On top of all that, transferring new technology, training soldiers around it, helping them build a new doctrine all takes a long time. You can't just hand them a new system and say ""have fun storming Kherson"", you have to actually make sure they know what the new system does.

To use a quick analogy, tube artillery is the humble infantry rifle. Absolute workhorse, medium rate of fire, medium accuracy, short to medium range, but very portable. Old school MLRS is a machine gun, higher rate of fire, longer range than the rifle, good for suppressive fire but not a precision weapon. Less portable than the rifle and needs time to set up. A short range ballistic missile is a .50 sniper rifle. Long range, single shot, single kill. Long setup time, and hard to carry around without a vehicle, kinda conspicuous.

The HIMARS is like the Designated Marksman Rifle, and equally disruptive to tactics and fighting styles. It has almost the sniper's accuracy and range, almost the machine gun's rate of fire, but in a package that's almost as portable as a regular infantry rifle.

In short, that's why it's such a game changer. It takes the very best points of three different weapons systems and builds something that outperforms all of them in most scenarios.

Seriously, I feel like a lot of Redditors who are the loudest about condemning Russians and passing judgment on how they “should” act (in front of a fucking camera with their face and/or name exposed for the world to see no less) aren’t actually Russian themselves.  
In fact, I bet a lot of them are Americans, and that makes it even more hilarious, because we couldn’t even throw trump the fuck out after terrorizing our country for 4 years (sure, we were able to vote him out, but we continue allowing his idiotic supporters spread dangerous rhetoric supporting insurrection and denying valid election results under the guise of “freedom of speech”, and now we’re seeing them run campaigns on this shit lol).  

Still, I’m sure that was nowhere near the level of terrorizing a nation that Russians have had to deal with for waaay longer. So why would we expect them to be so openly *against* putin? Russia has a more brutal police force than the US, yet over 19000 protesters have already been detained (16500+ of them *before* the mobilization order), and about a quarter million fled the country already. And those are just the people we know about, so many more were protesting. *Clearly* many of them aren’t about the war. 

I’m not saying they don’t buy into any propaganda and that there aren’t Russians who love the kremlin etc….  
Of course there are. But I do see some parallels to how misinformation and propaganda works in my own country. And given how we’ve gotten more insights lately into how putin’s propaganda works against Russians, I can only imagine that it would be pretty difficult to combat it. 

I get that’s anecdotal, but I know Russians here who luckily got the fuck out years ago, and even they talk about there being a dual concept of “truth”. Like, there’s *truth* truth, but then there’s “I’m just gonna say the shit I need to so my family and I don’t become targets”. And I know Ukrainians here, some who fled the war recently, and they have family in Russia and feel as if putin’s bullshit is literally breaking their family apart. It’s an incredibly heartbreaking, complicated situation that I don’t feel most of us have ever known.  
So yeah, I’m absolutely pro-Ukraine till I die, but I’m also not gonna just hate on Russians without trying to understand how complex their situation is as well. 

So maybe we (those of us in the US) should just stop going on and on and on about what Russians should do and focus on our own shit, before we complacently let the GOP take over congress (which would probably put an end to supporting Ukraine as we know it).",1666454643.0,1666452401.0,t3_yadiph,t1_itc37yj,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

LMAO.  Ukraine was asking for more air defenses a long time ago, well before drones entered the picture.  Before Russia even invaded in fact.

But there are consequences, NVM larger “possible” escalations that people usually talk about when providing more weaponry, and whether its real or perceived. That’s not even relevant here. 

At the very least ATACMS do NOT help with current missile attacks inside Ukraine and they would almost guaranteed MORE long range missile attacks inside Ukraine, which they already can’t deal with. These are the types of escalations you have to worry about. 

On top of this, Ukraine’s primary goal is to get Russia out of Ukraine as soon as possible. IMO ATACMS do not further that goal. In all likelihood it would most likely prolong the conflict. 

Ukraine already has no problem targeting assets in All of Ukraine. Opening up the possibility for most of Russia to fully embrace/support conscription or total war/mobilization seems like a bad idea… Do I think even in that scenario would it ultimately change the overall outcome of the war, no, but it absolutely would effect the goal I previously stated by allowing Russia to sustain the war effort in Ukraine even longer. 

Now are their other platforms/weapons that are being held back that could actually help Ukraine achieve their goal, probably and if people a problem with any of those systems, that makes sense to me.

The point is that the rules might be slightly murky. Let's create two fictitious South American countries, and call them San Theodoros (ST) and Nuevo Rico (NR). Both fly US made Boeings. Now, ST has just ""elected"" a dictatorial military leader who has imposed a bunch of extreme laws, and the country has been put under sanctions by the USA following international condemnation. In contrast, NR is totally democratic, US aligned, and a generally okay place.

ST wants to keep flying its planes, and it's in NR's interest to not have airliners falling out of the sky within its territory. So, NR buys Boeing parts, for the Boeings which it owns, and therefore has a legitimate stock of Boeing parts, and the ability to order them. NR is also not the USA and can still trade with ST providing it doesn't sell restricted goods to them directly.

The loophole here is that whilst NR can't sell Boeing parts to ST, ST planes landing at NR's capital's airport can still, under aviation rules, receive the maintenance needed to keep their international certificate of airworthiness issued. What happens is that ST's airline is just slightly bending the truth and some of their flights to NR are definitely not preplanned maintenance flights and those parts just happened to need replacement whilst on NR territory. NR is in on this, and encourages it, because it's mutually beneficial. The US kinda does nothing because NR has an obligation to repair aircraft that have landed at its airports.

I’m sure they could set a consolidated training program for experienced pilots just training on the platform switch. But even then you’re still training limited numbers because those people have to be taken out or rotation and you can only take so many out or the fight against Russia. 

I haven’t seen any confirmation that this is already taken place but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was and you seem to be saying that this is already happening.

You seem to be jumping between Ukraine actually invading/occupying Russia and then switching they just need to lob cruise missiles at Russia.

Which is it, what exactly are you advocating for, or do you even know? 

Here’s the deal, you know all the platitudes that get thrown around here how Ukrainian morale won’t be broken by missile strikes and the like. The same literally applies for Russia, we’ve seen this through multiple conflicts. Nuking Japan being the exception, but to put it simply conventional strikes will never cause the same amount of fear that nukes can, so strictly speaking it’s not relevant here. 

Ukraine’s goal here is to remove Russia from Ukraine as soon as possible.

A lot people keep referencing people/the US being scared of escalation. But these same people also seem to just ignore the fact that smaller escalation can also be a problem.
