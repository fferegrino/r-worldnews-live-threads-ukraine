RIA cited representatives of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic as saying that the shelling occurred late on Sunday.

Kyiv and the rebels, at war for the last eight years, have accused each other of increased ceasefire violations over the last few days and the use of heavy weaponry such as mortars and artillery. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders says it is concerned about the increase in hostilities.

\- U.S./NATO/French/Allies have \*very strong\* evidence that Russia has already passed the go/no-go line. 

\- Russia says that's bs. They do not plan to attack. 

\- Russia plan's (which the U.S./NATO/French/Allies have discovered call for several false flags to set the pretext for war. As result they run a pretty big public campaign letting the world know about this (in the intelligence community, you don't tip you hands unless it's a strategic move for yourself).

\- Russia's false flags so far have been more like false farts. So no invasion yet. But likely more false flag attacks/provocation/cease fire violations coming. It's possible some of those false flags have been foiled too. The question is whether Putin thinks he needs a bigger false flag or if the litany of minor events will ultimately be enough. 

\- Now in Sunday's two France-Russia calls, Putin said he agree to a summit and still won't invade, but everyone knows it's malarkey. 

\- Finally, France abruptly announces the Biden-Putin summit - which maybe was agreed upon in theory with like a million different conditions that ultimately are untenable for both parties - to show that yes, again, U.S./NATO/French/Allies are still open to talks, just don't freaking invade. 

(so now Putin just freaking invades, likely in the next 48 hrs or waits it out for the Summit.

The biggest difference is quantity. Troops are moving closer and closer to the border, knowing that they are being watched, and knowing what impression they are making but not actually going that last yard. The shelling is also taking place in larger quantities but is again nothing from what we have seen so far.

Russia, despite its really loud barks, is still accepting all kind of talks its being thrown its way. Every time Putin gets the talks he wants, Russia is doing the same as they are doing on the ground, barking really loud.

What does it tell us? That Putin tries to make us believe he is really going to invade Ukraine.

What does he want? His end goal is to force Ukraine to live up to the Minsk agreements (without having to accept Ukrainian troops in those republics under the same agreements). This would basically mean Ukraine will never get into NATO (Donetsk and Luhansk would block it) and Moscow keeps having a big influence on Kiev politics.

How does he want this? By going as far as possible till countries give in to his bluff. In their view they give small concessions (like informally saying they wont accept Ukraine into NATO and by forcing Ukraine to live up to the Minsk agreements) but in reality they give Putin everything he wants without him having to do anything in return. Yes he would pull back his troops but they basically never left Russia (or at most Belarus). It wouldn't cost him anything.

It worked at first as Germany (heavily dependent on Russian energy exports) dragged their feet.

However, the west did not back down or splinter and instead have rallied together as a unified bloc against Russian bs.

Putin expected concessions from France and Germany, instead he pissed everyone off. Instead of splintering NATO and EU, EU has united on responding with crippling economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs and industry, and NATO has airlifted lethal defensive military aid to Ukraine that complicates a Russian invasion.

Putin's bluff has been called and he is in a very bad spot. Traditionally neutral European countries, such as Finland and Sweden, are now seriously rethinking their neutrality in favor of joining NATO.

The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.

Tanks alone, Russia writes off the cost and casualties, and once they control the country they take any Ukrainian tanks that aren't scuttled as spoils of war.

Enough heavy casualties could demoralize Russian forces trying to push forward. It's a mostly conscript army and nothing hits that harder than watching a ton of their friends die.  The age of the commissaries in the Red Army is over so shooting people for insubordination isn't going to fly with draftees armed to the teeth.

Both, Russia halts it's advances, consolidates it's positions, and changes tactics. Expect the Russian sympathizer militias to act as cannon fodder/scouts for the Russian regulars. They'll be used to force the Ukrainians to burn through supplies before the Russian regulars attack.

I think the intelligence disclosures have been so far spot on in saying that Putin will try to manufacture a reason for war. The US is exactly trying to make that harder, and make the consequences of it more negative (especially uniting European opinion) as a deterrent for Russia. Who knows, maybe it'll limit how much of Ukraine Putin decides to invade.

>A senior Biden administration official told the FT that their purpose was to make an “invasion harder to execute, and then should it be executed, to make it harder to claim legitimacy”. But the US official added that it was also about openly countering Russia’s repeated use of misinformation over the past 15 years to gain strategic advantage.

>“We have learned a lot about how Russia uses the information space as part of the theatre of war.

ANYWHERE YOU turn in Moscow, it's easy to find members of the Russian elite who wonder why the West thinks that war in Ukraine is the Kremlin’s preferred course of action. Even if the Russian army managed to force Kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties, the damage to Russia’s national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains. 

The problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex Crimea and to stir conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region. The fact that Russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war. 

When it comes to Ukraine, people in Moscow and the West can be forgiven for assuming that the Kremlin’s policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons. What actually drives the Kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to President Vladimir Putin, as well as those of the Russian leader himself. Emboldened by perceptions of the West’s terminal decline, no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with America and Europe. In fact, the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism. 

Consider Mr Putin’s war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country’s foreign policy.

In recent years members of this group have become very vocal. Messrs Patrushev and Naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and Russia’s international role. According to them, the American-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of Western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance, multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities. A new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values. A feisty, resurgent Russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order, along with a rising China. Given the state of affairs in Western countries, the pair contend, it's only natural that they seek to contain Russia and to install pro-Western regimes in former Soviet republics. The West’s ultimate goal of a colour revolution in Russia itself would lead to the country’s conclusive collapse. 

Washington sees unfinished business in Russia’s persistence and success, according to Mr Putin’s entourage. As America’s power wanes, its methods are becoming more aggressive. This is why the West cannot be trusted. The best way to ensure the safety of Russia’s existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep America off balance.

Seen this way, Ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle. The stakes could not be higher. Should Moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence, Russia’s endurance as a great power will itself be under threat. On a personal level, the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of Soviet nostalgia, great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the Russian Orthodox faith. The fact that the new elite in Kyiv glorifies the Ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at Moscow is a huge personal affront. 

Why then are the people around Putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions? In their eyes, the sanctions that the West imposed to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas were intended largely to check Russia’s rise. America and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another, they were just looking for an excuse. Since 2014 such views have solidified. Messrs Patrushev, Bortnikov and Naryshkin all find themselves on the US Treasury’s blacklist already, along with many other members of Mr Putin’s inner circle. There is no way back for them to the West’s creature comforts. They are destined to end their lives in Fortress Russia, with their assets and their relatives alongside them.

As for sanctions by sector, including those that President Joe Biden’s team plans to impose should Russia invade Ukraine, these may end up largely strengthening the hard men’s grip on the national economy. Import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies, including through Rostec. The massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of Mr Putin’s from his KGB days in East Germany, Sergey Chemezov. In a similar vein, a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned Russia has led to spectacular growth in Russian agribusiness. The sector is overseen by Mr Patrushev’s elder son Dmitry, who is Mr Putin’s agriculture minister. 

Similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which, unsurprisingly enough, are also filled with KGB veterans. If anything, further sanctions wouldn’t just fail to hurt Mr Putin’s war cabinet, they would secure its members' place as the top beneficiaries of Russia’s deepening economic autarky. The same logic is true of domestic politics: as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege, the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime. That further cements the hard men’s grip on the country.

After two years of covid-induced self-isolation for Kremlin bosses, there is a clear tendency toward tunnel vision and a dearth of checks and balances. Russia’s interests are increasingly becoming conflated with the personal interests of the people at the very top of the system.",False,1645401747.0,t3_sxco3t,t1_hxrlerp,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Check out Malcolm Nance interview on the podcast “Gaslight Nation”.  He’s bullish on the Ukrainian people defending the nation at levels that no one is talking about.  The Ukrainian army may not be the most modern army, but extremely prepared.  Even if the Russians have 150,000 soldiers, they’d need 500,000 to police the country, as they would be sitting targets from guerrilla warfare, IEDs, and ambush.  Javelins and stingers can make a big difference, and NATO will continue to arm Ukraine.

It’s a good listen.

The media and public officials swore Afghanistan would stand for years - it fell in weeks and the footage and pictures of the evacuation from the country will be in history books similar to Saigon. 

This, along with other foreign policy disasters of the past four US administrations - things such as Bush allowing Russia to do as they please in Georgia, Obama drawing multiple red lines over Syria that were crossed without problem and so he drew more red lines that then got crossed over, both Obama and Trump and the situations around them seriously dividing the NATO alliance and the west (if you doubt me about Obama, consider the implications that were had when it was revealed the US was spying on Europe to such an extent), and then of course as I mentioned and perhaps most emboldening, Biden in Afghanistan ignoring US allies and etc. Among other things. The slow dissolution of American leadership and collapse from the world stage is evident and playing out in real time, and if you look back over the past twenty years it's even more obvious that is what's happening.

If Putin’s desire to invade Ukraine will lead to sanctions devastating to the (access of) wealth of the oligarchs, there may come a point were they will revolt.

What I don't realize is that I am very insecure about my own self, my own identity, so when I say something else is cringe it's because I'm experiencing second hand embarrassment because I put myself in their situation because I have a lot of empathy because I am overall a very sensitive kid.   
I'm very sensitive. I put myself in someone else's position because I have empathy but when I say something is cringe I wanna fight that off because I don't wanna feel like I am good person but deep down I really am, because maybe, maybe there's an intrinsic value to who I am bro.   
Not just because my cock is huge but because I'm a human being with good morals.

 >The Piper J-3 Cub is an American light aircraft that was built between 1938 and 1947 by Piper Aircraft. The aircraft has a simple, lightweight design which gives it good low-speed handling properties and short-field performance. The Cub is Piper Aircraft's most-produced model, with nearly 20,000 built in the United States. Its simplicity, affordability and popularity invokes comparisons to the Ford Model T automobile.

No, really, this will not end like our parents and grandparents believe it was going to in the 60s.

The impact will be mostly economical and also demographical though. No NATO ally, specially Germany and France, will ever accept a nuclear war happening, is not even in their considerations, and this is the same with Russia, for the sole fact even if Russia tries to invade Ukraine, his country still depends on other countries on Europe through economic relations, something that wasn't that way in the 60s. Russia is economically weak because its depend on other countries to subsits, but politically is strong because of things like what is happening right now, but military hubris does not survive for too long if you don't have money, specially when your customers are judging you.

Also, I very much doubt China will ever trust Putin if he tries to bomb any kind of European country when Germany is its biggest trade partner whiting the region.

I understand your concern related to a nuclear war, my parents have it as well, but I had to explain to them the political arena in the present is quite different than before, Biden and NATO talks about economical sanctions because those are worse for Russia and could possibly stop the invasion, but if Putin escalates to threatening NATO with a nuclear war, is because he is beyond maniac and his own politicians would feel the need to stop him even.

China would for sure still be able to take Taiwan if they really wanted but they probably don't NEED it as much as russia need Ukraine to prevent the collapse of it's economy.

Western intelligence has intercepted Russian communications and planning which revealed Russia's intent for false flag ops.

In 2014 the Donbass region attempted to break away from Ukraine, armed and supported by Russian soldiers and/or mercenaries. By the end, the Crimean peninsular and the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk (And outlying regions) had been secured by the separatists and Russia, which ended in the Minsk Protocol, where a ceasefire was agreed upon, the Donbass achieved autonomy, though not full independence and observers sent in to document the state of the ceasefire. Over that time there has been sporadic skirmishes but no major offensives.

Now, since the Russian buildup at the border in 2022 reached it's peak, there has been a *massive* uptick in border violence, and the Donbass cities have declared they intend to mobilize to fight for independence. Russia claims Ukraine is carrying out a systematic genocide of the Donbass, while the Ukrainian military has stated they don't even have units in the region, nor do they have any intention of sending them there if the separatists stand down and don't try attacking government controlled areas.

So the Russian narrative as it stands, is that Ukraine is trying to carry out a genocide of the Donbass region, and they are considering invading Ukraine to 'protect' the separatists.

The Ukranian narrative (And, I tend to believe), that the Ukrainian military has been respecting the Minsk Protocol, and the separatists are trying to push a conflict, to give the Russians a casus belli to invade in support of them.

The standoff distance should be 1.5x the diameter of the charge. So if the charges is 4in wide then you need a 6in standoff. Thats why rpgs have a cone shape on the front. It's stand off distance. That distance allows the cone to collapse during detonation and actually forces the pressure out in a jet essentially but then rapidly expands after that stand off distance and begins to loose energy at a very rapid rate. That's why anti-armor rugs aren't terribly effective against people. They're different charges for different jobs.

Edit:forgot to add that the inclusion of copper inside the cone also significantly increases the effectiveness of the charge

Edit 2: never clarified why. The cage on the top causes premature detonation allowing the cone to fully collapse and the energy dissipates and can be deflected by the armor on the vehicle. Unless they are using a significantly sized warhead or something I'm not aware of, standard handheld rockets can be defeated in this manner.

 >The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is an index which ranks countries ""by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys"". The CPI generally defines corruption as an ""abuse of entrusted power for private gain"". The index is published annually by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International since 1995. The 2021 CPI, published in January 2022, currently ranks 180 countries ""on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt)"" based on the situation between May 2020 and May 2021.

Describing it as a NOTAM alone is somewhat inaccurate. A NOTAM can be anything, all airports be it small or large have NOTAMs. Just for reference, a NOTAM could tell pilots that at the airport it serves, the lunch break for the control tower is 1245-1330. 

The actual NOTAM in particular in this area is the one that says “[TEMPO DANGER AREA ACT](https://twitter.com/the_lookout_n/status/1495436428456644614?s=21) :” valid between the 21st-26th. This means that aircraft can continue to fly through this area unimpeded, but just to let them know that there may be (in this case) live fire below them, or for other reasons.

The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart's 1993 novel, American Hero.

'Ruslan'; NATO reporting name: Condor) is a large, strategic airlift, four-engined aircraft that was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union (USSR). The An-124 is the world's heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and second heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the one-off Antonov An-225 Mriya (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124). The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in service.

This event took place in the aftermath of the Revolution of Dignity and is part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian conflict. On 22–23 February 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an all-night meeting with security service chiefs to discuss the extrication of the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. At the end of the meeting, Putin remarked that ""we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia"".

The country was located in the same territory as the former Tuvan protectorate of Imperial Russia, known as Uryankhay Krai, north-west of Mongolia, and now corresponds to the Tuva Republic within the Russian Federation. The Soviet Union and Mongolia were the only countries to formally recognize it during its existence, in 1924 and 1926 respectively.

Russia is very familiar with Ukraine, they'll have sympathetic insiders at virtually every level of Ukraine's government and security forces, there's not a massive linguistic or cultural gap and the terrain is flat instead of mountainous.  

There's also 0 chance people in Ukraine embrace the tactics that were most effective in the Middle East, and 0 chance Europe would fund or arm them if they tried. Especially since the ""occupying"" force will consist primarily of Russia aligned Ukrainians. Both the US and Europe are also more susceptible to retaliation from Russia than the local supporters of insurgencies in the Middle East, which will make them more hesitant to engage. 

I think the military is overwhelmed rapidly and is either neutralized, decimated or forced to surrender. Major cities are surrounded while potential opposition figures are targeted.

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

And how can you be so naive, you think it was all a coincidence that this all started when ultra nationalist right wing government was brought to power, semi-secret boasts of your politicians that ""5 bilion for taking Ukraine to your side and soon NATO was money well spent"" was actually, in reality, a ploy from Russia to overtake Ukraine, they changed a pro-Russian government to false flag a war a decade later?

Either you are very naive, or blind, or your media don't give you half the information we in Europe get, and when they give them to you they are doctored just the right way, your way... Or let me simplify!

- You had a deal with Russia that there will be NO spread of NATO towards it, and you've been doing exactly the opposite!

- You had a few arms deals with Russia, YOU pulled out of or broke them all, as recently as last year I believe?

- You armed and trained and hustled Georgian army into destroying Abkhasia and South Osethia, on the very borders of Russia, the provinces in which Russia was a peace keeper by agreement of all 3 sides, funnily enought the exact opposite of what you did in Kosovo where you armed muslim majority to fight Serbia and cede, and vice versa in Georgia!

- You promissed Ukraine the world to give up nukes, what you claimed was that you didn't want them falling into enemy hands, they would've been a deterant now, you took that away and have NOT been helpfull as you promissed!
Not only that but you brought a far right government to power which commited war crimes against Russian citizens of Ukraine, and that will make a long time feud between 2 brotherly nations!!

Is there anything in points above that makes a clear patern of you being the good guy, the peacekeepers, the... NOPE, you are even worse then Russia, you meddle in the entire planets bussiness and when someone pushes back you will demonise them, or false flag some shit and literaly turn them back to stone age!
All that just to satisfy power hungry ambitions, or at least your lobbysts money the took, so today you will help ISIS and Albanian mafia create terrorists, tomorrow you will help Georgia and Ukraine fight their own citizens because they are of other religion or nationality!
Or not even that (what we are taught in C.Europe is that Ukraine and Russia were one until Polish conquests and subsequent slight differences emerging linguisticly when Russian and Polish mingled so by all means they are very close nations and YOU are driving a wedge between them)!!

And all your smart ass comebacks to me were how I'm a bot, who was planted years ago just for this one comment, or that I'm FSB because I spell in British English as a European and not Yankee English, or that the US can't possibly be the bad guy, you'd know, you watch (your) TV...

It was negotiated in 1990 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic (the eponymous Two), and the Four Powers which had occupied Germany at the end of World War II in Europe: France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
