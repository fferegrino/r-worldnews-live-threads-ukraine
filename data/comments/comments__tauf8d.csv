- Their soldiers have no morale whatsoever because lots of them are conscripts with minimal training that have been lied to

- They’re simply abandoning their hardware on the battlefield to be towed away by farmers and don’t seem to be familiar with the concept of asset denial.

- Their air force don’t seem to be communicating or coordinating their attacks with their land forces

- Their tanks and armoured forces don’t seem to have infantry or air support. They’re relying on WWII tactics instead of proper, modern combined arms warfare.

Since it's paywalled, a few important parts:

> Lenders doing business with Russia often conduct transactions in dollars or euros specifically because Moscow’s economy is more volatile and emerging. But President Vladimir Putin has said his government could force lenders in certain countries to accept only Russian currency; as of Wednesday afternoon, the exchange rate was 120 rubles to $1. The Kremlin also has barred its citizens from withdrawing more than $10,000 in hard currency from the nation’s banks.

> Now, experts say, Russia is running out of dollars and other standard global currencies with which to pay creditors, and covering debts with rubles could only serve to further devalue the currency because it basically worthless in global markets.

> Western energy sanctions — President Biden said the United States would stop importing Russian fossil fuels, and the European Union said it would cut its consumption by two-thirds this year — issued in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine also serve to starve the Russian economy of new revenue. That means injections of even rubles into its domestic economy could be hard to come by.

--

> Inside Russia, a default would mean tremendous economic hardship for ordinary people. A lack of capital could mean massive unemployment, with the government and other major employers unable to raise funds to meet salaries. Consumer credit would evaporate, with Russian banks cut off from international financial systems.

> Russians are scrambling to take out money in currencies other than the ruble. On the Telegram chat app, which is highly popular in Russia, people on Wednesday were sharing the locations of ATMs that had euros and dollars available. One Telegram group alone had around 23,000 users.

--

>A Russian default could shake the economies of developing market countries — favored by some lenders for their high-yield upside — so profoundly that investors could ditch those venues in favor of safer bets, experts say. That would flood Western markets with capital pulled out of China, India, Brazil and eastern European economies, fueling even higher price inflation.

--

>  That’s because, experts say, Russia is so cut off from global financial systems that it cannot bring in sufficient revenue. Moscow cannot borrow money from eight of the world’s 10 largest economies. Its economy is dependent upon exporting natural resources, and some of its largest customers have cut off relations. Its consumer economy is far too small to support a prolonged war effort, let alone pay off its debts.

>I became an accidental Russia observer by marrying my wife, a citizen of a former Soviet state. I learned the language, absorbed the culture, and realised early that Russia is culturally distinct and in many ways alien to the West in aspects that now seem obvious. I attribute the differences to the fact that Russia was never part of the commonality of the Roman Empire and its nuances. Russia still remains extremely tribal, separated by centuries of geopolitical rivalries spread over vast distances. The Mongol empire did little to unite Russia as Rome did the West because it was purely about conquest, subjugation, but not assimilation. The result, as Kipling said, “East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet.”

>The fundamentals of Russian society are that elites believe themselves utterly superior and the lower classes exude subservience, neither tenet being useful in maintaining a society. Russia essentially succeeded because of its great size, opposed groups living in relative isolation from each other, helping greatly to reduce strife. Where there is a nexus, in central government for example, the result is generally catastrophic. No system of government survives because of intrinsic competition. Monarchy died by Bolshevism, killed by communism, supplanted by fascism, and whatever comes next.

>Putin is a product and victim of his own cultural history. Nothing about him is exceptional, only typical. His ordinariness now presents as a global threat.

Russia has left the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights organisation, the country's ministry of foreign affairs has said.

In a statement, the ministry said European Union and Nato states were ""unfriendly towards Russia"", accusing them of misusing their majority on the council's committee of ministers.

The Russian ministry claimed these states ""continue their policy of destroying the Council of Europe and the shared humanitarian and legal space in Europe"".

""Russia has no intention of tolerating these undermining actions performed by the collective West in order to impose a 'rules-based order' to replace international legislation violated by the US and its satellites,"" the statement continued.

Speaking at his press conference, Sergei Lavrov says of Russia's economic problems: ""We will cope with them - we have coped with difficulties at all junctures of our history.""

He says Russia will ""come out of the crisis with a better psychology and conscience"".

""We have no illusions the West can be a reliable partner,"" he continues, saying it will ""betray whoever, and will betray its own values"".

""I assure you we will cope and will do everything not to rely on the West ever, in any areas of our lives.""

First, there is no reason for Russia to play around with these and will simply recognize it for what it is. If Americans are shooting at Russians, they're not going to care if they are on a field trip or declaring war on Zelensky etc.

Second, this is what Russia did, we quickly ignored their ""reasons"" and treated it as the war it is. Why do you think it would be any different if we did it?

Third, I think the world becomes worse off when countries all need to coyly try and subvert the rules in order to justify military intervention. Truth matters, especially when it comes to conflicts, lets not degrade the world into a series of false flags and even more disinformation / confusion.

Edit: It is not lost on me that America has championed this idea of entering conflicts but not calling it war.

The best way to fix the problem is probably to impoverish them so deeply that they have to sell their TVs to buy food or at the very least begin to question the narrative they’re being spoofed.

Just some quick background info: this CCP party member is a professor at a top university directly administered by China's Ministry of Education, and I think they originally posted their essay to WeChat [which was then reposted to a Chinese propaganda outlet](http://web.archive.org/web/20220310041939/https://www.kunlunce.com/e/wap/show2022.php?classid=176&id=159437http%3A%2F%2F) (use Deepl and/or Youdao if you don't know Chinese). 

The actual essay (this is a shortened version!) is even longer, so I've included some excerpts below for the lazy. Some translations are mine, some are others. Lemme know if there's any mistakes. 

Again, a lot of it is... disturbing. Propaganda, or truth? I think it's probably both, but mostly propaganda. Still, remember this was originally posted for a Chinese audience. Wonder why their ruling party didn't take any of it down...

[...]

>**The President of Russia once stated that ""Ukraine is a great nation, but that after the color revolution, Ukraine is no longer worthy of respect.** This is a country ruled by corrupt forces, a nation run by an oligopoly, a society with a growing wealth disparity, a collective divided by race, a stronghold for terrorists, and the birthplace of Nazism."" **The Russian president could not stand it any longer and said that only by changing the regime can such a country be truly salvaged.**

>**This is the battle cry of the President of Russia.** It reflects not only the anger of the Russian president, but also the reality of Ukraine as a crossroads in Europe after the color revolution.

>**Russia was ready to reinvent Ukraine's government by completely turning the table over and pulling the rug out from under it. For European countries, this was a deep-rooted baptism; for the Ukrainian people, a cataclysmic event.**

>The US saw Ukraine's plight and at the same time saw the developing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, **and launched the proxy war in Ukraine. The reason the US launched this war in Europe's heartland was to destabilize Europe and make European countries bear the brunt of the war's consequences.**

>With the purpose of launching color revolutions and provoking military conflicts that benefit the US, **the US has also been creating new problems in East and South Asia** . . . The US intends to reproduce 'the Ukrainian model' in Asia and use Kazakhstan, Nepal, Vietnam and the Philippines to strategically contain China . . . Certainly, although the United States has promised to invest in Nepal, **if it interferes in Nepal's internal affairs by investing in a biochemical laboratory,** then China will not agree, nor will India.

[...]

>**The personal fate of the Ukrainian President is irrelevant,** but the tragedy of the Ukrainian people is worthy of sympathy, as the Chinese too has felt the threat of American wars before on the Korean peninsula when American planes continued to fly into northeastern China, **waging biological warfare.**

[...]

>**The world will never be at peace as long as the US exists.** 

[...]

>To address the Ukrainian crisis, **the black hand behind the curtain must first be severed, and that evil empire must pay the price, for only then will Ukraine have hope of rebirth.**

[...]

>From a historical perspective, **Ukraine's current situation is entirely self-inflicted by its government . . . The decline of Ukraine has brought many inspirations to China.** First, we must find a development path that suits us. If we try to copy others' democratic political systems blindly, we may lose ourselves completely in the process of development. 

[...]

>**The sanctions imposed on Russia by the West after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine are shocking and appalling.** Those sanctions have spread to Russian artists and even Russian animals have been targeted. **This shows that the so-called fair trade, the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter and the rules of the World Trade Organization, are not worth a damn in the eyes of Western leaders and they will go to any lengths to achieve their goals.** 

>The US will undoubtedly utilize its position of power to launch a full-fledged offensive against China. **Today's Russia could become tomorrow's China.**

>**China must remain highly vigilant and take all possible measures to safeguard its national interests. In fact, if no practical and effective measures are taken to protect Chinese assets overseas, China risks losing a large number of its overseas assets as it tries** ***to solve its domestic problems.***

This is Russian fascism 

_______________

The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Use

Klokotov stated that in the future the book would ""serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command"". Dugin has asserted that the book has been adopted as a textbook in many Russian educational institutions. Former speaker of the Russian State Duma, Gennadiy Seleznyov, for whom Dugin was adviser on geopolitics, has ""urged that Dugin's geopolitical doctrine be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum"".

Content

In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia, and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.

The book declares that ""the battle for the world rule of Russians"" has not ended and Russia remains ""the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution"". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed ""on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.""",False,1646923588.0,t3_tauf8d,t3_tauf8d,,0,12,0,12,1,0,

I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to debunk some common “myths” I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.

To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the myths below.

Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…

**Myth**: “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”

**Fact**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to organges.

In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.

In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.

**Myth**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”

**Fact**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.

**Myth**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""

**Fact**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine.As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.

**Myth**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”

**Fact**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…

**Myth**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”

**Fact**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",1646932060.0,1646931187.0,t3_tauf8d,t3_tauf8d,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Are there any loopholes that could be exploited to provide support in the Ukraine war without doing the predictable things which would escalate further? Really strange things such as:

(note: I am not considering logistics, timelines or blow-back, just things like treaties and element of surprise)

* The United States unilaterally declare war on and invade Belarus. They are not a nuclear state, they are not (on paper) the same state as Russia (I don't know the terms of their defense agreement). They should not have many Russian troops still left in the country. They barely have control over the country, and there is a government in exile waiting to be installed that would probably be genuinely welcomed.

- and/or -

* The United States declares war on Ukraine and invades from the west. If Russia can conduct special military operations on other's sovereign territory under the guise of a 'special military operation', why can't the US sort of trump that action by the actual recognized deceleration of war? The Ukranians, in on the plan, would allow rapid movement and surrender to the US government at which point the Russians NW of Kyiv would be surrounded and - even without firing a shot - be in such a horrible tactical situation they might be forced to withdraw or fire the first shot themselves.

1. Putin understands MAD and isn't crazy. He likes life, he likes his billion dollar house,  and he wants to keep on living. Or he wouldn't need a twenty foot long table to keep himself safe from germs and assassins.
2. Putin is crazy and doesn't care if he lives or dies. He just likes the aesthetic of a twenty foot long table, but he's willing to use nukes at the drop of a hat, or something equally trivial.

If it's #1 then all his threats are posturing to gain an advantage. If it's #2 then it's a virtual certainty that he will bring about the end of the world at some point. If he has not shits to give, he's just going to keep pushing until we surrender completely or we're forced to respond. Why wouldn't he? The Baltics are lovely in the summer.

Theory #3: If I'm the Biden administration, I don't want to get involved in a land war in Europe. I don't want to sacrifice American lives, American treasure, and I don't want the political fallout. The narrative that Putin is crazy is useful to me because it's my biggest excuse not to do anything. I send out guys like McFaul and Rubio to say/tweet things like “oh boy, that Putin's acting pretty crazy,” and “I've known Putin for decades and he's never been as nuts as he is today.”

cb11e72cfcc21d53ab23d690951fb934,tauf8d,i04h7n8,"Because I keep seeing people suggest escalating the war by the US or the very theoretical escalation by NATO, I suggest we do a thought experiment and really consider what this would feasibly look like. I suggest this not because I believe it is possible, but instead to explain so called ""western apathy"" and ""why the west is sacrificing Ukraine""

First, let's clarify that the alliance of NATO is defensive in nature and would not support a full scale attack without the same occuring to a member nation and that this has not happened so it's off the table. Unilaterally, the only nation that can stop the war is the US, so that's where this is framed from.

Second, in order for the following scenario to be palpable to the US, something significant would need to happen. This all theoretical, so insert your reasoning on why the US would do this here, and I don't believe even the following would do it: Moscow is taking heavy losses in Ukraine and believes the only thing that can save their situation is a dramatic escalation of violence in order to cause immediate capitulation of Ukraine and orders two tactical 10kt weapons to be fired from within Russia, striking both Kyiv and Kharkiv. In the aftermath, 300k Ukrainians are estimated to have died and Russian troops begin moving around the immediate fallout. The US leadership convenes and Congress, likely in secret, approve the use of military force to stop Russian aggression. Worldwide, Russia is cut off from everything outside of it.

Military planners don their cold war to hot war playbook and find significant intelligence indicating a severe degradation of Russian ICBMs, so a first strike is planned. Aegis cruisers are immediately repositioned around vital military assets and population centers, thaad missile defense is put on high alert and patriot missile batteries are placed around major population centers. Stealth bombers are repositioned as far east as allies will accept them while carrier strike groups are moved toward the black sea and Baltic coasts. Knowing that a land invasion is off the table, at least immediately due to both the massive logistics and political will of of r neighbors to agree, assets are moved to sea for preservation but curiously arent moving across the Atlantic. 

In an operation US planners come to refer to as judgement day, the fateful order is given for b2s and f35s to launch into the air with refueling tankers flying with them. Sealed orders are opened that read: 10 minutes ago a nuclear first strike was ordered against Russia. Each of you are equipped with tactical nuclear weapons and are ordered to proceed immediately to your strike coordinates where you will arrive as the warheads hit their targets. Godspeed and may God forgive us for what we have done. 

Russia detects the launch and immediately retaliates while China is informed of the move as it happens and informed that they are in no way a target and a live uplink is handed over to our nuclear forces which they believe. In the aftermath, it is discovered US intelligence was correct and the Russian nuclear forces were indeed fewer and worse maintained than our wildest dream. A handful of American cities are hit by warheads that failed to be intercepted and there are 12 million casualties in the US. In Russia, the devastation is total and casualties are expected to be above 130 million dead. In the chaos a few Western cities are also hit adding 10s of millions more dead. The war in Ukraine is over, NATO is abolished and the world unites against the nation that has committed the most serious genocide ever imagined. Biden is immediately impeached, etc, etc

That's basically what I believe would happen BEST case. That's why nothing can be done. It all ends in some variant of that. This isn't apathy, it's all that is possible",1646930295.0,1646930165.0,t3_tauf8d,t3_tauf8d,,0,-8,0,-8,0,0,

Nothing new though, exactly the same was true of many old Iron Curtain airlines like Interflug and communist era LOT.

The theory was that the two good engines would keep it airborne in the event of a failure. In reality, that didn't work.

He's still fighting the Cold War even if everyone else has stopped.  

I've used this example before: Imagine I have a rare vase. Your goal is to take it from me. My goal is to stop you from getting the vase. I can simply smash the vase to stop you getting it. That's how easy it is for me to win and you to loose.  

If Putin could take Ukraine mostly whole he would have. But he can't. So he can totally destroy the country (smashing the vase) and still accomplish his ultimate goal (you not getting the vase). The death-toll and destruction on both sides means nothing to him. Stopping Nato from having Ukraine is his only concern and he doesn't care how he accomplishes it or at what cost.

Russian BTG (Brigade Tactical Groups)  require local paramilitary support to function and expressly suck at logistics.  As they try to move into areas with less local paramilitary support their performance will get even worse.

This looks to be a 'defense in depth' similar to the Winter War with unsupported Russian elements being trapped.  They can slog forward on roads but they can't really sustain anything.  Sustainment is the only thing that matters.

remember the video a couple days ago of the armored vehicle machine gunning a elderly couple in a car?  That armored vehicle was guarding 1 tanker truck like the entire war depended on it.

This is BTG commanders not communicating and realizing that everything is fucked and continuing to their original objectives as fast as they can.

-	America is giving billions in aid from U.S. tax dollars.  (Yay!)

-	Oil and gas companies have thousands and thousands of unused drilling leases in the United States which probably equals a 10+ year supply, but they’re happy to go to the bank with what they already produce when you’re paying more and more at the pump.  (Boo!)

Visa application centres
You will need to have your photograph and fingerprints taken at a VAC as part of your application. Children under the age of 5 will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to attend the VAC and have a digital photograph taken.

When you attend the VAC you will need to provide your passport which will be scanned. If you do not have a passport you can still apply but will need to explain why you are unable to provide it.

Please be advised that the VAC in Kyiv is closed and all UK visa services in Kyiv are suspended.

How long it takes
You will need to await a decision from UKVI on your application before travelling.

You will be contacted when a decision has been made.

Please do not attend the VAC to collect your decision until you have been contacted.

Apply from inside the UK
Guidance on how to apply to the scheme from inside the UK will be available soon.

In the meantime you can call the free 24/7 helpline on +44 808 164 8810 (0808 164 8810 from within the UK) for help with any questions about the scheme. If you cannot contact UK 0808 numbers, please use +44 (0)175 390 7510.

I hear what you're saying, and I know it comes from a place of meaning well, but no. They are not extradimensional beings, they are not demons, they are not aliens.   
  
They are human. They are just like you and me. Understand what I'm saying: The worst atrocities ever witnessed were not committed by aliens or underground lizard people, they were committed by humans. They were committed by people just like you and me.   
  
Every time something happens, we fall into the trap of convincing ourselves that it only could have happened because the ones doing it must be something other than human, that they must be fundamentally different in some way, that no *real* person would ever be capable of something so horrible.   
   
That trap is called ""arrogance"", and it's the reason these things are allowed to happen. Our ego convinces us that the problem is *that specific person*. That if Putin were dead, if Hitler had never been born, if _______ had never existed, then these things could never have happened and the world would be free of evil.   
  
It's an insidious trap, because it leads us to believe that all the problems rest on the shoulders of one entity, and that by eliminating that entity we will have solved the problem. Sadly, it doesn't work that way. These disgusting men are the symptom, and the cause is human nature. That's the uncomfortable truth that we conveniently avoid when we say things like ""They're not even human"".   
  
Hate to break it to you: But that's the line of thinking that allowed them to do what they did in the first place. The same thought process that led you to believe that Putin is something other than human is the same thought process that he used to justify his horrific acts of war.   
  
Do not delude yourself. Look around you, look at every single person you meet, look in the mirror, and remind yourself every day that the person you're looking at could have been a Putin, a Hitler, a Pol Pot, just as easily as they could have been a saint.

The problem is that Russia has S400 SAM systems *inside their borders* which could shoot down interceptors we send to shoot down Russian planes.

Now with their losses and Ukraine getting so many foreign weapons and reinforcements it will be hard for Russia to beat them any time soon without horrendous losses.  Instead they will likely try to bomb/starve them into submission.

One unknown factor is how long Russia can keep this up in light of the sanctions and pressures at home.  If they can survive through the sanctions long enough then they could have enough time to force Ukraine to surrender to avoid millions of civiliian casualties from being under seige.  If they need to beat the clock on sanctions then they need to go all in soon, and trying to capture a defended city is slow, expensive work so they will likely fall short.

The short answer is:  
Short term: yes, they should be able to have a pyrrhic victory.  
Long term: they cannot occupy ukraine or install a puppet government with any sort of power against the people.  


If you look at the Russian advances. The truth is, they are advancing. Losing tons of manpower and firepower in the process but they are advancing. It's become apparent they wil resort to any scumbag tactics to ensure their 'objectives' are met although taking over the entirety of Ukraine becomes doubtful and short of using WMD, even taking Kiev seem like a suicide mission for the short term.  
The sad truth is that Kharkiv and Mariupol probably goes down eventually but its a matter of inflicting maximum damage as possible and even then, Russians will be forced to deal with insurgent attacks for the remainder of their time there.  


It si true that Ukraine has the man advantage however, Russia makes up for it with brute force and the thousands upon thousands of artillery shells they have available that they will fire indiscriminately at random targets.

Russia has fucked itself hard. Their supply lines are chaos, their encrypted communications have been disabled by their destroying 3g and 4g cell towers so all known communications are unprotected, and in many cases their troops are using unsecured analogue radios to communicate.

Further, troop desertions are common. Civilians finding abandoned APC’s and tanks seems the norm. Generals are being killed by snipers (extremely rare in modern combat, although Russia has failed to show the coordination necessary to facilitate what would constitute modern warfare).

Outside of overwhelming force against civilian soft targets with artillery, missiles, and aircraft, they’ve underperformed more or less across the board. Fueling, let alone feeding, their troops continues to be a logistical problem, and it’s quite likely at least a few Russian soldiers froze to death overnight. 

Long story short? Russian military credibility is down the drain, but Putin’s willingness to push his troops into a meat grinder is such that he is making some progress and likely will ultimately achieve his goals with enough time.",1646928830.0,1646928552.0,t3_tauf8d,t1_i04bung,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

You can see it on a smaller scale too - like when there's a flood in your own country you care more then when it's half-way across the world. Ukraine is in Europe and wanted EU membership - therefore Europeans do care more. I'm not saying, in a perfect world, that it's the morally right thing but humans are creatures of impulse and instinct.

I'm sure that people in the Middle East and Africa also naturally cared more (I'm not saying they don't care about Ukraine either) about the human tragedy in their own neighbouring countries as well. The second unfortunate reality is that Europe and its allies are able to put more pressure on their enemies than those neighbouring nations to Palestine, Afghanistan, Congo, etc can. If, for example, West Africa was in a large allied grouping with the GDP and influence of the EU then I can imagine these issues would be getting just as much attention. Unfortunately it highlights the disparity in the world. 

tl:dr: Humans are relatively tribal, and care about things that are familiar to them, close to them.

That being said, I would argue that we *did* have a responsibility militarily that we failed to meet (my personal take is we should have gone and set up a tripwire force in early Jan, pre-empting Putin from drawing his own red line against our involvement, but hindsight is 20/20 and all that). You have to remember, NATO promised back in 2008 to eventually extend invitations to both Ukraine and Georgia, which precipitated this whole thing. Obviously, this is all a pretext to Putin, but a) it is a talking point that allows him to rile his domestic base in support of this, and b) allows China to be a lot more handwavy than they should be allowed to be (and this is important, because China is essentially going to be Putin's lifeline here). It sets a terrible precedent that ""if NATO is considering to offer someone membership, invade them quick because NATO won't intervene militarily"", and, perhaps more important to me on a visceral level, it suggests that we are *essentially* screwing them over by having them align with us. For those that disagree on this point, I would challenge you to come up with a way for Ukraine or Georgia to have successfully joined NATO without getting invaded.

Why am I going into all this? Because I would argue that, beyond Ukraine, we are still handwaving with Georgia, who have *extreme* interest in joining NATO at this point and leaving them in a limbo. Yes, I recognize that joining NATO is a process, but stop leaving them on the hook and either commit to it or don't, and if we do commit to it, I would argue we should pledge to immediately commit to militarily defend à la Art. 5 - perhaps with a time expiry on it to make sure they actually do make progress towards meeting requirements for full membership. This is the point where I feel we failed Ukraine, and I would like to see more concrete action taken to ensure we don't further fail Georgia as well (beyond what they already lost in 2008)

If that is not the case, and we want to talk realpolitik and say that they are going to be buffer states -- well 1) that's shitty but sure, that's politics I guess, but 2) then don't give false promises. Make it clear that's what they are, but also make it clear to Russia that converting them into a ""not-buffer-state"" is going to be reacted to extremely poorly by the west.

- We're not any closer _right now_ to nuclear war, than we were in the last half century. It's still very low probability.

- Putin can't _actually_ trigger nuclear war, can just hand over the codes; he needs actual Russians to execute the order - and there's a history of Russians disobeying such orders, so I'm not extremely concerned about Putin triggering the nuclear war.

- What I am mildly concerned, though, is Russia disintegrating.

Ukraine was a model of disarmament and peace. Giving up its nuclear weapons, withdrawing from those Soviet era projects on chemical and biological warfare, and accepting international oversight to confirm these things.

Under what ""authority"" does Russia assume rights to parts of another sovereign country? (Other than... we have a bigger army and lots of bombs).

What stops China, India, the US from doing this in the future? The UN cannot allow this to happen. It shouldn't have allowed it to happen in Georgia (or done more). The Europeans let Russia railroad the Minsk agreement with the version 2 debacle.

Plus... Russia have already recognised the two Donbass territories as independent republics.(Remember that sham of a Russian security council meeting two weeks ago?)

Why?

How long does this last for? 10 years, 30 years, 50, 100, 1000. 

NATO: Security situations change all the time and Ukraine should be able to determine their own sovereignty and alliances. Ukraine wouldn't attack Moscow if Russia decided to form an alliance with China (for example).

EU: Cannot dictate another countries economic alliances and decisions.

In my view, these are both unreasonable and non-negotiable.

The actions of the (shit) government speak for themself. For years we have been training Ukrainian troops. For weeks Before the invasion we were arming them... while the EU were playing with their own dicks using Russian oil as lube. 

Since the invasion began the UK has seized more, in terms of financial value, than the EU and US. While still providing Ukraine with as much aid as possible. 

And the Ukrainians themselves seem to agree that the UK is doing the most.

But the key player is China (with whom Putin signed an agreement late in 2021, on the down low, involving many aspects of cooperation between the two nations). China is the world's largest consumer of Russian oil, and well, as prices go up for the remaining oil on the planet, China will be eager to buy more Russian oil. 

And it will. China also needs lithium (to make batteries; Russia is its suppler - we are all going to buy batteries from China, I figure), palladium (for semi-conductors and catalytic converters, to name two essential purposes; most semi-conductors and catalytic converters use palladium from Russia). 

So we would have the world divided into two parts, with the West dependent as it is on China for batteries, For example, currently [Tesla batteries come from China](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-looks-pave-way-chinese-battery-makers-come-us-2021-10-21/#:~:text=Tesla%20currently%20uses%20LFP%20batteries,Model%203%20sedans%20with%20LFP). Tesla wants to move that to the US (and there's lithium in the Western hemisphere - although investment will be needed to mine and refine it). Australia is currently the top supplier of lithium, but China is trying to move away from Australian lithium and toward Russian and Ukrainian lithium (currently supplying about 6-7% of the lithium used in China - but the goal of China's agreement with Russia was to decrease dependency on Australia and increase import of lithium from Russia).

So EV's are going to be price-affected by all of this, especially if the West decides it must cut Russia off from the world economy - because China and India are likely not going to do that. Nor will Thailand, Malaysia and other places currently producing batteries.

I also think the NFZ messaging by the involved powers is focusing on the wrong point (namely that it would be an escalation) primarily because to explain it properly would be an admission of weakness. 

In addition to the covered ideas and even if you overlook the fact that we would be firing on Russian AA stationed in Ukraine to establish it, an NFZ would **require** destroying the S-400 SAM sites which are in sovereign Russian territory which is a monumental escalation. We would probably need to use e.g. F35 and other stealth aircraft to do it - and we damn sure don't want those humiliated on the world stage or shot down and captured. All of this is undesired escalation.

But to me the most critical argument against an NFZ is that it would do **nothing at all to help** against rockets, cruise missiles, intermediate range missiles, and artillery which seem to constitute nearly 100% of the current attack strategy.

My thoughts on that particular question is that it's spot on but it should be aimed at the global collective zeitgeist.

Asking a single person is kinda like saying ""do you prefer war or peace?"" Like how you supposed to answer that when you're clearly doing a war.

It's extremely valid.

But it's a question for the soul and something people need to wake up to (reality).

ccc1046bd2523c4a595ed6515adeb0d4,tauf8d,i04abno,"It's mostly due to the passive reputation as Canadians as a whole and the reputation our military has with other countries in past conflicts.

Canada has many times outpunched it's weight class on a global stage starting in WWI, earning the respect of major military forces.

Perhaps the main reason was that they were consistently victorious on the battlefield, despite the fact that the British high command used them as cannon fodder. Time and again they achieved seemingly impossible tasks after everyone else had tried and failed,

They held the line at Ypres during the war’s first gas attack when troops on their flanks fled (with bloody good reason). Maybe they just didn't know better as they were new to the front. Maybe they were just plain stubborn. Green troops can sometimes take far greater risks in their baptism of fire than when they became more battle seasoned and wise.

At any event, some inspired officer ordered them to urinate on their puttees or handkerchiefs and wrap them round their nose and mouth. Apparently the ammonia checked the worst effects of the chlorine gas. Then they stood to their guns and fought on, foiling a determined German effort to achieve a decisive breakthrough. Right then and there they started building a reputation as hard fighters.

Probably the cornerstone of their reputation can be summed up in three crucial battles: Vimy Ridge; Passchendaele; and Amiens. The latter became legendary when they convincingly smashed the German defences and ended the stalemate that had caused such devastation on the Western Front for 4 years.

Thus began what is known as Canada's 100 days, when they broke into open country and spearheaded the allied pursuit that would end where the war began for the British - when the Canadians recaptured Mons on the day before the Armistice.

Why were they so successful? They weren't any more courageous and determined than other soldiers. But they had the benefit of a dream team of senior leaders. Sir Arthur Currie, a part-time soldier from British Columbia whose main background was real estate, and his boss, Lord Julian Byng who would later become Governor General to Canada.

These two seemingly disparate personalities forged a close and lasting partnership born of their mutual distaste for the tactics of the British high command that seemed destined to achieve nothing but forests of headstones, through badly planned frontal assaults against well prepared German positions.

They set about to develop a highly innovative approach to planning and assault tactics that flew directly in the face of British convention at the time. They greatly increased the number of guns on the Corps frontage, around twice the force usually assigned by the BEF or better, perfected the “creeping barrage” and brought counterbattery fire to a new level of precision by integrating aerial reconnaissance into their plans.

As well, they invested time in careful preparation of the infantry, by practicing their assaults, using lifescale mockups of the intended objectives in the rear area. Here they briefed and trained units down to platoon level ensuring that each man was trained to assume the task of the man above him.

They did away with hitherto rigid extended lines of assault troops, opting for a more loose formation in which company and platoon commanders were encouraged to employ their initiative moving forward and adopt the practice of “fire and movement”. At the same time, they trained the infantry to advance much closer to the creeping barrage than usual practice, to reduce the time available to the defenders to exit their bombproofs and man their machineguns.

They introduced additional lines of freash troops to pass through the assault formations after they had siezed the trenches and prepare for the inevitable German counterattack. They employed aggressive patrolling and trench raids to gather intelligence on the enemy positions while denying the defenders the chance to rest. And they became adept at deception tactics to confuse the Germans as to their dispositions and intentions.

All the while, the two men fought British high command remorselessly for the resources and operational freedom they needed to put their plans in motion. Neither was terribly popular with the boys at the top. They didn't care. They worked their magic and succeeded time and again while working constantly to minimize casualties. Both men were widely respected by the rank and file and especially by the Germans. One such wrote after the war that whenever they saw the Canadians move up to the line they knew they were in for it.

In sum, the Canadians succeeded in part because they were willing to break the mould of British military convention and fight smart as well as hard. Yes they had guts, but so did millions of others that were fed jnto that slaughterhouse. Other factors as important were meticulous planning; hard and constant practice; familiarity with the plan down to the rifleman; tactical delegation and innovation; and the sheer esprit de corps built upon consistent success. These were the crucial factors that formed the reputation of the Canadian fighting man during WWI.",1646927633.0,1646927450.0,t3_tauf8d,t1_i048t9w,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

So when he says, “Send the army”, he’s imagining something totally different from what they actually have.

Same thing for the Russian Air Force; they just don’t have the training (flight hours and quality of training) to coordinate large scale air operations.  So he says ‘send the air force’ and like, groups of two and three planes go out and sometimes get shot down because Russia just doesn’t know how to use them.

I'm not sure what point you think you're making, but this is exactly it: NATO is the military line in the sand. We don't want Russia to invade Sweden or Finland or Ukraine for that matter, but while we can destroy Russia's economy and isolate them from the international community, we cannot risk a nuclear confrontation. I know, nukes aren't fair, it sucks, doesn't it?

> And then, feasibly, it could be ""if NATO actively decides to defend Estonia, we'll fire nukes"". Well damn, we better kick Estonia out of NATO and remove all our troops, because we can't risk provoking nuclear weapons.

I keep seeing this repeated, but it makes absolutely no sense. You're fabricating a slippery slope out of literally nothing; the word ""feasibly"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there.
NATO is a defensive alliance. If you attack one member, the rest attack you. That has always been clear, and we have literally zero reason to assume this wouldn't be the case. At this point, we have to risk nuclear war, because the alternative is Russia taking over the world. 

You use the word ""appeasement"" here to describe us not going to war with a nuclear power, which presumably is supposed to conjure images of Hitler in the 30s, but it's such a stupid comparison. France and Britain could have isolated and demilitarized Germany, and the deterrent was that it might be expensive. We are not in the same scenario today. 

I feel like it's obvious to everyone, but apparently it needs to be restated: there is a real (albeit probably slim) chance of NUCLEAR WAR. World-ending destruction, where the death toll would be at least in the millions, potentially the billions. This strong-man attitude of ""well fuck Putin, I don't believe he'll actually do it, and I feel bad about 'appeasing' him"" seems to forget that the outcome if you're wrong is entire cities being flattened to the ground.

The USA, by contrast, is pushing for *cultural* victory - and just like China with economic force, the US is an unstoppable engine of cultural force. That means there's only 1 category left for Russia to try and ""beat"" the US and China in: *Military* victory. Part of the military victory strategy is espionage, which the Kremlin has been very engaged in for the last 2 decades.

Obviously Russia is *very* aware that their military is second to the US's (and thus most of NATO, by extension). But they also know that their military *can* dominate the nations they're interested in, such as Moldova, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, etc. Part of that strategy is also ensuring that Russia would be able to do so un-opposed, which is where he failed: He overestimated the loyalty and/or influence of politicians and leaders he's been bribing/coercing abroad since he first got into office.

Firstly, we (the West) are not just ""watching this happen."" Unprecedented steps have been taken to help Ukraine. Weapons, billions of dollars, humanitarian aid and sanctions on Russia. Much of this has come from NATO countries. In fact NATO has been training the Ukrainian military since 2015. That's a big deal.

What NATO countries are refusing to do at this point is **declare war on Russia.** They're stopping shoot of putting troops on the ground. For the same reason, the USA is refusing to be responsible for delivering Poland's jets to Ukraine - because if they do so, Putin will interpret that as America declaring war on Russia.

So what you're asking when you say ""isn’t it best to draw that line now?"" is ""isn't it best for the 30 countries in NATO, including the US, Canada, and most of Europe, to **declare war on Russia** now?""

If those countries declare war on Russia, best case scenario they do stop Putin. But it will come at a very high price. The price will be **a greater loss of life than will occur without military intervention.** More people will die. Many, many soldiers from NATO countries will die. But not just that. Putin will almost certainly react by increasing shelling of residential buildings in Ukraine, and possibly by resorting to chemical weapons. That means more civilians will die. More elderly people. More pregnant women. More children.

And that's the *best* case scenario. A world war. The worst case scenario is *nuclear* war.

The reason NATO is holding off on putting troops on the ground is **not** because they don't think Ukrainians are worth saving. Please stop saying that, because NATO is not a club of elite people, it's an alliance of *nations* made up of *hundreds of millions* of people who value human life regardless of race or nationality. 

NATO is refusing to declare war because it's trying to avoid making a bad situation much, much worse.

 >Since 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip as part of the continuing Arab–Israeli conflict. The attacks, widely condemned for targeting civilians, have been described as terrorism by the United Nations, the European Union, and Israeli officials, and are defined as war crimes by human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets to be illegal under international law.

So why did he not outright bomb from the start? Ukraine is big. Its HUGE if you look at the map. Have you looked at the encirclement map recently? What has Russia been doing? They are funneling the resistance to as small a defensive location as they can. In the military, we call this the kill zone. You get the defenders turtling up in the capital, so that you can more easily wipe them out.  


Why not just carpet nukes? Because it is costly and risky? Because you won't be able to use the whole region (as opposed to just a tactical nuke on Kyiv once he forces them to hole up in one area). Also, Putin himself wasn't sure if regular warfare would work enough (clearly now it doesn't) so there wasn't a need to go all out right off the bat. Not to mention he had no idea how the west would respond too. But now we know NATOs stand, it makes his job easier. Just don't trip the wires and he can bomb all he wants.

_______________

The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Quick Facts Author, Original title ...

Dugin credits General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff as co-author and his main inspiration, though Klokotov denies this. Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International Department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, helped draft the book.

Use

Klokotov stated that in the future the book would ""serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command"". Dugin has asserted that the book has been adopted as a textbook in many Russian educational institutions. Former speaker of the Russian State Duma, Gennadiy Seleznyov, for whom Dugin was adviser on geopolitics, has ""urged that Dugin's geopolitical doctrine be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum"".

Content

In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia, and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.

The book declares that ""the battle for the world rule of Russians"" has not ended and Russia remains ""the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution"". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed ""on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.""",False,1646923268.0,t3_tauf8d,t1_i03zfis,,9,1,0,1,1,0,

The ""How"" of ""how will NATO planes enforce a NFZ"" is ""with bullets, air to air missiles, and air to ground missiles and bombs targeting the SAM sites that threaten them, and missile launching sites that they would otherwise need to intercept in the air""

If you want me to expand the ""how"" to also include Russian response, I expect they will shoot back. They are deeply invested in this invasion, not only financially but also in terms of manpower and equipment. Even if the escalation is initially limited to conventional warfare between NATO air assets and Russian SAM / AA and air assets, the escalation brings in the entirety of NATO - which comprises 30 countries. This qualifies as a world war in scope and scale.

If we make the idealistic assumption that escalation would end there, NATO and Russia would be shooting each others planes out of the air and destroying ground assets that threaten planes. Assuming NATO is able to establish air superiority, Russia would once again feel the need to escalate. How they escalate is anyones guess, but it would further degrade the situation.

To maintain air superiority, NATO would need to start bringing in their own AA / SAM emplacements, which would mean boots on the ground. Additionally, for the sake of logistics, NATO planes would likely need to land on Ukrainian airstrips for refuel, resupply, and maintenance. Just the presence of NATO planes, airmen, and maintenance crews on the ground could escalate the situation further, including bringing more men in on the ground to support and defend those airstrips.

WW3 doesnt necessarily mean immediate nuclear annihilation, but it will mean contested airspace with NATO and RU air assets fighting over Ukraine, with all the included necessity of destroying hostile AA to preserve air superiority, and all the logistics requires to keep a constant supply of planes in the air to maintain the NFZ.",1646912665.0,1646912296.0,t3_tauf8d,t1_i03f6fd,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Why?

Something along the lines of ""If these planes fly from NATO countries to Ukraine it's seen as unacceptable."" In other words, Russia doesn't agree that it's ok, on some kind of technicality. And this is being respected. Green light from the West - red light from the East.
