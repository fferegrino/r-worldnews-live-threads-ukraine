Day 51 of my updates from Kharkiv.

They continue shelling residential districts as usual, just today 11 civilians died from it. My area is pretty quiet, but we still hear explosions and our artillery/MLRSs constantly. Even right now it is pretty loud outside, but compared to the intensity of shelling around eastern part of our city this is nothing.

They are destroying civilian infrastructure while calling it a legitimate target and then they cry when we destroy their warships, saying that that’s unfair, that this is an attack on Russia! Yeah, no shit, this is a war, but apparently fighting back is prohibited, we just need to give up and die. 

Seriously, they are getting more ridiculous by the day, and while watching them become more and more desperate is extremely funny, the stuff they say on their official media is just crazy. Now they started directly saying that they are conducting genocide and that this is the right thing to do, as apparently Ukraine shouldn’t exist and being called Ukrainian is an insult. 

First they were saying that they are “liberating” us, now they are confirming that they are indeed conduction genocide, they don’t even hide it anymore. So what is it, genocide or liberation? Or maybe they think that those two words actually mean the same thing?

>	Just now, @jaketapper on @ccn asked me about the strategic & operational importance of the Moskva sinking.

>	In my view, this is a very big deal for a variety of reasons.

>	Here's a new 🧵 

>	First, many are still asking ""was this a ship board accident (fire), or was this really a Neptune strike?""

>	DoD indicates the latter.  

>	Having said that, this was MORE than a simple matter of a couple of missiles hitting a ship that was a great distance away.

>	There will be an after-action review (AAR) on this strike, and someday we will learn what went into it.

>	But anytime a military unit conducts a strike as complex as this, there is MUCH more than just launching a couple of missiles that surround the event.

>	Let's leave it there.

>	But I would say that it is open-source reporting that Ukraine has had this ground-to-ship missile in experimentation for about 5 years.

>	Now I'm not a sailor, but it seems the Russians sure didn't incorporate that info into their naval maneuver planning.  

>	Shame on them.

>	Back to the question: Will this sinking be strategically important?

>	I'd say, emphatically: Yes, for a variety of reason!

>	First, this the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.  But this ship was also the flagship during the 2008 invasion in Georgia, and it's named for MOSCOW!

>	This ship was tasked to provide overall Fleet C2 (command and control), Air Defense (it is filled with different ADA systems), and it would have discharged Naval Infantry (Marines) during a planned amphib assault on the shores near Odesa.

>	As Putin revised his plan for ""eastern & southern attacks"" after failing to take Kyiv, the seizure of the Black Sea coast (& perhaps the continued attack toward Transnistria in Moldova) was likely part of the ""new"" plan.

>	It will be hard to execute that western assault now.

>	But there's more...

>	Russia/Putin should NOT take this sinking as a singular event.

>	Let's add the Moskva sinking to other failures:  
   -The destruction of the Russian Parachute Regiment (the famed ""palace guard"" VDV/Spetznaz) north of Kyiv during the first week of the war.  
   -The loss of at least 7 generals & an unlimited number of Colonel Commanders of key Combined Arms Armies and Tank/Motorized Rifle Units.  
   -The increasing number of Russian soldiers (mostly conscripts) killed in action (Ukraines count is now 20,000...and that's likely conservative).  
   -The destruction of over 700 tanks and literally hundreds of other armored vehicles during the first 50 days  
   -The inability of the Russian Air Force to provide close air support to Russian ground troops or deep strikes against Ukrainian forces due to fear of UA air defense  
    -Russians communicating using unencrypted devices that leads to intelligence leaks  
    -Ukraine Army helicopters conducting a cross-border operations into Belgorod to destroy multiple fuel tanks  
    -UA special operations striking behind Russian lines against key logistics targets.  
    -RU failure to resupply/medically evacuate their troops  

>	Again, the strike against the Moskva was a big deal.

>	But combining it with other the Russian military failures, it should be difficult for Putin to explain to his citizens.

>	The advantages of being an authoritarian w/ a friendly RT news channel.

>	I've learned never to underestimate my enemies, but it's going to be VERY hard for Russian General Dvornikov to turn this around.

Finland ‘highly likely’ to join NATO, minister says

Facing a dramatic change in its security assessment and relations with Russia, Finland is ‘highly likely’ to join NATO now, Finland’s European affairs minister Tytti Tuppurainen told Sky News in an interview.

“The people of Finland seem to have already made up their mind and there is a huge majority for NATO membership of Finland,” she said from Helsinki.”

“Of course, that’s not all. We are a parliamentary democracy so we need to discuss this issue in our parliament. At this point I would say it is highly likely, but a decision is not yet made.”

Russia has warned of consequences if the Nordic country makes such a move, and saying it would need to make new nuclear deployments in the Baltics is the alliance expanded along Russia’s borders.

—-

Theres a lot to unpack here in my view. 

First of all, several sources including Russian and Ukrainian news are reporting him killed, and even though the Kremlin has not bothered to confirm we can pretty safely assume the news is accurate.

Secondly, this lends some solid if anecdotal credence to the military truism that spent units can’t just be immediately redeployed to the front lines after being ravaged just a month prior.

Third, one of Russia’s best motorized regiments is now presumably trying to engage Ukrainian forces without its commander. Another point we’ve seen driven home again and again is that the Russian units rely heavily on senior leadership to execute their missions and fall apart spectacularly without their officers’ micromanagement.

Forth, the fact this guy rolled into battle and immediately died is absolutely laughable from an intelligence perspective. There aren’t any major offensives or counter offensives ongoing right now, he had absolutely no reason to expose himself to enemy fire but he did anyway. Makes you think even the regiment commanders are essentially blind on intel, much less their subordinate officers and troops.",1649994158.0,1649993465.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,143,0,143,0,0,

From CNN's Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told European allies that the United States believes the Russian war in Ukraine could last through the end of 2022, two European officials told CNN, as US and European officials have increasingly assessed that there is no short-term end in sight to the conflict.

Many of the officials who spoke with CNN stressed that it is hard to predict exactly how long the war could go on, but several officials said that there are no indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ultimate goals have changed, and it is unlikely he will pursue diplomatic negotiations unless faced with military defeat.

The thinking that this could be a long-term conflict represents a marked shift from the early days of the war, when Russia was expected to quickly take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, and underscores Moscow's failures on the battlefield.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday that the fighting will go on ""for months or even longer,"" while two other European officials said they believe fighting in eastern Ukraine could last for four to six months and then result in a stalemate.",False,1650020882.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

He recently told BBC that if Western countries implemented a ""real embargo"" on oil and gas exports from Russia, Russian operations in Ukraine would probably be stopped ""within a month or two.""

""I think it is a very important nonmilitary instrument to influence decision-making process in Kremlin,"" Illarionov told CNN's Brianna Keilar. ""The reason is very simple. Right now, the direct revenues from export of oil and gas from Russia [is] considered around 40% of all budget revenues in Russia. It will take into account direct and indirect revenues. Altogether it will be probably close to 60% of all revenue for the federal budget.""

Illarionov went on to explain the conditions needed to create enough economic pressure to halt Russia's operations in Ukraine.

""Assuming that these revenues would be reduced substantially as a result of implementation of full embargo for energy export from Russia, we understand it cannot be absolutely full because we have China, maybe some other smaller consumers; nevertheless, it would affect the main bulk of importers of energy from Russia,"" he said.

""And assuming that Russia at this moment does not have access to [the] credit market because of sanctions, and assuming that foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Russia are frozen, the Russian government, Putin's government, does not have resources to finance spending,"" he continued.

Illarionov noted that all these spendings would be forced to be ""reduced by 40% to 50%,"" a figure that was not even seen back in the 1990s. 

""That is why the regime will be in the position that it would need to stop operations, to look for some armistice and to see some negotiations with Ukraine,"" he continued.",False,1650036121.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

The fifty-first era of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began.
The full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against our State continues.

The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb strikes on the infrastructure of settlements in Ukraine.
In the Volyn and Polissya directions, separate units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus perform tasks to cover the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.

The situation in the Seversky and Slobozhansky directions is unchanged.

In the South Bug area, the enemy is trying to carry out fortification equipment positions, replenish stocks of weapons and military equipment, ammunition and fuel and lubricants. Conducts reconnaissance with the involvement of unmanned aerial vehicles.

In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the enemy's main efforts were focused on attempts to capture the settlements of Popasna and Rubizhne. It is not successful.
Thus, in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, eight enemy attacks were repulsed in the past 24 hours, four tanks, six armored personnel carriers, four infantry fighting vehicles, and one enemy artillery system were destroyed.

When asked about the impact of the diplomatic cable from Russia warning the United States not to continue arming Ukraine, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that “nothing will dissuade” President Joe Biden's administration from continuing to support Ukraine.

“The Russians have said some things privately, they have said some things publicly; nothing will dissuade us from the strategy that we've embarked on,” Price told CNN's Kate Bolduan.

Price said he is “not in a position to confirm any private diplomatic correspondence.”

But he added: “If the allegation from the Kremlin is that the US and our partners around the world are providing billions of dollars worth of security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, precisely what our Ukrainian partners have requested, and that our Ukrainian partners are using that very security assistance to extraordinary effects to repel this Russian aggression, well, then we're guilty as charged.”

CNN reported earlier Friday that the first flight from the US of the $800 million in new aid for Ukraine – which Biden announced this week — is expected to arrive in the region in the next 24 hours, according to a senior defense official. 

The Kremlin “shouldn’t be surprised” by US support for Ukraine, given the commitments the Biden administration made to supporting Ukraine even before Russia’s invasion began, Price added.",False,1650042603.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,51,0,51,0,0,
bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,u3x4df,i4s4n6c,"I have a humble proposal as to how the sinking of The Moscow could be remembered.

History will remember this war.

It will be seen as the final desperate attempt of a dying USSR to claw back into itself the land and people who once made it great.

Russia is a lesson to the world. Corruption has degraded it into an economic and cultural corpse. The unbridled success and power of the oligarchs has divided the population into extremes of haves and have nots. Russia is divided neatly into the super rich who have no incentive to change, and the poor, who can’t afford to do anything. The powerful are unchallenged in their quest to increase their wealth, and the poor have literally no way forward. Consequently, nobody in Russia has both the motivation to seek change and power to drive it. Across the society there is no improvement, there is no discussion, there is just propaganda leading to denial and inaction. 

The lack of innovation has left Russia without industry. So much so, it can’t even make its own weapons independently, let alone develop new ones. Russia will never be able to build another ship like The Moscow. The army is unable to adopt modern military structures and tactics. Instead, there are just hollow words about modernisation and bright shiny parades.

At the behest of the powerful, other than the spread of graft and corruption, Russia’s culture has stagnated. TV shows only one ‘truth’. Leaders do not have to defend their decisions. With absolute power, Putin is not accountable and so can easily deny truth. There is no capacity for learning. There is instead just a monologue that has slowly, and inexorably, moved away from reality as it is only dictated by what the powerful want to believe. Propaganda has replaced culture.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has shown why it was the engine room of the old USSR. Over the last 10 years it has quickly developed into an independent, strong and rich country.

It has moved on culturally from the influence of Russias autocrats and gangsters. A free press has enabled public discussion. It has moved on from autocracy and institutional crime. Consequently, it has rapidly re-invented its own unique culture and identity.

A population with the means and motivation to innovate has driven its industry. It exports an increasingly diverse range of goods. Ukraine has already developed its own modern weapons, like the Neptune missiles. The warship Moscow was built in Ukraine, it will build many more.

It has moved on from being simply a farm and a labour source for Russia. Ukraine has benefited enormously from no longer having to support 100+ million Russian peasants. It’s motivated and increasingly educated population now supports itself and funds the country’s development and contributes to its cultural and scientific growth.

Left alone, Ukraine is set to surpass Russia in every way.

Russia, living in the past, can never accept Ukraine’s example if how a Slavic country can be. To do so will shine an unforgiving light on itself. The oligarchs will be forced to recognise their riches are holding their own society back. Putin would have to admit his absolute power is illegitimate and is stifling change. The poor will realise there can be a way out of poverty with a different system.

Russia’s is willing to take Ukraine at any cost. Russias poor are to brainwashed and powerless to resist.

For the last 20 years, Russia has been slowly turning into a third world country, and it knows it. Russias system is unsustainable. It takes and produces nothing.

If Russia wins this war, all that will be achieved is a delay of the inevitable. Instead of cannibalising itself, Russia will be able to feast on Ukraine for awhile. Putin will stay in power, the oligarchs will get richer and there will be 40 million more people living in poverty. Until eventually, the larger Russia is again about to collapse from cultural stagnation and corruption and, yet again, it needs to find more resources.

If it can survive this war, Ukraine, and indeed the whole of Europe, has a great future ahead of it. Russia will have to face hard truths. Ukraine will join Europe as a peer.

I humbly propose that when Ukraine builds it’s next cruiser like the Moscow, they name it “Go Fuck Yourself”.

And when people see warship “Go Fuck Yourself” mothers and fathers will explain to their children why no one, ever, for any reason, should have absolute power.

and no one, for any reason, should be left powerless.

Democracy is fragile. It should be cherished if you have it. It has to be fought for if you don’t.

The official said the material will be picked up at the border by Ukrainians and taken into the country.

US President Joe Biden's administration announced the new package on Wednesday, which included 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had initially been earmarked for Afghanistan, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones, in addition to radar systems capable of tracking incoming fire and pinpointing its origin.

1. The Russian MOD spokesperson(the bald guy with glasses) makes an announcement and claims that Russia destroyed some unrealistic number of of Ukrainean targets. Then mainstream Russian media outlets like tass or rt republish his stuff.  Last night TASS published a statement of the guy claiming Russia so far has destroyed about 2200 Ukrainean tanks and almost 500 Ukrainean drones. Completely unrealistic.
2. Russian trolls on social media in Russia post more pictures and videos on Mariupol and some interviews with prisoners there(as if the Russian army capturing one city is some big achievement). Usually the prisoners are taken to some children's memorial in Donbas and they lie that Ukraineans killed kids there.
3. On western social Russian trolls come and start spreading ww3 and nuclear panic. Their comments are usually a variation of ""Ukraine hit a big target last night do you think Russia will launch nukes?"" or ""What are chances of Russia launching a nuke o Ukraine?"" or ""Ukraine doesn't need more weapons from the west. It got enough already. More weapons means a higher chance of ww3"".

>*To date, Ukraine has conducted a successful defense in depth along the breath of Russia’s original invasion axes. It was an operational approach that maximized Ukraine’s strength’s while positioning Russian forces to expose their weaknesses.
A key component of Ukraine’s defense in depth was revealing Russia’s principal operational shortcoming, logistics. Ukraine understood how vulnerable Russian logistics were, trading space for time outpaced Russia’s organic ability to support sustained ops & obtain rapid results.
Ukraine now faces a similar dilemma. How well the Ukrainian military can transition from an active defense in depth to a more offensive focus to defeat and drive out Russian forces from Ukrainian territory will mean the difference between victory and a renewed frozen conflict.
I have previously stated that the decisive point of a battlefield is determined by the character of geographic positions, the value of the strategic object in view, and the arrangement of the contending forces.
Bearing these in mind we can surmise what seems most important for Ukraine to focus the weight of offensive action to achieve its war aims. Ukraine must now answer the same three questions Russian forces have faced in devising their operational plans.*

Some definitions:

*Captain 1st rank is a rank used by the Russian Navy and a number of former communist states. The rank is the most senior rank in the staff officers' career group. The rank is equivalent to colonel in armies and air forces. Within NATO forces, the rank is rated as OF-5 and is equivalent to captain in English-speaking navies.*

*A flagship is (among other things; i.e., it's also a ceremonial designation in the US Navy):*

* *a vessel used by the commanding officer of a group of naval ships, characteristically a flag officer entitled by custom to fly a distinguishing flag*

* *Used more loosely, it is the lead ship in a fleet of vessels, typically the first, largest, fastest, most heavily armed, or best known.*

I think the second term applies here. I'm not sure if Anton there was a flag officer, or if there was another one on the ship, or if he's outranked by another officer on the ship that would make them the captain. With  command and control systems on the Moskva I imagine it wasn't only used as an AA bubble for the whole Black Sea fleet, but land masses such as Crimea as well. It probably would have made sense to have someone with coordinating authority on board the ship. Just saying I'm not sure (if possible) he was the highest ranking official on the ship.

>He “died during an explosion and fire on board the former flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation,” said Anton Gerashenko, advisor to the Kyiv interior ministry.

This war is about exactly two things:

1) the oil and gas fields in the black sea. That is why Crimea was important, as it took away Ukrainian sovereignty about a part of these resources. That is why they wanted to take the whole coastline in the west between Odessa and Crimea (and failed miserably).
While Putin knows that he will not be able to develop these fields due to ongoing disputes, that's not what he was aiming for primarily. The short term objective was simply to prevent Ukraine from developing these fields. Otherwise Ukraine would have been able to replace Russia as European energy supplier No. 1.
In the long term, Russia would of course want to exploit the fields themselves. They may have a lot of gas fields still within Russia, but many of them are difficult and expensive to develop, which poses a huge problem to the Russians.

2) Putin cannot allow a liberal democracy to prosper on his doorstep. Sure, Ukraine still had a long way to go in terms of democratization (e.g. reduce corruption), but they would inevitably have gone this way. This would have led to the Ukrainian public being able to live in relative prosperity. But this would have been dangerous for Putin. Ukraine was part of the heartland of the USSR. After the fall of the Soviet empire, Ukraine had a much more difficult starting conditions than Russia. Still, after the euromaidan and westward orientation, Ukraine was well on its way to overtake Russia in all relevant aspects of economy and civilian life. At some point, even the dumbest and most uninformed Russian would have noticed the stark contrast between their standard of living and the Ukrainian one (especially due to the close relationship between the two nations). And more importantly, Russians would at some point notice the stark contrast between their poverty and the wealth of the Kremlin ruling class. Not even Russian propaganda would then be able to protect Putin and his allies in the midterm. Putin was scared of the democratization of Russia.

Those are the reasons he attacked Ukraine.

Of the big town they called Istanbul
The Black sea, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of April turn gloomy

With a load of missiles many thousand tons more
Than the cruiser Moskva weighed empty
That old ship and true was a bone to be screwed
When the missiles of April came early

The ship was the pride of the Russian side
Running predictable patterns over and over
As the big warships go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and drunk captain well sloshed
Concluding some terms with Ukranian troops
When they wandered off into the darkness
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be a Bayraktar TB2 they'd been hearing'?

The sound from the drone made a tattle-tale sound
And a sailor threw up over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of Ukraine come stealin'

The drone circled around and distracted the crew
When the missiles of Ukraine came slashin'
When the radar was facing the completely wrong way
The missiles approached over water

When shooting at the drone the gunner cried out
""Fellas, it's too hard to hit it!""
At eleven PM, the first missile came in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And no way were they hit by a missile
And later that night when his ammo blew up
Came the wreck of the Cruiser Moskva

Does any one know where the love of Putin goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Sevastopol
If they'd remembered to turn their damn pumps on
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They certainly were not hit by a missile
And all that remains of the flagship of the fleet
Is the lies and the wreck under water

The Black Sea rolls, Ukraine sings
That the cruiser that attacked them is no more
Old Putin steams like a old man pissed off
The islands and bays are now safer
And farther below the black sea fleet
Runs as fast as they can from the missiles
And the iron boats go as the Russians all know
With the Missiles of April remembered

In a musty old hall in Moscow they prayed
In Putins hidden underground bunker
The old man complained and he executed 29 men

Lugansk group will attempt push through Izyum (south of the town and Kremenetz hills are still under firm ZSU control) and through Oskil in the direction of Barvinkove to Stepanivka, with a possible fixing action at Lyman and Svyatohirsk. Donetsk group will attempt pushing from Donetsk and Volnovakha through Maryinka and Vuhledar in the direction of Pokrovsk. The final goal is to meet around Dobropillya. Northern pincer will be the strongest due to various operational and logistical factors preventing reinforcement of the south pincer. Also due to the fact that the army group South is so overextended. They have a directive to fully neutralize Mariupol by the end of this week (which they won't achieve, though they might ""declare"" so anyway), and they would try their best to somehow hold bridge at Dnipro right bank. And still they have orders to somehow push to the north. Well we'll see how it goes. It is gonna be fun for sure.*  
  
*Another important part of this operation is a meat ram of 1,2 Army Corps (the so-called L/DPR). Of all casualties you see circulating in the media, none of them include L/DPR troops. And I don't think anybody could count them anyway. You can't imagine what's going on at line of contact in JFO right now. Now, granted I am not there either, but what I know from my colleagues there, it is as apocalyptic as it gets. The fields are filled with piles of corpses and smoldering armor husks, which can only be compared to Rzhev 43. My own preliminary conservative estimate for L/DPR losses (which includes Mariupol) is approximately 30,000 KIA\\MIA. Probably way higher. Nobody will ever know for sure I think, we will dig up what's left of them for generations to come. The reason is that L/DPR basically conscripted the majority (just before Feb 24 it was at least 100k men) and now pretty much entire male population, gave them some arms and threw them into prepared EAs and kill zones. The human waves, especially in the first two weeks, were fucking relentless, 24\\7 waves after waves. No preservation instinct whatsoever. And more to come. One thing for certain, at the end of this war there will be almost nobody left alive in Donbass. Talk about ""russians helping donbass"", lmao. Oh well.*  
  
*The vast majority of the kills are made by artillery. That includes armor. There are a lot of videos on Combat Footage, but honestly you don't see a fraction of it. All in all, if at Sumy-Chernihiv local territorials and farmers have plenty of opportunities to take selfies with their trophies\\kills, very little of this is happening in areas where the Army operates, for obvious reasons. All in all, what Oryx and others have access to is maybe 20-40% (depending on the theater) of the story.*",False,1650036815.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

From CNN's Kevin Liptak 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a request to US President Joe Biden in one of their recent phone conversations to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Zelensky's ask didn't come with the same level of urgency with which he's requested Western leaders provide additional arms and financial assistance, the person said, but he did make it as part of an effort to scale up international condemnation of Russia.

Biden did not offer a firm commitment to Zelensky's request, which was first reported by the Washington Post.

US officials have previously declined to rule out adding Russia to the list of state sponsors of terror, which right now includes North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Iran.

“I don’t have any assessment of that at this point in time. Obviously, we’re continuing to look at the actions on the ground and the actions of leaders,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the White House last month.

Adding Russia would be a dramatic move that would escalate economic sanctions and have secondary effects on countries still doing business with Moscow.",False,1650052042.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

However, Putin also acknowledged there were ""issues with payments for Russian export energy supplies"", as banks from “unfriendly countries” had been “delaying the transfer of funds”.""

TL;DR as quoted from the video itself (i copied directly from the transcript)

>\- i have an open question over how willing the west is to ramp up its support if it is willing to ramp its support up sufficiently it's probably going to win because if the answer is the west is willing to absorb at least a little bit of pain its ability to inflict pain on russia is completely asymmetric. for every hit the west takes probably has the capacity to deal 4 5 6 7 10 to russia in return so really this is a question of western will

Habeck clearly stated that Germany should send more weapons in the interview. He wanted to send weapons early last year, but was called back by his own party. 

Furthermore, no other country has sent tanks. Not Poland, not the US (EDIT: untrue, at least chechia has sent tanks, Poland maybe. But no western tanks have been sent). Probably because they don't want inexperienced crews rushed to the front to be killed (training on western tanks takes time) and the russians too have anti tank missiles and drones. Like military experts said, the age of the tank is over.

In related news, I do get why everyone is angry at the continued gas supply to germany. But Germany again is not the only country importing. For example

Italy is in extreme dept and too is highly dependent on Russian gas. An immediate stop could very well mean game over for their economy. Remember the euro crisis where Germany kept Greece alive with hundreds of billions of euros in guarantees?That's not possible with Italy. And if Italy goes bankrupt, the whole European economy and the european process goes bye bye.

What I want to say is that it's not only greed that motivates Germany. As a leading nation ( that saved the European project during the euro crisis and is the biggest contributor to the European budget), our leadership is concerned.

>Notably, Habeck mentioned concerns among NATO allies that deliveries of **modern tanks from Western producers** could prompt Russia to extend its war to Western countries.

This is not just his personal decision, this is the NATO position - have you noticed that the only tanks that have been delivered so far are Soviet-made?

>He added: “NATO will constantly reevaluate the situation, the course of the war will change, and then it will be discussed within NATO.”

>Scholz has been hesitant to send heavy weapons to Ukraine, arguing Germany should first reach a common line with allies before agreeing to send tanks.

However I want to make one last comment about the politico article that had so many people riled up against habeck.

This article is sensationalist and not good journalism. They spin his words around to make extraordinary claims when he gave the interview to the Funk-media group. Here is a news article of Tagesschau, the 'German BBC'. Feel free to read with translator. 

https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/habeck-waffen-ukraine-105.html

Habeck demands more weapons and, I quote.

'Of course the increasing brutality of the war demands an increase in quantity and quality of weapon deliveries. That is something we will discuss with our European partners.'

Discussing training and supply of heavy weapons within Nato is probably important considering that it would require a military training mission and direct involvement of western soldiers could be conceived as a declaration of war of nato by russia. That's worth discussing. 

Habeck also said, and I quote.

'we stand to our duty to supply Ukraine with weapons. Simultaneously we have a responsibility to not make ourself a target. This is the framework in which we deliver everything that is possible. That framework does not include tanks or fighter jets at the moment.'

It is also important to note that many other top ranking politicians demand  we send heavy weapons, and the population does aswell. Hell, habeck probably does too, considering he was the first who demanded weapons deliveries early last year.

As you can see, the politico article is a prime example of non-neutral journalism and I'm actually quite pissed at them because they misinformed so many for clicks.",False,1650033324.0,t3_u3x4df,t3_u3x4df,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

If Russia made the announcement first originally then there’s a chance that Ukraine is just riding the propaganda wave and claimed that they hit it with Missiles.

>The horrific scenes coming out of Bucha, Irpen and other Ukrainian cities (see EDM, April 13) “not only make [Russian President Vladimir] Putin a war criminal,” Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev says, but “show ‘the quality’ of the Russian army.” The soldiers who serve in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are so undisciplined and prone to criminal actions that they will pose a serious threat to the country itself once hundreds of thousands of war veterans return home, Inozemtsev argues. The behavior of the Russian military is not that surprising in one sense, the expert writes. After all, it was sent to fight by an organized criminal group, the Putin regime; and “if one such group steals, why should the other not specialize in murders?” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>But in thinking about the future, it should be obvious, he continues, that the several tens of thousands of Russian ruling elites will simply flee if and when Russia is defeated, whereas the much larger number of angry, traumatized, and physically and psychologically damaged veterans of the Ukrainian war will not. And the latter’s presence will bleed back into broader Russian society in horrific ways. Consequently, “even if Putin meets his next birthday in The Hague or does not live that long—and the chances of both these scenarios are growing today with unimaginable speed—the rapists, murderers and marauders will be returning to society and will significantly change its nature,” Inozemtsev says. The veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya were not as dangerous for Russia society: not only were there fewer of them and they came back gradually but also social norms at that point were better and exercised a greater influence on the behavior of veterans, he continues (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>Inozemtsev notes that Russian military commanders in Ukraine are either turning a blind eye to, encouraging, or even ordering the troops under their command to commit mass murder and atrocities. And this means “that even after the departure of Putin, the country will have to deal with the criminalization of society that he sponsored over several decades.” In comparison, he asserts, “the ‘accursed’ 1990s, will appear a model of gentlemanly behavior and decency” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>A major reason for that fear is that ever more Russians are arming themselves. Even prior to February 24, 2022, when Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, some observers suggested there were as many as 25 million guns in private hands in the Russian Federation. Wars almost inevitably lead to a bleeding back into society not only of people accustomed to violence but of weapons that allow them to engage in such acts (see Monitor, July 21, 1995 and August 22, 1995). And in response to that threat, ever more Russians have been buying up guns and ammunition since February, fearful that international sanctions will limit their access to such defenses or raise prices enough to put weapons out of their reach, even if returning veterans-turned-criminals wield them freely (RBC, March 23).

>The Russian government is now mulling new and more restrictive laws on gun control.

 >The Phalanx CIWS (pronounced ""sea-wiz"") is a close-in weapon system for defense against incoming threats such as small boats, surface torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. It was designed and manufactured by the General Dynamics Corporation, Pomona Division, later a part of Raytheon. Consisting of a radar-guided 20 mm (0. 8 in) Vulcan cannon mounted on a swiveling base, the Phalanx has been used by the United States Navy and the naval forces of 15 other countries.

The world produces/consumes 100M barrels per day and Russia is 11M of that.  There isn’t just another 11M barrels per day available out there for other countries to buy.  So what will happen is the price goes up, producers will ship to countries that pay the most and Russia will sell at a discount to replace demand in countries that can’t pay as much and thus lose their supply.  Imagine the Chinese basically selling their oil for $150/barrel and replacing most of their supply with $100/barrel Russian oil.  China alone could consume all Russian production, not to mention that Russia needs oil for their own use.

It’s basically playing musical chairs with oil except consumers pay more for gas, oil companies make more money, and the poorest will bear the largest costs and it’ll cause political instability across many countries and potentially tip countries out of favor of supporting Ukraine.  It’s a delicate balance being walked here with pragmatic realities to consider.

Natural gas is a bit different because it’s a pipeline product that isn’t easily as globally swapped, so that could hurt Russia.  But again LNG can’t cover the shortfall, costs a lot more, and some countries will literally have to ration power and close businesses and stuff to compensate, which again drives instability.

So, with the Moskva out of action, the Russians can and probably will still use their frigates and missile boats to attack Ukraine, but might do so from a bit further out to sea. IMO we are also pretty much guaranteed that they will not attempt a naval landing at Odessa now. The Ukrainians might feel more emboldened to use their own boats, maybe to do something like a raid to cross the Dnieper and cut off Kherson from behind or something.

IF Russia does declare to fully mobilize they could have a theoretical force of millions.

Ukraine could also mobilize more troops and would have the defenders 1:3 advantage. They also use women as soldiers, giving them access to 50% of the population that Russia wouldn't dream of using.


Next problem for Russia: how do they supply MILLIONS of troops? Gear, guns, ammo, and 3 meals a day for the next few YEARS? Does anyone think they can do this? Especially since almost all of the factory workers and farmers JUST GOT CONSCRIPTED. Are the babushkas gonna work the field?


And then this: the smart thing to do would be to mobilize millions of troops, train them up for 3 months, and then roll them in as an large, trained force. But Russia will never, ever, EVER do this. The last thing Putin would ever want would be a trained, armed force several million strong inside Russian borders. All it would take would be 1 charismatic general deciding he would rather be a billionaire than a sunflower and the next thing you know he's the new President of Russia.

https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Russland-Ukraine-Krieg-Habeck-ist-fuer-mehr-Waffenlieferungen,russlandkrise100.html

Would be nice to get a source of the quote of OP. If there are discrepancies in reporting, better find out who's distorting the truth. I for one don't like being lied to.

EDIT: The source of the original quote (thanks to u/A_Mouse_In_Da_House):

https://www.politico.eu/article/berlin-bickers-over-tanks-for-ukraine-amid-warnings-that-west-could-become-target/

EDIT2: So, what appears to be happening is reporting on things in motion. Politico took deliberations of Habeck on a local rally, while the German news took an official interview of the same day.

My takeaway from that would be the following:
1) Germany under the current government is likely not acting independently of the alliances it's in. What some my call initiative or leadership is rejected by Germany in favour of a unified front. How working on that is going in the back channels and whether Germany shows any initiative there remains to be seen.
2) Lighter weapons will continue to be delivered. Heavy weapon shipments are far from off the table as internal and external pressure rises, but from the bits of information the last days it has to be a sustainable offer (Rheinmetall's was deemed unsustainable due to lack of spare parts, making maintenance of Leopard I's difficult).
3) Ukraine's demands for a fast shipment of heavy weapons will remain at odds with the preferred deliberate (and therefore slower) German decision process.",1650009719.0,1650005376.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4swdx6,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think part of the bashing is targeting this point. In democratic society, the actions of past governments are at least partially the responsibility of the people.

It's not like concerns about energy security weren't raised in the past regarding sourcing from Russia; Russian territorial aggression has shown itself repeatedly over the past few decades. Sure, LNG terminals weren't needed _then_, but shouldn't Germany have thought about starting investment in them after 2014? Shouldn't it have considered whether NS2 was really the right path forward?

Those past risks and miscalculations are just manifesting as real liabilities now.

To put it a different way: the shift is not just about Germany's current leaders changing trajectory to better deal with the crisis. It's also about Germany choosing better leaders to deal with the crisis.",1650013819.0,1650013127.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4t6ys6,,1,15,0,15,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Look at the fighter jets.

Then Slovakia adamantly denied they were sending their S-300 for several weeks, then after it was delivered, announced they had shipped it after a quiet agreement with Germany and the US to deploy PATRIOT batteries until Slovakia can acquire either PATRIOT or Iron Dome batteries.

There is a debate internally over sending modern weapon systems due to training requirements for Ukrainian troops, so the new weapons will be of limited use. But people have generally overlooked Australia sending Bushmaster MRAP’s, and the US sending M113 armored personnel carriers, 155 mm howitzers, counterbattery drones and radars, and armored Humvees. This comes out literally right before reports of Germany deciding not to supply Leopard tanks. I think this is honestly strategy by the West to try and draw Russia’s attention away.

This is definitely true - and what makes things even worse is the fact that *they were warned* numerous times in advance, by several other countries. The German governments refused to listen, and are now in a mess of their own making.

Transitioning away from the self-imposed reliance on Russian natural gas will be difficult, and cannot be achieved quickly. That is all true. But banning Russian oil is much more realistic, and will hurt the Kremlin more. Germany should absolutely do that ASAP.

Like I would frame the Trump foreign policy doctrine to the extent it exists as having these rules 

1. The world is transactional. Be it transactions that benefit Trump and his family directly, or transactions that benefit the US directly (in that order of importance).
2. Because the world is transactional stuff like ideology doesnt matter - dictators are just as good as presidents as partners, maybe more so, since they are also likely to be transactional.
3. One caveat is that Trump respects visible shows of strength and dislikes looking weak. So he will suck up to strongmen (Putin/Xi) and can be baited into reacting to perception that the US/Trump are weak (Iran bombing US facilities in Iraq, North Korea launching missles).

So how that plays out in Ukraine is complex. Trump was, like all presidents, at least somewhat aware of public opinion. And since he has no core values, he will switch his opinions around if need be. The American public is anti-Russia and pro-Ukraine, so I htink he would have come around to being pro-Ukraine, at least somewhat. He also is generally anti-war because the American public is, so like Biden he would be very reluctant to get directly involved.  


Trump doesnt like NATO because he thinks that the US is a sucker for defending all these other countries on our own dime. And he likes Putin because Putin is outwardly strong - he has much more control of Russia than any American president has over Americans.   


But Russia just rolling into Ukraine would make Trump look weak - since even he can see that there is a great power battle going on there. So he doesn't MIND giving Ukraine weapons (even better would be to sell them the weapons), but he wants something in exchange (dirt on Biden at one point, probably oil and gas concessions in the future).  


So I dont think he would be leading the charge like Biden. But I dont think he would be at the China level either. He would be more like Germany or France than say Poland.

But the attack started later to avoid throwing shade on Chinas Olympic games, and if it was done later in warmer months there is less reliance, and by next winter people might have recovered somewhat, and some of the factors causing such high electricity prices may have been dampened or mitigated. Basically he had to strike while both crisis's were still relevant.

The fact that the invasion has gone much worse and far slower than intended also means the world has had time to marinate more in the misery and give people more time to react and coordinate a response

It also seems Putin underestimated how pissed off the general public would get, where not implementing severe sanctions would make politicians unpopular, which has probably allowed them to go as far as they have.

Put it another way:  think of communism as having its own liberal and conservative wings.  Accusing all socialist politics, which you are, ignores nearly a century of the left-opposition to Stalin and its descendents.

That's the whole, 'many more people are dying in Ethiopia right now' and so on.  Eritreans of course are supported by the Putin administration so that's a possible tie here, too.

Overall it seems the consensus is that almost evryone is pro heavy weaponry. Questions is what weapons and how many (cause our army isnt exactly sitting on huge stockpiles of most things either). Just sending a bunch of leopards and marders wont do much short term since no one in ukraine is trained for using those vehicles.

Another issue is our convoluted processes  when it comes to this. You basicly have to talk to 3 different groups of people to get a go.

I just hope that they get their shit together and just sit down with the ukrainians and make a plan.

We did just not killed them, we systemic destroyed humans. Knowing this what our grandparents did. Well we still live with traumas and guilt and obligations. Thats what mostly the public opinion is. Than we have those arms dealers which deal arms like everywhere and dont give a fuck. The public is realy ""blind"" for this and dont want to know this part of Germany. Those german arms dealers are cuite big lord of wars.

So what did the germans try? And always get now blamed for? We tried to bind russia with trade close to us to prevent war. If you look up in history, the biggest peace maker is and always will be trade. You know there is a lot of blame for Nordstream 2 and I can only laugh about this blame. Of course US dont want this, because they want to sell us their Gas etc. They said Russia will make us blackmailable. Yes theire right but once it started we also would blackmail Russia. This pipeline would be 2 sided sword and of course Ukraine and Poland would get no transit fees that why they pissed of and also so no please no please bla bla stuff. What I want to say is this is realy complicated geo political stuff and curroption, who is who bitch etc. I am so fucking pissed off from all this armchair geopolitcians here in reddit who dont know shit, pretending always that all other countries are sheeps will germany is a wolf and still trade with russia LOL. Just a tiny example pre war. Poland was moving more and more away from democracy to autocracy. Hard conversativ, make stupid laws to fuck the laws and EU etc etc. Now that this Psychopath in Russia started a full scale invasion in Ukraine everyone was shocked and noone expected this. And this huge bubble in Ukraine is complete unpredictable. Can Ukraine push Russia back, Yes? No? How long will this war go on? 48 hours coup? 1 years? Who knows? So germans was very careful in everything. Maybe a big to much careful? Yes? No? Afterwards is always easy to say ""X"" was on the wrong side// ""X"" is to slow etc.

So now you wonder why I write all this? This Ukraine Diplomat is so fucking impolite, ignorant and uncivil. There were several situations where he was realy rude. I remember a live show situatuon: where a former high major general was discussing and analysing movements by the russians: Those helicopters which flying right after start of the war and capturing hostomel. The general said he was confused why the Ukraine allow Russia to do movements like this and if Ukraine would not respond quickly he cant give Ukraine a big chance to survive this war. This so called ""Diplomat"" Melenyk was furious and insulted that former german general that he should like shut his mouth and fuck off.And I was like? WTF Kick this shit guy out here quickly. You know in every other country this guys would be asap kicked out but we germans are quite to pussy to do this.

Now to the heavy weapon question: which should we send there? Its not that simple to just deliver 30 Leopard 2, 30 Panzerhaubitze 2000, 30 Gepard Flakpanzer, 50 Marder Panzer and I can go on and on through the arsenal of german army. You need to train the crew to operate them properly. Of course it would be a huge demoral boost for the russians to see that the enemy just got high tech modern main battle tanks which crush them but to be realistic, I dont think that many Ukraine soldiers are capable of understanding the german language which is needed to operate those tanks since everything is in german for this tanks and it wouldnt help them to give them just translated manuals in german to ukraine language and say: Hey Ukraine, here are those tanks and here are 20.000 manuals. Just sign here and there and... well good luck now, and see ya

The article speaks of concerns of retaliation when modern Western tanks are sent. In comparison to cold war era equipment - which is only somewhat logically coherent, but not the point here.

The point being is that the eastern European countries could send heavy equipment because Ukraine could immediately use it and could maintain it. The same is not true for anything Western European countries can send.

In the short run it's the best way to reimburse losses of equipment from Eastern European countries with newer equipment from the more Western ones. This already appears to be happening (German patriots in Slovakia in exchange for the S-300s)

In the meantime there has to be found a limited number of equipment of more modern origin that is readily available or can be made so that can be provided to Ukraine do not to kneecap their logistics.

Let me list a few reasons as to why most analysts worth a damn haven't been running around flailing their arms about the upcoming offensive:

1. It's the wet and muddy season in Ukraine. It's so much of a thing it has it's own name. Rasputitsa. During this time, travel is by roads or rail, the ground becomes mud. Off-road it doesn't matter mech, wheeled, nothing moves over that ground unless it knows the back-alley local routes. This significantly reduces Russia's materiel advantage

2. Supplies and logistics issues. While Russia has done better in the South, they still exist. Concentrate more forces in one place and you strain already strained supply lines further. Supply lines always have choke points, what happens when you double traffic through any sort of choke point? Exactly, it jams.

3. Beaten and battered troops. The Northern troops pouring in haven't gone through a proper refit-to-fight process after being mauled. This means replacing equipment, giving it a service, replacing lost manpower, training them up on your units TTPs, etc. These troops in some cases have lost upto 40-50% of their people and/or equipment.

4. More and more equipment and supplies keeps flowing to Ukraine. Ukraine doesn't have an endless supply but the equipment they're getting is starting to be more significant than ATGMs and SAMs.

5. Ukraine knows how to run a defence-in-depth, which has been Russia's Achilles heel.

6. Russia's Air Power has degraded and will continue to. With more and more better and better SAM. Fun fact about smaller areas, they're easier to defend with fewer weapon systems, a more sparse conflict actually favours Air Power, not the inverse. Air Power is about being anywhere at short notice. Russia's 'smart' munitions, the ones they needed to prioritise taking out AA systems with; they're pretty much depleted.

There are far more elements than this but do not mistake a big fight to Russia being any more able to win than they did last round.

Ukraine is likely waiting for Russia to do dumb shit again, punish them for it and then exploit the mistake.

So please, don't stress and don't buy into the hyperbole, I know most of the media keeps blowing up everything and fearmongering but it's just shit for the most part.

The same 'experts' telling folks Ukraine would fall in 3 days, then at any moment now Russia would actually begin its true offensive, then it was a decoy; Russia still has a lot of strength... Those 'experts' are still wrong.",1650002231.0,1649999663.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4somv4,,1,63,0,63,0,0,

I don't even think land vehicles currently exist that are designed to move ships that size across land.

Even after Putin's actions in South Ossetia started the process of destroying the gains he had made early in his rule, their economy was still much bigger than Ukraine (in both a total sense and a per-capita sense).  As far as I can see, the reason is probably mostly down to natural resources.  The Russian economy has been MASSIVELY dominated by natural resource extraction for a long time (mostly fossil fuels).  Their massive size advantage over Ukraine has probably served to amplify this.  

Up until recently, I hadn't heard about Ukraine having anything near the same resources. What I've heard about recently are, apparently, newly discovered resources in the Black Sea which are yet to be tapped.  Beyond that, I'm under the impression that much of their economy is dominated by less profitable (but very important to the world as a whole) grain production.  

Lastly, as an added hindrance to their economic development, pre-Maidan protests Ukraine was firmly limited to mostly trading with Russia's stunted economy by rampant Russian interference in their politics.",False,1650004488.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4svk9h,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Putin isn't being pushed into a corner. You can see in the headlines every day how anxious the leaders of NATO countries are to ensure the war in Ukraine does not escalate into WW3, despite what ""A LOT of people"" are saying - armchair generals are gonna armchair. Instead Putin put himself and Russia into a corner by starting an unprovoked war of aggression against a neighboring sovereign country. I agree that Russia seems insistent on backing itself further and further into a corner, and that behavior is ominous. How can Ukraine and the West build a bridge to retreat for the Russians when they seem totally unwilling to acknowledge that their strategy has failed so far? [War on the Rocks has a great article about this subject.](https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/putins-folly-a-case-study-of-an-inept-strategist/)

I had bought into the general ""expert opinion"" earlier this year that Russia's buildup of troops was a negotiating tactic to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO or the EU. I was wrong, obviously, as the invasion has demonstrated. If Putin isn't the stone-cold rational dictator that the West seemed to largely view him as before the Ukraine war, how do you build the bridge to retreat?

Usually through veiled threats, then real threats. then actual war but when even war doesn't work as a bargaining chip, his last resort are the nukes. And that's where they are now, mentally. Losing Moskva means another loss of respect and the fear that noone fears Russia.

If you want to understand Putin, I like to quote the author Hjalmar Söderberg. ""People want to be loved; failing that admired; failing that feared; failing that hated and despised. They want to evoke some sort of sentiment. The soul shudders before oblivion and seeks connection at any price.""

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,u3x4df,i4uxmo0,"Well, there's a difference between what Ukraine would want and what they ""need"", and a third category of what they will actually get.

What they *want* is up to date NATO air forces like F16s, F35s, NATO tanks like Leopards and Abrams, and long-endurance drones like reapers.

Most of those forces are unlikely to impossible. It is possible that Ukraine will get some reaper drones later on, but NATO aircraft and tanks are out. Takes too long to train pilots and crews on them, and they're considered too escalatory. Sadly, this will mean that Ukraine's ability to engage in a true, massive offensive with airpower and state of the art armor is moot.

More realistically, what Ukraine needs (and hopefully will get some decent quantities of) are large artillery weapons like the howitzers, some additional Migs for its dwindling airforce to keep the enemy forces on their toes whenever they try to maneuver, replacement Soviet tanks so they can advance more safely against Russian lines with armor, and lots of heavy Soviet AA like the S300s. These weapons allow Ukraine to move up safely without getting bombed by Russian air power, and the arty is helpful for softening up Russian positions that Ukraine wants to take in limited counter-attacks.

America is also giving some helpful NATO weapons that are not weapons in a conventional sense: heavy duty radar that helps detect enemy planes, missiles and artillery incoming fire ahead of time faster and more accurately. Ukraine has apparently had a big advantage with radar detection and radar-jamming throughout this war, and the incoming American radar weaponry will help with that a lot. Russia has more artillery but appears to suffer from widespread poor intel and poor accuracy, due to lack of good drone and radar coverage. Ukraine's smaller numbers of arty systems are also apparently better able to locate Russian arty and counter-fire it before the Russian arty can escape.

More generally, there's another group of things Ukraine needs badly: Small, shoulder-mounted AA weapons like MANPADs, shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons like Javelins, Gustavs, Panzerfausts and NLAWs, and massive amounts of replacement guns, bullets, helmets and body armor.",1650045513.0,1650045323.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4uw3n8,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

SAMs: Surface-to-air missiles. the ones Ukraine wants are bigger and more effective than MANPADS and portable on vehicles. S-300 system is a big one if Ukraine can secure it from the West - Soviet-designed long-range anti-air that Ukraine already uses. These are a big deal - Ukraine needs to be able to deny air superiority to Russia.

Neptune: Ukrainian-designed anti-ship cruise missile. The Ukrainians want to supplement them with Western anti-ship missiles of various sorts. Useful, especially to deny Russia any ability to launch amphibious assault.

MiG-29: Air superiority jet fighter already operated by Ukraine, with secondary (if limited) air-to-ground interdiction capability. Ukraine wants to be able to maintain a threat against Russian jet ground attack aircraft and their pilots/ground crew know these ones already.

With ""T81"", you may be talking about the Bayraktar TB2 armed drone which they've been using effectively against Russian multiple rocket launchers, supply trucks, anti-air missile platforms, etc. Also useful for spotting targets - multi-purpose system which has already served Ukraine well.

There are also Switchblade loitering munitions - a sort of ""suicide drone"" that can fly over targets and pick moments to strike with precision while also being able to call the attack off if the target is no longer viable.

I am truly sick of all the countries that have been fully involved in many forms of aggression and civilian deaths now preaching the impotence of respecting sovereignty. 

Yes we should respect it. But it would be so nice if it were coming from people who had a history of doing so. But it is okay. It is happening. Let’s just keep this up as a people. 

As for US standing nervously, I don’t think so. I don’t think anyone wants Putin to press that button but I also think that anyone with a brain the size of a peanut would know that it isn’t happening. We are not cornering Putin to the point of leaving him with no other options. We are also not giving him free reign. This is a good balance. And trust me, it is very good for Ukraine. No doubt Ukraine would have been history a month ago otherwise. 

On the flip side, I am not sure what will happen if despite all these efforts, Russia is able to come out on top. It isn’t the first time Russia has taken huge losses only to still win in the end. It would be very very awkward if that were to happen.

The idea of a totally brainwashed population is flawed from the source; polls. You see Putin’s popularity rise, you see the percentage of “Russians” that approve or support the war and you get upset at it. But we never question it.

So here’s the thing: we outside of Russia do not support nor accept anything said by the Russian government since it’s mostly propaganda. BUT, up comes the polls (made by the government of Russia) and we accept their numbers then use them to hate on the Russian population. We end up spreading Russian propaganda for Russia.

Ask yourself this; if you live in an authoritarian regime where dissidence is horribly punished by indefinite imprisonment, torture and poison, and said regime calls you to ask for your opinion on the regime…would you be honest about your thoughts on the regime?

Most people don’t want the consequences. They just want to live their private lives.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall

> In a conference with President Truman on June 18, Marshall, taking the Battle of Luzon as the best model for Olympic, thought the Americans would suffer 31,000 casualties in the first 30 days and ultimately 20% of Japanese casualties, which he estimated would include the entire Japanese force. This implied a total of 70,000 American casualties in the battle of Kyushu using the June projection of 350,000 Japanese defenders.[105] Admiral Leahy, more impressed by the Battle of Okinawa, thought the American forces would suffer a 35% casualty rate (implying an ultimate toll of 268,000).[106] Admiral King thought that casualties in the first 30 days would fall between Luzon and Okinawa, i.e., between 31,000 and 41,000.[106] Of these estimates, only Nimitz's included losses of the forces at sea, though kamikazes had inflicted 1.78 fatalities and a similar number of wounded per kamikaze pilot in the Battle of Okinawa,[107] and troop transports off Kyūshū would have been much more exposed.

> A study done for Secretary of War Henry Stimson's staff by William Shockley estimated that invading Japan would cost 1.7–4 million American casualties, including 400,000–800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities. The key assumption was large-scale participation by civilians in the defense of Japan.[17]

>In evaluating these estimates, especially those based on projected Japanese troop strength (such as General MacArthur's), it is important to consider what was known about the state of Japanese defenses at the time, as well as the actual condition of those defenses (MacArthur's staff believed Japanese manpower on Kyushu to be roughly 300,000).[115] Nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals (awarded for combat casualties) were manufactured in anticipation of the casualties resulting from the invasion of Japan; the number exceeded that of all American military casualties of the 65 years following the end of World War II, including the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock.[116] There were so many left that combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan were able to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to soldiers wounded in the field.[116]

TL;DR; it was judged that casualties from the bomb would be less than casualties from the US invading. On both sides.

I visited the Hiroshima bomb museum. It's a documentation of the horrors but also pretty even handed. At the end it does mention the Japanese response, and how surrender wasn't very forth coming. 

There was a plan to launch captured V2 and US produced V1 ( yes, we were making our own for the Japanese Invasion ) into Japanese coastal defenses from the decks of US aircraft carriers.

7396ffbb5a3824d6040de9055b18a4b3,u3x4df,i4upftl,"Agreed. The event that arguably *actually* swayed the Japanese was the Soviets joining the war and initiating a campaign in China, after the first bomb on Hiroshima. Their heavy tanks and experience in Europe meant they were simply cutting through the Japanese forces at phenomenal rate. The Russians brought their equipment used to fight Germany in Europe: T-34s and IS-2s, Il-2 anti armour ground attack aircraft, et cetera. This was quite unlike the US who had *radically* different equipment in the Pacific, lighter and more easily transported by sea, with no need for heavy tanks because the Japanese didn't field them. Whilst the Red Army might have not been as well trained as either the US or Japan, they had heavy weaponry the Japanese struggled to counter, and combat experience on how to use it. In the air, against Soviet pilots in late war aircraft like Yak-3s with heavy cannon, the light and agile Japanese fighters were finding a very different experience from the carrier based fighters of the US. Whilst they could outmanoeuvre them, they were so outnumbered it didn't matter, and one or two hits from the cannons tore their aircraft to shreds, whilst their light machine guns struggled against the robust Soviet airframes.

c6102eaa2d2626a3fd49dcff12302f44,u3x4df,i4tu7fg,"In the case that Putin ordered a tactical or low yield nuclear strike on Kyiv, would he really be the insane one—or just a cold, sociopathic monster, but not insane?

Hear me out. I’m being serious here and I’ll explain my logical reasoning. 

First, keep in mind that Putin sees how much the US has openly acknowledged the possibility that the Russian Army could use tactical nukes if Putin started to lose and became desperate for a win in Ukraine. 

He also sees that the US is also aggressively aiding Ukraine in the very effort of making Putin lose to begin with, therefore helping raise the likelihood of the very extreme escalation the US is warning him against. I’m not saying this to condemn the US, because Ukraine is a sovereign country being invaded by a cruel dictator, and they do need a lot of help. The US and Ukraine are in an utter complete no-win position here no matter what they do. But at the same time, this is how Putin sees it, and, well, it’s just true, unfortunately. 

Second, Putin has been in power of a large country that’s had very extensive relations with the US and the West, for over 20 years now. He’s known for a very long time how much the US wants to preserve its own place as the global power and lead a unipolar world, and how much the West wants to keep the general world order together as is.

So, when Putin sees that the US is exercising their authority, pledging to do whatever they can for a just and fair world and not cause a nuclear war, and clearly trying to deter Putin from this nuclear war as well and keep world order from falling apart—yet, they are also doing things that clearly have the potential to escalate the conflict to that point, *and* refusing to stop doing those things even after he warns them about the potential for nuclear deployment, how can Putin reconcile this existential paradox on the US’ part? 

Keep in mind him pulling out Ukraine is the only morally right thing to do, but he literally will not for as long as he’s in power, no matter what. (And truthfully, he’s done pretty well to coup proof himself.)

With that said, the only real explanation that makes sense, is that the US is desperately trying to force a regime change to prevent Putin from winning, but won’t actually follow through with their threat of a retaliatory strike if their goal fails to actually materialize before tactical nukes enter the equation; this would also explain the unprecedented use of openly weaponizing declassified US intel to the media, and Biden’s frustrated cries about removing Putin from power and Putin being a war criminal committing genocide. All of which I agree with, btw. 

Now, a retaliatory strike of another tactical or a full blown conventional nuke by the US/NATO, would be the catalyst to kick off the chain of reactions leading to the end of the entire world. This means that not only would Russia ease to exist, but so would the US—whether by way of direct nuclear attacks or total societal and structural collapse from the resulting fallout. The implication is that in such a situation, Russia accepts its death sentence, but so will the US its own. 

Think on that very carefully. You either give Putin the power to use tactical nukes on non-NATO territory and hope that he doesn’t decide to target you and your silos later. Maybe he will, maybe he won’t. He probably wouldn’t though—it’s the utter antithesis of everything he’s done and totally against the operative goals of his mission thus far. It’s still possible, though. 

There’s also the fairly high likelihood that he’ll start moving onto the Baltics and threaten another tactical nuke if they don’t pull out of NATO, after he’s done with Ukraine. But it is also true that Russia simply cannot take over the entire of Europe and keep it—even if they attempted it, they literally couldn’t. At this point it’s unsustainable. At some point, Putin dies of natural causes or (less likely) a coup, and then there will be a chance things will finally get better. It’ll be miserable and lots of people will still die, but again, there’ll at least be the chance of actual change after. 

Or… you show him who’s boss, punish him and the entirety of Russia, completely and thoroughly, and ensure that he never gets to terrorize the rest of Europe ever again, by sending in your own nuclear warheads with the knowledge that it’ll very likely kick off a chain of reactions that ends in total nuclear war and death of the entire planet. 

**If** NATO nukes Russian forces or Russian territory, whether as a counter measure or not, the very debate whether Putin is legitimately willing to drop a conventional nuke as a first strike measure to begin with, ceases to matter. Just the retaliatory act itself essentially guarantees a conventional strike by Russia and the very death of the country itself by the end of the conflict. 

However, as I said, it would also mean the death of the US. Mind, there’s almost no chance Putin wouldn’t order Russia’s silos or submarines to deploy a barrage of conventional nuke strikes *immediately,* if a retaliatory strike is sent out or if he catches wind of an assassination order, in case the US or another nation tries to send in someone to stop him. 

Either way, Putin’s counter retaliatory response guarantees the US’ death as well. Total nuclear annihilation and nuclear winter, the deaths of billions, and the death of the US hegemony and everything the US worked so hard for. All leading from the counter response by the US/NATO to Russia’s initial, strictly regional use of at least one tactical nuke for strategic purposes. 

Ultimately, in reality, after making the assessment that the US has no actual intent to send a retaliatory strike after Russia for the use of tactical nukes on what’s not even NATO territory, is it really Putin who would be irrational to send in a tactical nuke or multiple tactical nukes, to neutralize Ukraine and force a surrender under the justification that it was to end all fighting and force a surrender (which is certainly true on the most clinical level)? 

**Keep in mind that this justification would be the very same one the US used for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.** Unfortunately, Putin can simply call the US a hypocrite and weaponize it, to neutralize any attempt at ostracizing Russia from the rest of the world by the West for the use of tactical strikes. It might even *help* his own standing and earn respect, which… is… disturbing, but yeah. 

Or would it be the US/NATO that is irrational, by ordering a retaliatory strike, fully knowing the end result would quite likely be nuclear winter and total death of the world order, as well as the non-consensual deaths of billions, instead of the loss of one or a few European countries and Taiwan? Consider that if the world dies, it won’t ever get the chance at having global nuclear weapon reform, and/or the liberation of multiple countries from Russia and/or China, one day. 

Again, think on that very carefully.

P.S.    
You really don’t want to bet on the chances that there are in fact people at the top in the Kremlin who will stop him from being able to send in nukes.

Indeed, Trump has been shifting his position recently, going from calling Putin a genius for invading Ukraine early on, to now agreeing with Biden in calling the war a genocide. So his cronies are telling him not to defend Putin or else he'll look bad. Not going to bother with links here, they are all over the Internet.

However, I am still convinced that his first reaction would have been to try and kneecap NATO and sabotage Ukraine. He would have praised Putin or at the very least, try the ""good people on both sides"" bullshit routine.

After that, he'd be like China, pretending to be above it all and calling for peace, while trying to undermine NATO's efforts to help Ukraine. After all, he did try to undermine NATO for four years.

The reason why I do not fully agree with you, is that I do not believe he'd have gone ""Oops! Maybe a really strong Russia is not good for me?"" and instead, he'd have said that this is an European problem, and he'd try to pull out of NATO (again) and then Ukraine would not have access to all the weapons and help that Biden is sending to Ukraine.

More importantly, the point from the CIA is that a logical conclusion of not achieving the desired military results in the Donbass for Russia may in their eyes *necessitate* the use of tactical nuclear weapons in order to force a win.

The point being that the leadership in the Kremlin views the outcome of the war as a matter of (political) survival. Hence, defeat at the hands of Ukraine could be seen as *more* problematic than the limited use of nuclear weapons. Russia's leadership has simply put itself into an ideological ""can't lose"" position but in a realistic ""may lose"" position. The question here is what will happen if those two positions intersect and clash: will ideology bend reality to it's will or will ideology give way to reality.

I would assume that scenario's of a Western response are being, or already have been, worked out in such a case. Hopefully this would involve close alignment with China and India, who likely have no interest in seeing nuclear weapons being deployed. 

One would hope that China is already signalling severe consequences to Russia in such a case, and certainly the move would lead to unified world wide condemnation, further alienating Russia. However, the question remains to be seen what NATO's response to such a situation would be. Already it's been stated that if fallout would reach NATO territories, it could be considered an act of war, but you have to wonder how high public support would be to attack a nation that just actually used nuclear weapons. NATO and the global community at large must therefore work to dissuade Russia from using such weapons by creating a credible deterrent that outweighs the advantages of using tactical nuclear weapons for Russia.

So yes, there is no evidence of the use of nuclear weapons being prepared, but the situation itself inherently lends itself to their use. It would be a gamble on Russia's part, but if the leadership sufficiently believes they have little to lose and everything to gain, it might for them be the most logical choice.",False,1650056361.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4viknb,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

It's easy cynicism to say otherwise. Most of the good the U.S. does is done quietly, overwhelmed by propaganda from foreign actors, domestic isolationists and leftists like Noam Chomsky, or simply ignored because it is boring.

In the boring category, in the 1920s the U.S. helped alleviate a massive famine in the new Soviet Union by sending food, farm equipment and agricultural experts. The Soviets responded with their characteristic grandiose statements of eternal friendship but Stalin had subsequently downplayed America's contributions and had records purged for ideological reasons. The Soviet Union (and Stalin) could not be seen as having depended on the decadent American capitalists for help.

The U.S. also averted a famine in India in the 1960s

More recently the U.S. has run the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), for twenty years. Countries that receive PEPFAR funding see declines in HIV mortality rates of around 10.5%. It's estimated that the program has saved a little over 20,000,000 lives so far, mostly in Africa.

U.S. intervention in Afghanistan also reduced childhood mortality by roughly 100,000 children per year between 2001 and 2015. The average Afghan's life expectancy increased from 42 to 62 over that period. For every year of America's intervention during that time period the average Afghan could expect to live 1.42 years longer.

My truthful opinion is that the US fully intends not to interfere if Putin only nukes Ukraine. It’s either that or the entire world dies. Billions of non-consensual deaths. The deaths of both Russia and the US. Total collapse. And for that to happen, the ball would have to be in the US’ court first.

What oligarchs don’t get - well, many of them get it but don’t care - is that their money is basically stolen from the 100 million poor Russians.

In fact, usually they ensure that most people around them don’t even speak Russian so they don’t have to worry about spies as much.

THEN they use that money to invest in property in Russia, which of course spreads the misery by blocking other people from owning their home.

After that they do the same thing overseas. They don’t just do this in the USA, they do it in every country they can.

In fact, they own enough property to seriously reduce realestate prices across the world if they ever have to sell up.

 >Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale written by English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.

Without chips from Taiwan, precision machined microparts from the EU and America etc. Ru manufacturers are in real trouble. These are not things you can replace internally overnight. The investments required to replace these items at the quality levels needed are about long term human capital and societal structuring. China started to invest in this kind of development about 8 years ago but it is still expected to be a decade before they can make any kind of qualitative match to current producers. 

In terms of your Mcdonalds point this is a massive assumption based on a mis-understanding of the financials involved.

1. You can't just roll up a big operation overnight, you still have leases, contracts and assets.

2. The example you give, Mcdonalds, produces and sources very little of its stock in country. Instead it imports its stock. When imports are embargoed or restricted the cost of bringing stock in rises. This affects the bottom line, mcDs isn't interested in taking a loss to trade in Russia. 

3. Companies that still have rubles can't take their funds out so they will hedge their bets for now and use those rubles to maintain their operations in a mothballed way until they are forced to commit to a course of action. 

4. Service industry companies aren't going to help the Russian economy much even if they do return. These are industries which rely on other parts of the economy performing healthily for a profit and the foreign ones are extractive, which is to say they take the money of the nation they are in and export it to their own country.

5. With the Ru economy facing stagflation the ability to raise credit for native Russian business (many of whom already run a high debt/asset ratio) has tanked. When a business relying on a healthy credit market finds that market drying up the walls close in pretty quickly. This means lay offs, closures and unemployment. Rising unemployment reduces the size of the market for a service industry business.

A final thought is that a notice printed and put on a door by the branch manager of a Mcdonalds in St Petersburg is probably not the most reliable source of economic forecasting.",False,1650022899.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4tgvtd,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

They could have done any number of things to Japan including fire bombing (which they already did and was more deadly than one of the nuclear weapons). Nukes were dropped as a show of force to both Japan and Russia. The war was over, new world powers were forming, and they were carving up the world. Russia was marching towards Japan (as planned at Yalta), they were poised to be an adversary to the US in the future, and they were likely to claim more territory if they fought there.

This isn't exactly the appropriate place to give Russia credit, but American tales of WW2 significantly diminish the Soviet (including Ukraine) contribution and sacrifice.

This involved sailing around six landing ships towards Odesa as if to conduct an assault. But then diverting at the last moment. These exercises tie up Ukrainian forces and act as a deception.

Moskva has been observed in both of the main documented examples of this. First [on March 15](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/03/russian-navy-landing-ships-seen-approaching-ukrainian-coast-near-odessa/) and then on March 30. There may be other unseen occasions. Here Moskva was surrounded by other warships or again, providing area protection from a position further out. It is intuitive that Moskva has played a command role in these operations.""

Obviously I was dead wrong. What happened in Syria is what ultimately woke me up to the truth and subsequent Russian actions only made it more clear.

Look at the 2022 one.

The issue is very obvious. Resources. Russia simply doesn't have the manpower to do this. They lost more military age men in WW2 than they *have* military age men today.

They also don't have the equipment. Most of their supposed ""massed reserves"" are so old they're scrap metal. Then, without tanks, IFVs, trucks, aircraft and pilots, what, they're gonna just walk infantry across Ukraine in some massive horde that Ukraine will reluctantly but relentlessly butcher?

Likewise, even on Soviet hardware anything more than a truck needs a trained operator. War is far more complex than the 1940s where most things operated on a point-and-go-boom kind of model.

It's the air power that's going to be the tipping point. Make no mistake, none of these conscripts could be pilots, unlike WW2 fighters you could learn to fly in a week enough to get airborne and shoot at stuff, modern jets are simply too complex and specialist. Even those with a natural aptitude for handling the plane (most will simply smash it into the ground at high speed, hitting god knows what, probably their own airbase) won't be able to use any of the weapons systems without months of training.

The other issue is probably the ability to supply an army that's larger than 200k.  The Russians are already using civilian vehicles as supply trucks.  I doubt there doing it because they think they will be able to hide their supply shipments easier.  The soldiers of the DNR and lnr are fitted with old equipment.  

I guess the Russian could conscript soldiers and just have them sit around until they can rotate in.  The generals will be like ""hand your weapons to the guy walking in the opposite direction"".  This is just a recipe for disaster, sending in troops with basically no training, since I doubt the Russians have gear lying around to give their soldiers a refresher training with live rounds,etc.  

Chances are they just conscripts soldiers to replace their loses.  They won't increase their army beyond 200k.  Yet with each rotation out the Russians will keep getting worse combat effective.

Perhaps it is worth reminding people that Germany continued to refuse closing Nordstream 2 *after* the invasion has started. It opposed harsher sanctions right from the beginning. It refused to send weapons when it was already obvious the Ukrainians are getting slaughtered in a war of aggression. It still refuses to accept an oil import ban. It still refuses to allow *all* Russian banks to be removed from SWIFT.

> Germany didn't want to believe that this would ever happen

That's right, it *didn't want* to believe. Germany's partners kept warning it for years about the dangers of becoming themselves reliant so much on Russia and also about feeding this monster.

> It wasn't daddy Biden who sent bald eagles over to shout at us

The US has publicly urged Germany to abandon Nordstream 2 more than once, citing exactly this reason, the danger of becoming energy reliant on an authoritarian state obsessed with expansionism and threatening its neighbors. 

> it was the shelling of civilian targets in Ukraine that changed the government's mind.

Because there aren't any carrier groups hanging around in the Black Sea? Ukraine has no navy at this point; there aren't any ships for those weapons to target because Russia destroyed them at anchor in the opening days of the war.

Thus Putin's options moving forward aren't good, for him or for us.  The West can't afford to seem weak as the history of interaction with Russia generally dictates.  Which includes capitulation, and at this point, making deals or diplomatic overtures with Russian demands.  All the West can do right now, is keep bolstering Ukrainian forces and hope they expel Russia from their territory without provoking a non-conventional response from Russia.  This may very well be an impossible task, as Russian forces continue to see greater and greater losses and setbacks, and the calls for escalation grow louder and louder.  At some point, Putin is going to have to make a decision, assuming things keep going the way they are, on whether or not to escalate the conflict, or resign himself to being replaced and disposed in disgrace.  True, Russian forces could just turtle and pour their resources into holding the line, leading to a stalemate that lasts years, but the sanctions that have been imposed, barring a change in western politics, ensure that this is a loosing option for Russia.  Who the hell knows what's going to happen.  It's entirely in Putin's ball court now.  All we can do is wait.",False,1650037961.0,t3_u3x4df,t1_i4u73t3,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

But the comment above mine said that we need to stop worrying about Putin’s nuclear arsenal and that he is not going to start ww3, and that’s something I disagree and both the director of CIA and Zelensky seem to agree that the risk still exists. Their doctrine is that nuclear weapons are to be used in the case of an existential threat to Russia, which is rather hard to interpret because we don’t know what is considered an existential threat, I believe that a good example is an incursion of NATO forces on Russian territory. For example let’s say that Putin used chemical weapons there is a chance that NATO might intervene directly if he did, if NATO intervenes directly in order to be truly effective they need to attack Russian territory, furthermore if NATO intervened Russia might move to tactical nukes, they have 2000 of those against the 200 American ones, at that point NATO can either pull back or escalate, and the situation might devolve pretty quickly.

You're talking about small arms, right? Germany's been sending those, along with shoulder launched AT weapons. Their other specialties are ships and subs, which doesn't help Ukraine.

What they could do, and what they're probably going to do next, is sending them Marder IFVs which, while pretty old, are still excellent, battle proven in Afghanistan, and presumably easier and quicker to train on than tanks.

Germany [stopped the certification](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germanys-scholz-halts-nord-stream-2-certification-2022-02-22/) of the pipeline 2 days *before* the invasion, in response to Russia asserting DPR and LPR independence.

>It refused to send weapons when it was already obvious the Ukrainians are getting slaughtered in a war of aggression.

False, it announced that it would [send weapons to Ukraine ](https://m.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-announces-paradigm-change-in-response-to-ukraine-invasion/a-60932652)as soon as the invasion started, a reversal of continuous German policy since the end of WW2. 

>That's right, it didn't want to believe. Germany's partners kept warning it for years about the dangers of becoming themselves reliant so much on Russia and also about feeding this monster.

Hindsight is always 20/20. Zelenskyy himself said in the buildup to the conflict that it's [causing undue panic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60174684) to say war is on the horizon. So it's not like Germany was uniquely mistaken in its assessment, and I say that as someone who never supported the pipeline in the first place. Imagine how deep in shit we are going to be if China decides to invade Taiwan. In that case, it's no longer gonna be everyone pointing the finger at Germany, and everyone is going to say ""The writing has been on the wall here forever, this war was inevitable, how could xyz be so dumb not to see it coming? Fuck them for not *literally nuking their economy to save face*. What a bunch of pussies.""


>The US has publicly urged Germany to abandon Nordstream 2 more than once, citing exactly this reason, the danger of becoming energy reliant on an authoritarian state obsessed with expansionism and threatening its neighbors. 

You mean like paying for energy and going to war for countries like Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia or Venezuela? In this case, they were right to do so, but primarily because the unthinkable happened and Putin decided to invade another country. Germany became reliant on his energy long before February 24. But the fact that this international trade was taking place is the reason why sanctions can be imposed that hurt. How many other foreign entanglements are just powder kegs waiting to be ignited? Germany does not have the luxury of being self-reliant in terms of energy.

1. Within 24 hours, NATO would announce a deployment of air defense operations over Ukraine skies. Russia would be given advance notice that any aircraft, ballistic or nuclear missile will be intercepted by NATO 
2. NATO would request a formal lengthy humanitarian ceasefire to allow for evacuations of civilian clusters in Fallout risk zones and to supply Ukrainian forces with proper protective equipment. They will also join Ukraine/Russia peace talks as a third party. They ""MAY"" discuss with Zelenskyy offering  a potential political offramp for Putin, where Crimea and parts of Donbass that are in Russian control be ceded to Russia in order to avoid a wider escalation. 
3. More sanctions, but this time, countries like China and India will be under increased pressure to pick a side or be treated as complicit to Russia's aggression and see similar economic penalties. There's also going to be an image component at play, as they'd be essentially siding with a Nation who's military is so incompetent, that it needs to nuke enemies on foreign soil to win. This is unprecedented, not even the U.S has resorted to this short of WWII when nuclear weapons had just begun production. I don't see it likely that Russia's remaining allies would stand beside them, they'd further isolate themselves. 
4.  If Russia refuses the ceasefire, or if peace talks fail and neither Russia or Ukraine will settle for a compromise, war will continue with the No Fly Zone present, Russia would further retaliate with Nuclear weapons, (WWIII)

MAD says if I die, you die. In fact, anyone with nuclear weapons does. That's a huge deterrent. Anyone using them signs their own death warrant too. It has to be that way.

No First Strike says I have them, but I will only use them in response to another nuclear attack, or a similarly devastating conventional attack. Most nuclear nations claim to have a No First Strike policy. Russia, notably, does not. Even North Korea for all its blustering, generally indicates that it intends to use its nuclear arsenal for self preservation. Israel, which doesn't officially acknowledge them, actually targets *itself* with many of its weapons in an insane Broken Arrow / area denial scenario. The tacit agreement here is that everyone knows a First Strike would invoke MAD. It's also heavily implied that the nuclear response *may* not be limited to just the attacked nation. The general consensus is that all nuclear nations target whoever fires first, and their own enemies. For example, if the US was to attack Russia conventionally and receive a First Strike nuclear attack, that attack would probably target China and India as well, and even if not, China and India would likely participate in a Second Strike nuclear response. Likewise, India and Pakistan would attack each other because their hand was forced to prevent the other striking it in retaliation for retaliating against Russia. Yes, it's that crazy. The nuclear club is basically that gang who all turn on the one who breaks first.

If Russia can use a tactical nuclear weapon without any other nuclear nations responding, so can Pakistan on India and vice versa. So can Israel on Palestine or even Iran. So can North Korea on South Korea. The cat would be out of the bag.

Even if support for military intervention went up to 60%, so what? That doesn’t mean we have to go to war. Anyone with a brain knows the “cowardly west” rhetoric is fucking stupid. I’m terrified of nuclear war and you should be too. 

2.) Yep, it would be an instant victory for Russia. What a tragedy. But Russia will never attack NATO. Why? Because they don’t want nuclear war either. Even a nuclear strike in Ukraine is extremely unlikely. 

3.) NATO is not contractually obligated to defend any of those countries at the moment. So they won’t take collective action. Individual states that are allied with those countries may decide to help. Putin would also probably find himself six feet under if he did that. Anyway, Russia has always been free to attack those countries. But it won’t, because the consequences of doing so on an international scale will be catastrophic. They’re barely trucking on with Ukraine. Russia would be more isolated, sanctioned and friendless than North Korea.

But Logistics is just one of those things that requires the careful book-smarts and study that only a college curriculum (or college-like curriculum) offers. Unless you wanna be a truck-driver I guess (technically part of the logistics chain but not what people normally talk about...).

I'm a computer programmer, so logistics is outside my field of expertise. But I was taught ""logistics algorithms"", such as the Simplex Algorithm. I was also taught about how business-students would use the simplex-algorithm to optimize the amount of equipment going places.

There's also maximum flow, and other such concepts. Its just math heavy and very book / nerd-like thinking. Clearly a job of a college-trained officer (even if a lowly lieutenant).

So I don't have any military training. But I have a minor amount of insight into what supply-chain business folk do.

---------

Lets say you have a remote base. The base uses 5MW of power, requiring how much fuel in the generators? How good are the roads leading to the base? How much diesel fuel shipments is that? What kind of truck delivers those? What about combat, if trucks are inevitably being shot at / destroyed, how many additional trucks do you put on the route to ensure the base gets the fuel it needs to run?

Now lets say you have a dirt road along the way, or some other bottleneck, like the river needs to be ford the river. What's the high-tide/low-tide of the river? When is it fordable? How many trucks can pass through that over the next week? What about the next month? (The river may be higher on some days, meaning some days it may be impassable). Etc. etc. 

Obviously the long term solution is to build a bridge. But where to build the bridge? What kind of bridge?

Sure, they are currently buying Russian resources but that's only half the picture. 

These countries are part of the reason why Russia is now the most sanctioned country in the history of the civilisation, you know. 

These countries are already taking in historical numbers of refugees. This has enormous cost. Just as an example, the Ukrainians kids need housing, education and possibly trauma treatment. My area is preparing to take take of 100 000 Ukrainians. 

On top of that, it's not like EU citizens aren't seeing negative impacts already. Fuel prices, heating prices, food prices and so on is still through the roof. 

Just to be clear: You and I aren't suffering as much as the Ukrainians by any stretch of the imagination. It would be stupid to understate the enormous sacrifice they are going through right now. 

... But there are EU citizens, right now, who struggle to put food on the table as a direct result of Putin's war in Ukraine. 

We really should avoid more cases like that.

It's like the American expression: Two wrongs don't make a right.

So, if you ask me, the EU and its member states certainly are doing something and they certainly are selfless to some degree.

And to top if off, they are working towards weaning off Russian resources to prevent such a situation from happening again.

Is it their own fault for ending up in a situation where they can't act any faster? Yes, it certainly is, but you can't change the past. The EU could certainly be handling this a lot worse.
