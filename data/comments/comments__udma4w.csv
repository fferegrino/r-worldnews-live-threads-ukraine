There were no cameras with them. Some of Zelensky’s closest aides only learned about the trip nearly two months later, when he brought it up during our interview.*

>*Heading north from Bankova Street, the group went to a collapsed bridge that marked the front line at the edge of the city. It was the first time Zelensky had seen the effects of the fighting up close. He marveled at the size of a crater left by an explosion in the road. When they stopped to talk to Ukrainian troops at a checkpoint, Zelensky’s bodyguards, he says, “were losing their minds.” The President had no pressing reason to be that close to the Russian positions. He says he just wanted to have a look, and to talk to the people on the front lines.*

Those poor bodyguards. There's a bunch more interesting anecdotes like that in the article.

""A few days later, Zelenskyy went to a checkpoint and met a man who cooks borscht for the troops every day. Within range of enemy snipers and artillery, they had a bowl of soup with bread, talking about the Soviet Union and what the Russians had become since its collapse. “He told me how much he hated the Russians,” he recalls. Then the cook went to his car and pulled out medals he had earned in the Soviet military. The conversation left a deep impression on the president.""

>Some highlights:

>Notable: While the Pentagon does not assess that Russia has seized control of Mariupol, the senior defense official said today that a “significant” number of Russian forces are beginning to shift from the port city to the northwest.

>The shift comes as a small number of Ukrainian forces hold out in Mariupol. The Pentagon has predicted previously that when Mariupol fell, it was likely some Russian forces would join the fight in the Donbas region.

>The forces leaving Mariupol so far have shifted northwest, in Zaporizhzhia oblast, the senior defense official said. That’s roughly south of the major city of Dnipro.

>“They’re continuing to pound Mariupol with strikes, both airstrikes and missile strikes,” the senior U.S. defense official said. “You don’t do that if you think it belongs to you.”

>As of Thursday, the Pentagon assesses that Russia has about 92 battalion tactical groups in the war. That’s up several more from last week, as Putin’s forces continue to reset units after their earlier failures and put them back in the war.

>The senior defense official said that there appears to be about 20 additional battalion tactical groups that are outside Ukraine, but nearby. Their operational status is not yet clear.

>The new numbers highlight a condensation of Russian units after they got sliced up earlier in the war. 

>There were originally more than 130 battalion tactical groups arrayed at the border. There appear to be somewhere close to 110 left.

""""To ensure employment"" - in the ""Transnistrian region"" announced a military meeting
April 28, 2022

The unrecognized ""Transnistrian Moldavian Republic"" is strengthening its army. The letter of the Ministry of Defense of Transnistria to the heads of local administrations reveals information on the drafting of citizens to the ""special meeting"". It is noted that the purpose of the meeting is to ""ensure 100% staffing of the Peacekeeping Contingent of the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic, as well as to provide employment for the working population of the republic.""

Men under the age of 55, who are guaranteed ""financial and material support, accommodation and food"", can take part in the meeting. Financial support for unemployed citizens is promised from 2,800 ""rubles of Transnistria"". The meeting itself will last 90 days.

Despite the formal voluntary participation in the meeting, there is information that the call will be coercive.

It is noteworthy that the letter is dated April 21. That is, before the beginning of the last Russian provocations on the territory of ""PMR"". This is reminiscent of the events in the so-called ""LPR / DPR"" on the eve of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

“We are in dialogue with Finland and Sweden, and it’s their decision. But if they decide to apply, Finland and Sweden will be warmly welcomed, and I expect the process to go quickly,” he told the press.

“This is fundamentally about the right of every nation in Europe to decide its own future. So when Russia tries in a way to threaten, to intimidate Finland and Sweden from not applying it just demonstrates how Russia is not respecting the basic right of every nation to choose its own path,” Stoltenberg added.

“The reality is that Finland and Sweden are already very close to NATO and we work together, we operate together, we exercise together. And as soon as we take the decision to invite them, that will send a strong political message, that the security of Finland and Sweden matters for all NATO allies,” he continued.

This is up from 86 BTGs that I read a week or two ago now.  On top of RU moving a handful of BTGs from Mariupol to other parts of the line.

Yet for the last few days, UA has been destroying about 1 BTG worth of equipment per day.  Killing and wounding about 1 BTG worth of men per day as well.  And I doubt many if any of those BTGs are at full strength.

The issue with BTGs as well, is they only have \~200 combat soldiers.  The rest work the vehicles, heavy equipment, supply trucks, etc. I'd imagine that RU is either replacing the lost combat troops with green horns and/or moving non frontline soldiers to the active front line.  So basically replacing dead/wounded soldiers with those with even less experience than before. Even if those troops before already had little to no training.

&#x200B;

I think RU can keep up with troop parity pretty well with UA.  When you go on the offensive you want to have numerical superiority.  Im not sure UA will be able to achieve that in a meaningful way, at least not soon.  However, I think UA can potentially in the next few weeks, really start making moves on RU reguardless. With the losses RU are sustaining, I am not sure the commanders are going to want to or be able to keep up with that.  Rather face units getting obliterated I would not be surprised if in the next 4\~8 weeks the RU forces withdrawal to Feb 24 lines.

Though, I don't think RU will be prepared to hold onto those Feb 24 lines.  UA may not advanced into those areas, but they will have the equipment to constantly blow up anything and everything military related.

Dozens of bombs hit hospital in Mariupol

Dozens of heavy Russian bombs have destroyed a hospital inside Azovstal, a steel plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol where hundreds of servicemen and civilians have been holed up, a Ukrainian serviceman has said.

Russian heavy bombers and fighter jets bombed the plant last night, hitting the hospital, Oleksandr Vershinin of the Azov battalion that defends Mariupol said in a voice message posted on YouTube by the Mariupol public television.

The United States has accused Russia of planning to short-circuit Ukrainian democracy by forcing the government from power and dismantling local authorities. 

“We have information that Russia’s planning for its further invasion of Ukraine includes a forced capitulation of Ukraine’s democratically elected government, including dissolving all local municipal governments in Ukraine,” US Ambassador Michael Carpenter said in an address to the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperating in Europe (OSCE).

“New governance structures were to be set up in ‘liberated’ territories under Russian control,” he added in the speech posted online.

>The frustration is becoming so intense that it has spilled over into the public space.  Alexander Arutyunov (aka, the blogger RAZVEDOS), a well-known veteran of Spetsnaz of the National Guard, made a video plea to Putin: ""Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, please decide, are we fighting a war or are we masturbating?""

>He demanded a massive escalation, with a choice of airstrikes on Ukrainian  infrastructure or an end to the war. The video went viral, especially with pro-military groups on VKontakte [the Russian equivalent to Facebook] and Telegram channels affiliated with the Russian army.

>The telegram channel “FighterBomber” associated with the Russian air force, posted on April 12 a comment about NATO’s weapon supplies to Ukraine: “Naturally, we’ll further increase air defense units on the border with Ukraine in order to cover our territory from ballistic missile strikes, but it is also clear that NATO countries have far more weapons than Russia.”

>The author expressed optimism that the Russian air force will be able to staunch the flow of Western supplies but warned that further Ukrainian victories “will almost certainly prompt the use of nuclear weapons” against targets in Ukraine.

>And then on April 22, Russian army General Rustam Minnekayev announced a second phase of the “special operation” which would aim to “establish full control over the Donbas and Southern Ukraine.

>“This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” Minnekayev said, according to Russian wire agencies. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria [the Russian-garrisoned breakaway region of Moldova], where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population.”

>This was odd. Minnekayev is Deputy Commander of the Central Military District, and he made his remarks at the annual meeting of the Union of Defense Industries, of all places. The most plausible explanation was that having recently attended General Staff meetings, he became over-excited at what he had heard, and then revealed the news at the first public meeting thereafter. Regardless, it is a sign that the Russian army wants more war rather than less.

His latest piece is an outstanding essay about Russian historical attitudes toward Ukraine.


> As a young poet in the Soviet Union, Joseph Brodsky was persecuted by the authorities before escaping to the U.S. in 1972 and going on to win the Nobel Prize in literature. In Soviet-era Kyiv, Ukrainian intellectuals used to trade coveted samizdat reprints of Brodsky’s poems, reciting them at clandestine gatherings.
> 
> But the affection wasn’t mutual. At a reading in 1992, less than a year into Ukraine’s existence as an independent nation, Brodsky offered a new poem titled “To the Independence of Ukraine.” “Farewell khokhols,” he intoned, using a racial slur for Ukrainians. “We’ve lived together, now enough. Wish I could spit into the Dnipro river, perhaps it would now flow backwards.” Brodsky went on to predict that when the ungrateful Ukrainians were wheezing on their deathbeds, they would surely revert to reciting the verse of the classic Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin, rather than the “lies” of their own national poet, Taras Shevchenko.
> 
> 
> 

> The idea that Ukrainians aren’t a real people and that Ukrainian nationhood is an artificial construct has long been mainstream in Russian culture, literature and politics—including among liberal luminaries like Brodsky, who died in 1996. President Vladimir Putin’s views on Ukraine, which he expounded in an essay last year that was read to Russian soldiers preparing for the invasion, are no outlier. They follow a lengthy tradition that helps to explain the continuing support for the war among Russia’s citizens.
> 
> This blind spot dates to the beginnings of the modern Ukrainian quest for sovereignty more than a century ago. “The Russian democrat ends where the Ukrainian question begins,” said Ukrainian writer and playwright Volodymyr Vynnychenko, who served as prime minister of the short-lived Ukrainian National Republic in 1917-18. It has become one of the best-known phrases in Ukrainian politics.

His analysis below.

The area south of Izyum:

fierce fighting continues along the entire perimeter of the Russian bridgehead. There are tactical advances everywhere.

According to incoming reports, the most fierce battles are taking place on the right flank - in the area of ​​the village of Velikaya Kamyshevakha (and, possibly, directly in the village), as well as ""on the edge"" of the offensive - in the center of the bridgehead - in the area (possibly - and on the territory) of the village of Novaya Dmitrovka.

After taking the indicated villages our troops will approach directly the Barvenkovo-Slavyansk highway and create a threat of its interception (which will not be easy, since the settlements along this highway merge into an almost continuous agglomeration).

It should be noted that the battles are continuous ""viscous"" character. The enemy has enough manpower to - despite the lengthening of the front line in this area - nowhere to allow Russian troops to make deep breakthroughs.

At the same time, the enemy continues to withdraw his forces from the bridgehead he still has on the left bank of the Seversky Donets - from the Liman-Yampol region and the Severodonetsk ledge, leaving the most advanced positions to the east between Severodonetsk and Popasna (in which fierce fighting continued).

It is assumed that the enemy will soon (today or tomorrow) leave Liman and withdraw his troops to strengthen the flanks of the group - near Barvenkovo ​​and Slavyansk.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the DPR were unable to prevent this and surround the enemy units.

In general, the enemy defends competently, stubbornly, controls the situation and his troops.

There is no panic in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is absolutely clear that their command is betting on **WINNING TIME AND INflicting MAXIMUM LOSS ON THE STRIKING UNITS OF THE RF AF (LDNR AF)** \- due to the unhurried surrender of the territory.

Ahead of the Russian troops in this direction is the huge Slavyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration, which was prepared in advance for a long defense.

Its Armed Forces will definitely not surrender until the last opportunity - defending, if necessary, as a ""besieged fortress"". (In this regard, the fate of the remnants of the Mariupol garrison is of great importance - they should not be released or interned in any case - otherwise the garrison of Slavyansk-Kramatorsk will defend just as long and stubbornly, if not even longer and more stubbornly).

However, this ""fortress"" will still have to be surrounded, which is very difficult to do with the available limited forces and at such a slow pace - at which the enemy freely withdraws his units and prepares new defense units in advance.

In the south - in the area of ​​Gulyai-Pole and Orekhov - the situation has not changed significantly. ""Southern part of the offensive"" have stalled.

In the central section - near Donetsk - the situation as a whole is unchanged. There is a lull in most areas, the fighting is only in the area north of Avdiivka, where the DPR Armed Forces have had minor tactical successes.

**The general conclusion, unfortunately, is bleak: the attack of the Russian group on the encirclement and encirclement of the Donetsk group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which did not come as a surprise, met with fierce resistance and almost certainly will not lead to a complete encirclement and defeat of the enemy. additional tank corps in order to abruptly break through the front and connect deep in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""Cannes"" just didn't work out.**

**In the** ***best*** **case, the enemy will “squeeze out” from the Donbass for many weeks and even - it is possible - for several months, with heavy losses (mutual, of course). That will allow him to create, train and massively introduce strategic reserves into battle in any chosen area without much haste by the summer. And also - to crush Transnistria, gathering sufficient forces for this and not risking defeat near Donetsk during the operation.**",1651163123.0,1651162215.0,t3_udma4w,t3_udma4w,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

“We will continue to put maximum pressure on [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin to end the war by imposing sanctions, by providing economic support but also military support to Ukraine, and we need to be prepared for the long-term,” Stoltenberg said during a NATO Youth Summit taking place in Brussels. 

“It's a very unpredictable and fragile situation in Ukraine. But there is absolutely the possibility that this war will drag on and last for months and years,"" he continued.  

Stoltenberg also said that NATO allies are preparing to help Kyiv advance form an “old Soviet-era equipment to more modern standard-weapons and systems,” but added that it will “require more training.” 

The United States and some European countries including Netherlands and France have recently announced that they will be supplying Ukraine with howitzers, long-range weapons, to help defend itself against Russia.  

Germany has said they will supply anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, as it attempts to deflect criticism that the government has been slow to provide military equipment to the war-torn country.  

On Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said they will support the Ukrainian military by providing “training and maintenance.” 

Baerbock added that Germany had chosen not to make public all the weapons it had previously sent to Ukraine. “We have supplied anti-tank weapons, Stingers and many other weapons that we haven’t spoken about in public,” the foreign minister said. 

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss rallied for support for the United Kingdom to send warplanes and other heavy weapons in a keynote speech on Wednesday.    

“Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes – digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this,” Truss said.

Eventually the Tiger had enough of Timur's shit and literally yeeted the goat off of a hill in their shared enclosure. Timur lived, but was reportedly ""Never the same"" from then until his death some time later.

I feel that this story is in many ways analogous to Russia's recent behavior, and will likely have a similar result. An amusing coincidence that it occurred in Moscow of all places.

A long protracted conflict is in the cards, we're entering the third and final act of the 2022 version of the Russo-Ukrainian war. I think based on that, what is likely to happen next is:

* As early as next month, RU forces may soon capitulate on their goals to encircle Ukrainian forces and taking all of the Donbas region, instead opting for a defensive posture to secure territorial gains. 
* A formal declaration war and mass mobilization is unlikely, as it would carry implications of failure and setbacks in the original special operation. Instead, a silent mobilization where reservists and conscripts will be called up for training in preparation for a summer deployment. 
* Ukrainian forces will complete operation training for many of the heavy weapons supplied by the West. They are actively working to get these shipments to the Mykolaiv/Kherson and Donbas fronts in preparation for a wider scale counter-offensive. UA forces are going to try shifting the initiative, testing the RU forces defensive lines in an effort to break them before the summer conscripts arrive. 
* Russia may try to counter this by legislating the DPR and LPR territories as Russian soil via referendum. They'll shift the narrative through implications that the peaceful, newly federalized, ""legally"" annexed Russian lands are under assault by foreign invaders. Ukrainians living in these territories will continue to be filtered out and relocated in order to make it easier for RU forces to occupy those lands with little resistance.

Their army is now a laughing stock of incompetence, and so badly damaged by Ukraine that it will take decades or more to ever get back to where it was pre invasion.

Consider that if Russia got away with ‘nuclear bullying’, it would create incentives for other nuclear powers to try the same trick, and for non-nuclear powers to go nuclear. These could be massively significant additions to long-term nuclear risk.

“The tendency to pump up Ukraine and other countries with weapons is the type of actions that threaten the security of the continent and provoke instability,” Peskov told reporters on Thursday's regular conference call when asked to comment on remarks about supporting Ukraine and other countries in the region with arms made by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Wednesday.

Truss suggested Wednesday it is essential to arm not just Ukraine with heavy weapons, but also Moldova, Georgia and the Western Balkans.

“Some argue we shouldn’t provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something worse. But my view, is that inaction would be the greatest provocation,” Truss said.

“And we must ensure that, alongside Ukraine, the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom,” she added.

40bc41f817efd41a7023c43caa97281a,udma4w,i6jgrzd,"The most realistic prediction of how the Donbas campaign will end is with a full retreat of the Russian forces there like they did in Kyiv. The retreat will happen somewhere around mid to late summer.

TLDR of the explanation: Russia will not suffer high casualties to defend the L/DPR and once the armed forces of L/DPR run out Russia will say there is no reason to stay there anymore and pull out (Igor grekin aka strelok already mentioned a couple of days ago that the L/DPR are already at maximum conscription meaning they can't bring new soldiers to the field). They did the same with their Kyiv retreat.

Longer explanation:

The **OFFICIAL** position of Russia, which has been stated both by Putin as well as the Russia state media is that Russia is just **HELPING** the L/DPR republics in their war against Ukraine. Keep in mind that **OFFCIALLY**, Russia sees itself as a different country that the L/DPR. And this distinction is very important since it is explanatory of a number of things(such as lack of general mobilization in Russia): **Russia** **OFFICIALLY** **is NOT at war** with Ukraine but it is only helping the **L/DPR republics who are** **OFFICIALLY at war with Ukraine.**

Basically Russia is treating the L/DPR republics like the USA treated South Korea and South Vietnam during the Vietnam and Korean wars: as allies but not as parts of the United States. This means that Russia will not go ALL OUT in Ukraine with general mobilization and nukes. Keep in mind that the USA during the Korean War and the Vietnam war, although they gave HUGE amounts of help to both South Korea and Vietnam they didn't mobilize the same amount of resources as if the USA was under attack (which is why no nukes were used in either the Korean or the Vietnam war). Neither did the Soviet Union allocate as many forces in their Afghanistan war as if the Soviet Union is under attacks.

This OFFICIAL position of Russia is also their **OFF RAMP** from the Donbas campaign: Since this is the OFFICIAL war of the L/DPR, if the L/DPR will not be able to continue the war on their own Russia who is not OFFICIALLY at war in Ukraine will say there is no reason to stay in the Donbas and pull out.

They did the same during the Soviet Afghanistan war when the local propped up communist Afghan government was extremely unpopular and couldn't win the war on their own. Also keep in mind that the Soviet Union was never officially involved in the Afghanistan war they were just here to help the Communist Afghans in their civil war against the Taliban. The USA did the same in Vietnam.

Now why do I believe that the retreat will happen by mid-end summer? Because the L/DPR will probably have ran out of soldiers by them. Igor Girkin, the former MOD of the Donbas republics and one of the most connected person in the area stated one week ago that the L/DPR are at FULL MOBILISATION.

[https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1516796704816832512/photo/1](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1516796704816832512/photo/1)

This means that the soldiers of the L/DPR that they lose in battle CAN NOT BE REPLACED. Also according to the above Girkin post it is the **L/DPR soldiers who are mostly fighting the harsh battle to keep and defend settlements** while the Russian simply retreat. This means that a large part of the losses suffered in the Donbas campaign by what we here call the ""Russian army"" is actually suffered by the L/DPR forces. This has been confirmed by statements by L/DPR forces around Mariupol who stated on camera that they are doing the main fighting in Donbas. This means that soon the L/DPR won't have a capable fighting army which will give Russia a reason to exist the Donbas.

This scenario has already been confirmed by the Kyiv offensive: Russia went in, suffered great loses and the pulled out **UNEXPECTEDLY**. Their **OFFICIAL** explanation as to why they pulled out: because that served just as a distraction for the Donbas front and because they wanted to extend an olive branch to Ukraine and its allies(in hopes of sanctions being lifted).

What else happens by summer: the full effect of the sanctions kicks in and the Russian economy will suffer more and more. Sanctions also were the reason why the Soviet Afghanistan war was ended

>Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev decided to withdraw from Afghanistan a year before the Mujahideen fired their first Stinger missiles; Gorbachev was motivated by U.S. sanctions, not military losses.

This is why the Ukrainian strategy to allow Russian and L/DPR forces to take some ground and then inflict heavy damages on them is good: Because if the L/DPR forces are getting killed Russian will not fight as hard for Donbass territory. And once a lot of them get killed and the L/DPR and Donbas won't be able to defend themselves then Russia will say they have no reason to be there and retreat.

So no a bunch of villages going back and forth in Donbas won't end the Donbas campaign. L/DPR loses plus sanctions will.",False,1651157690.0,t3_udma4w,t3_udma4w,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

* 45% of Germans are for and 45% are against sending heavy weapons to Ukraine: https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/crchart-7875~_v-videowebl.jpg

From Ukrainian Intelligence, Google translated:

""""To ensure employment"" - in the ""Transnistrian region"" announced a military meeting
April 28, 2022

The unrecognized ""Transnistrian Moldavian Republic"" is strengthening its army. The letter of the Ministry of Defense of Transnistria to the heads of local administrations reveals information on the drafting of citizens to the ""special meeting"". It is noted that the purpose of the meeting is to ""ensure 100% staffing of the Peacekeeping Contingent of the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic, as well as to provide employment for the working population of the republic.""

Men under the age of 55, who are guaranteed ""financial and material support, accommodation and food"", can take part in the meeting. Financial support for unemployed citizens is promised from 2,800 ""rubles of Transnistria"". The meeting itself will last 90 days.

Despite the formal voluntary participation in the meeting, there is information that the call will be coercive.

It is noteworthy that the letter is dated April 21. That is, before the beginning of the last Russian provocations on the territory of ""PMR"". This is reminiscent of the events in the so-called ""LPR / DPR"" on the eve of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

*And they are pointing the finger at other agencies, the FSB’s foreign intelligence branch primarily, for misinforming the president about the true conditions inside Ukraine that have led to failure. Other FSB departments appear to share the military’s analysis.*  
  
*The war in Ukraine sharply divided Russian society. As journalists, we expected to lose many of our contacts in the Russian military and secret services after the invasion began on Feb. 24.

Excerpt:

> The Kremlin is resurrecting the arcane art of nuclear war fighting. These weapons have a military purpose. They also have a political one. The U.S. should reframe its thinking in kind.
> 
> This isn’t to say the U.S. should use nuclear weapons—again, a nuclear response would make global nuclear war more likely. But America and its allies can take steps against Russia’s nuclear arsenal that undermine the Russian position at higher escalation levels. The U.S. Navy’s surface ships, for example, could be re-equipped with nuclear weapons, as they were during the Cold War.
> 
> Most critically, if Russia used a nuclear weapon, the U.S. could use its naval power to hunt down and destroy a Russian nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarine, the backbone of Russian second-strike capability. 

...

> The ability to win is the key. By arming surface ships with tactical nuclear weapons as well as attacking a nuclear-missile sub and thus reducing Russian second-strike ability, the U.S. undermines Russia’s ability to fight a nuclear war. The Soviets were deeply afraid of a pre-emptive strike by NATO. That fear has morphed, under Mr. Putin’s regime, into a fixation on the “color revolutions,” pro-democracy uprisings in former Soviet republics. Jeopardizing Russian second-strike capability would tangibly raise the military stakes. Mr. Putin could no longer unleash his nuclear arsenal with impunity. Instead, he would need to reckon with the possibility that NATO could decapitate the Kremlin—yes, suffering casualties in the process, but still decapitate it.

1. OK, so there's a bunch of weapons in Transnistria that aren't being used. But couldn't Russia just transfer those weapons without trying a military expedition? Sure it's a warzone- but it's a warzone whatever Russia tries to do.

2. Let's say Russia opens a second front from Transnistria. I don't know where the UA is, but if opening a second (third?) front worked well enough, then the Kievan Offensive wouldn't have been cancelled. After all, Week One of the invasion had fresh troops who were supposed to capture the capital in three days, whereas these guys have been loitering around the TDR, a quiet area until a week ago, for years. Plus, depending on whether the Russians turn against Moldova, if the war goes on for years, that gives Moldova time to prep the military or make a deal with Romania to push out the Russians once and for all while they're distracted with the Russian version of the Soviet/Afghanistan war.

3. If you drink enough Ukrainium (I don't have the military wits to go one way or another on this): What happens if the 20,000 Russian troops are beaten back? What happens if Ukraine smashes them *really* hard, and maybe even makes progress INSIDE of the TDR? It doesn't matter whether Ukraine occupies it- break the Russian presence and even leave them be, it's an issue. Russia can't replenish that area easily anymore, especially since any attempt to ship troops through the Black Sea risks another missile or Neptune attack and Russia is not really in a state to surround Odessa yet.

> Now, the fear in Washington and European capitals is that the conflict may soon escalate into a wider war — spreading to neighboring states, to cyberspace and to NATO countries suddenly facing a Russian cutoff of gas. Over the long term, such an expansion could evolve into a more direct conflict between Washington and Moscow reminiscent of the Cold War, as each seeks to sap the other’s power.
> 
> In the past three days, the American secretary of defense has called for an effort to degrade the capability of the Russian military so that it could not invade another country for years to come. The Russians have cut off gas shipments to Poland and Bulgaria, which joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the collapse of the Soviet Union; Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, immediately denounced the move as an “instrument of blackmail.” Explosions have rocked a disputed area of Moldova, a natural next target for the Russians, and gas depots and even a missile factory in Russia have mysteriously caught fire or come under direct attack from Ukrainian forces.
> 
> And with increasing frequency, the Russians are reminding the world of the size and power of their nuclear arsenal, an unsubtle warning that if President Vladimir V. Putin’s conventional forces face any more humiliating losses, he has other options. American and European officials say they see no evidence the Russians are mobilizing their battlefield nuclear forces, but behind the scenes, the officials are already gaming out how they might react to a Russian nuclear test, or demonstration explosion, over the Black Sea or on Ukrainian territory.

...

> Talk of a diplomatic resolution or even a cease-fire — attempted at various points by the leaders of France, Israel and Turkey, among others — has died out. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are digging in for the long haul, focusing on what they expect will be an artillery war in the south and east of the country, where Russia has focused its forces after a humiliating retreat from Kyiv and other key cities.
> 
> “Putin is not willing to back down, nor are the Ukrainians, so there is more blood to come,” said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a British think tank. At the same time, American and European determination to help Ukraine defeat the Russians has hardened, partly after the atrocities in Bucha and other towns occupied by the Russians became clear, with even Germany overcoming its initial objections and sending artillery and armored vehicles.
> 
> Seth G. Jones, who directs the European Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said on Wednesday that “the risk of a widening war is serious right now.”

So, in just **one day** they lost almost 1/3rd of a year's worth of pre-war tank production!

And in just **2 months** they've lost ~970 tanks (according to UA, and [~583 have been visually confirmed by Oryx already](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html)) which is **~81%** of the number of tanks prepared for the invasion and likely **29~38%** of their total number of functional, serviced tanks (depending on estimate; which is usually in the 2500~3300 tanks). That's a decade's worth of tank production!

And the cherry on top? [Russia can no longer produce tanks because Uralvagonzavod is cut off from essential parts and materials in their supply chain.](https://sofrep.com/news/russian-tank-manufacturer-uralvagonzavod-halts-production-due-to-low-supply-of-parts/)

 The Russian propaganda/hometown news only serves to disorient the listener so they have no clues to what is actually going on it.  It serves two purposes, first, to make it very difficult to ""prove"" anything they said, because they have other audio clips saying conflicting things.  Second, it confuses the populace and makes them question everything and scrutinize it all.  Which is why you can have literal close family members from Ukraine calling their Russian relatives saying ""your army just blew my neighbour and his wife into 1000 pieces with a rocket, grandma's China is broken, and my dog is dead"" and they will still deny it because they are fed so much bullshit at such a rapid pace they honestly don't know what to believe because it ALL could be the truth or lies.

1. Ukraine may not have really factored an attack from the Moldovan direction, so there's a chance of catching them off guard and making a surprise gain- even if the TDR is lost after May 9 given the difficulties of resupplying through a war zone.

2. The EU and Turkey has basically closed off access to the Black Sea outside of Russian controlled and Ukrainian contested zones, and the only ways into Moldova by land now are either through NATO territory or Ukraine. This isn't so much ""get a quick win"" as ""if we don't get in soon, the TDR might be lost as we can no longer resupply our troops there and Moldova might get some ideas.""",False,1651197272.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6m2502,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Hitler sold WW2 to the German public as a way to ""even the score"" w/ the rest of the World, and looted the European continent to the point that he was able to completely ignore the catastrophe that was the German economy.  He gave seized land to Ethnic Germans, pilfered the treasures of other nations to give to the upper echelon, seized Jewish owned businesses to be run and operated by Germans, and used the German military as the biggest employer in Europe at one point.  It was way easier to pitch the invasion of the USSR to the general public after they'd prospered off of every conquest leading up to it, and promising even greater riches in the East.

Putin has been trying to develop a poor man's Third Reich from the top down since he came into power.  He desperately tried to indoctrinate the general public into his world view, and he's really only gotten them to commit to the broad strokes of simply following orders.  Whereas Hitler had the Hitler youth, Putin at his disposal only possesses a youth generation beset by developmental issues, alcohol abuse, institutional abuse, and no mind whatsoever for individual thinking that ultimately wins military conflicts.  Sure he had as good a PR system as Hitler had w/ Goebbels given that internationally everybody was afraid of the Russian Army, but ultimately the Russian Army was revealed to be a paper tiger.  Worse yet as opposed to the WW2 German Army it had zero in the way of competent training, discipline, and everyone from the highest General to the lowest Private has zero free will to make decisions.  Everything we're seeing is a direct result of Putin's direct orders down the chain of command w/ zero room for any tactical reasoning.

So when it comes to Russia attempting a landing/annexation of Transistria and greater Moldova, I wouldn't put it past him.  If Putin continues attempting the dumb Nazi Germany playbook then he'll burn resources opening that second front in Moldova, Moldova in turn may request Ukrainian/NATO assistance which will only put Russia in an even deeper hole, and Putin still publicly refuses to admit any setbacks at his little May 9th parade.

Narcissists mentally can NOT admit defeat or that they're wrong in any case whatsoever.  If Putin had the ability to cure all of his physical ailments by publicly stating, ""I was wrong to invade"" he could not do it.  So they'll attempt the landing, and casualties will be horrific.  The Ukrainian Army will get a chance to permanently secure it's south western border by land, and more Russians will die as a result.",False,1651198469.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6m2502,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

This keeps getting repeated, but keep in mind it's not representative. Yeah, its economy is smaller than New Yorks, but all of its relative costs are too. US soldier earns X? Russian soldier earns X/10. US tank costs Y, Russia tank costs Y/10 etc. 

Lockheed Martin will charge you 100million to do the same work that a Russian defence contractor will charge 10, there's a reason Russian weapons fuel tin pot dictators around half the world.


It's an apples to oranges comparison due to costs of living, expected pay, and years of inflations and growth.

Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act

This bill authorizes the President to, subject to certain conditions, seize assets belonging to a foreign person whose wealth is derived in part through political support for or corruption linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Specifically, for two years starting from this bill's enactment, the President may seize such assets if (1) Russia remains engaged in a conflict of territorial conquest in Ukraine; (2) the President has imposed sanctions on the owner of the assets for reasons related to corruption, human rights violations, malign influence, or conflicts in Ukraine; and (3) the assets are valued at over $5 million.

Such seized assets may be liquidated, and the resulting funds may only be used for specified purposes, including (1) the post-conflict reconstruction of Ukraine, (2) humanitarian assistance and refugee support for the Ukrainian people, (3) weapons for Ukraine's uniformed military forces, and (4) humanitarian and development assistance for the Russian people.",False,1651150029.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6ixr1b,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

""  sibling 2:"" yeah... yeah he did"". The siblings don't like seeing someone hit their neighbor, it is just wrong. they both stop fighting each other for a brief moment and turn to face the mutual enemy/asshole.... together, for Olga. 


We may fight, but american culture has a strong idea of "" for the little guy"", ""heroism"" or ""for a good cause"". Yes, these cultural ideas don't always manifest into action or legislation, but on a... individual level it is with everyone. Good or bad, it is what it is.


God forbid that asshole punches on of the siblings....

What can help the most and be delivered quickly is what they're going to focus on, and right now that's artillery and ammunition. This equipment will also require training, spare parts, and new supply chains, but these are much easier weapons to transition to by comparison. They can be in the field very soon, and they'll help Ukraine equalize and hopefully gain the advantage in the artillery war.

The story of Pahom, who for one thousand rubles is offered by the Bashkirs all the land he can cover in one day if he returns to his starting position.

> Pahóm looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side of it had already
disappeared. With all his remaining strength he rushed on, bending his body forward
so that his legs could hardly follow fast enough to keep him from falling. Just as he
reached the hillock it suddenly grew dark. He looked up -- the sun had already set!
He gave a cry: “All my labour has been in vain,” thought he, and was about to stop,
but he heard the Bashkírs still shouting, and remembered that though to him, from
below, the sun seemed to have set, they on the hillock could still see it. He took a
long breath and ran up the hillock. It was still light there. He reached the top and saw
the cap. Before it sat the Chief laughing and holding his sides. Again Pahóm
remembered his dream, and he uttered a cry: his legs gave way beneath him, he fell
forward and reached the cap with his hands.
“Ah, that’s a fine fellow!” exclaimed the Chief. “He has gained much land!”
Pahóm’s servant came running up and tried to raise him, but he saw that blood was
flogging from his mouth. Pahóm was dead!
The Bashkírs clicked their tongues to show their pity.
His servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pahóm to lie in, and
buried him in it.

Small territorial gains is not what Russia wants to be getting right now, so in that respect, they're being ""destroyed"".  It's a bit of a misnomer.  Ukraine is giving ground slowly while Russia remains sanctioned and appears unable to rearm itself with precision munitions, tanks, aircraft, basically anything requiring western parts (since the collapse of USSR, they had started to source bits and bobs from out-of-country) or microchips.  Ukraine used to make a lot of this stuff, funnily enough.  Their factory shutdowns are making the news.

Any talk of victory is more or less from the perspective of attrition.  Russia may be gaining minimal territory but it is at a fairly high cost that they can't replace.  Meanwhile Ukraine is minimizing losses and being constantly funded and supplied from the west.

The expectation is that these gains will reverse themselves as Russia runs out of troops, vehicles, tanks, guided munitions, and thanks to western supplies, finds itself outranged and countered in it's main area of strength: artillery.  This will not happen overnight.  Ukraine is doing defense-in-depth, Russia is doing ""attack/defend with artillery cover"".  Once the shelling bit no longer packs the punch it used to...",1651157358.0,1651157017.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6je73s,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

both are correct. 

Russian army is making minor but steady territorial gains, but the cost of these gains has been terrible. 

As some military experts stated, Russian lacks infantry and this was a fact even at the start of the invasion. Now of course this problem is even bigger. They're having brutal losses while gaining every day a piece of territory. 

This is not sustainable and also, the moment they'll have to hold every inch they occupied, it will be brutal.

> Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force. Once an attacker has lost momentum or is forced to spread out to pacify a large area, defensive counter-attacks can be mounted on the attacker's weak points, with the goal being to cause attrition or drive the attacker back to its original starting position.",False,1651156816.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6je73s,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Ukraine still hasn't lost any other major cities or towns in the east and the south. The major defensive line in Donbass still holds and any minor gains the russia has gained have been paid for dearly - their losses of both manpower and heavy equipment have spiked in the last day or two after a period of lull following the withdrawal from the north.

Remember that two sides have very different definitions of ""victory"". Ukraine has to maintain the bulk of its army, but any losses in ammo and equipment will be replentished by western allies while those mobilized in the first weeks of the war are still being trained and haven't entered combat.

But in general, your military is organized into two forces:

1. Standing military -- These are soldiers who are ready to fight at a moment's notice. If USA were attacked tonight, you can expect our standing-military to respond tomorrow.

2. Reserve forces -- These are soldiers who have **promised** to return if called upon, but are right now doing other jobs in the economy. (Programmers, Doctors, Teachers, etc. etc.). Reserve forces undergo training so that if they're ""activated"", they can return to the military quicker than an untrained person.

In effect, ""reserve forces"" are ""partially mobilized"". Reserves in the USA practice army-stuff every month so that they don't ""forget"" how to fight, but their full-time job is something else completely.

----------

Mobilization is when you ""call upon"" your reserve forces. So the reserves leave their current jobs and enter the military as their main job.

How much this matters depends on how good you've been training your reserve forces. 

--------

In terms of this conflict: Ukraine is mobilized (reserves are fighting now). Russia has **NOT** mobilized yet, because Russia wants to pretend this is not a war, and just a ""special military operation"".

2. Ukraine, using a small 0.1 kiloton weapon which is capable of destroying a large football field. Or I do a high altitude detonation that give a lot of propaganda usage and scary pictures, without any (large) fallout. 

3. My strategic asset is having my opponent guessing my next move and showing my people that I/we are still strong. The target itself wouldn’t really matter. 

4. De-escalation could consist of a forced cease fire, maybe while giving back some land I have conquered in the past weeks. After all, I extended the border of my country with 1500 kilometers. They could have Mariupol, I wouldn’t care. 

Everyone will be mad, but they are mad already at this point. The only ones I would be concerned with would be China, since I would rely on them for money and because Ukraine has a nuclear umbrella agreement with them.

2. Probably Kryvyi Rih, tactical nuke with low-yield, ~500kt, which using [this generator, albeit quickly](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) allows fallout to reach Kharkiv and not Russia proper.

3. To create a buffer area dividing Russia and Western Ukraine, where Ukraine receives re-supply, allowing Russia to focus a blitz on remaining troops in the Donbas/east Ukraine by virtue of theoretically cutting them off from the west.

4. Hold onto your butts, cuz this is uncharted territory. No idea in terms of response, but at that point, Russia would probably let loose more low yield tactical nukes. 

* Quick edit - I'm really unsure if NATO/the west would retaliate with a full on nuclear counter attack if Russia uses low yield. It's such sketchy territory and while on the face of it it stands to reason they probably should? I really just don't know if they'd risk escalation as I think Russia would try to utilize the fact that they didn't outright start a conventional ICBM slugfest, even though they're **clearly** in the wrong here, and have been since the beginning of this conflict.

This has been the strategy of the Ukrainian armed forces for a while. Let the Russians come and exploit their weaknesses. Ukrainians haven't even started their counter offensive, because they are waiting for the opposition's supplies to run low, their morale lower.

Instead they're fighting easy wins, contesting airspace around the 'controlled' areas and striking supply convoys. They're training on the latest weapons, preparing full mobilization (it takes several months of training for mobilization) and striking high opportunity targets within Russia.

Sure, the maps look bad. The maps looked incredibly bad around Kyiv at the start, yet in reality, they at most controlled some roads and settlements. With the US and NATO training Ukrainian forces on modern NATO equipment and supplying more, it'll be advantage Ukraine in the near future.

Certain statements carry meaning and bare the regime's true intentions, while others do not. Often the truth is somewhere in the middle. One must also always keep in mind that when there are mixed messages it is either a sign that different things are being said to different audiences, or that the purpose is to confuse absolutely everyone. It's difficult to make (the right) decision when you're confused, is it not? My main advice is to judge them by what they do, not what they say.

There's a very good reason why the US only launches rockets from coastal locations, (Vandenberg, Wallops, Cape Canaveral, Kodiak), and that's because in the 1930's and 1940's, early missile tests ended up crashing and causing destruction (not to mention toxic contamination with extremely volatile chemicals like hydrazine rocket fuel).  

This is just another example of Russia's culture of indifference to others' suffering. Russia could have built their cosmodrome in a safer spot, (like ESA's center in French Guyana in South America).

Even worse: Russia's launch site in Kazakhstan means they tend to use a more highly-inclined orbit, which means more ∆-V is needed to put the same payload in orbit. (higher cost-per-pound).

The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. Ukraine was one of the largest grain producing states in the USSR and as a result was hit particularly hard by the famine. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly.

 >During the French occupation of Moscow the 1812 Fire of Moscow persisted from 14 to 18 September 1812 and all but destroyed the city. The Russian troops and most of the remaining residents had abandoned Moscow on 14 September 1812 just ahead of French Emperor Napoleon's troops entering the city after the Battle of Borodino. The Moscow military governor, Count Fyodor Rostopchin, has been blamed to have organised the destruction of the sacred former capital to weaken the French army in the scorched city even more.

It used to be that people self-censored out of fear that they may come across as immature and irresponsible to other adults, or set a bad example for the younger generations, but social media turned their sentiments into the mainstream.

It was given on the basis that such help was essential for the defense of the United States; this aid included warships and warplanes, along with other weaponry.

In return, the U.S. was given leases on army and naval bases in Allied territory during the war. Canada operated a similar smaller program called Mutual Aid.

Germany chose MEADS to replace their MIM-104 Patriot systems in June 2015.

Plus the 500 or so they had stationed in groups aboard, and likely hundreds more out on various stations, or hidden from view.  

> I would be SHOCKED if any more than a few hundred were battle ready.

They had 1000 in/around Ukraine. Plus likely a few hundreds scattered around in yards, on trains etc. And the 500 abroad on foreign duties. Definitely more than a few hundred. If they only had 1/3rd of the working force that Ukraine had, then the amount of land they have managed to occupy is hugely embarrassing for Ukraine.

A few weeks ago the doomer posts got me to bother looking up the public side at least.

Stopping them at launch was ideal, but highly impractical. The US would need an asset within about 100-200km of the launcher, which doesn't work for any threat except North Korea. So that idea was mostly abandoned.

Then it was to stop them mid flight. The US does maintain 2 bases of these anti-ICBM missiles. They are basically half size ICBMs themselves. Not horribly accurate though and not as many of them as you'd like.

Finally there is ""shoot the warhead down as it falls."" This actually isn't too bad accuracy wise, but you need to be pretty close to the system to be protected by it.

They are still considered center-left and environmentalists but they do understand and accept that the can't ignore reality. And they really care about human rights and democracy and are much less willing to turn a blind eye on that just for better trade relations, which was basically the policy of the social democrats and the conservative party, especially in the last 16 years under Merkel.

And because of that they rejected the Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Russia and advocated for arming Ukraine long before this war even started. This is what Habeck said in May last year:

This is a pretty gross misunderstanding of nuclear winter.

1) No, even if 200 warheads were to go off on Indian soil, it wouldn't cause Nuclear Winter on the scale you're talking about. You're looking at 200 10-20MT warheads going off which are fucking massive explosions would wipe out most population centers in India. This would, yes, cause debris and atmospheric cooling due to particulates. 

2) Fallout would be pretty bad for SE Asia, China and the Pacific Islands for a long while and the spikes in radiation related cancers would grow in those regions for the next few decades.

3) It would still rain. The sun is an immense and powerful radiation object. It would provide enough heat to the surface of the earth to still allow for normal evaporation cycles, jetstreams and ocean currents as particles settled in less than a single years atmospheric conditions.

Note the verbiage: “spilled over”. This strongly implies it wasn’t part of some intentional effort by the Kremlin to drive their own agenda further. 

What I’m referring to is this specific passage:

For example some of Russia's dollar denominated foreign reserve assets have been frozen which is basically like Bank of America taking deposits from you then telling you that the money no longer belongs to you. For an adversarial nation, you can see how it puts them in a really bad situation to give the United States so much leverage over their ability to trade internationally and so several countries are looking for ways to start trading outside of the dollar system, most notably China and Russia. 

The other thing to consider is that global interbank financial transactions are done via the SWIFT system which the United States also controls. Trump used this system against Iran by locking them out of it, forcing them out of the mainstream financial system. Other countries saw this and regardless of whether you're an ally or enemy of the US, this is concerning. It's the first time this system was weaponized and the world started to wake up to the precarious situation they found themselves in. It's a national security risk for most countries since we can, at any moment, elect officials that can wake up and decide to wage economic warfare on any country for any reason.

Anyway, the point here is that most countries, including our allies are getting increasingly skittish about having the USD as the sole global reserve currency but everyone is putting up with it for the time being because there aren't any viable alternatives. In the case of Russia, they're being forced out of the dollar system anyway so they're trying to use the leverage the have (energy supply) to get other countries to trade outside of the dollar system.

They are not attempting to completely halt the advancement of Russian forces, but mainly to blunt or slow it, while inflicting maximum casualties onto the advancing forces at the same time.  

We also know that Russian forces rely heavily on rail for their logistics and really begin to struggle when they advance more than 70 miles beyond that infrastructure.  So, Ukraine has likely been more focused on continually disrupting their supply lines rather than fully halting Russian advances.  

The strategy appears to be, don't over commit to defending territory, preserve the lives of your personnel as much as possible, continue to disrupt enemy supply lines, and make the invaders exhaust themselves with the advance.

What you're doing is essentially saying you want the west to de-escalate a situation against an armed terrorist that has no consequences to that terrorist.

You're also handing China the same playbook as well. 

The west has used de-escalatory language this entire time. Everytime they are asked about nukes they say it's irresponsible to talk about nuclear war like that. They say they are providing aid for Ukraine to defend itself, and they once again imply that Russia needs to stop their hostilities.

You're describing a world that no longer exists. Putin is the head of a terrorist organization that was pretending to be a European country.

 >In politics, diplomacy and export control, ""dual-use"" refers to technology that can be used for both peaceful and military aims. More generally speaking, dual-use can also refer to any technology which can satisfy more than one goal at any given time. Thus, expensive technologies that would otherwise benefit only civilian commercial interests can also be used to serve military purposes if they are not otherwise engaged, such as the Global Positioning System.

 >The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects. The World Bank is the collective name for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), two of five international organizations owned by the World Bank Group. It was established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. After a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947.

 >A battalion tactical group (Russian: Батальонная тактическая группа, batal'onnaya takticheskaya gruppa), abbreviated as BTG, is a combined-arms manoeuvre unit deployed by the Russian Army that is kept at a high level of readiness. A BTG typically comprises a battalion (typically mechanised infantry) of two to four companies reinforced with air-defence, artillery, engineering, and logistical support units, formed from a garrisoned army brigade. A tank company and rocket artillery typically reinforce such groupings. BTGs formed the mainstay of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine from 2013–2015, particularly in the War in Donbas.

But that's also what matters - because it doesn't require a huge amount of equipment, no one would need to lend-lease. As conflicts get larger, the amount of equipment goes up drastically. Even if the scale of destruction of equipment is proportional, that means numerically the amount is still huge. In this conflict, we're looking at two very large armies, and so a significantly larger amount is needed. Which is where America comes in. America spends more on its defence than the next 11 countries combined. That's because America can. Its GDP is about 15-16% of the entire world.

Between 2008 and 2012, Newsweek experienced financial difficulties, leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to an all-digital format at the end of 2012. It was relaunched (print and digital) in 2014 under the ownership of IBT Media, which also owns the International Business Times, until it was spun off a few years later.

There was always a deescalation path and if I read stuff in the US media saying “The Kremlin doesn’t pick up the phone anymore”, then yes: that concerns me. 

The easiest way to end is, is if Russia “just went home”. I just don’t believe they do will do this. The war will grind to a hold at some point and probably turn into a frozen conflict as the Russians have more or less patented this (I’ve commented in this before). That would give the Russians time to refortify their efforts and try again a couple of years later to finish unfinished business. There are 2 ways of preventing this:

1. Beating Russia so badly that they can’t refortify (this is mote or less what we are doing now)
2. Putting so much (NATO) weapons in Ukraine that attack Ukraine would be too costly. (This will happen regardless, now that I think about it). 

My final counter argument is this: western interventions do bit have a terribly great track record looking at the past (Irak, Afghanistan, etc. everyone knows the list). This is not some argument to justify not doing anything. I am just looking back. However, this is an unprecedented response from the west, both in economic (sanctions) and in military terms (possible lend lease from the US).

I worked on an icebreaker in 2013 that was going down to Antarctica to supply the US research base.

While we were enroute, there was a Russian icebreaker that had gotten stuck in some unfavorable conditions. I guess they have so many that they lease them out to take tourists on trips around Antarctica... So at after they can get themselves out, they ask the Australians for help, and they send an icebreaker down to break them free, no luck, they get stuck too. Then the Chinese try and break them out with theirs, the Snow Dragon, but no luck, they get stuck too. Kind of like throwing your shoe up at the kite and it gets stuck too... 

Now at this point we receive a report that they are running low on food and the civilians get evacuated via helicopter to Australia or the Australian ship. We get tapped to break them out since our ship was bigger and more powerful than the other two.

We cut our planned portcall in sydney, the first and only time I have ever set foot in Australia, from 4 days to 36 hours. Just long enough to refuel and stock up on food. We start heading south towards the Russian ship, go through the southern ocean as fast as possible, which means the ship rides the worst it can. Beam to, the whole time, half the crew is sick, I am standing watch with a garbage bag in my pocket so I can vomit on the go since no one can come and replace mewhen I am sick. Our cook gets a concussion in a particular big wave/roll.
When we are one day out from them, the winds shift, it blows out the ice floes/bergs or whatever we're keeping them and they are free. We receive word of that and ask them if they need food supplies so they can make it back to restock. They say nyet, they were actually running low on booze, and have enough food to make it back to port.

NATO spec 155mm shells are comparatively plentiful, widely manufactured, in general more modern and have a bit better range and accuracy. Those last factors are mostly due to incremental advances in design and improved consistency for the unguided shells, while NATO guided shells add an entirely new level off accuracy whether GPS,INS, or active laser guided.

Once you move from the ammunition to the actual guns, the differences become more obvious. Weapons are more mobile, vastly easier to operate, and come with fun new toys like single gun time-on-target mode that allows a single gun to fire multiple rounds on differing trajectories such that they all impact at nearly the same time.

> I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.

Perhaps the line ""the United States could boot into world war mode and have manufacturing lines all over the place (like WW2) in no time flat if necessary"" wasn't clear enough.

The US (and her companies) would literally convert many of their production lines into necessary lines for the war effort, as they did in WW2. For example, Auto companies transitioned to making tanks, aircraft engines, ammunition, weapons, and so on. It was *such* a monumental shift from normal products to military items that the US went from producing around 3 million cars a year in 1941 to only [139](https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/2128446/during-wwii-industries-transitioned-from-peacetime-to-wartime-production/) cars over the next 4 years, or 35/yr!

And this was true for pretty much any company that made anything. We still have plenty of companies that make things, and believe it or not, are still the [second largest manufacturer in the world](https://www.brookings.edu/research/global-manufacturing-scorecard-how-the-us-compares-to-18-other-nations/) (behind china) with 18% of the **entire worlds** manufacturing output being based in the US, and China is only just ahead of us, at 20%. And it's worth noting that only 12% of the US GDP output is from manufacturing. Meaning if needed, a massive increase in output can be had in little time.

And if we need more lines, *we'll just make them*. In WW2, the US had the world's largest manufacturing base before joining the war, and in 4 years, *doubled* it. That's insane. So what I was saying is not at all misleading or incorrect. We could literally outpace china in manufacturing if desired or required, but don't currently because of the opportunity cost and the fact that it would be a step backwards (service based economy > manufacturing based economy > agricultural based economy).

Anyway, the bottom line is we could and would transition to manufacturing as necessary for an all our war effort.",False,1651161705.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6jg3sr,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

- ISW and my comment acknowledged that a silent mobilization is likely, but will take months to materialize into a combat ready force. If mobilization was something the Kremlin is prepared for, they'd have declared it long before withdrawing from Kyiv and scaling back their goals. Existing RU foces do not have months, sanctions will continue to take a heavy toll on Russia's economic outlook. Mobilizing reservists and conscripts will only prolong the conflict but will not change the overall outcome.

- China has supported Russia publicly, but many of its companies and state owned banks have limited their operations in recent weeks in fear of sanctions. If China wishes to help Russia militarily, they'd be doing so already, and if they are, that aid hasn't materialized into significant gains for RU forces. More aid is seriously unlikely to change the outcome unless that aid is heavy weapons and Chinese forces, but then they will receive severe sanctions as well. If China intends to go that route, they'd have done so already. 

- if Russia attacks NATO or destabilizes other parts of the world, we are no longer talking about act 3 of the Russo-Ukranian war, this would become something else entirely. My comment pertains to this conflict specifically.

- Russia can possibly resort to WMDs, but unlikely as this will lead to embargos on all Russian exports, Russia collapses faster. We also can't predict with 100% certainly that global allies like India and China will continue to support Russia if they resort to a Nuclear holocaust to accomplish their goals, there's a strong likelihood that they'd get sanctions too for supporting Russia once it reaches that point.

 >Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture, is a process in which law enforcement officers take assets from people who are suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime.

ABM systems do exist, and will have a significant impact (but they're not a guarantee of protection).

One of the reasons why JFK was an **extremely** overrated President.

He basically let the generals have their way with the Bay of Pigs, and then when things turned sour the generals thought they could talk him into providing air support, which he refused because it wasn't a part of the original plan and he (rightfully) felt that they had misled him. And good on him for doing so.

But the Cubans were obviously freaked out about the attempted coup and decided to host Soviet missiles, which is totally understandable given the Bay of Pigs. The Soviets were happy to do so given US missile systems in Turkey. Which, again, was totally understandable.

Then you got the Cuban Missile Crisis, which largely happened because JFK felt like he couldn't withstand another foreign policy debacle like the Bay of Pigs, which was mostly his fault to begin with. He risked complete global destruction to cover his own ass politically.

He was a good president on civil rights and very little else. I guess we'll never know whether is Vietnam policy would have been better than Johnson's, which is likely, but I'll honestly never understand why he is considered to be a great president given his track record, even if that record was cut short.

But not a gross one. 

Full disclosure, this is amateur level, spherical cow math:

M777 weighs 10K lbs. C-5 can carry 120K lbs 5.5k miles. We are going to assume that all M777's are being shipped  from Ft. Sill, OK (Major artillery base and center of the US, just to make the math easier, conveniently also \~5.5K miles from Poland)

If each C-5 carries a dozen howitzers, we need 34 flights for the guns. Figure half again as many for personnel, auxiliary equipment, ect, so a total of \~50 flights.

US operates about 50 C-5s at the moment, but not all of them will be available (maintenance, deployments, other taskings) Easy math, assume 50% availability, so 25 airframes, requiring 2 flights each.

C-5 cruise is 520mph, fudge it down to 500 for climb/decent/weather. 5.5k miles @ 500 mph , 11 hours each way plus loading/unloading/service time, call it round trip per day, so 2 days or a bit more for 2 flights. 

That gives us \~48-52 hours to deploy 22 battalions worth of artillery, plus some spares, 5500 miles away over a whole frigging ocean. Now, we could speed that up by including c-17 flights, ect, but then we get into aerial refueling and/or multiple stops, and I am outside WAY too much homebrew at the moment to math that out right now.",False,1651195639.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6ltf0s,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

These skins dried tight, like a steel band, thus damaging their brains and enslaving them forever. A mankurt did not recognise his name, family or tribe — ""a mankurt did not recognise himself as a human being"".

Below is just one of many [articles](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/09/neville-chamberlain-was-right-to-cede-czechoslovakia-to-adolf-hitler-seventy-five-years-ago-the-british-prime-signed-the-munich-pact.html) or books that cover the subject. His own military advisors told him they weren't ready and couldn't do anything about Czechoslovak anyway.  

> But among historians, that view changed in the late 1950s, when the British government began making Chamberlain-era records available to researchers. “The result of this was the discovery of all sorts of factors that narrowed the options of the British government in general and narrowed the options of Neville Chamberlain in particular,” explains David Dutton, a British historian who wrote a recent biography of the prime minister. “The evidence was so overwhelming,” he says, that many historians came to believe that Chamberlain “couldn’t do anything other than what he did” at Munich. Over time, Dutton says, “the weight of the historiography began to shift to a much more sympathetic appreciation” of Chamberlain.
 
> First, a look at the military situation. Most historians agree that the British army was not ready for war with Germany in September 1938. If war had broken out over the Czechoslovak crisis, Britain would only have been able to send two divisions to the continent—and ill-equipped divisions, at that. Between 1919 and March 1932, Britain had based its military planning on a “10-year rule,” which assumed Britain would face no major war in the next decade. Rearmament only began in 1934—and only on a limited basis. The British army, as it existed in September 1938, was simply not intended for continental warfare. Nor was the rearmament of the Navy or the Royal Air Force complete. British naval rearmament had recommenced in 1936 as part of a five-year program. And although Hitler’s Luftwaffe had repeatedly doubled in size in the late 1930s, it wasn’t until April 1938 that the British government decided that its air force could purchase as many aircraft as could be produced.

> All of this factored into what Chamberlain was hearing from his top military advisers. In March 1938 the British military chiefs of staff produced a report that concluded that Britain could not possibly stop Germany from taking Czechoslovakia. In general, British generals believed the military and the nation were not ready for war. On Sept. 20, 1938, then-Col.Hastings Ismay, secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defense, sent a note to Thomas Inskip, the minister for the coordination of defense, and Sir Horace Wilson, a civil servant. Time was on Britain’s side, Ismay argued, writing that delaying the outbreak of war would give the Royal Air Force time to acquire airplanes that could counter the Luftwaffe, which he considered the only chance for defeating Hitler. British strategists, including Ismay, believed their country could win a long war (so long as they had time to prepare for it). This was a common belief, and doubtless factored into Chamberlain’s calculations.",False,1651173116.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6kgvg8,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

First off your projectile isn't going to be as massive as a Soyuz capsule, so that's much less weight to lift, and so much less fuel required. And second, you don't actually need to get into orbit, all you need is altitude.

Ever watch an orbital rocket launch? They go up for a bit, then they steadily curve their path and fly sideways - usually eastwards, to go with the Earth's rotation. The point is to build up enormous speed sideways, which is what allows the spacecraft to circle the Earth rather than just shoot up and then fall straight back down.

Well, if your goal is to destroy a satellite, not launch one, you're fine with that. You don't need the velocity to stay in space - you just need to gain enough height. Pop up your projectile from the ground, time it just right so the satellite crashes into it, job done.

The HIMARS carries six rockets or one MGM-140 ATACMS missile on the U.S. Army's new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton truck, and can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM). HIMARS ammunition is interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1; however, it is only able to carry one pod rather than the standard two for the M270 and A1 variants. The launcher is C-130 transportable.

Yeaaaa you need to do more reading on this. The Canadian government was scrambling hard to find countries that'd sell old aircraft. It's not normal.

Second point
The Holocaust (which you display zero understanding of) was a forced removal program *across Europe* not just in another country (Ukraine in the case of Russia). The German people could in many cases use the excuse of ""I thought they were just being kicked out"" because that's what they were told. Even though in some towns where there were extermination camps the towns people likely knew because of proximity but that is a few towns in an entire fascist nation where information is controlled.
I doubt many Germans in Dresden understood the scale of the Holocaust outside of rumors and hearsay, look up the secretary notes of the Wansee Conference the Nazis actually had the goal of only leaking rumors out because the regular German wouldn't have the stomach to carry out what the Nazis saw as required but having those rumors also helped the fascist state immensely in the area of control. 
The entire purpose of the Concentration Camp system was efficient yet secretive murder.

Gladly:

The George W. Bush administration took
office in January 2001 intending to do some-
thing about missile defense and determined
not to let the ABM Treaty stand in its way.
In December 2001, the administration gave
the required six months’ notice of its inten-
tion to withdraw from the treaty. The Russian
government disagreed and wished to maintain
the treaty, but it did not object with any vigor.
The United States formally withdrew in June
2002.As a result, for the first time in 30 years, U.S.
(and Russian) missile defenses no longer
were limited. Motivated by concern about
potential North Korean and Iranian ICBMs
(which had not yet been developed), the
Bush administration launched the Ground-
Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD) system
to deploy 44 ground-based interceptors
(GBIs) in Alaska and California, with the
first achieving operational status in 2004.
The GBI three-stage interceptor missiles,
supported by a variety of radar and satellite-
based infrared capabilities, carry an exo-
atmospheric kill vehicle that uses an infrared
“seeker” to guide the kill vehicle into the
incoming warhead and destroying it by colli-
sion (“hit-to-kill”). 21
U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was
followed by Russia’s withdrawal from the
1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START II), which had not yet entered into
force. Among other things, START II would
have banned all MIRVed and heavy ICBMs
– an objective pursued by U.S. negotiators
in the belief that limiting ICBM forces to
single-warhead missiles would present less
attractive targets in a crisis and thereby
enhance strategic stability.

You are under the impression that these systems are designed to stop mass nuclear power vs. nuclear power attacks. They are not. They are aimed at defending against much smaller scale attacks, particular by NK/Iran-type players.",False,1651190382.0,t3_udma4w,t1_i6lmqgt,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

I don't think they have any more of an idea than we do about our real capabilities, and it amounts to speculation. They also haven't gone into detail about all of our systems, only a couple of them.

I get it, it’s an unsettling topic that the US (or any country) can’t prevent a full nuclear attack, and instead can only have a chance to thwart a smaller strike by an NK-like rogue state.
