You might see some accounts that are eerily making similar comments on the same post. The accounts are either brand new or a few months old. The accounts were dormant until recently.

It's unknown what their goal is but they're probably farming comment karma to spam other subs later on.

""A Ukrainian brigade posted a video of soldiers celebrating in southeastern Ukraine Sunday, saying they were hailing the recapture of the village of Neskuchne from Russian forces.

The video, which has been geolocated by CNN, shows ten men from Ukraine‚Äôs 129th Brigade standing around their battalion flag outside a small medical facility in the village. 

‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes,‚Äù they shout.

The video, which was posted to the battalion‚Äôs Facebook page, is accompanied by a statement saying the village was recaptured Saturday.

Keep in mind: CNN cannot independently verify battlefield reports, and Ukraine has yet to officially claim the successful recapture of Neskuchne, which lies immediately south of the town of Velyka Novosilka on the front lines between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk.

But Ukrainian army officials have said that they took back the neighboring village of Blahodatne, and Russian military bloggers have been reporting since Saturday night that both villages fell to Ukrainian forces.

The reported capture of these two small territories comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky gave his clearest indication yet that Ukraine's counteroffensive is underway.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-11-23/index.html

""Ukraine's military has recaptured Makarivka, another frontline village in the eastern Donetsk region, and has advanced on several fronts, the country's deputy defense minister said Sunday.

‚ÄúThe settlements of Blahodatne and Makarivka were liberated,‚Äù the official, Hanna Maliar, said in an update on Telegram, referring to a second southeastern village that army officials had earlier claimed was back in Ukrainian hands.

A third, Neskuchne, has also been claimed Sunday by a Ukrainian army brigade, though Kyiv defense leaders have not yet commented on that territory. Russian military bloggers have also made unofficial reports that Neskuchne has been recaptured by Ukraine's troops.

CNN cannot independently verify battlefield reports.

Elsewhere along the front lines: Maliar said ""troops continue offensive actions"" around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which has long served as a flashpoint in the conflict.

Kyiv's forces were making progress around the Berkhivka reservoir northwest of the city, and on two fronts south of the city, in one case advancing as much as 1,500 meters (around a mile), according to the deputy defense minister.

Earlier Sunday, other Ukrainian officials reported similar progress to the northwest and southwest of the city.

>Spy Ship Attacked: Russia Implies Ukrainian/NATO Threat To TurkStream Gas Pipeline


>There are reports from Russian sources claiming that the Black Sea Fleet Vishnya class Intelligence Ship Priazovye, was attacked by maritime drones (USVs). This happened in the Southeast Black Sea, in a similar area to where Russian intelligence ship Ivan Khurs attacked on May 24.

>From a defense analysis the attack is interesting, although all USVs (reportedly 6) are said to have been destroyed. However the claimed reason that she was there may be more significant.

>It is generally expected that Russian intelligence ships operating in this area, away from Ukrainian controlled coasts, are there to monitor NATO air assets. However the Russian reports claim a different purpose. She was apparently ""defending of Turk stream gas pipeline"" (and/or Blue Stream) 300km southeast of Sevastopol. Vishnya class intelligence ships are not well suited to protecting undersea infrastructure.

>The TurkStream pipeline is controversial because, like Nord Stream, it is seen as a way Russia can pipe gas to Europe without going via Ukraine. It also offers Turkey the potential to 'whitewash' Russian gas to obscure its origin. It is operated by Gazprom (Russian onshore section, offshore section) and BOTA≈û (Turkish onshore section)

>The inference is that Russia believes that it needs to defend the pipeline. Possibly from Ukrainian or NATO sabotage. This seems far-fetched.

>	Ukrainian forces are currently attempting an extraordinarily difficult tactical operation ‚Äì a frontal assault against prepared defensive positions, further complicated by a lack of air superiority ‚Äì and these initial assaults should not be extrapolated to predict all Ukrainian operations. Ukrainian forces are unsurprisingly taking casualties in initial attacks against some of the best-prepared Russian forces in Ukraine. However, initial attacks ‚Äì and particularly selected footage that Russian sources are intentionally disseminating and highlighting ‚Äì are not representative of all Ukrainian operations.

Another thing to remember is that Ukraine has to cede the information space to Russia in order  to not reveal the movement of their own troops. This means that Ukrainian losses will likely be overstated, while Russian losses will likely be understated. So please, only listen to official sources because there is a lot of dis/misinformation.

""There are few reports from the battlefields between the southern Zaporizhzhia region and Donetsk in the east Sunday morning but snippets from Russian journalists and propagandists suggest further Ukrainian offences, in particular to the south of the town of Velyka Novosilka. 

The Rybar Telegram channel reports Ukrainian forces regained control of two villages, Neskuchne and Blahodatne, ‚Äúalmost without a fight.‚Äù

In the same area, the Wargonzo Telegram channel reports ‚Äúcertain tactical successes‚Äù for Ukraine‚Äôs forces in the same area. A few kilometres further south, Rybar reports fighting around the village of Urozhaine.

Further west, there were consistent reports of very heavy Ukrainian artillery fire during Saturday towards Russian positions south of Orikhiv, where Ukrainian forces have also stepped up activities over the last week.

Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Defense had not issued any detailed statements Sunday on the latest fighting, while Ukraine‚Äôs latest General Staff report said only that Russian forces in the area were carrying out defensive operations.

CNN is unable to independently verify battlefield reports.

Some context: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave his clearest indication yet on Saturday that Ukraine‚Äôs long-awaited push to liberate territory still held by Russia‚Äôs occupying forces is underway, saying ‚Äúrelevant counteroffensive defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine.‚Äù

""The Russian ship Priazovye was attacked by six unmanned Ukrainian boats in the southeastern part of the Black Sea on Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement. 

The ship was not damaged and the drone boats were destroyed, according to the ministry. 

Video published on the ministry's Telegram channel purports to show the ship‚Äôs crew firing and hitting the approaching unmanned boats, as explosions are seen in the distance. 

CNN is not able to independently verify the ministry's claims or the authenticity of the video. 

A statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense said Priazovye was ""monitoring the situation and ensuring security on the routes of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipeline"" when it was attacked by ""six uncrewed surface vessels.""

""In the course of repulsing the attack, all the boats were destroyed by fire from the Russian ship's regular weapons 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) southeast of Sevastopol,"" the ministry said, adding there were no casualties. 

A similar incident took place on May 24, when Moscow claims three Ukrainian unmanned boats tried to attack the Russian ship Ivan Khurs, which was also monitoring the pipeline and Turkish route, according to Russian state news agency TASS. 

The drones were, likewise, destroyed by the ship‚Äôs standard weapons, according to TASS.""",False,1686507008.0,t3_146jx02,t3_146jx02,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-11-23/index.html

""The International Criminal Court has begun an investigation into the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address Sunday.

The collapse in southern Ukraine is one of the biggest industrial and ecological disasters in Europe for decades. The catastrophe has destroyed entire villages, flooded farmland, deprived tens of thousands of people of power and clean water, and caused massive environmental damage.

‚ÄúIn recent days, representatives of the ICC visited Kherson region,‚Äù Zelensky said. ‚ÄúOn the very first day after the disaster, the prosecutor general sent a request to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC to investigate the disaster, and the work has already begun.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is very important that the representatives of international justice have seen the consequences of this Russian act of terrorism with their own eyes and heard for themselves that Russian terror continues,‚Äù Zelensky said. ‚ÄúAnd it continues with the most cynical and brutal shelling of the flooded territory, the evacuation area.‚Äù

Key context: Kyiv and Moscow each blame the other for causing the dam breach, although it is unclear whether the dam was deliberately attacked at all, or if the collapse was the result of structural failure.

Russia and Ukraine have also accused one another of shelling during the effort to evacuate civilians from areas they control ‚Äî sometimes with deadly consequences.

More from Zelensky: The Ukrainian president said his government is facilitating the ICC investigation by providing ‚Äúfull access to the affected areas, to witnesses, to all information and evidence.‚Äù 

Zelensky also said his government has helped evacuate 4,000 people from flooded areas in southern Ukraine, ‚Äúwith the worst situation still in the temporarily occupied part of Kherson region.‚Äù

Russian state news agency TASS, meanwhile, reported that Russian Emergency Services have evacuated about 7,000 people from areas it controls.

""Rail traffic in Crimea was suspended for a few hours Sunday after a line in the east of the Russian-annexed peninsula was damaged, according to the territory‚Äôs Russian-installed head Sergiy Aksenov.

Aksenov did not give any details on what caused the damage but did say there were no casualties. Unconfirmed local reports said there was an explosion. 

Some context: Rail lines in Crimea are key to supplying Russia‚Äôs war effort and have been targeted on several occasions by Ukraine, most recently a week ago in an attempted drone strike on the railway junction at Dzhankoi.

Kherson/Kharkiv Offensives ended because of rivers getting in the way, for Russians the river was a godsend.  They were able to escape across them relatively quickly (but suffered huge losses doing so).

For THIS offensive, they dont have that option.  They will have to either retreat west towards Melitopol where they will immediately be cut off from the rest of the Russian forces, sea routes being the only supply line or...

East, towards Makivka/Donetsk where there are already huge concentrations of Russian troops - with Ukrainians on their tail.  Over population of troops will become an enormous issue for the Russians in these areas as Ukraine will have far superior firing positions with easy pickins.  


I dont think they will retreat towards Mariupol to stage a defense, its just not a great position  

I think they will go east - and probably try to abandon the entire area west of Donetsk.  Many will be left behind and trapped in the west around Melitopol by Ukranian Forces - resulting in the first mass capture of troops of the war.  


I dont believe the Russians have the capability to facilitate the mass evacuation of troops by sea at the moment either so - shucks for them.

Ukraine has taken a village some hundreds of kilometres east of Zaporizhiye, somewhere north-west of Mariupol. The penetration is reportedly about 10km deep in places.  
  
Russian convoys seen going up in flames here and there due to HIMARS, Excalibur and Storm Shadow strikes. I did predict the Ukrainians would be saving up all their artillery stockpiles for this attack near Zaporizhiye and it looks like I was right. They are going to wreak an awful toll on the Russians in the weeks to come.  
  
Some gains reportedly made by the Ukrainians around the flanks of Bakhmut.  
  
Although it is obvious that the first attack with the Bradley group failed, it seems that in some places, at least, Ukrainian assault tactics are working well. We also have footage today of a trench assault taking place. Ukrainians seem to be good at trench assaults from what I can tell. The difficulty for them is often in getting there, particularly over open fields with a few vehicles for support and cover. I tend to think that a thick blanket of artillery would be helpful in this situation but it's not clear they have the ammunition for that. What is clear to me is that the Russians have reacted swiftly to this offensive, but that they are facing the same problem the Germans did in Normandy, in that their reserves are being targeted while moving up to the front. Russian artillery kills as well as Ukrainian, but the difference in precision and range has been growing greater and greater throughout the war. I think that will give Ukraine an advantage over the longer term.  
  
This battle could turn out to be a slog, in which case the first one to run out of materials will crack. If Ukraine can seize all the Russian defensive lines even in only one part of the front, they can then break through to the rear and unhinge their whole position - if they have enough armoured reserves.

You could do some decent damage to a trench line with either rocket, but given that the HIMARS out-ranges the tube artillery and Russian-based GMLRS systems like the Grad, HIMARS would more likely be used to strike deeper targets such as HQs, artillery emplacements and other deeper positioned targets of opportunities. Plus, it takes a more effort and time to reload the HIMARS, since the rocket packs are bulky and heavy enough to require heavy-lift equipment and larger supply vehicles to carry them.

Big blocks of concrete are quite resistant to being blown up. And while bridges will have weak points that are more vulnerable, you really need to attack those points specifically. 

One approach is to use a really big fucking bomb, which seems to have been the case before. Put it in a truck and you know it will be on the roadway, and hope it goes off somewhere near some weak point for extra damage. Dumb bombs dropped from the sky don't work because exploding next to a concrete block generally doesn't hurt the block. You have to be right there. Guided bombs with huge metal penetrators work because they pierce the concrete before exploding and turn the big block into many little ones that cannot hold up a bridge. But you need a bomber for that.

Alternately, you can have a team place explosives exactly where they need to be, as in a controlled demolition. You don't even need a lot of explosives, sometimes, if you can wrap them around certain bolts, cables and pins to make the whole engineering untenable.

So missiles, even precision-guided ones, aren't a good fit for this. You need lots of bomb stuff, which is heavy and you need to fly it there in the missile. Heavy metal penetrators are similarly problematic. And precision guidance can be used to make sure you hit the bridge, but isn't generally accurate enough to make sure you hit the bridge exactly *there* at a specific weak point. 

Bridges are huge and absurdly strong. They'll figure out a way, but it won't be easy, and possibly be novel and devious and unexpected.

It is great that you have not been colored by the views here. Some redditors here were too over optimistic and colored by the Russian failures of the past.

Ukrainian artillery both outranges and outmaneuvers Russian artillery and will be able to kill Russian artillery over time.

That means Ukraine is maintaining its artillery advantage in mobility and outranging and out-killing Russian artillery.

Now, if Ukraine is able to kill a good portion of Russian AA, especially with long range standoff strikes from Storm Shadow or HIMARS, while denying use of airspace for the Russians, the tactical air superiority can tip in favor of Ukraine. If they can do that the battles will move much faster for Ukraine.

Edit: I am not sure about the veracity of the claims of villages, but the idea that Ukraine will need to fight hard for to breach lines is correct.

The accuracy of that number is questionable, because russia has warehouses all over their country, and maybe even they don't know what they have lying around there. How much can be directly sent to the front, how much needs repair and how much can just be used for spare parts is another question.

* UAF keep their own losses closely guarded for strategic and political reasons. Even claims for Russian losses don't go into further detail and accuracy to not tell how much they know exactly.

* Western intelligence are very conservative in their estimates and rarely release meaningful numbers as a political favor to Ukraine for morale and OpSec. Also due to them working together.

* Independent journalists like Oryx do their best to work on publicly available material, but have large blind spots regarding stuff going on further behind the front lines and all of the footage withheld for tactical reasons.

While these are real parts of the counteroffensive plan, I suspect Ukraine is still holding the bulk of their new units in reserve waiting for an opportunity. I think their idea is to pursue a Kherson like grind to force the front lines to move where they want them and pressure Russia to move their reserves where they want them.

As to your first point, I don‚Äôt think Ukraine has a manpower shortage, if anything they have an advantage. Also, the Ukrainian military has shown that they‚Äôre capable of changing the axis of attack based on ground reports (at least far better than the Russians, who rely on a more centralised command structure), meaning that they need less troops aswell. The fact that they haven‚Äôt deployed the majority of their forces suggests that they will launch their largests assaults once these smaller probing missions identify weak Russian positions. 

>	point i was trying to make is i‚Äôd rather have seen them ball up and train up until russia can take literally not another inch from them no matter how hard they try, then watch them go on the attack.

I doubt Ukraine wants to do this, as no movement on the frontlines means they won‚Äôt be in the headlines, and because Ukraine relies heavily on western support this would mean they get less aid packages.

I'm sure it's a lot more complex than that and I'm vastly oversimplifying here, but if it is how you say, once you have only a few radar pings you can basically calculate a parabola and get a pretty good estimate where the missile will be when. That's senior highschool math.

How could they possibly think this would be a good idea? No wonder Putin is upset with his scientists lol.

The chips are then reprocessed (pins straightened, tinned to hide pin damage, top ground down and relabeled, so called ""black top"") into ""new"" (if you have a dishonest vendor) or ""recycled"" chips (if you have a more honest one)

These chips have a high failure rate for the following reasons:

1. The recovery process is crude, using primitive tools and optimized for quick retrieval rather than particular care. This may damage the chip.

2. Sometimes the chip is relabeled (with black top, see above) in a fraudulent manner to increase profit: Slow memory is relabeled as fast memory, lower spec chips are labeled as higher spec ones. This effectively ""overclocks"" the chips when used as labeled, which may work, or not.

To see an example of how this looks:
https://yewtu.be/watch?v=5vN_7NJ4qYA

For hobbyists these chips can actually be ok since they are a lot cheaper and it doesn't matter if half fail, you are still ahead, but in a professional environment this would be a disaster.

Lastly, there are genuinely fake chips, for example, a local Chinese chipmaker producing a knockoff versions of high-quality brand name manufacturers like Linear Technologies or Analog Devices. The resulting chips can be a hit or miss: Sometimes they work, seldom they don't work at all, a lot of times they work for a while and then fail, or fail under certain conditions where the original product wouldn't.

Attacking through fortified areas has  a much worse kill ratio (in both equipment and people) than defending through those same areas.  But you can make all that back if you get a route somehow.  The Kharkiv offensive is a great example of this - tons of armor was left behind, and thousands of russians killed or captured, even during a fairly ordered hasty retreat by ru forces from Izium.

Taking territory has advantages, sometimes strategic (providing avenues for further attack or cutting off other areas), economic (the Kharkiv offensive lifted the siege of Kharkiv and allowed some to return to the city), or humanitarian (many torture chambers were shut down).  But the actual amount of territory that's been exchanged since ~October is very small.

Interestingly it sounds like Ukraine might be achieving a good kill ratio even on the offense here.  They never release numbers on people, but we've seen many dead russians while russian telegram has not shown many dead Ukrainians.  Equipment trades are less meaningful since the combined economies supporting Ukraine's are so much larger than russia's - but just trading 1-1 in monetary value of the equipment involved should be a win, and it seems like the ratio is more like 5:1 on the tanks (though it's hard to compare the value of older Leopard 2s versus much-much-older T62s being pulled out of stockpiles, nominally the Leopard is 2x the cost though).",False,1686534499.0,t3_146jx02,t1_jnulye3,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

If you look at the second last figure, the thing marked as ""1"" is the sluiceway. It is basically a dam within a dam, 46 meters wide, 21 meters high, and made out of concrete. It is so massive that it's unlikely it got destroyed.

There's a ""but"", unfortunately. If you look at the last figure, that's the turbine section. If the turbine flow parh is damaged and open it can be releasing water at a low point. It's hard to tell how much water is getting through there, if we are lucky it could be only enough to maintain the normal flow rate of the Dnieper.

What Germany did was a risky maneuver where they decided to mass all their available tanks into one single formation and send them ahead of their horse supply lines. This had never been attempted before, especially at such a huge scale. The Allies did not think it would be possible for several hundred tanks to get through a forest so quickly, and then for those tanks to outrun their supply convoys for several straight days.

It only took the Allies a day or so to realize what had happened, but their own formations were slow to respond to because they did not realize quite how many German tanks had made it through. The narrative that they never saw the maneuver coming, however, is a falsity that has been mythologized. Bunching up all of the German armor into a single formation that was detached from its supply sources was an extremely dangerous move that had higher odds of blowing up in their faces than working for them, but Hitler favored daring options in the winter of 1940 when it looked very plausible that the war was about to bog down in Trench World War Two against France again. They took a huge gamble, and it paid off because, frankly, the Allies didn't think the Germans would be that insanely reckless. When the Germans reattempted the same strategies in later engagements, it didn't work as well.

There really isn't an applicable comparison here to the Southern Ukraine front. The defenses in Southern Ukraine are not nearly as extensive as the Maginot Line, but they are still quite tough, and there is no clear alternative option for bypassing them. The Ukrainians instead have to find locality-sized weak spots that are undermanned, using costly trial-and-error probing attacks that measure the strength of Russian resistance, and then they have to react quickly to the unexpected weakly manned area and flood that area with reserves before the Russians can bring up their own reserves to plug the hole.

The Russian defenses are designed for this. They know in advance that they can't station full-strength units everywhere on the front (and they wouldn't want to -- that would be a stupid way to get their strongest formations destroyed on the front line). They are holding most of their manpower and armor back behind the first and second lines of fortifications and wheeling them over to detected Ukrainian breakthroughs only after the Ukrainians discover a weak spot.

This isn't a contest of one side outsmarting the other. Both sides know exactly what the other is *trying* to do, and why they are trying to do it that way. This is about, first of all, speed: which side can *react* to unexpected weak points and flush in their reserves in time before the other side? And second, it's about endurance: which side can outlast the other with artillery fire superiority? Making a breakthrough is mostly pointless if you don't have enough artillery ammunition to destroy the enemy's approaching reserve artillery.",1686496494.0,1686494740.0,t3_146jx02,t1_jns6q1y,,4,15,0,15,0,0,

In an entire kilometer stretch, there are sometimes only 20 to 50 people manning the trenches. That's sometimes as little as two to three dudes in a trench the length of a football field. In WW1 a football-field-length trench would have had 1 to 200 men in it.

The whole idea is elastic defense. You keep your beefier forces to the rear and deploy them on an as-needed basis, wherever the enemy is thickest. The same goes for your artillery.

Even as a high school teacher, which I'd need another 10-15k student loan for, I'd be struggling to break even for the first four to five years of teaching, eating the cheapest food I can find and constantly freaking out about my budget. I can basically forget any hope of owning my own home.

Here, I'm already living in an owned apartment. I live 15 mins from the city centre by transport, but I can walk there in 30 mins as well if I'm in the mood. Buses come every 10 mins, metro trains every 2-3 mins. There is really no need for a car at all. I save around 50 percent of my salary each month, and I'd save a lot more if I didn't eat out restaurants or bakeries every other day. Also the cultural life here is on a level I couldn't even imagine in NZ - I'm a big fan of museums and classical music, and Petersburg is really top of the line for that stuff. 

So yeah, while NZ certainly isn't impossible, it's just a massive downgrade from what I've been living in for ten years. You're right that the freedom of speech thing is worrying, but apart from reddit I don't use any social media, and I don't really discuss politics with anyone, so the only danger probably is if the Kremlin wants to give a middle finger to New Zealand lol.

And sure, you can use smaller forward groups just for early warnings, and drones probably count for a lot, but at some point just mines and artillery aren't going to finish the job, so you need actual defensive troops there too.

Part of defense in depth is to be reactive to the enemy, but that doesn't mean you dont build defensive structures - sure a trench can be seen by satellite and targeted by drones, but it's damn way safer being a trench when under artillery fire than out in the open. And trenches are just one part of a defense in depth, the reserve units are the other part, and the idea is to be flexible and responsive. But not building trenches is just dumb, soldiers out in the open are even more vulnerable to drones and atillery.

Also a defensive web is in no way static. You have static positions, such as hills, forests, villages and fortifications where your troops will have an advantage over the enemy and you want to hold them there. But you will have units that will move to counterattack, units that attempt to reinforce, units that attempt to attack the sides of the enemy line.

And finally satellites are great, but again both sides have them, and aerial recon was already an extensive feature of combat since WWI. Drones are a lot more unique in this war due to giving frontline troops realtime aerial views of the combat area, but if these things were so crazily revolutionary, why are both sides having such a difficult time advancing? In many ways it seems to have battles a lot more lopsided towards the side that has the ability to overwatch the enemy with drones - what might before just be a tank driving into a mine and then being towed away will now very quickly devolve into multiple drones overwatching artillery fire and ripping apart the other vehicles in a column, while a trench that might before have been unbreachable by light units will now be harassed by drones before being stormed by infantry. But notice in a lot of the footage - the trenches are still stormed by infantry fighting extremely close quarters, even the video with the Humvees from a few days ago, the Ukranian infantry flushed out the enemy with hand grenades and gunfire, not with drones and artillery. And that one went well for the Ukranians, but I can show you dozens of videos where they would get picked off by a single soldier in good cover.

And if the situation with the attack where Ukraine lost a few Leopards and Bradleys played out as stated, Russia conducted a perfectly exectued defense in depth operaton, letting the enemy penetrate and absorb the shock, then counterattack with reserves. Sure, it might be an anomaly with a well trained Russian unit, but it could also be something that other units can do and we can't be sure how successful Ukranian operations will be just because they take a few villages in the first days.

Basically what I'm trying to say is wait a bit. Ukraine is doing well overall, but you can't count on anything this quickly.",1686494095.0,1686493360.0,t3_146jx02,t1_jns54nf,,5,6,0,6,0,0,

Extortion is clearly defined and he tried it.

Edit - Seems u/shadowsiege is so cofnident in his point he's done the Reply and Block.  So to reply to his post here.

People really should listen to the call.

If they are really that delusional after hearing the attempted extortion, there's not much that can be done for them.  That's the modern age, there is reality and then there are people who insist on a world of Alternative Facts.

If there's not enough water where it needs to be, as tends to happen when pipes are blown up by lunatics placing explosives in nuclear reactor facilities, those fuel rods are going to overheat, and then they're going to melt down through the bottom of the core. It may not necessarily lead to an containment breaching explosion, but it (""mines"") could very well lead to meltdowns. There are 6 reactors at ZNPP.


Fukushima was a different reactor design but the basic principles of how nuclear meltdowns can occur is the same :

I would also direct you to this quote from a Ukrainian nuclear engineer giving an interview to the Guardian - 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea

>‚ÄúAbsence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,‚Äù he warned.

>Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. ‚ÄúIf the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there‚Äôs no guarantee they won‚Äôt blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined ‚Äì three of the six,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.‚Äù

No, it wouldn't be a Chernobyl open air reactor catastrophic explosion, but it could still cause meltdowns and be a horrific disaster.",1686525374.0,1686524853.0,t3_146jx02,t1_jnu6612,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
