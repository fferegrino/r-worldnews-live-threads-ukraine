- Kakhovka
- Oleshky
- Velyka Lepetykha
- Hornostaivka
- Rubinavka
- Skadovsk
- Askaniya-Nova
- Novotroiske

Ukraine is absolutely determined to rattle Russian troops in this area.

The artillery on both sides is currently exchanging fire, but the Russian response seems to be limited at the Dnipro area while Ukrainians fire far beyond horizon. I doubt that Russians expected that and it will lead to forcing them to redistribute more troops to Kherson oblast.

**Yaakov Kedmi**: About what you said, I disagree on two points.  It's obscene, it's not constructive, it's criminal to bomb peaceful cities.  These words, ""To wipe Kyiv and Kharkiv off the face of the Earth"".  There were no wars in history where the bombing of a peaceful city, of a civilian population ever led to some kind of results on the battlefield.  Would they be deterred by that?  When did it ever happen?  It didn't happen in any war.

**Solovyov**: Fine. Then we'll keep responding on the level of a girl in the 5th grade whose crying that our peaceful cities are being bombed.

**Kedmi:** I didn't say that...  But it's not an option to bomb a peaceful city and its population.

**Solovyov**: We will first warn the civilians to leave.

**Kedmi**: You can't bomb peaceful cities!  These things shouldn't even be uttered!  To wipe a city off the face of the Earth is obscene.  It shouldn't be uttered!  There are 1001 ways to fight without touching civilians.

Day 272 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another very quiet day; we had no missile strikes or drones. The weirdest part is that we had no air raid alerts in over 49 hours, which is basically unheard of. This is probably the longest interval we had between alerts since the war started, before that the longest one was about 25 hours. 

Though honestly there should have been an air raid alert yesterday when the missile launches from Belgorod were happening, but for some reason there wasn’t one. And actually not that long ago some more missile/AA launches were sighted in Belgorod, but that didn’t trigger our air raid alert either. I hope it’s not broken, because relying solely on civilians to report missile launches is not very reliable, radars are much better suited for it.

Russian propagandists continue to threaten every country they are supposedly “friendly” with. They threatened to “de-Nazify” Kazakhstan on their main TV channels now, and in some telegram channels they also call for preventive strikes on Armenia because they are protesting against Russia/CSTO today. I mean people might think they are joking, but they aren’t. We were also laughing at them for 8 years since 2014, thinking they were joking about attacking us, but then they actually did it and it wasn’t as funny after that.

Keep in mind I don't know anything, particularly the critical, on-the-ground intel.

I've written about their options before and have largely been vindicated.

The two strategic offensive areas that have potential are the East and the South. The East of Kharkiv and South to Melitopol.

There is always the outside chance of the South West, East of Kherson but I would argue that's hard to do when factoring in the Dnieper River.

Strategically, considering Kherson; Melitopol remains the logical decision.

However, Crimea is a hard nut to crack and heading East and collapsing the so-called 'Republics' is a good choice too.

My money would be on breaking the entire Southern theatre sooner rather than later and then dealing with the breakaways, then Crimea.

The new Russian government cooperates completely with the investigations of the Hague into Russian War Crimes and departs all those suspected of such crimes (past and present) to the Hague to face trial and punishment if found guilty.

Russia admits its provocation of the war and rescinds all claims to Ex-Soviet nations and Ex-Imperial nations.

The amount of money loaned to Russia through the plan is no more than 75% of that loaned to Ukraine for its rebuilding. Russia started this war and caused this destruction to both Ukraine and itself. They will not get additional assistance without further concessions. 

Optional concessions for further assistance: 

Russia hands over its entire nuclear stockpile for dismantling by the IAEA

Russia promises to pay reparations to Ukraine within 100 years time. (I'm not including this in the original plan as it seems counterintuitive to give someone money on the condition they pay that back to another person. The hope here being Russia rebuilds enough in 25 years to be able to repay Ukraine for the next 75.)

They're claiming the story got published because he mislead the editors into thinking his sources had been vetted by the news managers - it doesn't look that way at all.  Secondly, AP sourcing standards explicitly require at least 2 different anonymous sources for a story - a story can never rely on a single anonymous source.  They clearly went with this story knowing it was based on information from a single source.

https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/telling-the-story/anonymous-sources

>**Reporters who intend to use material from anonymous sources must get approval from their news manager before sending the story to the desk. The manager is responsible for vetting the material and making sure it meets AP guidelines. The manager must know the identity of the source, and is obligated, like the reporter, to keep the source's identity confidential. Only after they are assured that the source material has been vetted by a manager should editors and producers allow it to be used.**


edit:  And the idea that the editors would publish this story WITHOUT CHECKING THEMSELVES if the news manager had actually vetted it, just asking the reporter over slack, is beyond ridiculous.  They could have triggered a major international incident.

It's also of note that these frames ar more durable, have better cross section, have better countermeasures.

Once the missile approaches coordinates it activates radar homing and zeroes into any radar.

Same with Brimstone UA can only use it in test mode because they can only launch it from ground which means that instead of 70km+ range and a seek and destroy mode they can use only LR mode and the range is usually less than 15km.

Another thing is air is NATOs game. There's not a lot of M30/M31 stock for HiMARS/M270 because  it was never to be the main play. But for air there's a fuck ton of missiles and they get more and more absurd in their capabilities.",False,1669115739.0,t3_z1jsm5,t1_ixc5ttx,,1,35,0,35,0,0,

f9e9de9b53c9f6472a84a26127756d69,z1jsm5,ixfvs10,"After forcing Russian troops to retreat from the city of Kherson two weeks ago, Ukrainian special forces are now battling the Russians on the islands and in marshes to the southwest, trying to push them out of a strategically vital peninsula at the mouth of the Dnipro River where it meets the Black Sea.

The fighting is focused on the Kinburn Spit, on the east bank of the Dnipro River, Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday. For tourists who have visited the sliver of land, the spit is a place of rare natural beauty, but it could also prove pivotal to the next phase of the country’s war against Moscow.


Russia took control of the peninsula in June in one of its last notable advances in the south before it was forced onto the defensive by a sustained Ukrainian counteroffensive. Two weeks ago, the Kremlin ordered a retreat from the city of Kherson, on the west bank of the Dnipro, but military experts said it would fight tenaciously to keep control of Kinburn.

Control of the peninsula allows Russia to project force deeper into the Black Sea, guard routes to the ports in Mykolaiv and Kherson and protect its forces in Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. If Ukraine were to take Kinburn, it would put key Russian supply lines running north out of Crimea in easy range of Ukrainian weapon systems.

In addition, Russian forces on the spit can launch missiles at the port city of Odesa, around 40 miles to the west, as well as the city of Mykolaiv, a similar distance to the northeast, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a military research group. By the same token, military experts say that if Ukraine can seize the spit, it could outflank Russian forces still establishing defensive positions east of the Dnipro.

“This specific bit of sandy territory becomes hugely significant because it’s a door to the Southern Bug and the Dnipro and it’s a gate out into the Black Sea,” said Rory Finnin, an associate professor of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Cambridge and the author of a book about Crimea’s history.

Vitaly Kim, head of the military administration in the Mykolaiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces were making progress on Kinburn Spit. Ukrainian forces control the town of Ochakiv, less than three miles to the north across the water and well within artillery range.

Russian military bloggers have claimed in recent days that Russian forces have repelled attacks on the cape, while the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern military command, Nataliya Gumenyuk, told journalists, after the fall of Kherson, that the spit was the next objective.

At its tip, the Kinburn Spit is a strip of sand a few feet across, lapped by waves. Tourist guides speak of its sunsets and the area is known for its bird life — flamingos are sometimes sighted — and for its marshy woods. One is named after the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote about the area.

During the Crimean War, in 1855, the navies of Britain and France destroyed a Russian fortress on the peninsula, while a fierce battle took place there in 1787, as the Ottoman Empire attempted to regain land lost to the Russian Empire.

Mr. Finnin argued that the current fighting over Kinburn was a sign that Russia’s retreat in the Kherson region made Moscow’s control of Crimea “hugely insecure.” Historically, the arid Crimean Peninsula and the more fertile land to the north have never been divided between competing powers for long.

“If they are able to claim the spit it will have a lot of consequences for them in defeating Russia,” Mr. Finnin said of Ukrainian forces.

In late October, Russian media showed images of concrete blocks that it said were being trucked to Kinburn for defensive fortifications. A few days later, a video circulated online that appeared to show the only Ukrainian amphibious assault ship reported to have survived the Russian invasion, the Yuri Olefirenks, launching rockets at Russian positions there.

But with that said the chip shortage is real and ongoing.  What happened is all these Manufacturers of cars and washing machines and other gizmos canceled their chip orders at the beginning of the pandemic.  Some of those orders were for standardized chips, but many of them were custom.  So the chip Manufacturers quickly retooled to make whatever orders they could fill, which at the time were GPUs and ASICS for crypto.  And they made a lot of money even with lower production.

Generally speaking, most manufacturers don’t want to piss off existing customers because they see them as long term investments.  Once those orders were cancelled, all these gizmo manufacturers were dropped from the ‘existing customer’ status that allowed them to keep their orders fulfilled 

So now, those gizmo manufacturers are struggling to get those chip manufacturers off producing the very profitable chipsets and back to their dull and standardized chipsets.

Tanks are also immune to snipers (Bradleys can be taken out by anti-material rifles due to their aluminum armor).

Tanks also have a 120mm gun, which is more useful than the 30mm gun a Braldey has when assaulting bunkers / entrenched positions. Having 40-shots of a 120mm gun that fires at Mach 5 is more useful than 6-shots of a smaller rocket launcher that fires at Mach 1 to 2.

Tanks are glass cannons (that happen to be immune to a lot of weapons). Their offensive power is what defines them on the modern battlefield, not their armor... strangely enough.

-----------

The 30mm gun is faster firing though and has like 800 rounds of ammunition IIRC? That's more useful vs trenches IIRC, as airburst rounds / airburst machine gun reaches into trenches. It also makes Bradleys better for suppressive  fire and some other fire missions.

Yeah so this exact same situation happened in 1991. Guess what, they got monetary aid to maintain their nuclear weapons. This was done to prevent nuclear proliferation, because the fear was that the corrupt officials might sell or give nuclear weapons to emerging factions in broken up USSR.

>At that point, do you really believe they'd hold up to weapons that would rot in a weapons cache and living in bankruptcy vs giving up this money sinkhole to live in a decent country.

What do you think will happen to nuclear weapons when a corrupt commander no longer has to answer to any one above him because the Russian government has broken apart? Remember these are the same officials that embezzled funds meant for Russia's military *before* the Ukrainian invasion.

Is there not a reasonable fear that these nuclear weapons might fall into the hands of some organization that is worse than the current Russian government?

If not, what is different this time around compared to 1991?

>There's a long way until it comes but to be clear, once it get there.. Russia won't have much to bargain with. Think of it like an offer you can't refuse kind of thing.

But what happens if they do refuse? Russian economy collapses, Russian quality of life drops like a rock?

It seems it seems it went all fine for Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus. 

It's a lot of speculation but understand that nuclear weapons will be the least of the worries in Moscow when all the resources fuelling their economy will be gone, the production capability of military equipment will be gone while the Moscow region barely has anything to offer now that the Europe is moving to renewable energies and ditching Russian gas.
