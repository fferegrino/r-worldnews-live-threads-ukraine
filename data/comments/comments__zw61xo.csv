Early April - Russia retreats from Kyiv and redeploys forces to try fully capture Donbas.

Mid April - Russia attacks Kreminna (1) and captures it. They continue their attack on Sievierodonetsk.

Russians realize their strength is in their artillery and zerg rushing the enemy.

Early May - Russia attacks Rubizhne (2) (located north west of Sievierodonetsk) and captures it. This allows Russia to heavily focus on Sievierodonetsk with lots of artillery.

Russia also concludes the Mariupol siege. They suffered heavy losses in Mariupol but still redeploy to Sievierodonetsk.

Mid to Late June - Ukraine withdraws from Sievierodonetsk (3) and Lysychansk (4) under heavy fire, Russia now focuses on Bakhmut (5).

Ukraine was criticized for staying in Sievierodonetsk for longer than they should have, but I think it was the right call because it stalled the Russians enough to allow for the arrival of Western artillery, all while inflicting heavy losses.

June/July - M777, M270 and HIMARS introduces themselves, wipes out Russian ammunition depots and supply lines everywhere, causing ammunition starvation.

16th June - Ground footage of a Ukrainian Tochka-U wiping out a very large ammunition depot at Krasny Luch.

Bakhmut (5) and Siversk frontline stalls heavily from here onwards, while Western artillery destroys the entire Russian strategy.

September - Kharkiv counteroffensive before winter effectively renders Bakhmut (5) a less meaningful target. Russia now mass mobilizes for the war.

October - Crimean bridge explosion exacerbates supply issues in the south of Ukraine and Crimea.

November - Russia retreats from Kherson, both sides redeploy to the other fronts.

December - We come full circle for the Russians in Kreminna (1).

Ukraine can potentially threaten the entire north Luhansk area if Kreminna (1) is captured or somehow bypassed. This includes the Sievierodonetsk area (2, 3, 4), Svatove, Starobilsk and even Luhansk itself. This would also likely collapse the Bakhmut (5) offensive.

It seems likely that Ukraine will fight very well in the heavily forested areas around Sievierodonetsk in 2023. They will likely capture it like the Russians did back in June, if things go according to plan.",False,1672115363.0,t3_zw61xo,t3_zw61xo,,0,80,0,80,0,0,

Putin.

On December 26, the FSB announced the murder of four Ukrainians who allegedly tried to enter the territory of the Bryansk region in order to carry out ""sabotage and terrorist acts.""

The Russian intelligence service reported that the dead had foreign weapons, in particular SIG Sauer submachine guns, communication and navigation devices, and four bombs with a total capacity of about 40 kg of TNT.


The FSB also made public the data of the Ukrainians. The secret service reported that while trying to enter Russian territory, the following were killed [below].

The death of Ukrainian servicemen was subsequently confirmed by a fighter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Yevgeny Karas. From the photographs released by the Russians, he concluded [his opinion] that the group had entered a minefield. This is not confirmation. Karas shared his memories of the dead. [in italics]

- Yuri Gorovets, born in 1988, call sign ""Svyatosha"", the Russians called him the group commander;  *""A successful saboteur. This was far from his first reconnaissance mission. The Russians paid a terrible price [ie, we will avenge] ... Patriot. Christian. Actor. Traveler. Veteran. Long-term member of the Brotherhood community of Dmitry Korchinsky*."" 

- Maksim Mikhailov, born in 1990, call sign ""Nepiypivo""; “*Cossack. Cheerful but fearless. Kind but courageous. Forever young, a provocateur of Korchinsky. Tender, but with a twinkle in his eyes. A romantic who lit stars with a fire over the occupied territories of Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod.“*

- Taras Karpyuk, born in 1984, call sign ""Tarasy"";  *“Taras was a real warrior. Taras was a true soldier...It is not surprising that he was one of the first to go to war in 2014. He was wounded in close contact with the enemy near Ilovaisk. Separatists shot at Taras from a distance of 15m, missing him, ended up in a store with tracers. They caught fire and began to explode. He was treated for a long time. After the start of the full-scale war, he went to the front. Saint. A true patriot, fought them before it became popular. He fought in Ilovaisk in 2014 and defended Mariupol. It was he who led our group that entered enemy territory.”*

- Bogdan Lyagov, born in 2003, call sign Apollo. *“From the beginning of the war, this 19-year-old guy began to fight. He immediately volunteered for a sabotage group. You can imagine the number of successful operations since February ... The guy is extremely brave. He always volunteered— difficult missions, but ""Apollo"" was happy. He was considered brilliantly capable, because he showed some of the best results in physical and tactical training. the very fact that a 19-year-old young man went behind enemy lines is admirable.""*


*“All the best. All my friends. All of them died with weapons in their hands behind enemy lines. Everyone fought anti-Ukrainian shit! Honor! Let's take revenge!”*

> *Dec 25:* Russian officers in East gave us conflicting information. RF HQ clarified that there was no connection with units south of Svatovo, and it was impossible to say exactly what was happening there. 

> *Dec 26, AM:*  Ukrainian officers reported:  that it was too early to talk about the encirclement of Svatovo, but UA northern outskirts of Kremennaya, continued to move around Svatovo. Svatovo locals reported that shooting, artillery fire were heard *around* the city, but calm *in* the city. 

> *Dec 26, PM:* Russian sources, Luhansk HQ: the situation in the Svatovo-Kremennaya sector difficult for RF army; command & control broken, no communication; impossible to establish what is happening, surmise UA trying to move forward. One source at the group's HQ: if the Ukrainian army could move east of Svatovo and cut off the road to Starobilsk, there will be a risk of collapse of the Russian defenses in this area. 

> Then will need trained infantry to avoid a repetition of the Sept scenario near Balakleya, Izyum, Kupyansk. 

> > “In the Starobelsky direction, we have unfired motorized rifles from the mobilized. If there is a threat of a breakthrough, then the holes will need to be quickly closed by trained units. I won’t be surprised if they rush to return those who were sent to Belarus a month ago,” says the Russian staff officer [at Luhansk HQ].

> *Analysis:* While little is known about the UA offensive in the Kremennaya-Svatovo area, the fact that it began on the *afternoon* of Dec 25, *before* the expected offensive of the RF on Volyn [from the North], may indicate an attempt by UA command to ‘seize the initiative’ from RF, forcing them to change their plans.  A similar situation occurred at the end of August in the Kherson and Kharkov regions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine again demonstrate the ability to quickly respond to the situation on the fronts, and the Russian command once again shows the inability to plan their operations, taking into account the actions of the enemy. 

> The likelihood of a Russian attack on Volyn remains, despite the change or disruption of the deadlines indicated by our sources [of Dec 25-26].

Automatic seekers are required, because the assets are not static. This is the difference between Iranian Shaheds, which can only hit buildings or similar structures.

There were 2 almost simultaneous explosions on separate locations, something that is difficult to do if you are flying in the targets with multiple drones.

bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,zw61xo,j1ww1vy,"This video illustrates why Ukraine is winning this war. The story is about the power of NCO decision making, precision long range munitions, and real time intelligence.

Russias military doctrine is to “combine arms” by saturating the frontline with artillery and then moving forward with men, tanks and armoured vehicles. Troop movement and goals are on a map and predetermined.

This tactic creates and reinforces the existence of a frontline. Even Russia’s “surprise attacks” are telegraphed by an hour or so of shelling beforehand. Everyone knows where the strikes are happening. There is a specific “meat grinder” area. It doesn’t require anything to win except larger scale men, artillery and equipment.

Russia does to long range strikes, but they are mostly against fixed civilian and infrastructure targets. This is presumably because of a lack of real time intelligence on Ukraine’s military deployment and relatively poor accuracy of long range munitions.

Ukraine’s doctrine is very different. 

Firstly, front lines are usually for defence. The grinder isn’t seen as an opportunity to gain territory, rather as a way to deplete the enemy.

Ukrainian troop movement in offence is largely for reconnaissance. They use force to gain information about Russia. To all purposes these are attacks, but the goal is different. They identify a trench and then back off. There is no rushing trenches unless they are perceived to be vulnerable or compromised for some reason. The goal is information, rather than land.

You can’t do this with a centralised command structure. For reconnaissance in force, the decision maker has to be physically there and deciding whether to turn left or right. As you could imagine this real time decision making by NCOs on the small scale saves A LOT of casualties for Ukraine. Russia effectively does not have this.

Ukraine’s second advantage is intelligence. Intelligence. This comes in three forms. Satellite and spy stuff from the West, infantry and special ops reconnaissance, and extensive partisan networks in Russian territory. The important thing is this information is largely REAL TIME. 

This approach works perfectly with Ukraine’s third advantage. Ukraine’s only area of military superiority over Russia is precision long range artillery. HIMARS are no better than any normal MRLS if you don’t know where to fire down to the metre.

The way Ukraine uses these three advantages essentially dissolves the Russian “front line”. Russians are getting hit everywhere. 

Instead of Russians taking casualties, losing ordinance, and equipment where they have concentrated their forces and are strong, Russia is constantly being hit in areas of weakness.

Russia’s soldiers are dying at night in their barracks instead of with a gun in hand, and when they do have a gun in hand, they are invariably attacking prepared Ukrainian defences. Russian shells are fired at co-ordinates and areas rather than crucial targets, and that’s when they aren’t being blown up in ammo dumps.

Because of this, it is estimated the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian KIAs is about 6:1.

No army can sustain that level of failure for long. Morale is impossible in that situation.

Even if Russian moral doesn’t dissolve, they will still lose as they bleed out form thousands of cuts sustained outside their preferred “battle areas”.",False,1672186739.0,t3_zw61xo,t1_j1wgzei,,1,74,0,74,0,0,

It just SEEMS like a lot which is always the dominant rhetoric in right wing talking points. In general, the military support is based more on pragmatism and profitability than the theatrics. And our military industry pretty much loves this deal since it's a bargain bin bonanza.

The benefits are almost entirely positive for the the US. It pokes Russia and weakens them as a ""world"" power. It frees up room for us in terms of what we can maintain as part of an active military budget. It allows us to get rid of things that we would otherwise have to pay to get rid of (which is still funny since these are the equivalent of goodwill donations that are still head and shoulders above what the opposition fields).

If it were any Republican president (that was not Trump), you can bet that they would have actually been stronger on the escalations since it is the equivalent to an Iraq that yields immediate results (with far more provocations that damage to be had).

After giving them anti radar missiles to take out Russian air defense, in coordination with drone decoys. A tactic first used by the US air force, in Iraq.

When you have organizations that require unanimity and a conflict of interests threatens to delay internal processes for emergency requests, you have to improvise.  

This is the exact same situation.  And certain of EU member benefits are already being granted to Ukrainians.  Some were even granted before the war, simply because there was demand for it and the normal EU membership process would have been prohibitively lengthy.  In 2017 it became visa-free for example, without being part of the treaty that established Schengen visas.  

What Macron is *actually* saying here is extremely pro-Ukraine.  Namely that they shouldn't have to wait to receive benefits most European countries have extended to them via membership stance.  

As for those weapon deliveries, that was not public knowledge until July-August because France's policy is not to disclose that information.  As a result the more unreasonable frequenters of this sub had declared in their infinite wisdom that France was contributing nothing.  

As for his calls to Putin, Macron was one of the few pro-Ukraine leaders Putin was still speaking with.  Russia refused contact with the US over the war right up until the ZPP incident.  Pure silence from the reality-warping nuclear-capable kleptocracy is not good for anybody.  

Macron's phone calls with Zelenskyy have also now been released.  And the one from Feb 24th, the day of the invasion, *has Zelenskyy asking Macron to speak urgently with Putin on their behalf and Macron saying okay he'll do it.*  That's not audio; that's video.  That's what he said.  Google it.  

If people here want to criticize Macron over something, find a domestic policy he's fumbled.  There at least are such things.  If they want to make an ass of themselves, keep not-so-subtly insinuating that he's playing both sides, and only the goddamn Reddit commentariat has that *super secret information*.",False,1672130286.0,t3_zw61xo,t1_j1tmypu,,2,35,0,35,0,0,

The process is known as vajazzling, a portmanteau of vajayjay  (a euphemism for vagina) and bedazzle. Vajazzling was popularized by actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, who devoted a chapter in her book The Day I Shot Cupid to vajazzling. During a promotional interview on Lopez Tonight in 2010, she encouraged the female members of her audience ""to vajazzle their vajayjays"".

In the early 1990s the second vision aligned more closely with the UK government's broader geopolitical goals of drawing in the former Warsaw Pact nations and pulling them out of the orbit of Russia and into Europe, whilst still leaving the more enthusiastic EU 'deepeners' like France and Germany free to pursue further integration. There was lots of talk about 'two-speed' Europe or 'pick-and-mix' Europe. 

The whole point is that you don't tank the Euro by letting Greece in and you don't have to worry about EU policy being paralyzed by former Eastern Bloc backsliders like Orban.  And totally coincidentally you can mollify British Eurosceptics by telling them that a future Federal European super-state is not actually the agenda and will never happen.

The setback to this potential future created first by the Maastricht treaty and then in the early 2000s when it became clear that most of the other EU members weren't interested in even having the conversation was when many of the British right parted ways with Europe.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s British Euroscepticism was mostly a preserve of the left, who saw the whole thing as essentially a massive banker's ramp (incidentally why the sole survivor of this period, one Mr J Corbyn, was conspicuously extremely unenthusiastic when asked to go out and stump for Remain).

This whole debate was a good percentage of the coverage that the EU got back when I was studying A-Level politics, and I would imagine it would be similar for many other Brits who grew up back in the 1990s.

It's not just that Ukraine is inherently morally better (it probably is) but also a matter of International Relations.

Russia attacks civilians because it wants to and because it can. All of Russia's major allies (Belarus, Iran, Syria, North Korea, etc) take on the role of client/vassal state or junior partner, and so Russia can, to some extent, behave with impunity without threatening to lose allies. Russia has created a dependency on which its allies are hooked.

Ukraine does not attack civilians and that's both because it doesn't want to (the doctrine it adopts acknowledges why civilians are a bad target) and because it can't. Ukraine's allies are the ones with seniority and represent two major organisations, NATO and the EU, which Ukraine hopes to one day join. Demonstrating a blatant disregard for international law is the fastest way to drop those allies now and scupper any chance of future membership too. It would also completely destroy their ability to be seen more widely as the victim of aggression and a valiant, upstanding defender in the face of a clear ""bad guy"".

Smaller navies tend to operate diesel-electrics in the littoral region for coastal defense.  Some navies like Russia operate both types.  Each have their advantages and disadvantages.  Certainly the US Navy got their eyes opened a number of years back

Lots of navies have submarines and they operate all over.  There are plenty of US subs operating off the coast of Russia and China.

To be fair, in the Gulf War, there was a good reason to believe that Iraq would gather allies to fight against us. And in that case, we would have needed the battleships for offshore bombardment.  Yes, it can be done more accurately with cruise missiles; but not in the volume that would have been required if we needed to bombard several locations in a sustained campaign.  

The operational costs (and manpower) of a battleship are much higher, but the theory behind it was that supplying ammunition for those big guns was going to be much more sustainable and cheaper than paying $1 million per missile.

None of that came to pass of course, and the amount of missiles we had and used was sufficient.
