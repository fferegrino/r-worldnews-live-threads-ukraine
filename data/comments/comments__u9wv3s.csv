In a Facebook post early Friday, Reznikov said, “I met with the soldiers in Kyiv Region in the completely destroyed Moschun. Here the occupiers used all possible weapons, including missiles and aircrafts.”

He said the village was on a list of settlements that Russian forces had to take to reach Kyiv.

General Hertling, former commanding general of US Army Europe, breaks it down in a new thread. This is esp important since the Russian military is the most artillery-focused in the world. A few key points:

New M777 artillery can use Excalibur shells with GPS and laser guidance to hit a target the size of a car 40km away.  They are more like miniature cruise missiles than a shell lobbed in a parabola. They can even follow moving targets. Other shells for M777 are less precise but still much more precise than Russia. 

Counter artillery radar system (Q36) can detect Russian artillery as soon as they fire and guide return fire. Any time Russians fire they open themselves up for precise counter-strike. 

New artillery for Ukraine is very good at “shoot and scoot” to avoid Russian return fire. Very hard for Russians to win an artillery duel with their unguided shells against highly mobile precision shells. Ideally, by the time Russians returns fire, Ukraine has moved to a new location. 

Summary: Russia fucked around and is fixin to find out.

*“How did she threaten Russia? It seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the Russian Federation,” Zelenskiy said. The missiles were launched by Russian strategic aircraft from the Caspian Sea region, he added. Ukraine managed to shoot down two missiles, but five more missiles hit the city.*  
  
*“We will identify all those responsible for this strike.... Everyone who gives these orders, everyone who fulfils these orders. No matter how long it takes us, all these bastards will be responsible for every death they caused,” he said.*  
  
*He added that new information continued to emerge regarding crimes by Russian forces against Mariupol residents. “New graves of people killed by the occupiers are being found. We are talking about tens of thousands of dead Mariupol residents. Negotiations of the occupiers on how they conceal the traces of their crimes are recorded,” he said.*  
  
*Zelenskiy said Russia was continuing the activites of “filtration camps”, where Russian forces are sending Ukrainian citizens, before forcibly relocating them to Russia.*  
  
*“The honest name for them is in fact different, concentration camps. Like those built by the Nazies in the past. Ukrainians from these camps, the survivors, are sent further into the occupied territories and to Russia,” he said. “They also deport children hoping that they will forget where there home is and where they are from.”*

KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine, April 23 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that Russia's invasion of his country was just the beginning and that Moscow has designs on capturing other countries, after a Russian general said it wants full control over southern Ukraine.  
  
""All the nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us. They must help us, because we are the first in line. And who will come next?"" Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Friday.  
  
Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west. read more  
  
That would cut off Ukraine's entire coastline and mean Russian forces pushing hundreds of miles west beyond current lines, past the major Ukrainian coastal cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa.  
  
The statement was one of the most detailed about Moscow's ambitions in Ukraine and suggests Russia does not plan to wind down its offensive there anytime soon.  
  
On Twitter, Ukraine's defence ministry said Minnekayev's comments showed Russia was no longer hiding its intentions.  
  
Moscow, it said, had now ""acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.""  
  
Russia says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine and liberate its population from dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and its Western allies call Russia's Feb. 24 invasion an unjustified war of aggression.  
  
Moldova's foreign ministry said it had summoned Moscow's ambassador on Friday to express ""deep concern"" about the general's comments. Moldova was neutral, it said. Moldova last month applied to join the European Union, charting a pro-Western course hastened by Russia's invasion.  
  
U.S. State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter said Washington firmly supported Moldova's sovereignty.  
  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked if Russia had expanded the goals of its operation and how Moscow saw the political future of southern Ukraine.  
  
As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in Washington, Zelenskiy said allies were finally delivering the weapons Kyiv had asked for.  
  
President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had authorized a further $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, including heavy artillery, ammunition and drones. Canada said on Friday it had provided more heavy artillery to Ukraine.

>Amid the massive human and economic toll of Russia’s ongoing invasion, Ukraine’s plan to raise additional funds for its war effort and reconstruction by offering bonds to retail investors abroad could see “big interest” if it comes to fruition, according to one analyst reached by Forbes.



>Ukraine is seeking to offer “peace bonds” to retail investors across the United States and Europe as the country explores new avenues of funding for its war effort and reconstruction, Bloomberg first reported.

>EU and Ukrainian officials have already held talks about how to implement a sale of the new bonds in different member countries and Kyiv has also spoken with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sources told the publication.

>Getting approval for bond sales to retail investors abroad can typically be a lengthy process and Ukraine has not yet released full details about its proposed offerings.

>Ukraine’s financial ministers have so far struggled to reach a wider pool of retail investors abroad: Although the country has been selling bonds since shortly after Russia’s invasion began, only institutional investors and pension funds have been able to buy them.

>Despite only top-tier investors being able to buy Ukraine’s debt so far, there is significant interest from abroad—as investors from around the world have been asking the country’s finance ministry since last month how they can get those bonds as well.

>If the proposed bond offerings do come to fruition, people are “very receptive” to helping Ukraine and that would likely draw “big investor interest,” says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

The whole concept of the ""big lie"" comes apart ugly if you are proven wrong over and over again, but still people line up to eat at the trough of propaganda being served to justify naked territorial aggression.

So what happened?  Was it Volodymyr Zelenskyy refusing to run or surrender?  Was it an unanticipated spirit of the Ukrainian people and their willingness and competence to stand up the Russian bullying?  Was it a remarkable coalescing of an alliance of foreign nations stepping up to support Ukraine?

**Details**: In the South Bug area, the enemy did not conduct active offensive operations, but only resorted to isolated shelling of units of the Armed Forces.

On the northern borders of Ukraine, the Russian occupiers did not take active action, and Ukrainian intelligence did not record the formation of enemy offensive groups.

Ukrainian intelligence reports that the Russian robbers have significant difficulties with the medical support of their units and the evacuation of the wounded. The enemy is in dire need of medicine.

In Balakleya, Kharkiv region, the occupiers, in addition to their own military field hospital, began using the city clinic to house and treat the wounded due to the growing number of wounded.

Due to problems with replenishment of reserves, the Russian occupiers are forcing the people of Kherson to fight against Ukraine.

Five civilians died and 18 were wounded in Russian missile strikes on the southern port city of Odesa, according to a senior Ukrainian official, as another official denounced them as ""Easter gifts from Putin.""

""Five Ukrainian citizens were killed and 18 wounded,"" Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement. ""These are only those who were found. And most likely, there will be more.""

Yermak said one of the dead was a 3-month-old baby, adding: ""A child who had to celebrate his first Easter with his parents. Nothing is sacred. Absolutely. Evil will be punished.""

Many Ukrainians celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with Easter Sunday falling this year on April 24.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, said Russian forces launched at least six cruise missiles at Odesa.

""City residents heard the blasts in different districts of the city. These were the rockets strikes as well as the work of our air-defense system,"" he said.

Gerashchenko added that at least one missile had landed and exploded, residential buildings were hit and one person was burned inside their car in the yard of one of the buildings.

In a statement on Telegram, Odesa City Council Deputy Petro Obukhov called the missile strikes ""Easter gifts from Putin."" 

​Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the strikes, saying, ""The only aim of Russian missile strikes on Odesa is terror. Russia must be designated a state sponsor of terrorism and treated accordingly. No business, no contacts, no cultural projects. We need a wall between civilization and barbarians striking peaceful cities with missiles.""

Ukrainian officials have warned of potential Russian attacks during Easter holiday observances in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently claimed Russian forces have ""liberated"" the Azov Sea port of Mariupol, although Ukrainian defenders are holding out in a massive steel works in the city. 

Ukraine's Air Command South said in a separate statement that missiles also struck a military facility and were launched by Russian bombers:

""Today ... the air defense group of the South Air Command conducted combat operations to destroy enemy cruise missiles launched by Russia's TU-95 strategic aircraft from the Caspian Sea,"" the statement said. ""During the engagement, warriors of anti-aircraft missile units destroyed two enemy cruise missiles (preliminary X555 or X101), which struck the city of Odesa and two operational-tactical level UAVs, which presumably corrected the trajectory of cruise missiles and placed active obstacles to the air-defense system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""

Dismissing the idea that these politicians are concerned about the release of civilians reportedly trapped at Azovstal along with members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Skabeeva concluded: “They want to free the people from the catacombs, which means there are some very, very special people—very valuable people there.”

To use artillery effectively, you need forward teams to be able to find targets and call in the locations, so the artillery can aim and destroy stuff. Suppose in this case, the Russians have completely failed to get any forward teams set up, or perhaps Ukraine have made their communication channels fail (we already heard they had to use cell phones)?  
  
In this case the Russians would have no option - they will have to either stop firing, ot fire artillery a lot more randomly, maybe taking out big targets which can be found on a map - which is exactly what they are doing.

When it came to Russian gas, everyone was on board, he pointed out, mocking his detractors over copious amounts of white wine.

“They all went along with it for the last 30 years,” he said. “But suddenly everyone knows better.”

Mr. Schröder scoffed at the notion of now distancing himself personally from Mr. Putin, 69, whom he considers a friend and sees regularly, most recently last month in an informal effort to help end the Ukraine war.

Mr. Schröder refuses to resign from his board seats on Russian energy companies, despite calls to do so from across the political spectrum, not least from Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a fellow Social Democrat, who worked closely with Mr. Schröder when he was chancellor.

Distancing himself now, Mr. Schröder said, would lose him the trust of the one man who can end the war: Mr. Putin. Even so, after all of his years of close relations with Mr. Putin, he walked away with nothing during his one brief interlude trying to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.

It is hard by now — with Mr. Putin unrelenting more than two months into the Ukraine war — to avoid the impression that Mr. Schröder is useful to the Russian leader as a cat’s paw to further his own interest in hooking Germany on cheap Russian gas.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and make a very bold prediction.  If Macron wins the election in France in the next 24 hours, I think we are going to see a major change in both the French posture towards this conflict AND their position in the EU.

Germany is displaying an incredible amount of weakness and it is becoming clear to many in the EU that counting on Germany to have any sort of leadership role in the EU is going to be a massive liability (this has been echoed by many political pundits over the last 48-72 hours).

I think a fresh mandate for Macron will embolden him to take more decisive action in Ukraine.  This will elevate France's position among a large number of countries in the EU (all the Eastern members for sure will get in the French camp ASAP).  When the UK left the EU it left a void in terms of military and strategic defense leadership, I can see Macron taking this chance to put France into the position to assume that role de-facto.  

One thing that continues to strike me is the extreme weakness Germany and her leadership are showing in all of this.  This could have been a huge opportunity for them, but it is very likely the actions Scholz are going to have a very diminishing effect soft power in both the EU and the world once this is over.",False,1650762847.0,t3_u9wv3s,t3_u9wv3s,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE FROM A CONFLICT THAT HAS HAD VERY LITTLE OF IT? A LOT

(...)

*And yet there has been no major amphibious operation so far in Ukraine. There have, however, been minor operations that have incorporated amphibious capabilities. It is important to note that although large-scale amphibious landings intended to have strategic impacts in war—like the D-Day landings—receive disproportionate historical attention, smaller actions aimed at tactical effects can also be launched amphibiously.* 

*Russia has recent experience with such operations. Russian naval infantry conducted an uncontested landing from three ships into Abkhazia, a Georgian region under separatist control, before marching into Georgia proper during the 2008 war. Even in the current war, although reports have been vague, it appears that Russian forces conducted a small-scale, uncontested amphibious landing near Mariupol at the beginning of the conflict.* 

*Since then, Russian naval infantry forces have been engaged in fighting in the south, particularly in and around Mariupol, where the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet was reportedly killed in action. Russian naval forces also seized Snake Island, after being confronted by Ukrainian defenders who famously sent a courageous reply to the invaders’ demand that the garrison surrender: “Go f—k yourself.” These minor operations are, so far, the only look we have at the application of Russian amphibious capability in the current conflict.*

Poverty and ignorance in a supposedly modern country so profound that soldiers lug around *stolen toilets* in a bloody battlefield? Hilarious. Zelenskyy's latest remark? Total dunk!

We are united in warning against an uncontrollable escalation of the war with unforeseeable consequences for the entire world and in opposing a prolongation of the war and bloodshed with arms deliveries.*

*By supplying weapons, Germany and other NATO countries have de facto made themselves a war party. And so Ukraine has also become the battlefield for the conflict between NATO and Russia over the security order in Europe, which has been escalating for years.*

*This brutal war in the heart of Europe is being fought at the expense of the Ukrainian people. At the same time, the economic war that has now been unleashed is jeopardizing the supply of people in Russia and many poor countries around the world.*

*Reports of war crimes are piling up. Although difficult to verify under the prevailing conditions, it must be assumed that in this war, as in others before it, atrocities will be committed and that the brutality will increase with its duration. One more reason to end it quickly.*

*The war harbors the real danger of escalation and military escalation that can no longer be controlled - similar to that of the First World War. Red Lines are drawn, which are then crossed by actors and gamblers on both sides, and the spiral continues one step further. If responsible people like you, dear Mr. Federal Chancellor, do not stop this development, the end will be another big war. Only this time with nuclear weapons, widespread devastation and the end of human civilization. The avoidance of more and more casualties, destruction and a further dangerous escalation must therefore have absolute priority.*

*Despite reports of success from the Ukrainian army in the meantime: it is far inferior to the Russian one and has little chance of winning this war. The price of prolonged military resistance, regardless of possible success, will be more destroyed towns and villages and more casualties among the Ukrainian population. Deliveries of arms and military support from NATO prolong the war and make a diplomatic solution a long way off.*

*It is right to make the demand “Down with your arms!” primarily to the Russian side. But at the same time, further steps must be taken to end the bloodshed and displacement of people as soon as possible.*

*As bitter as it is to retreat from violence that violates international law, it is the only realistic and humane alternative to a long, grueling war. The first and most important step would be to stop all arms deliveries to Ukraine, combined with an immediate ceasefire to be negotiated.*

*We therefore call on the German government, the EU and NATO countries to stop supplying arms to the Ukrainian troops and to encourage the government in Kyiv to end military resistance against the promise of negotiations on a ceasefire and a political solution. The offers to Moscow already discussed by President Zelenskyi - possible neutrality, agreement on the recognition of Crimea and referendums on the future status of the Donbass republics - offer a real chance to do so.*

*Negotiations on the rapid withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity should be supported by NATO countries' own proposals regarding the legitimate security interests of Russia and its neighboring countries.*

*In order to stop further massive destruction of the cities as quickly as possible and to accelerate ceasefire negotiations, the federal government should suggest that the cities currently under siege, most at risk and so far largely undestroyed, such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa, become ""undefended cities"". the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention of 1949. Thanks to the concept already defined in the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, numerous cities were able to prevent their devastation during the Second World War .*

*The prevailing logic of war must be replaced by a courageous logic of peace and a new European and global peace architecture must be created, including Russia and China. Our country must not stand on the sidelines here, but must play an active role.*

*Sincerely,*

ab12d56d4f0c842aa90da9d6a733a4dc,u9wv3s,i5ug87n,"One argument I really don't understand is when people say that Putin might attack the Baltic states (NATO members) after Ukraine, so we have to join the war now to stop him. That doesn't make any sense. 

Regardless of whether you think Putin is stupid enough to attack NATO, sending troops now would be a bad decision either way. There are many ways this conflict can play out. 

It is possible that Ukraine stops Russia and then we don't have to worry about Putin attacking anyone else, because they simply won't be in the position to do so. In that scenario, NATO joining the war would be an unnecessary escalation that can lead to a nuclear conflict and leave many millions dead.

If Russia defeats Ukraine, it's still not guaranteed that Putin would attack the Baltics, in fact it's very unlikely. Missiles and troops don't just grow on trees. A wrecked Russian economy cannot hope to rival NATO. Even a healthy Russia would have no chance, so it's reasonable to think that Putin wouldn't go into a suicidal war with the alliance. It's believable that he thought he could easily take Ukraine, he can't think that about NATO. 

So let's say Putin actually wants to attack the Baltics regardless of how shitty the Russian economy is, how seriously their army is outgunned by NATO. Even then, if we knew it for a fact that he wants war, it would be reckless to send troops to Ukraine for many reasons. First of all, Putin might not live long enough to see his plans play out. He might get bogged down in Ukraine or get overthrown at home. The guy's turning 70 this year, he won't live forever. 

Also, even in the case of a certain Russian attack on the Baltics, the best thing we can do is to prepare and not rush the conflict. Russia is not getting stronger anytime soon, but we can arm those countries, supply them with weapons, etc. It makes zero sense to jump into Ukraine guns blazing. With Europe turning away from Russian gas and oil, their economy will be in serious trouble, regardless of how this war ends. Time is on our side. 

The only argument for intervention is that it could save Ukrainian lives, which is an admirable goal, but it would also put a lot more Ukrainian lives at serious risk. If things escalate to a point where Russia feels serious threatened, the first tactical nukes would be used in Ukraine. At that point you either retreat or escalate further. Retreating would give Putin free reign and a permission to use nukes, it would be the end of NATO as we know it. Escalating would mean a nuclear war. 

Basically the best way for NATO to win, like in the classic movie WarGames, is to not play. Participating in the conflict can only hurt us. Supplying Ukraine like crazy and wait for Russia to give up or implode is by far the best thing we can do. Even if you're only concern is to save as many Ukrainian lives as possible, you shouldn't want NATO involved.",False,1650691544.0,t3_u9wv3s,t3_u9wv3s,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

Its important to remember that there are multiple kinds of artillery systems here. Sure, they all shoot 155mm shells, but they all have their own characteristics, pros-and-cons, etc. etc.

If a bridge is blown up by the Russians, the M777 riding in a Helicopter sling can still reach wherever you want (while self-propelled artillery like Panzerhaubitze 2000  would have to wait for the bridge to be rebuilt)

M777 is also cheaper.",1650690237.0,1650690019.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5u8olh,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

2.	The good life is not in Russia, it’s in the West.  But your money is in Russia, which is no good.
3.	Oligarchs who have moved assets into the West have been sanctioned heavily in the past- before this, before 2014.  For them, it’s dicey to put wealth into Western financial instruments like real estate or investments.
4.	Enter the superyacht.  A boat like this costs as much as a high-end property in a global capitol city, but here’s the thing– it’s not part of the Western financial system, and you can sail it *to* the West.  That’s a win-win.
5.	You can also sail it to all sorts of shady places who will look the other way if you have money.
6.	Sailing it to the West or to shady places implies sailing away from Russia, which as others have stated, is a shitty place to be regardless of how rich you are.
7.	You can even hoard more wealth in your yacht than the yacht itself.  Think solid gold doorknobs and shit like that.  Now you can take your wealth with you, and nobody can take it.  Got sanctioned in country X?  Take it to county Y.

So you can see that the yacht is like a big floating luxury property, status symbol, and bank all in one.  It’s a pretty great solution to a lot of your #oligarchproblems.

The only thing is, nobody expected a cohesive Western response that was as sudden and severe as what happened.  The whole purpose of the yacht is that you can use it to make borders “porous”, but that doesn’t happen if everybody decides to stonewall you at the same time.  The idea that even a hostile Western regime would outright seize the boat like they’ve done was just unthinkable.

First, brigade in this context refers just to the combat troops.  There are 3-4 times that number in support personel.  The majority of Bucha crimes were committed by support personel, and by 'cleanse' crews, which are listed under support.  

The soldiers who actually had experience were mostly, not all but mostly, at their posts with Kadyrovites keeping them there.  I would bet real money very few people listed with this brigade committed the violence in Bucha, Brovary, or Borodyanka.  A few did, especially at the end during the pull-out when a bunch got left behind, and we have their names in a few cases, but the first few weeks these guys were in their trenches with no downtime.  Support crew with no direction and less training are mainly the ones that pillage the communities.  And if they are in the East now, they're still alive.  

By all means impale them on horsecocks, but don't think this is justice or at least don't think justice is total.

In Grozny in the 90s apartment blocks were nearly ideal fortification for light infantry.  Slight modification by cutting holes in walls you can run through between apartments the full length of a floor.  Holes in closet floors/ceilings make it easy to climb to another floor.  Explosive mines in half the closets make it painful for Russian troops to storm and clear a floor.  Attackers do not know the location of routes so they are stuck in hallways and stairwells.  Fist sized grenade holes make that a poor position to be in. Cast iron bathtubs are easy to cross stack to make bunkers.  Windows in mid and top floors offer wide view for snipers.

A fire team or squad with a few missiles can wreck havoc on invading forces.

Russia was willing to pull troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts ostensibly to focus on the Donbas.  They won't be willing to pull units from the Donbas to focus on a different territory.  Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are useless to Russia without the Donbas, and ultimately indefensible if UA gets to relocate artillery to the south, which is why Russia can hold those areas effectively right now.  

Unless *for some reason* Crimea starts getting threatened, but that is frankly impossible as UA has no navy and all you have to do is guard one entry point at the bridge, or blow the bridge.  UA will never in a million years effect an amphibious landing there.  

It's not like Kherson is a low priority for them; it's not.  It's just contingent on success elsewhere.  The war ends when the war in the Donbas ends.  That's why experts are saying it won't end for a long time.  Russia will certainly be willing to mobilize if the new 'phase' starts to falter.  That brings its own risks, but it's worth it to them.  

Also a note about Crimea's water supply (via the Dnieper).  It's necessary for growth in the region, not for life in the region.  Also access since the start of the war has refilled their reservoirs.  With current pop it's probably got enough fresh water for a further five years.  So losing everything north of Crimea does not lose them Crimea.  UA only gets Crimea at the negotiating table, which means they have to threaten something else.

One of the biggest differences between the two is atgm. Russian infantry is likely to be conscript heavy and lacks defensive capabilities against mechanized forces.

No, all of this was a multi-pronged affair.  Sow lots of dissension leading to disunity and disintegration of existing arrangements.  This is things like Brexit, Trump, Le Pen, Orban.  Lots of relatively slow moving stuff to increase favorable views of Russia and to decrease support for things like NATO.  Once NATO ***disintegrates***, then Russia can attack the Baltics.

This plan was largely rent asunder because it depended on patience (and for clowns like Trump to continue to win).  But invading Ukraine threw patience out the window.  However, imagine if Ukraine had just simply and quietly folded.  Then the rest of working to disintegrate NATO could continue.

Now, you seem to be arguing against sending NATO troops directly.  Is this a bit of a straw man?  Who's seriously advocating that other than Poland's suggestion for peacekeepers?

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/ukraine-dismisses-german-chancellor-s-statements-on-weapons-aid-1.4858663  
  
Apparently Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, said it in an interview with Germany’s ZDF television  
  
>Mr Melnyk claims the list of available German equipment provided to him was cut from 48 to 24 pages. Of 15 specific Ukrainian requests from German arms companies, he said, just three remained on the list.  
  
No English language transcripts to back that up, so German's on the menu tonight  
  
Let me know if you find the interview first  
  
E: found it, in video form.  Will need to translate somehow    
  
E2: was listening for the word 'achtundvierzig' (48), didn't hear it. Maybe my ears are no good, maybe they didn't reference it directly, or maybe it's the wrong interview?

Maybe he thought it was because Ukraine had some super powers and it would translate to a larger Russian collapse? Everything I've read about the northern front was more that Russian forces overextended than anything else and they were only beaten out because they were deliberately withdrawing after finding they couldn't mount a proper encirclement of Kyiv. And this should if anything mean they should try and emulate this again rather than charge foolishly into Russian defensive positions.

Right now Ukraine is trying to hold their defensive positions in the Donbas and they have repelled a ton of probing attacks. We are all waiting for Russia to do their big offensive and breakthrough and this guy is spazzing out about Ukraine not doing enough progress with counter offensives? 

>the Russian dictatorship is in no rush

And what's this? Everyone talks about either the 9th May Victory day needing a big victory or the heavy pressure on Russia's economy. Acting like they are in no rush is absurd. Especially as long as the west is as heavily behind Ukraine as they are.

> But I also doubt, it will liberate everything captured since Feb 24

Here's another example of weird reasoning. The main goal right now is to survive the big Donbas offensive that's been gathering in Izium and will come from many angles. After that they might put harder pressure elsewhere. The new M777 howitzers will help a lot with outranging Russian artillery too which will maybe make the counter offensives less bloody. 

The way I hope to see the end of the war is a Russian peace agreement to lift sanctions and give back land. Russia is under very heavy pressure right now and I'm not sure they are willing to fight to the last man to defend the Donbas and Crimea.

Like yes, they came from the ""good families"", they all went to same fancy schools, and in theory, they all look the same on paper.

The reality is very different.

Death of a general + possibly his closest aides, the supporting staff, who might have spend several years working together with him, can be devastating to the army.

Replacing him, getting the new general up to speed can take several weeks, and by and large most generals (especially in russian military) lack the experience of a real world combat against a modern opponent, trained by NATO, using modern equipment.

This means that the new general will most likely play it safe, or ""by the book"", atleast early on. Unfortunately what works during highly scripted war games in Russian military exercises, might not work so well against highly motivated hostile army.

1. Agriculture: European states like France are very protective of their agricultural sectors and would rather not let Indian farmers destroy their local growers.

2. Big Industrial Goods: The days of India pursuing import substitution industrialization (*where a country tries to build industrial goods at home to avoid having to import from the West*) are long over, but automotive firms in Germany might think this is a big market to break into. By contrast, Indians (and others) fear that letting in big, developed foreign goods might break local firms (*Tata may survive lower tariffs on BMW, but smaller ones?*).

3. What does this have to do with the war: While Europe has a lot to offer (at least in theory), among the main reasons India is unlikely to cancel its current arrangements with Russia REGARDLESS of the prospective trade agreement is history (*complicated*), energy (aside from Ukraine, don't expect much), and the Russian agreement for military technology transfer (can you imagine France teaching them how to make Mirage jets!?!).

Aircraft is a blurry area, their air force is fairly large but it's hard to say what the readiness numbers are. Pilots are a weak link, known for extremely low flight hours which says maintenance and spare parts are scarce so likely a sustained air campaign cannot be maintained for long. Eventually their sortie rate will tank unless they cannbalize other aircraft which is likely already happening. 

Same with helicopters is pretty likely, it'll hit modern gun ships and heavy lift first (there are plenty B grade mi 8/16s to scanvange) and likely will start to tank sorties, especially since they're valuable and the battlefield is saturated with stingers. air assault is likely off the table given vdv loses as well.

...Al Jazeera went out of their way to quote a guy from New Zealand who is basically Putin's press agent, sort of the Kiwi Tucker Carlson.  He writes things like this:

""In short, Putin started his first presidential term as a visionary reformer so, in order to carry out his ambitious plans, he accumulated a great deal of power. In this respect, his enlightened despotism is similar to that of other Russian rulers who wanted to transform and modernise the country, like Peter the Great. Hence, Putin’s levels of authoritarianism and hawkishness are relatively mild for Russian standards (the contrast is evident when comparisons with Ivan the Terrible or Stalin are made). Some progress has been made and the flame of national morale has been rekindled during the reign of President Putin and his clan, but there are problematic issues that will have to be dealt with if Russia truly wants to reassert itself as a relevant player on the global geopolitical chessboard.

I guess you don't trust basically every western leading geopolitical analyst, because Putin's belief about Russia's history has been used to justify Putin's expansionism and his idea of [""Russian exceptionalism""](https://www.fpri.org/article/2013/10/the-curse-of-russian-exceptionalism/) for over a decade at this point.


I don't disagree that Putin doesn't want a western style democracy on its doorstep but people like you who simplify the cause of Putin's invasion down to one thing really boggle the mind. War is rarely caused by one thing. There is no obvious answer. There are many answers. I don't trust anyone who tries to sell me or others the singular cause of this war



edit: Since I think the book is extremely relevant to the topic, [""Putin's World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest""](https://www.amazon.com/Putins-World-Russia-Against-West/dp/1455533025) by Angela Stent is a few years old at this point and primarily is focused around the 2014 invasion of Crimea and the subsequent fallout, but it's all the same stuff that essentially led to where we are now, and I think that anyone who thinks there is one cause of this war should really read that book and get a better idea of who Putin is and what he wants for Russia. It's a lot deeper than just Putin not wanting democracy on his doorstep, even if that is a reason.

Europe of the next 20 years isn't going to be Europe of the last 20.  Military power is going to be MUCH more important with China and Russia being legitimate threats (in different ways, Russia for being a war monger, and China for their ever increasing militarization).  A country without the stomach for military conflict won't be looked to for a leadership role, regardless of their economy.

It's still specific to right-wing autocracy; it just now means any sort of right-wing autocracy, whether it's actual fascism or more accurately monarchism, oligarchy, or a generic non-ideological dictatorship.  

The things that separated 20th century fascists from these other types were:  

- a particular focus on racial 'purity'
- promotion of the military including a merging of the military and the police
- a systematic dismantling of the aristocracy
- the dismantling of corporations and the nationalization of any company useful to war efforts or military supply (a far more limited definition of capitalism, more like the ancient Roman system)

Your typical free-market espousing corporate apologia can still lead to right-wing autocracy, but it wouldn't be fascist autocracy.  American grassroots fascism tends to still be anti-corporate, but elected officials accused of fascism are all extremely pro-corporate, even if their abject racism invites fascist comparison.  

Russia, however, has increasingly met each and every one of these criteria.  It has always suppressed non-Russian ethnolinguistic parties.  The police have military authority over civilians and are supported by two intelligence networks.  Russian oligarchs who made their money in the 90s no longer control the country and have effectively become a new aristocracy, one which Putin is now attacking.  And now it's started nationalizing companies, both foreign and domestic.  The murder of billionaires and their families and nationalization of their assets is textbook fascism.

Essentially, the collective mindset of Germans is still pretty pacifistic. We do have a completely different perception regarding the use of weapons in our society. It's basically frowned upon and it indeed reaches back to the atrocities of the second world war. Our society was indoctrinated for generations that we shouldn't arm our Bundeswehr, that weapons are bad and the only way for a glorious future is working together (on a global level) and not shooting each other. That was basically the state doctrine of Germany for the past 30 odd years.

We are acknowledging the atrocities of Russians in Ukraine and there is a major shift ongoing in our society regarding weapons, military et al, but that's something which isn't going to work in two days. I know that it's probably frustrating to see if you are from the US or whatever, but bear in mind that the American way of doing global politics (e.g. with boots on the ground, Iraq, Afghanistan etc.) was heavily frowned upon in Germany.

It's not like: ""Uh, those Germans are pro Russia"". That's absolutely not the case. We are probably the heart of the EU as we are the biggest economical country of Europe, but we as a society still **want** to believe that there has to be a way without shooting each other.

If you can read German and read national media you can see that the messaging is far less than clear: While the SPD (Scholz) is very reluctant, the Greens (foreign, economy ministers of the important ones) would like to deliver weapons and embargo oil and get out of gas fast (and proposed so since last year). The FDP (i.e. the liberals, among others finance) also shifted towards a far more aggressive stance (though they wouldn't support a gas embargo as much as the Greens).

Next week is going to be interesting, the biggest opposition party CDU (Party of Merkel) will put a very aggressive bill for the delivery of weapons in front of the Bundestag. If the Greens and FDP (and parts of the SPD) support that two things will happen: 1) much more deliveries; 2) Scholz would be a dead man walking and the coalition would break apart.

 >Tankie is a pejorative label for communists, particularly Stalinists, who support the authoritarian tendencies of Marxism–Leninism. The term was originally used by dissident Marxist–Leninists to describe members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) who followed the party line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Specifically it was used to distinguish party members who spoke out defending Soviet use of tanks to crush the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and later the 1968 Prague Spring uprising, or more broadly, those who adhered to pro-Soviet positions in general.

2.	⁠Scholz doesn't share the list with Ukraine.
3.	⁠Scholz says that there are no more weapons left in Germany to give to Ukraine.
4.	⁠Germany's defense industry leaks the list to Ukraine's ambassador.
5.	⁠Scholz says that the weapons on the list don't work.
6.	⁠The defense industry denies this and leaks the list to the press.
7.	⁠Scholz states Ukrainians can't master the weapons in the available time.
8.	⁠German defense experts tell the German press that Ukrainians can master the weapons in 2-3 weeks.
9.	⁠Scholz says the weapons are needed by NATO and NATO must approve their transfer.
10.	⁠NATO officials and German generals deny this.
11.	⁠Scholz says no other NATO/EU ally is delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine.
12.	⁠The US, UK, Australia, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, Turkey, Italy, Finland, Denmark, Romania, Netherlands, etc. publish the lists of heavy weapon they deliver to Ukraine.
13.	⁠Under pressure Scholz announces €2 billion for Ukraine's military.
14.	⁠German parliamentarians find out that it's really just €1 billion, which won't be available for another 2-3 months, and then Scholz can veto or delay indefinitely every item Ukraine wants to buy.
15.	⁠The US, France, Poland, Romania, Japan, the UK and Italy, plus the heads of EU and NATO spend an afternoon trying to talk sense into Scholz.
16.	⁠Scholz makes a statement and says Ukraine can have the €1 billion now and order whatever it wants from the list.
17.	⁠Ukraine's ambassador says that Scholz removed all the items Ukraine actually wants from the list before giving it to Ukraine and what remains on the list is just a fraction of the €1 billion.

The green Ur-Quan actually believe what they are doing protects not just themselves, but also the other races, both from themselves and from the horrors of the universe.

The black Ur-Quan just kill to protect themselves. But they're also 100% honest about it, and other than a bit of post-hoc rationalization (that their victims might end up better off by being reincarnated as an Ur-Quan) honest with themselves as well.

The problem with only looking at the scale and scope of their influences, the motivations and reasoning behind their actions are similar. To me, Trump doesn't somehow become ""not a killer"", even if his actions killed less than a hundred thousand people... which is debateable.

I think there's this kind of conforting myth floating around, that Trump was somehow too self-involved or too stupid to understand the damage and consequences of his actions as president. But the fact of the matter is, that many decisions, most importantly the ones around Covid, were made while purposefully putting Trump's own political goals and rhetoric above people's lives and wellbeing, and the administration committed many evil acts in full cognition of what their consequences would be.

The idea, that Scholz and others are afraid of Russia or some other way compromised/corrupt, seems to me like Russian propaganda, that only seeks to divide the opinion in Europe and turn the supporters of Ukraine against each other.

But there are two mayor problems with the modern heavy weapons:

1. Germany currently doesn't have heavy weapons to spare. The Bundeswehr was extremely underfunded for decades. The latest reports stated, that only about half of all ""active"" heavy systems of the Bundeswehr are in working conditions. Giving this few weapons up would mean failing completely in fulfilling the NATO-obligations, in a time where a war is raging at our doorsteps. Our Generals are understandably very reluctant to do this.
2. Germans tend to think things thru before acting. Because of that, everything takes a bit longer and in this case there is a focus on the question, if Ukraine currently would even be able to maintain these heavy weapon systems. So before the first weapons could be delivered, the Ukrainian logistic and maintenance units (who are already under much strain because a full-blown war is going on) have to be prepared with training, tools, spare parts, technical documentations etc. This is absolutely doable, but takes time.

And a related third problem is, that German politicians are bad in communicating this problems. They may be thinking that everyone already understands this obvious facts and don't bother explaining them over and over.

Russian propaganda seems to be a mayor reason why everyone is questioning Germanys commitment all the time, but no one asks, why for example the USA, who have many weapon systems in store, are also only sending simple, towed howitzers and 60 years old APCs and not for example some of their modernized M109 and modern IFVs or their latest main battle tanks.

Germany: depends on Russia for half of its natural gas, and big parts of its coal and oil, and vetoes EU proposals to boycott Russian fossil fuels.

We know that Germany wanted to make Nordstream 2 happen, and blocked transfers of German-made weapons until after the war started.

There are also credible allegations that Germany  initially refused support to Ukraine, since they were going to lose in a matter of hours anyway.

And any observation that a dozen countries are now supplying heavy equipment including combat vehicles,  artillery and support for these, but Germany isn't, is met with some deflection about ""I don't see the US sending any tanks"" or some such bullshit.

Meanwhile, the Germans alternatively claim that they can't spare anything, or the Ukrainians can't possible figure out how to use their equipment, or it would start World War 3 to do anything.

Germany has also sent a lot of nonlethal and lethal aid, plus it permitted countries to send German built equipment to Ukraine. And at this point, Ukraine needs a LOT of nonlethal aid like helmets, trucks, bulletproof vests, first aid gear, field hospitals, etc. But Germany has also sent Panzerfaust 3, ammunition (both for small arms and heavier weapons), Strela MANPAD’s, and grenades.

NATO is running out of Soviet-designed weapons systems and equipment, combined with the fact that we cannot remove combat effectiveness from NATO to arm Ukraine (in case Russia does make a move on the Baltics), and the newer weapons take time to train on (especially heavy weapons). Plus some of these NATO systems use different ammunition (the alliance uses both 120×570mm NATO and 105×617mm NATO in their tanks) so there is likely background discussions on how to avoid overcomplicating Ukraine’s logistics.

Also, early on in the conflict, Ukraine needed lighter weapons for quick response to punch the invaders then retreat. The new offensive has only taken shape over the past fifteen days and is the first time that Ukraine can actually effectively use heavier weapons like tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and artillery.

To my earlier point also: while Germany isn’t sending heavy lethal aid, it is backfilling other countries, including deploying PATRIOT’s to Slovakia and investigating sending Leopard 1 or 2’s to Poland to backfill the T-72’s until the Abrams can arrive in the next year or two.",False,1650700718.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5uol6w,,3,19,0,19,0,0,

Each defection has the value of the working tank, the not fired missile, and the morale impact on other Russians who have to face their own weapons.  But we should, on principle, also value the lives of the crew and count that as added value.  

Ukraine is on the right side.  There is no reason to give them a blank check on morality.  Ukraine should be under pressure to treat prisoners well.  When they advance on Kursk they need to use some care to minimize civilian harm.  The ""Russia did it now our turn"" needs to be anticipated and strongly opposed.  ""Russians"" who live in Ukraine are Ukrainian nationals by standards we in USA consider normal.  Ukrainians could very easily do many things that are wrong during the war even if the war itself is Moscow's wrong doing.

As currently - for Germany - the aggressor is Russia (and has realistically been Russia and Germany for the rest of Europe since the fall of the Ottoman Empire). 

So using the excuse ""we need the weapons at home in case of attack"" is very weak. If you are attacked - with the state the German army is in right now - it would not be able to defend, even if it has a few hundred heavy weapons more. It will do what almost every European country would do - count to NATO to step in, on the collective support of the Alliance - which would decisively push back any Russian aggression.

And before Russia even gets close to Germany - it would have to pass through a lot of other NATO countries, most of which are smart enough to realize that the best chance to stop this is to give Ukraine ALL it needs to counter it now. Ukraine has the army, the motivation and the mindset to fight the Russians. 

So no - this argument is hollow. You would not be undoing decades of neglect in 1-2 years, while you could definitely actively protect yourselves from aggression by diverting those weapons to people that actually fight.

4be30489c4461490e65176de5a608884,u9wv3s,i5xa9dz,"You and I must have learned very different things about Germany in the Cold War.  Last I recall, after  the Soviets went and ate up East Germany, the US set up the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, and more than a little emphasis was placed on West Germany.  Now, there were some very obvious geopolitical reasons why, not the least of which being that West Germany was the front line to hold back any Soviet invasions.   But, whether it was an explicit reason or not, the Marshall Plan also learned from and avoided the mistakes of the horrifically bad Teeaty of Versailles.  Rather than a closed fist, or at best a pointing finger telling ""shame on you"", Germany was offered an open hand up.  Rather than rivals to blame their socioeconomic woes on, they were given friends and allies to become something better than they were before.

While it is true that the above approach hasn't worked on Russia thus far, keep in mind the differences that exist between the Nazi -> West Germany and the Soviet Union -> Russian Federation.  At the end of WW2, the douchecanoes that had been calling the shots and making the policies got dragged to Nuremburg and made to answer for their crimes.  To use your cancer analogy, instead of chemotherapy we went in with a surgeon and cut the tumor out.  At the collapse of the USSR, not only did that not happen but by and large the leadership in general and the oligarchy in particular received little more than a fresh coat of paint.  Those responsible for stoking tensions between the West and the USSR are very much still stoking the tensions between the West and Russia.

And on a final note to your last paragraph, one of the amazing and beautiful things about humanity is our ability to improve upon ourselves.  Yes, nature is cruel, brutal and short.  But, the entirety of (civilized) human history had more or less involved us telling nature to piss off because we could do better.  Engineering, Healthcare, culture... all the things we value in human society revolves around taking a part of nature and making it better than it was before.

Germany's defense industry didn't leak the list to Ukraine, the German gov't gave it to them. 

Scholz didn't say that there's no weapons left to give to UA - Germany's been actively delivering weapons. 

Scholz didn't say that the weapons on the list didn't work, because the list is about new equipment. The weapons that didn't work were old GDR strela MANPADs, and Scholz didn't say that, the Ukrainians did. At least get your lies straight.

Scholz didn't state that the Ukrainians can't master weapons in the available time. He said that it's important to deliver things that can be used quickly. The Defense industry didn't reply that that was wrong. What KMW did say is that they could get the Leo 1s into working order quicker than the govt anticipated, but that wasn't about training.

Scholz did say that ""the weapons"", which here means heavy equipment, is needed by NATO, which is true - Germany's very tight on working equipment and much of it is tied up in NATO fast response teams that absolutely cannot spare it. NATO and German generals absolutely did NOT deny this.

Scholz did not say that nobody else is delivering heavy weapons.

Whether aircraft or short range ground to ground missiles?  Looking at a map,  the best way to relieve Mariupol would be via the sea so why aren’t we preparing to transfer sea assets to Ukraine to counteract the shitty Black Sea fleet?  It only had what, forty ships at the best of times right?  The flagship of that fleet sat in dry dock rotting for about a decade before being refurbished. It’s not like that flotilla (seems silly to keep calling it a fleet after such incompetent deployment) represents some sort of invincible force.  Plus any naval assets would help protect Odessa from a Russian incursion by land or by a raid from the sea. 

There’s better ground vehicles, better anti craft equipment, radar, etc they could be receiving. Just seems if the goal is to bring this conflict to a rapid close we would be seeing Operation Nickel Grass Part II and not doling out equipment in a couple of tranches every week. 

This whole invasion has removed any concept the Russians deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as individual Western European states, much less the United States. I thought their reforms post Georgia invasion would have been much more meaningful but it turns out the Russian state is suicidally corrupt.  Opening the floodgates almost seems like the best way to save Ukrainian and Russian lives. Stop the destruction of the lives and livelihood of the former and let the latter know  they need to begin a disorganized retreat east if they wish to see their mothers again.",False,1650768635.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5y9jjh,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

On the other hand, people with prejudices with regards to race in the West have much more of a choice to think that way.

The difference between Russia and Ukraine here is that in Russia this discrimination is almost encouraged by the government's insistence that all countries critical of their behaviour in this war are Russophobic. You don't see Ukraine claiming that India and China are racist towards Ukrainians.

By the way, I think your comment is being received poorly for two reasons. One, people are wary of users that may look like Russian bots accusing Ukraine and particularly its government of Nazism.

Put in that context US conflicts make more sense. Policy towards the USSR post-WWII was one of containment (i.e., preventing the spread of communism.) Vietnam, Korea, and Iraq (1980s) were all great examples of this. 

Post-USSR America's priorities changed. We felt the threat of communism was massively reduced, so much so we became friendly with communist nations and became enemies of states (e.g., Iraq) we stopped only a few short years before. We took our eye off Russia and focused elsewhere (e.g, Middle East, China).

in this post-USSR works we were unhappy with the state of Ukraine (e.g., corruption) and ignored the threat from a resurgent authoritarian Russia. In doing so we were guilty of letting perfect be the enemy of good.

Fortunately Russia's mask has been lifted and most in the West now understand we're already in the middle of a battle for the existence of our way of life, yet we didn't even know it.  Our supporting Ukraine does look like supporting democracy and freedom, but the West would likely support Ukraine even if they were an authoritarian regime, so long as it made Russia bleed.

As a static weapon, or on a technical, there's very little reason to not use them if they're available unless you have access to ammunition-compatinlble PKMs or PKPs which are lighter and easier to maintain, or you want to use a DShK or KORD firing a higher caliber round.

The US still uses the Browning and that's not substantially newer. The basic operation of a machine gun is really something that doesn't need changing and exactly what this video highlights is really important - because the Maxim fires a still in use cartridge (and in fact used by modern machine guns that use Maxim-pattern belts to boot) means ammunition is available and plentiful, already belted up.

Basically, the only reason to not keep using the Maxim is that you have a surplus of PK machine guns and that if you *need* to move those (e.g. pulling back from  overrun static defenses or removing the gun from a disabled technical) they are man portable and operable where the Maxim requires a gun team in mobile use.",False,1650749718.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5wsys0,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

----------

I don't think that Ukrainians are just flying drones randomly around the front. Switchblade 300s are one-time launch. And any ""returning drone"" carries the chance of bringing Russians back to the Ukrainian operator.

Ukrainians need to have a general idea of where the enemy is before launching a drone. And when doing such an operation, I'd expect that the drone-operator would need to move forward to stay in radio-contact with the drone. Radio-physics demands a number of attributes: high-bandwidth for the video feed for example, will only be possible from high-frequency radio, which implies line-of-sight between the drone operator and the drone.

Doing that is an offensive operation by any definition. There could be Russians in some entrenched position (hiding in a tree line) for example as you setup a drone.",1650732123.0,1650729843.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5vd3gg,,5,-2,0,-2,0,0,

The more amorphous the enemy is, the easier it is to justify an unending campaign, and thus the continued role of leaders.  The war on terrorism, the culture wars, the war on drugs, all of these are impossible to 'win' but easy to rally folks to the fight and maintain a power base.    


Even for those not in power, establishing an audience can mean that you don't deeply examine your core beliefs any longer, lest you lose your audience, and with it your chance to make money off them.    


Followers are a different breed, but I think you've got something with the notion that they tie so much of their identity in a notion that questioning it becomes a dangerous thing.  No one in the cult wants to question the leaders because then the whole thing falls apart, and not only do they lose their 'meaning' in life, but have to find another one.  


I don't have an easy answer to this problem, as it has existed for pretty much the entirety of human history.

> only 1 out 27 countries is really willing to do so this is an outlier

Not at all! If you live in the EU, you know that Orban's willingness to help Putin to the detriment of the union is hardly an outlier. It's a real issue for the EU, one that is really frustrating also because there seems to be no solution for it. The European Union has a Trojan Horse inside it and the legal structure of the Union cannot help us deal with this problem. One member is all you need to divide the EU, especially because for many decisions unanimity is required. For example, the reason we cannot impose harsher economic sanctions on Russia right now is due to the fact that a small number of members oppose them. Sometimes it can be just a single member.

The truth is that Hungary's behavior has a very negative impact on the strength of the European Union. If OP made a statement that wasn't as obvious, you may have convinced me they are ""seeding discontent"". Unfortunately, this is the truth.",False,1650702501.0,t3_u9wv3s,t1_i5us8x4,,7,-3,0,-3,0,0,

But if you insist, lets take a [random comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/u8h3or/germany_rules_out_immediate_end_to_russian_oil/i5lc3wc/) of yours (damn, you really have an obsession with germany, you got a fuckton of those):

> We understand you do not want to cut all oil and gas now, but just commit to a time time table

First of all its not about not wanting to, but not being able to without pulling the whole european union into a major financial crisis and lack of common goods like pharmaceuticals. Second there is a timeframe: [Ending oil imports from russia until the end of the year and gas imports in the middle of 2024.](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/baerbock-zu-russischem-oel-werden-bis-ende-des-jahres-bei-null-sein-li.223411) Thats currently the fastest timeframe possible.

>Just send the message that you want to do the best you can

Well, i guess sending that message doesnt matter if people like you dont actually want to read it.

> It first refused to close Nordstream 2. It wanted to just put it on hold, while Putin was playing 19 century politics in Europe.

[Nordstream 2 was stopped 2 days before the actual invasion due to the recognition of the DPR and LPR](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-to-stop-nord-stream-2/). And just for your information: Stopping the approval process of the pipeline is the only way to stop it unless you want them to personally rip out the finished pipeline from the sea.

> Then it refused to offer any weapons to Ukraine, when it was obvious they are going to be the victims of a criminal war of aggression

[2 days after the invasion the first weapon deliveries were announced, there was no refusal to offer any weapons following the outbreak of the war.](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-russia-germany-still-blocking-arms-supplies/). Yet another wrong fact.

> It even prevented other countries from sending German made weapons

It did not do that after the breakout of the war, you wont be able to find a single example for that. Before the invasion there was a small amount former german artillery pieces in estonia which needed germanys approval which was only given after the invasion. Besides delaying that approval no other country was actively prevented of sending stuff.

> Countries that were willing to help with weapons had to fly their cargo planes around Germany. 

They did not lol. I'm pretty sure you are talking about that british plane flying over the north sea, noone knows why they did that but noone needs to avoid germany to deliver weapons. In fact US bases in germany like Ramstein are likely the main logistic hubs for weapon deliveries. The only country preventing weapons being delivered through their territory is hungary. Yet another wrong fact.

> Germany opposed kicking the Russian banks from SWIFT and it is still the main roadblock against removing all of them. 

There are exemptions because the whole of europe, not just germany, needs banks to send money for gas and oil deliveries and wants to fund NGOs in russia. Taking those away would create issues for the russian opposition.

> Germany still finds silly pretexts to not send heavy weapons to Ukraine. 

While i agree that germany could spare some of its stock, its not a secret that the Bundeswehr had been seriously underfunded the last few years. Theres few to spare and most of the heavy weapons are currently scheduled for NATO duties in eastern europe. 

> Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine and Germany still refuses to help it defend itself 

Germany has send quite a lot of weapons, fuel and other support, will buy eastern european countries replacements for every soviet heavy weapon they send to ukraine and will be training them on the Panzerhaubitze 2000. Yeah thats totally refusing to help.

> still hoping probably to preserve good relations with Russia after the war is over

People like Scholz are literally saying the war can only end on ukraines terms and are burning quite a lot of bridges to russia. Such a statement can really only come from someone who gathers his knowledge from circlejerks on reddit.

Haha. Here, I'll take them one by one for you, just to show you that you guys are desperate in your attempts to cope with the truth. People who aggressively defend German politicians in these decisions are shameful. The only reason I engage with them in these comments is because I believe their hypocrisy should not be left unanswered.

> Well, your hate boner speaks for itself.

I already replied to that. This is not a rebuttal, it's self delusion. People that do not want to accept criticism believe that anyone who criticizes them must do so because they are ""haters"".

> First of all its not about not wanting to, but not being able to without pulling the whole european union into a major financial crisis

This has already been debunked. Germany stands to lose up to a few percent of its GDP until it secures other sources. The wealthiest country in Europe has to go for a year or two with an increased bill on its oil and gas. This is the argument German politicians use to explain why they do not want to make real steps to stop genocide being committed right now in Ukraine.

And do not bring ""the whole European Union"" into this. Other countries were responsible enough to not become willingly dependent for energy on an autocrat with an expansionist agenda. The other countries will manage. It is only very few - of which Germany is the richest and has the most resources to go past it - that are still opposing it.

> Nordstream 2 was stopped 2 days before the actual invasion due to the recognition of the DPR and LPR. 

Read the news of those days to learn that Germany - after many pleas from other European countries - only accepted to put the project on hold, They did not accept to cancel it at the beginning. Germany still hoped Ukraine will fall in days so they can go back to doing profitable business with Russia. They only accepted to cancel Nordstream 2 after immense pressure from the rest of EU and the United States.

> They did not lol. I'm pretty sure you are talking about that british plane flying over the north sea, noone knows why they did that but noone needs to avoid germany to deliver weapons.

Is there a counter argument in there? I cannot find one. Britain had to fly their weapons cargo for Ukraine around Germany. It's a fact. This user claims to not understand why. How difficult is it to understand why when at that time Germany kept claiming with great hypocrisy that is interested in pacifism. Germany was refusing to send weapons (before the actual invasion began) and was forbidding other countries to help with German made weapons.

> There are exemptions because the whole of europe, not just germany, needs banks to send money for gas and oil deliveries and wants to fund NGOs in russia. Taking those away would create issues for the russian opposition.

Show me where is the counter argument in there. Germany was the main country opposing removing Russian banks from SWIFT initially and it is still refusing to accept removing *all* Russian banks. This helps the Russian economy and it helps Putin finance his war in Ukraine.

> While i agree that germany could spare some of its stock, its not a secret that the Bundeswehr had been seriously underfunded the last few years. Theres few to spare and most of the heavy weapons are currently scheduled for NATO duties in eastern europe.

This is just a pretext. The German weapons manufacturer offered to send heavy weapons, it is the Chancellor that [opposed it](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/german-chancellor-stalling-heavy-weaponry-ukraine-coalition-olaf-scholz-russia-offensive). Germany sells loads of weapons but it is not willing to help Ukraine with the heavy weapons it needs to win this war. Much smaller countries were willing to raise to the occasion and do the right thing.

> Germany has send quite a lot of weapons, fuel and other support, will buy eastern european countries replacements for every soviet heavy weapon they send to ukraine and will be training them on the Panzerhaubitze 2000. Yeah thats totally refusing to help.

Yes, Germany *refuses* to send the help that is needed now to win this battle. Helmets and Panzerfausts were sufficient during the first phase of the invasion. Now Ukraine needs artillery to fend off the invader. The United States, UK, Belgium, Canada, The Netherlands and other countries understand how important this is and decided to help with these needed weapons.

> People like Scholz are literally saying the war can only end on ukraines terms and are burning quite a lot of bridges to russia. Such a statement can really only come from someone who gathers his knowledge from circlejerks on reddit.

Again, a non argument. Scholz says a lot of things because words are cheap. But when it is time to *lead* Europe in this crisis, he is hiding under the desk.

That debunk has already been debunked, mate. That was the opinion of a bunch of heavily criticized economists with no clue about the implications of running out of gas. As an example the german chemical industry - pretty much the largest in europe - would have to shut down its operations in case of a gas embargo. As a result pretty much every industry in europe using those chemicals for production (which is pretty much... everyone) wouldnt be able to produce anything. That means supply issues for every basic necessity you can imagine. This is not about a few points of GDP, but entire supply chains collapsing.

> The wealthiest country in Europe has to go for a year or two with an increased bill on its oil and gas

Lol, how naive are you to think that the price is a problem? There is literally no infrastructure to magically teleport gas from the other half of the globe to europe. There are no alternatives right now. The gas bills are already insanely high, if it would be possible the german government would instantly switch. The issue is quite obviously not the price, but having literally no gas resulting in the collapse of whole industries and homes being unheated in the winter. Norway is already trying to increase its extraction for germany, but their gas fields and infrastructure are finite.

> And do not bring ""the whole European Union"" into this. Other countries were responsible enough to not become willingly dependent for energy on an autocrat with an expansionist agenda. 

Other countries [including poland](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/26768.jpeg) are also importing large amount of their gas from russia or are importing it from germany obscuring its origin (guess where that gas is from). Exceptions would be france and spain, partially due to relying more on electricity for heating and geographical reasons. How about you stick to the facts?

> Read the news of those days to learn that Germany - after many pleas from other European countries - only accepted to put the project on hold, They did not accept to cancel it at the beginning. 

Are you reading some magical news that dont exist? Im sure you can provide some sources instead of claiming anything you want. Fun fact: Its still on hold, as literally the only way to stop it is to keep it in eternal bureaucratic limbo - it was never ""cancelled"" as a response of US or EU pressure.

> Britain had to fly their weapons cargo for Ukraine around Germany. It's a fact. This user claims to not understand why. 

No. Literally noone knows why they did it. Sadly for you, [journalists have long inquired about that](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-uk-planes-long-detour-around-germany-deliver-weapons-2022-1):

""But a spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence told Insider: ""Germany has not denied access to its airspace as the UK did not submit a request. There has been no dispute between the UK and Germany on this issue.""

And a spokesperson for the German defense ministry told Bild, ""There had been no application from the British for the flights.""

The C-17s were therefore ""not prohibited"" from using German airspace, the spokesperson said, Bild reported.""

But who cares about facts, right? You certainly dont.

> Show me where is the counter argument in there.

The counter argument is that whats germany doing this is a) agreed on by all allies which also benefit from this arrangement and b) not a bad thing like you are portraying it to be. The world is a bit more complex than what you are imagining.

> The German weapons manufacturer offered to send heavy weapons, it is the Chancellor that opposed it

They did not offer to send any weapons from their stock. Until yesterday, where the export of 100 marders was submitted, there was no request regarding exporting those. Those companies offered that the Bundeswehr sends its stock - you would know that if you read the article you linked. The 100 Panzerhaubitzen would be the entire artillery of the german armed force and only replaced from 2025 to 2027. But who reads the stuff they link as long as the headline fits, right?

> Germany sells loads of weapons

Yeah, ships and tanks with delivery times of several years to decades. Good luck, im sure Putin will wait that long. The smaller arms which can be produced faster are already being sent.

> The United States, UK, Belgium, Canada, The Netherlands and other countries understand how important this is and decided to help with these needed weapons.

The US has enough weapons on stockpile that they alone could arm ukraine. Curious that they arent sending any of the thousands abrams they got standing around. The netherlands has put the Panzerhaubitzen it will be sending in storage, unlike the Bundeswehr which is actively using those in NATO obligations and has no alternatives. Besides that, as mentioned, germany will be buying and replacing the heavy weapons other countries are sending - obviously acknowledging the need and enabling countries like slovenia to send its stock.

> Scholz says a lot of things because words are cheap. 

He actually does not say a lot of things, thats literally the reason why he is being criticized as he does not explain his decisions properly. But that you arent actually familiar with the political surroundings was already blatantly obvious.

>  He, and the German government, have been stalling and dragging feet every step of the way ever since this crisis started and even before that.
