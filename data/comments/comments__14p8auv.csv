>This report analyses ten suspected Russian war crimes carried out using the Shahed-136. The attacks targeted residential buildings, power plants, businesses, a school and a children's summer camp. In each instance, we have explored the circumstances around the attack, the presence of military objects or activity in the vicinity of targeted objects, the result of the attacks, including the level of damage and casualties, and the means by which we have identified the Shahed-136 as being used.

>We find that Russia‚Äôs attacks are, on the face of it, intentionally aimed at the civilian population and infrastructure, with no tangible military advantage gained as a result of them. These are fundamental conditions that must be met in order for an attack to be assessed as a war crime, and in each case study, we examine the legal background behind our assessment.

>America‚Äôs Founders upended history when they forged a republic based on individual freedom and political pluralism, pledging to live as ‚Äúfree and independent states.‚Äù It was, and is, the greatest attempt in history to rid mankind of tyranny. They broke with centuries of subservience to create a new type of nation, one where all are equal and live free.

>A decade ago the current boss of Russia wrote that ‚ÄúAmerica is not exceptional.‚Äù What he did later shows what he really meant. Many tyrants in human history have claimed global influence, but none of them could inspire the rest of the world to strive for the best in human nature. That‚Äôs why today‚Äôs Russian tyrants, like all tyrants, are fundamentally weak and their regime will crumble over time.

>When Russia fully invaded Ukraine in 2022, it was an attempt not only to bring the Ukrainian people under Vladimir Putin‚Äôs dictatorial rule, but also to extinguish the ideals that inspire people to be free.

If‚ÄîGod forbid‚ÄîRussia were to succeed in Ukraine, it would further embolden countries like Iran to take up arms against free peoples elsewhere in the world.

> In the Zaporizhia direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with the support of artillery, carried out offensive operations near Rabotin. **There is some progress. To the east, Ukrainian units attacked at Lugovskoy and managed to take a number of positions.** Russian troops attacked the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kamyshevakh, Novoandreevka, Orekhovo and Novodanilovka.

> In the Uglidar sector, Ukrainian troops tried to conduct assault operations in the Priyutnoye area. No promotion. Under shelling their positions in Zeleny Pole, Storozhevoe, Makarovka, Blagodatny and Zolotoy Niva. **It is worth saying that the intensity and width of the front of the work of Russian artillery have decreased in recent days.**

> On the Donetsk front, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, after artillery strikes, traditionally attacked in Maryinka. They carried out similar actions on the southwestern approaches to Avdiivka. **No success.**

Admission of Ukrainian advances, denial of Russian advances that were being reported yesterday, and perhaps most interestingly a sign that Ukraine‚Äôs relentless counterbattery and logistics strategy is working.

Rybar also reports:

> Northeast of Bakhmut, **AFU units managed to break through the first line of defence and reach the outskirts of Berkhivka.** Russian troops conducted a number of counterattacks and regained lost positions, the situation in the area is generally controlled.

> On the southern flank, severe clashes continue on Klishchiivka -Kurdyumivka line. Attempts of enemy assault groups to seize strongholds and heights are suppressing by small arms and artillery fire.

> In Vremivka sector of the front, AFU continues to attack in small groups at Pryyutne - Staromaiors'ke line. **Russian units have so far managed to slow the enemy down,** eliminating dozens of militants every day.

> In Orikhiv sector, the enemy managed to buckle in Russian defence about 300 meters north of Robotyne. After regrouping, Russian servicemen launched a counterattack, recapturing most of the lost positions.

> In Kherson direction, **fighting continues in the riverbank zone near Antonovskiy Bridge. A complete sweep of the terrain is complicated by the active work of enemy artillery from the opposite bank of Dnipro.**

Interesting notes here: anything short of absolute success by Russian forces (‚Äúslowed down the enemy‚Äù, ‚Äúgenerally under control‚Äù) may suggest the news is a lot worse than it sounds, and the literal bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro is still active.",1688405580.0,1688404297.0,t3_14p8auv,t3_14p8auv,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Ukraine's counter-offensive may be slow, and relatively cautious at this stage.

""You will see this soon,"" he said.

Same thing with repairs, the money wasn't enough to do all repairs so they fudged - but absent the fudging only slightly more could have been repaired.

The top people must have known that the army was partly smoke and mirrors. So likely they didn't think that it would be actual fighting.

The reason that area is so heavily defended is if Ukraine reaches the Azov sea, Russia's position is more or less impossible.

Yes, definitely.  We won't be able to do this if we end up in a war with China somewhere and they start manufacturing Shahed equivalents.

The west squandered almost a year of war equivocating over what weapons to send.

However, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese‚Äôs attendance at the NATO summit in July is another opportunity for Australia to take a more meaningful package to the core group of nations fighting for Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty and against Moscow‚Äôs authoritarian aggression.

Such a package would be consistent with the Defence Strategic Review, which rightly recognised that deterrence must be the cornerstone concept of a national defence strategy, including through working with partners.

Vitally, this is not just about a war on the other side of the world that we can choose to ignore. To help deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific, we must help Ukraine prevail in Europe. Partners must provide the necessary military support to Ukraine to take advantage of current operational advantage ‚Äì heightened by the turmoil of the Prigozhin mutiny ‚Äì and push Russia out of its territory to reclaim its sovereignty.

While the bulk will need to come from NATO members, Australia, as a NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner, has much to offer. In terms of military equipment, Defence should look harder at what is possible for a friend suffering war crimes, and not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It‚Äôs likely we can afford to send some Hawkeis, and the previously dismissed but now live option of jets in the form of retired FA-18 Hornet fourth-generation fighters.

Failure in Ukraine would only embolden authoritarian aggression elsewhere in the world and could fatally undermine the notion of collective security. This includes the framework of international laws that provide vital protections and establish inviolable rights for states and civilians alike, also known as the international rules-based system.

Ukraine is fighting for its very survival ‚Äì as a nation, a people, a culture. It cannot and will not stop. It is fighting within and beyond Ukraine, using every available lever: political, technological, military, economic, diplomatic and, importantly, informational.

Russia‚Äôs fight is for a fiction, laid bare in unexpected and dramatic fashion by Vladimir Putin‚Äôs own creation Yevgeny Prighozin over an extraordinary weekend. It is a fiction based on Putin‚Äôs obsession to restore the Soviet Union, scaffolded by a complex information warfare campaign and enforced with heavy-handed violence at home and atrocities in Ukraine.

Despite an unconvincing start, key actors within NATO ‚Äì the Baltic states, Poland, the UK and the US ‚Äì unwound entrenched institutional inertia to provide support. Germany has gone from offering helmets to tanks. This collective success seems to have surprised almost as many in the West as it has Putin (and likely his ‚Äúno limits‚Äù partner, China‚Äôs President Xi Jinping).
The key lesson that Ukraine and the free world want Xi to take away is that unilateral authoritarian aggression will not succeed.
Australia‚Äôs and Japan‚Äôs support have been important in reinforcing the fact that Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine is a global issue, not just an Atlantic problem. The Indo-Pacific has a key interest in ensuring that the rule of law prevails, that Ukraine prevails, and that there is no perception that crises and conflicts can be ‚Äúregional‚Äù and ‚Äúcontained‚Äù.
We cannot stem the contagion of war and the erosion of collective security unless we deny Russia its aims and hold it responsible for its actions.

Ukraine‚Äôs partnerships are among the asymmetric advantages it holds ‚Äì along with the iron will of its people and its masterful use of strategic communications. But the partnerships are only useful if the partners provide real resources that give Ukraine its much-needed military edge.
The longer the war goes on, the more uncertainty there will be ‚Äì across changes in governments, economies and popular support. The longer it takes to defeat Russia‚Äôs aggression, restore the rule of law, and ensure justice for Russia‚Äôs crimes, the greater the risk to our efforts to deter any such aggression in the Indo-Pacific.

The time to end the war in Ukraine is now. Russia is significantly weakened, but there are opportunities on which Ukraine can capitalise only if it has greater technological and military assistance from countries like Australia. This could likely enable the Ukrainians to push the Russian military back to its borders.
If it‚Äôs clear that Russia is failing to achieve its aims, Xi‚Äôs concern will grow. Xi and his military are excellent students of strategy and warfare. The key lesson that Ukraine and the free world want Xi to take away ‚Äì in the interests of global peace and security ‚Äì is that unilateral authoritarian aggression will not succeed and comes at unacceptable cost: economically, militarily, politically. If that can be achieved, deterrence in the Pacific will be significantly bolstered.

Beyond that signal to other authoritarians, the lessons from Ukraine can help Australia build the stronger and more focused force the government wants. It can enable policymakers to better understand necessary industrial capability, and ultimately help deter aggression in the Pacific.

As Albanese heads for the NATO summit in Vilnius this month, he should offer everything Australia possibly can afford, confident that any concerns about depleting our own capability are outweighed by the cost of failing to provide Ukraine with relevant support today.",False,1688434401.0,t3_14p8auv,t1_jqkw5i7,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

Absolutely not. You can't turn a nuclear power plant into anything resembling a nuclear weapon. The best Russia will be able to do is release radioactive material into the surrounding area, [which has a very limited effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bomb#Tests)

The geopolitical response will be proportional to the threat. Hopefully Ukraine's allies will take the threat of what Russia is willing to do seriously and pull out all the stops in terms of sending them what they need.

The core contains a lot of radioactive fission and activation products that could be dispersed by an explosion and wherever the debris lands would need extensive cleanup. If they set the core on fire, radioactive smoke could be dispersed into the atmosphere.

The surrounding area would likely need to be evacuated, as well as the area downwind. Luckily the reactor has been in a shutdown state for a while now, and because of the laws of physics, the most radioactive particles also decay the fastest. So the fallout would **not** be as deadly as it could be.

As for geopolitical considerations, blowing up the plant would likely bring Poland into the war at the very least, which would likely bring in the rest of NATO. Likely the war would be limited to Ukraine and Belarus bc invading Russia might prompt them to launch nukes.

All while having mouthpieces in the world's democracies say that Ukraine was to blame.  If there were additional goals like making the land uninhabitable or drawing in nato to give an excuse to end the war, then then the radiation release could be much larger.

russia has a strong history of threatening so many terror attacks that don't come, that when they do come it's sometimes almost surprising.

It is a lot more alarming than I think a lot of people in the democratic world are willing to admit at this point.  
  
Basically, the narrative paints the world's liberal democracies as forcing everyone to be subjugated under a monolithic set of values defined by liberalism, much the same way Nazis sought to impose their value set on Europe (this is an actual comparison Russia makes).  There is a hint of truth to it, but like most propaganda the devil is in the details.  It is true that the west generally will not associate with tyrants, countries with horrifying human rights records, or ones which openly state they want to harm western institutions.  It is also true that the west uses various forms of soft and hard power to marginalize these influences.  Much like a normal, well adjusted person would not knowingly associate with a murderer or rapist, and support measures to marginalize their influence.  Like so much right wing whining, it really boils down to ""we don't like these consequences of our words and actions.""
  
The reality is, the things that the world's autocrats are upset about are typically not mere differences of opinion.  The red lines in question here are again, things which most reasonable people would never want to associate with.  And for the most part, the west is not even actively hunting down these influences or anything - it is just exerting its right to freely associate or not associate with people of its own choosing.

For those of you that weren't around in the 2000s - this was how it was. We had numerous soc. sites that vied for our attention- we picked face book, Twitter, and eventually reddit from countless choices. 

I hesitate to give any advice here - Mastodon seems hellbent on doing the right thing, but tos can change quick with a buyout (which I dont see happening soon, but ie reddit).

Bluesky outright says it owns anything put on there. I agree its just another billionaire.

 So I'd pick Mastodon. There are others, but really this is all up to a critical mass of users.

QUOTE: The other massive threat is Russian MiG-31s and Su-35s flying with long range R-37 missiles.  These have been particularly lethal against Ukrainian MiG-29s and Su-27s. These Russian aircraft can see further and shoot at longer range than the F-16 MLUs.

Most people imagine modern air combat to look like Top Gun. In reality, it's mostly fought Beyond Visual Range (BVR). The guy with the more powerful radar and longer range missiles usually wins. Dogfighting is something of an afterthought, even in training. 

While we paid a price for this thinking in Vietnam, radars and missiles (and the situation) have evolved such that in Ukraine air-to-air combat has played out as BVR only, and the Russians are consistently winning fights with bigger better radars and longer range missiles. 

The F-16 MLU doesn't change this equation. It's small, antique APG-66 radar can't see as far as bigger, more modern Russian radars on the MiGs and Sukhois. The R-37 has a significantly longer range than the AIM-120C. And it (potentially) gets worse. 

Russia has A-50 AEW&C aircraft for long range detection, targeting and cuing. Ukraine doesn't have an equivalent. If they did, it might allow Ukraine to fire AIM-120s at data-linked targets without turning on their APG-66 radars, mitigating radar counter-detection.",False,1688397807.0,t3_14p8auv,t1_jqi8u89,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

The F-16 would be capable of detecting further out (they have a reported ~180mi range) if they have the upgraded radar, that advantage drops to ~90mi with the original radars (older). The key would be what kit the F-16's get .. if they get modern ordinance, they'd probably outmatch a lot of what Russia is willing to use.

And before some answer: Tf you know. You internet stranger.

I'm very deeply pro Ukraine. But that does not mean that anybody should discard independent reports that there are no mines on the cooler pools and important premise as Ru-propaganda. It's literally only the SBU pressing that claim, with various media sourcing their claims to the SBU. Independent IAEA observers, present AT THE SITE repeatedly stated that there is no evidence of mines. Russia itself stated 'We only placed mines in non-important areas'. Sure, Russia is not very credible, but the IAEA is no propaganda tool.

Articles like 'Rosatom advised their employees to leave the premise' is not 'Russia plans to blow the site' but 'The frontline is moving closer and we advice our non-vital employees to take every precaution necessary to move out of harms way.'.

NATO said 'Any spec of radioactive dust or every radioactive droplet of water on NATO sail will immediately activate Article 5!'. So it does not make ANY sense for Russia to blow the nuclear plant up.

And before someone answers 'The Nova Kharkova dam blowing up wasn't rational either', yes. But there are more than quite a few overlapping reports that the damn blew up due to Russian sappers miscalculating explosives and mines. Miscalculations that wont happen in the the nuclear plant, as there are no mines in vital places that can blew up in a cascade effect and literally no literal cascades with thousands of tons of water pouring down the severely damage and subsequently massively brittle/unstable structure.",1688434874.0,1688433678.0,t3_14p8auv,t1_jqkr0u2,,3,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Well that's kind of the big deal about giving them F16's and such. They'll have access to a huge swath of the NATO air-launched/dropped inventory and at full capability.

Right now a few of the pieces of kit we've handed over, like the HARM missiles, do not work at their full capabilities because they've had to be jury-rigged. With the HARM missiles for example, they have three modes.

 * The more powerful radar systems on the fighter collect data and feed targeting information to the missile.
 * The missile itself talks to the fighter and lets it know when it's figured out a viable target.
 * The missile is programmed with a GPS location to try and reach and hopes it spots something on the way in.

Right now Ukraine can only use HARM in the last mode and the problem is that since the missile cannot talk with their aircraft computers, the only time you can program the target destination is on the ground before the plane takes off. This means you have to have a ready plane, get the GPS coordinates, feed them into the computer, take off, move into position, and fire, all in less than an hour or so before the target SAM shuts off and starts moving.

With an F16/F18, they'll be able to fly patrols with these missiles mounted, and seconds after a russian radar lights up the sky, it's targeted and the missile's ready to fly.

And that leaves aside a lot of other kit which requires a connection to a NATO configured aircraft computer in order to operate correctly.

The HARM missiles and their ilk will enable Ukraine to better (but likely not completely) clear the skies so they can operate their aircraft at higher altitudes where MANPADs can't reach them.

Reason: Losing in Ukraine would make a large, WW3-style confrontation inevitable and exponentially increase the risk of a global all-out nuclear exchange. The reason is the following:

- It undermines the idea of a rule-based international order and legitimizes nuclear blackmail. Losing or giving up Ukraine means that the threat of nuclear use was successfully deployed by Russia to make territorial gains. This will not go unnoticed, other nuclear powers would start to consider this option, non-nuclear powers would quickly strive to become nuclear powers to either counter that threat or gain that option as well.

- Since it worked, it will encourage Putin to try this again with someone else, since there is no detriment not to. Why should he stop with Ukraine when this approach works so well.
