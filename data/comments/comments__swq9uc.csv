Amazing interview at Munich from DW with Constanze Stelzenmüller (foreign policy expert) - few things jumped out at me:

* Ukraine is a top 10 producer of several agricultural products; with global inflation already running rampant, this will worsen and a major driver of political destabilisation in the early 2010s was down to food price inflation.
* Germany is trying to balance a lot of relationships and is very much stuck between multiple super powers as it tries to prosper.
* Russia is still significantly concerned by the increasing political/economic cooperatioon across Europe, the US and their willingness to take actions which harm Russia but also harm themselves economically.
* Its German focused of course but I think what comes out to me very much and in the whole crisis is that Germany is increasingly of importance to US interest.

Local residents are concerned with the behaviour of soldiers, who blow off steam & the article hints that soldiers from other parts of Russia (non-Slavic) are the centre of tensions. Nothing like racism to help an army unite. 3/9

An extended period of heavy vehicles in the area has damaged roads & other infrastructure. The article says the Russians don't care and that probably there isn't the money to repair what were new roads anyway. 5/9

Videos of soldiers complaining of bad food have been uploaded to social media. If unable to barter for food (see next tweet), domestic animals vanish.  Locals are too scared to report any of this to their authorities who probably can't do much to young men with guns anyway. 7/9

Due to boredom, alcoholism, bad food & poor pay, soldiers are starting to sell/trade military equipment for goods. Diesel fuel & uniforms are common goods but the article reports even weapons can be acquired - all written off as ""losses"". 8/9

Anti-aircraft fire was recorded over Donetsk at 10 PM Ukraine time yesterday. Videos have surfaced of Russian armoured and mobile artillery convoys with friendly indicators on them, in the letter ""Z"" painted onto the backs of vehicles. The normal ceasefire violation rate is 4 - 8 incidents per day. Now, we're experiencing 1500 - 1800 per day. Ukraine is already in a state of renewed warfare with Russia. If you're at war with another country, and they violate your ceasefires by 2000 incidents, that's not a ceasefire anymore. You've already gone to battle.

The separatist leader of the Donetsk People's Republic (which occupies part of Donbas), Denis Pushilin, has claimed that if the situation worsens, he'll call for Russian Army reinforcements. For context, the DPR and LPR (Luhansk People's Republic) have claimed that the Ukrainian Army has been shelling them with Artillery, they've evacuated 10000 citizens and mandated forced military service for men 18 - 55. Russia claims that the Ukrainian Army have shelled them with Artillery in Rostov Oblast. Rostov just so happens to host a massive gathering of Russian forces, and is currently under martial law because of national security concerns.

Another telling aspect to me is how refutations against a Russian invasion are either from Russian troll bots, or American conservatives who claim U.S. intelligence is unreliable. Yet they'll never elaborate on this. They'll state a thesis, and then both deny and deflect, before insulting you over social media. There are no logically structured arguments against what declassified NATO military intelligence is out there. This tells me that these individuals are speaking from emotion, and are afraid of what could happen, rather than factually disputing the on-ground information. Thus their own perspectives are unlikely to happen in real-time.

The fact of the matter is that global leadership has been declining for several decades. This has apparently culminated with ongoing crises such as the pandemic, economic collapse and now regional European war. Millions are already dead from these problems. Other issues have included life-long debt, unaffordable living, wage stagnation, malnutrition (obesity), drug addiction, criminality and suicide. Something has to give, because this chronic stress is unsustainable. And it's going to give way very soon, it seems.",False,1645345367.0,t3_swq9uc,t3_swq9uc,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

If I didn’t have the surgery, I would still be in Kyiv. However, instead of leaving my cat there with my friend to watch him, I’ve taken him with me at the last minute just in case something happens.

I’ll be in Berlin for two weeks to recover, and depending on the situation at that time, will either return to Ukraine or not (all I would lose is a $900 security deposit on my apartment if I peaced out totally, but would like to at least get the rest of my things out of there if nothing else). 

Kyiv today was very calm like any other Sunday, airport was unremarkable. Up until Friday I was very much downplaying the likelihood of large-scale invasion but obviously with today’s announcement about “indefinite exercises” in Belarus, it’s certainly becoming more of a пиздец. 

I’m very disappointed in the US and Europe – I think Zelensky is absolutely correct that the West needs to publish what the sanctions would be, were Putin to invade. If Putin is going to play the “I’m not touching you, I’m not touching you” game, the rest of the world can at least say fuck around and find out with a list of how they’ll upend his entire economy.

 Right now everyone is bending over while a clear aggressor tries to tank another country (in both meanings of that double-entendre). This sends the message that the ball is always in the belligerent’s court, and any warmonger autocrat can cause lasting damage to sovereign nations, and only will face consequences when people die (if even then).

>Consider Mr Putin’s war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country’s foreign policy.

""LUGANSK, February 20. /TASS/. The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) attempted to attack the positions of the people's militia of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). This was stated on Sunday by the official representative of the People's Militia of the LNR, Ivan Filiponenko.

""At around 5 am (coincides with Moscow time - TASS note) on February 20, servicemen of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade attempted to attack the positions of the people's militia in the area of ​​​​the settlement of Pionerskoye with the crossing of the Seversky Donets River. As a result of the clash, the enemy suffered losses and retreated "", - he said.

""The criminal actions of the Ukrainian armed forces led to the destruction of five residential buildings and casualties among the civilian population. Additional data is being specified,"" Filiponenko informed.""

There's absolutely no natural defenses. Zero. Except for the Dniepr, but it's not like they haven't been building a bridge over it a few hours ago. Otherwise, it's the perfect tank racing setup. Great for empires around, but absolutely trash for anyone wishing to build a long-lasting state there.

Plus, it's not like Putin isn't already encircling Ukraine from three sides - you have big bad Russia in the East, its little puppet Belarus in the North, and Russian-owned waters in the South, complete with warships and stuff. If they really want to invade, they can do it in like, a few days? Plus, the ground is frozen, so there's absolutely zero problem for them if they want to send the tanks in. They didn't choose the time randomly - it's not like they didn't already invade in late February last time, when they took Crimea.

Because, yeah, they already did it - why wouldn't they do it again? They have a better economy (sanctions don't work), a better army, a better everything - plus they know NATO can't fast-track Ukraine into joining anymore. In other words, they can start pouring the tanks in, and there's literally nobody who could (or would) stop them.

Oh, and also, they have nukes. And guess who else had nukes? Ukraine. Guess what they did? They gave them up for promises of security. And we see where that ""security"" is now.

I grew up an immigrant, my parents escaped Syria for these exact reasons Ukrainians are dealing with today. It aches me even more being able to live a form of the American dream, while there are still people out there who have to die so they can be more like us. Just think about that. Sometimes that guilt being an immigrant never goes away, especially when you know you were just one of the lucky few. 

I used to pray, and sometimes I don't. And I used to believe in a god. And sometimes I'm reminded of all the fucked up things in the world, and how everything is just chance. There will always be a world where I view myself as a dead Syrian soldier today. Knowing I would not have made it past 30 if my family stayed back home. I would have been drafted to War, brainwashed, and ended up abusive with PTSD like my father was. 

All this war, always leads to pain. Our generation understands this the most, and I have a firm belief that we are all equally fucking tired of it. We understand what this does to us, we know that just the idea of all this anticipation is enough to cause trauma. 

I can only imagine what it would be like for me today, how different my life would be if we never left Syria.  I can only imagine if I was finally free and independent and 8 years later 150,000 soldiers lined outside the country I call my new home.

Putin just wants to posture, but by unexpectedly going “come on then” and calling his bluff, the west have made Putin’s options suddenly a lot less palatable:

1. An expensive invasion that will cost lives and military hardware (including planes and even ships - Ukraine have state of the art anti ship cruise missiles). Top that off with sanctions and it may well well cripple an already fragile Russian economy.

2. Keeping the forces deployed indefinitely , which is both expensive and strategically risky given how overcommitted Russia will be to one area.

Install some pro-Russian Government? It won’t have the support of those 40m people, which means it can’t rule without constant use of force, Russian friendly police and a large occupation force. 

Russia cannot sustain this. Despite Ukraine being militarily inferior, it will still put up a reasonable fight and there’ll be enough citizens to frustrate any occupation force for years. I still can’t see Russia actually taking any concrete steps to physically send it’s marked forces into Ukraine.

Hopefully will look back on this post in a week or two and will be proved accurate. This silliness achieves nothing and ironically makes Russia LESS safe from Western nations. Not more.",1645324232.0,1645324137.0,t3_swq9uc,t3_swq9uc,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

Of course we don't have propaganda like they have in Russia but to be fair, news in general in the last year's had a bad reputation.

Right now the news is that Russia wants more than just Ukraine, but are there hard facts or is this more western leaders saying it as ""Russia bad"" campaign?

,swq9uc,hxoasph,"it’s my theory that the so called, “Poland” we’ve always learned about in history and geography, has never actually existed until 2017 when a country was made which copied fortnite. So while this theory does completely make sense, there are a few objections I need to address. “What about the history that proves “Poland” exists?” Well I did a quick google search and the only thing I could find on things “Poland” has done was create a type of polish vodka dating back to the middle ages, but wikipedia clearly lied here, since we all know all vodka was created by a clan of russia bears in 1273.

There were some really good wrote ups about how difficult it is to maintain a high level military operation using things other than small arms and more traditional unguided heavy weaponry like tanks and classic artillery. In fact outside of the US military industrial complex, and maybe China with their current level of manufacturing capacity along with large domestic supply of raw materials/chemicals, there probably aren’t any modern nations that could maintain the type of ware fare that the US/nato engaged in during the “war on terror” for example. 

I just don’t think people realize how much resources are required to sustain large scale military operations. Russia’s economy is around the size of the State of Texas, smaller than Italy and Canadas, now ask yourself could Canada or Italy sustain a full on war with Europe? Russia has a massive amount of equipment sure, but their fighter technology has lagged behind the west for some time, and outside of their newest SAM platforms, again mostly deployed for defense of Russia, don’t have much that could counter out F-22’s and F-35’s and even their newest 4++ stuff (su-35 for example) is matches by the newer blocs of our older F18’s and things like the Eurofighter. We also have incredibly potent defenses against Russias newest ballistic missile tech in our Rim-161 and THAAD systems, which deployment of in and around Europe has become a massive issue for Russia with many defense experts suggesting the huge leaps the Us and some other western nations have been taking in anti ballistic missile tech is almost forcing Russia to act now to take any large swaths of territory it ever hopes to gain while some of their short and medium range stuff is still seen as a major threat. 

There’s also the fact that I highly doubt China would support Russia if a full out European war broke out, as secondary sanctions would likely cripple China who’s in a very precarious spot with their domestic economy should they be the main supporter of Russia. China has shown they aren’t too concerned with the territorial issues in European and are much more focused on expansionist policy in the pacific. If Russia tried to engage in a large scale war they’d basiclly be relying almost entirely on China to make up their lost productivity by the west  completely turning off access to their economies for Russia. 

Finally, you have to ask what the Russian people are willing to accept. It’s pretty well accepted that a majority of Russia would probably support a takeover of Ukraine, or at least action to get nato troops directly off its border. Think for example if Mexico elected a new government that was very anti USA, and then looked at teaming up with China and Russia to deploy tens of thousands of troops with high tech cruise/ballistic missiles and long range surface to air missiles that could hit major population centers like LA, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dalllas, Houston, etc in less than an hour. Do you think the US population would feel comfortable with that, or would they expect the government to act especially if they could before more major deployment of these imaginary forces. While we might want some action, I don’t think the government would have a mandate to invade all of Latin and South America once it ended some of the threat at the border. I think the same is going on with Russia, there’s a sense of Natio is already on huge parts of our border, but we won’t allow that to happen in Ukraine and that’s final, but beyond that I don’t think they have much desire to push further at this point.

""When Ukraine elected corrupt oligarch billionaire and pro-NATO President Petro Poroshenko, replacing corrupt pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, Putin took decisive action to keep Ukraine out of NATO and the EU. He declared Poroshenko’s government to be a modern Nazi party, a theory based on delusions and string, and sent Russian troops disguised as pro-Russian locals to hold a popular referendum on whether Crimeans wanted to join Russia or get shot where they stood. 96.77% of respondents voted to join Russia (local community activists put the real number at about 20%), and the international community labeled the entire Crimea adventure “the Russian annexation of Crimea.” Russia disputes this characterization the way Trump denies the 2020 US election results.Torture and other human rights abuses of hundreds have characterized the Russian occupation of Crimea, but most Crimeans keep their head down and Russia treats that compliant set like citizens with rights. Selective application of human rights is one of the hallmarks of tyranny.Russia also invaded eastern Ukraine, justifying themselves with the argument that the far east was mostly Russian, mostly pro-Moscow, and the imaginary Nazis just elected would otherwise have killed them off. Poroshenko, bloated plutocrat that he was, still managed to arrange an impressively effective resistance to Russian aggression in the east, but that took all his forces. All he could do about Crimea was dam up the North Crimean Canal that supplies Crimea most of their drinking water. Crimea’s agriculture was destroyed, and the population is chronically short of drinking water. Russia spent a ton of money trying to build wells and things, but it’s not really working.Putin has to get Ukraine to open up that canal.""",False,1645334816.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxo4k5q,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Remember, the average American citizen didn’t even know about the existence of the concentration camps, and even if we did we had a pretty isolationist policy at the time.

That said, I do see the point of that Tweet. I also agree with what Zelensky said in Munich yesterday that if they are not going to receive help from the US/UK then they should be allowed to have their own nukes again, seems fair considering the agreement we made with Ukraine.

Personally however, I do not support us getting involved unless a NATO member state is harmed. I don’t want us to go back to pre-WWII isolationist tendencies, but I also think we have been way too involved in way too many countries at our citizens (and the other countries citizens, let’s be honest) detriment.

Russia's aversion to NATO is directly tied to Russia's desire to be the local superpower and hold a sphere of influence over the former soviet states. This isn't about borders. Russia already shares a border with NATO through Latvia and Estonia. This is about Russia losing what they feel should be their fiefdoms to the west. And if those countries that left your sphere of influence grow more than you, how does that reflect on you to your own people?

Additionally, politicians and diplomats have no power in Russia. Russia is ruled by a cabinet of relics from the Soviet Union, many of them former KGB members.

if they are going for everything, they will launch special forces from Transnistria, supported by air dropped armor and infantry from Belarus and circling around through the black sea, landing ships and floating ifv's will launch from Crimea, and come through the south. medium and light armor, along with mechanized infantry will deploy along the north from Belarus, crossing pontoon bridges and moving through Chernobyl. to the northeast, east, and southeast through donbas you will see massed mechanized infantry, the bulk of their forces and Mbt's, along with self propelled artillery, separatist units and conscripted troops are likely to make up the first wave as fodder to sus out Ukrainian positions.

in the other case, they will target everything east of the Dnieper, along with Kiev to decapitate the leadership, and the coast to take ports and refinery's, the strategy will be overall similar, but they will avoid the western Ukrainian heartland to create a NATO buffer, and keeping the most important, and easily defended terrain, eventually Russia will probably try to grab the whole nation, particularly if they don't have too much trouble with guerilla's.

in either case one can expect the Russians to use white phosphorus and even possibly chemical attacks on any established position near Donbas, along with massed artillery and airstrikes. Ukraine's Sam's and air force will not last the first hour, likely not even getting off the ground, their navy is in a similar state. in the first day, any visible armor, emplaced artillery, bunker, military vehicle, and even a great portion of civilian vehicles will be targeted by precision loitering munitions, deployed in mass in the tens to hundreds of thousands, and possibly dronelike/""AI"" in guidance. attack helicopter fleets with units in the hundreds will assault the south, and the northeast. all military buildings, munitions depots and bases will be bombed to hell with massed bombs, cluster munitions, and airdropped mines, with following strikes to animate any remaining ground forces. airfields are likely the exception to this, as they pose little threat and are important bases for Russia to capture.

Russia will break any networked communication line along with massed cyberwarfare attacks and radio jamming, ending civilian and military commination's in Ukraine, and possibly the neighboring nations. along with this, it is feared Russia already has special forces in the range 100 to 1000+ already deployed within Ukraine ready to decapitate leadership and launch assaults on bases and depots.

i would not put it past Russia to use a nuclear weapon to scare to west at some point of this conflict, especially if they lose bad. as from what i hear and read, Putin is eager to have ""his"" new weapons tested, but this could just be fearmongering.

&#x200B;

As for what Ukraine can do, not a whole lot besides drawing it out, going full Taliban, and inflicting more casualties unless something miraculous happens. i have specifics, but given Russia's incompetence i would not want to somehow accidently give away Ukraine's plans, though i doubt Russia is competent enough to read what armchair redditors think on the topic. Russia has proven itself to be shockingly incompetent in the recent past, both militarily and particularly with it's current propaganda / disinformation campaigns, but they are mostly targeted at their own people soo...

2/25/22 Edit: though the time is long past, i made a few mistakes with my observations, such as confusing who was using the loitering munitions in the Armenia-Azerbaijan war. assuming there were any significant Russian forces in Moldova and Transnistria. also in dismissing the northern and southern pushes due to the Crimean and Chernobyl bottlenecks making it a hell of a place to get fired on by at, which appears to have been mild at best. I'm somewhat surprised Russia used their paratroopers as mech inf, throwing great numbers into reportedly suicidal pushes where they were reportedly lost. and did not do even small, equally suicidial ""naval"" deployments. also I underestimated how crazy Putin was.",1645802179.0,1645344494.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxohfif,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

My unqualified armchair advice to the resistance would be to take their fight over the border.

The West could use this as a spring board to bring Ukraine into Nato so that is worth considering as well if you are going to take both sides into account.

However it appears objectively true that Russia conducted very large military exercises on the border of Ukraine. The size and scope appears excessive and is what precipitated the crisis in the first place. So we can reasonably assume they had something to gain and some intention behind doing it.

There’s a very real sense by many defense experts that Putin sees this as his only chance to “cheaply” invade Ukraine or at least take large portions of it under effective Russian control, having to only really expend lower tier army resources so to speak, no advanced 4++ aircraft and bombers that take years to build and cost hundreds of millions a pop, or use newer ballistic missiles that are $10 million+ per shot so to speak, especially seeing how weak their economy is at the moment. There was good reporting about them having to suspend bombing campaigns multiple times in Syria because they couldn’t keep a consistent supply of guided munitions available to the Air Force. As of now they could probably take a lot of Ukraine using mostly small arms, tanks, traditional mortars and limited use of the Air Force beyond solidifying air superiority and quickly taking out critical infrastructure and major defensive positions, then let the ground forces deal with the rest and when they do need to use things like ballistic missiles Ukraine doesn’t really have the ability to counter much so they can use their very large stockpile of Cold War era missiles and not need to expend the aforementioned new stuff that’s really expensive and probably in short supply already.",False,1645329375.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxntfb2,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Even if the Russian army managed to force Kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties, the damage to Russia’s national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains.

>The problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex Crimea and to stir conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region. The fact that Russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war.

>When it comes to Ukraine, people in Moscow and the West can be forgiven for assuming that the Kremlin’s policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons. What actually drives the Kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to President Vladimir Putin, as well as those of the Russian leader himself. Emboldened by perceptions of the West’s terminal decline, no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with America and Europe. In fact, the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism.

>Consider Mr Putin’s war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country’s foreign policy.

>In recent years members of this group have become very vocal. Messrs Patrushev and Naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and Russia’s international role. According to them, the American-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of Western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance, multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities. A new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values. A feisty, resurgent Russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order, along with a rising China. Given the state of affairs in western countries, the pair contend, it's only natural that they seek to contain Russia and to install pro-Western regimes in former Soviet republics. The West’s ultimate goal of a colour revolution in Russia itself would lead to the country’s conclusive collapse.

>Washington sees unfinished business in Russia’s persistence and success, according to Mr Putin’s entourage. As America’s power wanes, its methods are becoming more aggressive. This is why the West cannot be trusted. The best way to ensure the safety of Russia’s existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep America off balance.

>Seen this way, Ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle. >The stakes could not be higher. Should Moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence, Russia’s endurance as a great power will itself be under threat. On a personal level, the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of Soviet nostalgia, great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the Russian Orthodox faith. The fact that the new elite in Kyiv glorifies the Ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at Moscow is a huge personal affront.

>Why then are the people around Putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions? In their eyes, the sanctions that the West imposed to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas were intended largely to check Russia’s rise. America and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another, they were just looking for an excuse. Since 2014 such views have solidified. Messrs Patrushev, Bortnikov and Naryshkin all find themselves on the U.S. Treasury’s blacklist already, along with many other members of Mr Putin’s inner circle. There is no way back for them to the West’s creature comforts. They are destined to end their lives in Fortress Russia, with their assets and their relatives alongside them.

>As for sanctions by sector, including those that President Joe Biden’s team plans to impose should Russia invade Ukraine, these may end up largely strengthening the hard men’s grip on the national economy. Import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies, including through Rostec. The massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of Mr Putin’s from his KGB days in East Germany, Sergey Chemezov. In a similar vein, a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned Russia has led to spectacular growth in Russian agribusiness. The sector is overseen by Mr Patrushev’s elder son Dmitry, who is Mr Putin’s agriculture minister.

>Similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which, unsurprisingly enough, are also filled with KGB veterans. If anything, further sanctions wouldn’t just fail to hurt Mr Putin’s war cabinet, they would secure its members' place as the top beneficiaries of Russia’s deepening economic autarky. The same logic is true of domestic politics: as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege, the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime. That further cements the hard men’s grip on the country.

You also  have a hard really enjoy things in life the same when you're entire family isn't around to see it. 
Especially when our culture is built on big families and support systems. We all grew up poor, but you were never lonley. That's what's so heart breaking about it all. Being displaced.  You can't find much joy for the people who make it out, because they'll always feel like a stranger in another land. 

My parents came here so late in life as well, they never had a chance to become educated or catch up. I was translator, mediator, call the credit card company guy, go to meetings, fill out forms. I grew up filling out all the paper work for when my parents needed food stamps, renew their health insurance, issue with the electric companies. I would just pretend to be my dad, and I got good at lying and being very creative. 

And this isn't just my story, have a lot of friends who had to grow up like this. So, yeah Fuck I love America. But I can't fucking lie and say there's nothing I loved more then Syria , running around as a child with my cousins, always being outside playing, always with family. Then one day my parents told us we had to leave. And the kids didn't even play the same sports as me, I grew up trying to fit in and fell in love with Basketball and Football. 

My first football game I watched with my brother on a small tv in the kitchen in our apartment in the US. Dante Culpeper, Randy Moss it was our favorite team.

 >The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely-piloted, surveillance aircraft. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

They just look like a tube (or even like a telescope) propped up at aimed at the sky. Artillery are much larger and need to be moved via vehicle. 

Mortars are usually considered shelling as well by most people. Shelling is now a generic term for anything falling and exploding (with grenades being the main exception) and that isn’t launched from the air. 

People are gonna come say this isn’t all ten in sky correct. True. But I’m just giving you the cliff notes version. 

So when you see there’s shelling, it means mortars and artillery and tank rounds are falling and exploding in the area.",False,1645329108.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxnv23n,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
520fe4e9f39e89cacb5ed16bc98277ec,swq9uc,hxnwelf,"well mortars are artillery that fires in in a steep arc so the shell fall on top of the target. OG mortars looked like a cannon that ran into a wall and squished. Modern mortars are like small tubes on platforms that soldier just hand drop rounds roughly the size of nerf footballs into, tail first. They have a fuse on the tail that goes of when the shell hits the tube bottom which fires the thing.",False,1645329379.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxnv23n,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
bbf7f95fdd43ab44df9814d4ecd4d950,swq9uc,hxnxapf,"Google that shit for more info but a mortar is a small tube, like 8cm diameter and maybe a meter tall.  Metal plate at the bottom.  You can adjust the angle of it (adjusts how far away the explosive round will land).  The operator drops in an explosive round that sort of looks like a small nerf ball with a tail and fins.  The explosive round hits the plate at the base of the tube which triggers a charge that causes it to shoot out of the tube.

Think of it like a large grenade but instead of a person lobbing it a short distance, a small charge lobs it maybe 400-1200m away.  There are also smaller, shorter ones that are more mobile (4cm, 6cm something two people can carry into combat and quickly start laying down mortars or smoke on nearby combatants) and larger ones that are more stationary.  You might also find fireworks (the kind that shoot into the air and explode all pretty, ""flaming balls and reports"") referred to as mortars or artillery shells.

Shelling also refers to using large, generally fixed (non moving) artillery cannons that shoot large ammunition, like 105-155mm over much longer distances (like 15km). Look up Howitzers for an example.  The ammunition are are generally called artillery shells, hence ""shelling"".  Although there are a few of different types of shells that the cannon can fire.

Anyway the ammunition are called shells because it's a metal shell with a creamy--but not delicious--explosive center that goes boom when it hits the ground (Usually, depends on the type of ammunition).",1645330463.0,1645329841.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxnv23n,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.

You see, he did that publicly, but privately he went home and pushed for the largest increase on military spending England had ever seen. He pushed all the provinces to deal with any internal issues ASAP, even at the cost of British power in the region. He got the funds to rebuild the Navy, Army, and even the Air Force.

He pushed soft propaganda to get the civilian population ready to fight again, and used the backdrop of his ""deal"" to present that the English weren't the aggressors and would just be defending their homes. He pushed soft propaganda on the provinces that with their new independence they should prepare for a war the likes of which the world had never seen. 

He pushed for increased drafting and trained up a massive army the likes of which England hadn't seen since WW1. 

Chamberlin was not a good man. He was a racist asshole who failed in a lot of ways at home. But he knowingly threw away his entire political career to make sure the UK would survive WW2. And it's because of him the UK and it's provinces had armies at the ready when Churchill took over. 

Modern historians look at Chamberlin a lot different then we did back in the 90s. The new phrasing is that Churchill fought WW2 with Chamberlin's army. Had he not done that Churchill would not have been able to accomplish much at all as England wouldn't have had the will for the fight. 

You have to remember in '38 the British had next to nothing ready for Hitler. They had heavily demilitarized after WW1 as the population had no desire for war anymore. They hadn't been keeping up with anything military, no new tech, nothing trained. Just a standing ""defensive"" army that wasn't going to amount to much.

People think the various EU governments had plenty of warning but they really didn't. In the span of only '38 Hitler built up his entire army, purged the military leadership, allied with Japan and Italy, and started pogroms against the Jews. Up until that point he'd been largely reasonable and while a tinpot dictator not a massive threat. EVERYTHING happened in a year, and suddenly the various EU govs had an army 2-3 times their size sitting smack dab in the middle of the continent raring for war. 

""He should have fought"" is a laughable thing when you look at army readiness comparisons during '38. Germany had more troops ready for war then the UK, France, and US combined. It wasn't until later did the actual armies materialize, largely due to the actions of people like Chamberlin and Roosevelt who saw the threat coming and spent a good chunk of those early years of WW2 prepping.",False,1645375823.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxpnzcd,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >The Phoney War (French: Drôle de guerre; German: Sitzkrieg) was an eight-month period at the start of World War II, during which there was only one limited military land operation on the Western Front, when French troops invaded Germany's Saar district. Nazi Germany carried out the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939; the Phoney period began with the declaration of war by the United Kingdom and France against Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, after which little actual warfare occurred, and ended with the German invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940.

 >The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed by Finland and the Soviet Union on 12 March 1940, and the ratifications were exchanged on 21 March. It marked the end of the 105-day Winter War, upon which Finland ceded border areas to the Soviet Union. The treaty was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, Andrei Zhdanov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky for the Soviet Union, and Risto Ryti, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, Rudolf Walden and Väinö Voionmaa for Finland. The terms of the treaty were not reversed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the Karelian question remains disputed.

In mid-2001, the Volgograd tractor plant revealed that the development of the 2S25 had lasted several years. The Sprut-SD is designed to defeat tanks, hard-skinned material and enemy manpower by airborne and amphibious landing forces, as well as by specially designated units of ground forces. Its main armament, the 2A75, is capable of firing APFSDS, HE-Frag, HEAT and ATGM ammunition.

If you want to go into “funding new drugs” - that is almost always a separate funding situation and the companies then pocket the parent and the profits. The fact that companies over there often hike up prices of medications that have not changed and that they aren’t offering any different options by hundreds of percent because they can completely invalidates that point when other countries are also producing these medicines at a fraction of the cost to healthcare services. Because they’re not lining their pockets as much. 

Why does it cost money for a mother to hold her baby just after it’s born? Why does an ampule of saline cost 1000% more than it actually costs? Why do two pills of paracetamol in a hospital cost tens of dollars when i can get a box for 50p? 

Your healthcare system is run for profit. That’s why it’s so expensive. Americans piss themselves at the idea of paying a touch more tax to help fellow Americans - do you really think companies and the government are  genuinely happy paying more to subsidise healthcare in the rest of the world?

The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock. The syndrome is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as acute delusional states, hallucinations, feelings of persecution (perceptions of being a victim of prejudice, aggression, and hostility from others), derealization, depersonalization, anxiety, and also psychosomatic manifestations such as dizziness, tachycardia, sweating, and others, such as vomiting.

Context of the comparison is important here.

Sarcasm aside, the point I am trying to make is everyone, including you, throws around the word propaganda way too frequently. Rather than discussing events and comparing perspectives, people lean back and point fingers calling each other’s sources fake/propaganda, when both countries have massive amounts of people that read and take their respective media into account.  

Connotatively, propaganda is simply defined as misleading information. Wouldn’t you say whether information is misleading or not, is highly debatable? People argue about this all the time. 

So what I’m doing is *not* applying a western view, what I’m doing is trying to encourage people to engage in exploring other perspectives and to step back from their own views and/or agenda for a moment. If we can show enough respect for each other’s media, maybe we can find better solutions through civil discourse. I think civil discourse is easier to engage in when not starting off with the discredit to either party’s news source.

It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

Hey, if we send troops we can easily stop that” lmao. So putting out 75% of its assets is an obvious strategic move.

It’s not a binary 5% or 75% dichotomy.

>is not about ‘preparing for NATO’ as much as it’s about portraying how serious Russia is here and deterring military intervention from NATO. 

This is contradictory. The deterrence only works if NATO would be reluctant to engage the force they have. Russia, again, has enough force in place as a contingency. Thus it acts as a deterrent.

>2nd point, Russia has zero motive to commit human rights violations on any such scale. 

Most human rights violations aren’t committed as an order like the Holocaust. Rape and murder and torture are often carried about by bloodthirsty, undisciplined troops in areas where there’s effectively no law enforcement because of war.

That isn’t something that can be predicted. Neither can civilian resistance

>Why would russia want actual war? It meets its objectives by simply invading and installing a pro-Russian govt in Ukraine.

Russia is preparing for *an actual war.* What do you think is about to happen?

The Mujahideen were variously backed primarily by the United States, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and the United Kingdom; the conflict was a Cold War-era proxy war. Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 Afghans were killed and millions more fled the country as refugees, mostly to Pakistan and Iran. Between 6.

At least, not to the degree where it is predicted by western state media.  
War will not turn out in his favor, at all, and he knows that. Last time Russia invaded a sovereign, highly patriotic, state in the middle of a social and economic crisis it imploded the Soviet Union. Putin is - or at least, that's what most people are saying - smart enough to remember that happening. His whole idea is to artifically inflate a crisis to a point where either a) other countries flat-out refuse Ukraine's admission to the NATO (which is what we already see happening) or b) at the very least force Zelensky to uphold his part of the Minsk Agreement, which would include a Federalized Donbass with enough power to basically bar Ukraine from ever joining NATO or Europe. Both of those scenario's are a win-win for Putin.   


Biden, on his part, knows that just as well - so he uses his own state apparatus to force Putin to a point of such desperation where he will be forced to reveal his cards (those being, economical and material support for pro-Donbass rebels) or even invade in a panicked flurry. This would cause a huge crisis for Russia, since most people there, still see Ukraine as brothers - meaning that any armed conflict would just be fratricide, which wouldn't fare well in Russia.   


There a few caveats to be made here though:   
First off - the analysis of Putin's  actions is predicated on what he did in the past. It is well-known, however, that Putin is extremly volatile and often does not see the consequences of his own actions (something that had barred him from fieldwork in the past), meaning that he could have just as easily actually planned a blitzkrieg to capture Kiev from the get-go.   
Second -  a revolution in Russia as a side-effect of the war in Ukraine is likely, but not a certainty, due to how tired and broken most Russians are in general. However, they were just as broken during the First World War and during Afghanistan and they still managed to rise up, so what gives?  
Third - you do have to realize, this is still not very objective. I, as a Russian living in Europe, have my own stakes in the conflict (or the avoidance thereof) - one of my best friends is serving his time in the army, for fuck's sakes.",False,1645356092.0,t3_swq9uc,t1_hxowvyv,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

There was laying the ground work with bullshit about 'paying there fair share'. 

It's weird that you look at the thing that Putin and Russia hate most, and the only President to ever try to undermine that thing. And his own advisors admit he wanted to get rid of it. And think, hmmm he did great with Putin.

Under Bush Putin moved into Georgia. Under Obama he moved into Crimea. Under Trump, who handed him nothing but wins, receiving nothing in return. Weirdly there was no conflict. Under Biden we have another issue in eastern Ukraine. It's almost like you hand a dictator easy Ws and suddenly 'conflict' disappears. I think in most cases if someone rolls over like a lap dog, there's no conflict.

Sanctions are no themselves an act of war. Although they could be a justification for one. Economic warfare is not the same as war, aka an armed conflict.

The sanctions on Russia were a bipartisan response to **Russia's actions**. There's zero rationale for not implementing them other than rolling over like a dog to Putin. Sanctions are a diplomatic tool. The military is a diplomatic tool. War is a diplomatic tool. Different means to different ends. 

There's only one example of sanctions that I can even think of that most certainly led to war. That being the oil embargo of Japan. Which when 80% of Japan's oil came form the US, embargoing it all but cripples them. But given Japan's open warfare across Asia and alliance with the Nazis. It's hard to see how it could be considered warmongering. 

>So in my example, the store owner would not be justified in attacking you for boycotting him

So then you agree sanctions are not warmongering. Thanks for agreeing then. If boycotting a store isn't a justification for violence than sanctions aren't warmongering because they are rarely a justification for war. Beautiful analogy and a wonderful own goal.

>did actually sanction Russia

So you're arguing he did sanction Russia so he's a warmonger, even though you brought up sanctions because you felt it was ok Trump didn't implement them since they were warmongering. Nice logic.
