Roughly 30% of Russians military are commissioned officers, many of these officers fill the traditional role of commissioned officers and assume the duties that are normally delegated to western military NCOs. In essence, a very top down approach. While they do have some NCOs, they rarely have more than a couple subordinates. This creates tremendous inefficiencies as the commissioned officers must manage a lot of privates while seeing that everything commanded from the top is implemented.


NCOs in western militaries are the professional soldiers that ensure discipline is maintained, critical skills are taught, and can make tactical decisions on the spot. They are the bridge between most enlisted soldiers and commissioned officers. 


It's very likely that between 2014 and 2022 when NATO countries rendered training to Ukraine, and the military was modernized, they likely passed down this approach to the Ukranians.

But they won't be able to establish rail lines unless they capture urban areas. Right now they've been bypassing and bombarding them. Except in the south where they've actually tried taking them.


They're probably abandoning tanks because the crews are more important than the equipment. And they don't have the recovery vehicles available to tow them to repair facilities.

""Putin and Shoigu plan to cut down and sell Ukrainian forests

March 15, 2022

 The occupying state plans mass deforestation of Ukrainian forests. This is stated in a letter from Russian Defense Minister Shoigu ""On the possibility of felling on defense lands,"" which is addressed personally to Putin.

The document aims to obtain a permit for the total felling of Ukrainian ""forests, trees, shrubs and greenery."" It is planned to cut down ""any intensity and any age, regardless of ownership and category of land with the right to use the resulting wood.""

At the same time, the letter states that wood not used for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces will be sold, and the proceeds will go to support the occupying army.

Today, without exception, all forests in the temporarily occupied territories are in the highest risk zone. The total felling of greenery is another terrible crime of the occupiers and the creation of an ecocide.

The last time this happened on the territory of Ukraine was during the Nazi occupation. When the invaders destroyed and exported material and natural values.""

The use of the decoys may point to some level of carelessness or urgency by Russian military leadership, Mr. Lewis said, given that Russia knows they will inevitably be collected and studied by Western intelligence services so that NATO air defenses can be programmed to defeat the Iskander’s countermeasures.

And it is highly unlikely, he said, that the version of the Iskander that Russia has sold to other countries would contain these decoys.

What's happening in Ukraine right now is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor state. The responsibility for this aggression lies on the conscience of a single person, and that person is Vladimir Putin.

My father is Ukrainian, my mother is Russian. They were never enemies. This necklace I'm wearing symbolizes that Russia should immediately stop this fratricidal war, and our brotherly nations will be able to make peace with each other.

Unfortunately for the past years I've been working on Channel 1, spreading Kremlin's propaganda, and I am now terribly ashamed of myself for that. I'm ashamed for allowing myself to speak the lies from the screens of TVs. Ashamed for letting Russian people get zombified.

We stayed silent in 2014, when it all began. We did not go out to protest when Kremlin poisoned Navalny. We just quietly observed this inhumane regime. And now the entire world has turned away from us, and ten generations of our descendants won't be able to wash away the shame of this fratricidal war.

>  
>A Ukrainian government advisor said he expects the **war to be over by early May at the latest, when Russia runs out of resources** to attack its neighbour.  
""I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement,"" said Oleksiy Arestovich, an advisor to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, late on Monday.  
He outlined two possible outcomes in the months ahead.  
""There will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April,"" he said.  
The Pentagon had earlier claimed that Russia is trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine - though this has not been verified.  
**Arestovich is not personally involved in the talks between Ukraine and Russia.**

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: Russia is sending strategic bombers.

>The U.S. won’t negotiate exemptions to Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and could try to strike a separate accord excluding Moscow, a senior U.S. official said, a diplomatic effort complicated by an Iranian missile attack on Iraq that sent American troops rushing for shelter.  
>  
>Time is pressing. U.S. and European officials say that Iran’s nuclear work has expanded close to a point that the deal’s main benefit to the West—keeping Iran months away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a nuclear weapon—would be impossible. Iran is currently just a few weeks from that so-called breakout point.  
>  
>Earlier this month, as Western diplomats were seeking to wrap up the talks, Russia requested guarantees that its work under the JCPOA would be exempted from Western sanctions over Ukraine. The U.S. had given sanctions waivers for the 2015 deal.However after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters Moscow wanted much broader guarantees, its chief negotiator in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, presented a second paper to European negotiators on Tuesday seeking to protect all future trade and investment against Ukraine-related sanctions, something the U.S. has rejected.  
>  
>One option for the U.S. and its partners would be to create an interim deal that could freeze some of Iran’s activities and wind back aspects of its nuclear program in return for some level of sanctions relief from the U.S. Iran has always rejected the idea of an interim deal.  
>  
>Another option would be to create what the senior U.S. official called a “replica of the JCPOA,” without Russia, which would assign Moscow’s tasks in the agreement elsewhere.“I do think we would be open to various alternatives. We are beginning to think about what those might be,” the official said. “We…at this point wouldn’t rule anything out.”
>
>The negotiations in Vienna, which have dragged on for close to a year, aim to agree on the steps the U.S. and Iran would take to return into compliance with the nuclear deal. If Russia’s demands can be resolved, negotiators have said they could be back in Vienna within a few days to finish the talks.
>
>Iran has avoided calling out Russia and has continued to blame the failure to complete the talks on Washington. However there have been hints of irritation from Iranian officials, who have said they wouldn’t let external factors get in the way of their interests.

To me it seems like sensible key points for now.

  
  
— Russia struggling to take cities if Ukraine defends them: Kharkiv or Mariupol, leading to their destruction.  
  
— Creeping doubt Russia can fully encircle Kyiv or take it given this difficulties elsewhere.  
  
—  Risk of Ukrainian encirclement in the Donbas.  
  
— Consensus that Russia’s originally regime change plan is dead and now it is trying to scare Zelensky with city destruction into brutal terms to save Kyiv, especially if encircled.   
  
— Western shock at Russia’s request to China for arms and the apparent openness in Beijing.  
  
— War popularity boosts for Johnson, Macron, Biden.   
  
— Western surprise at Indian openness to alternative payments systems to trade with Russia.  
  
— Intense Russian shock at global fear of US secondary sanctions.  
  
— Freezing effect on brands exiting Russia appears to be slowing.  
  
— Mixed signals on seriousness of the peace talks with Ukraine, some positive sounds from Moscow-Kyiv.  
  
— General pessimism from France and the United States on this.   
  
— Israel seen as not being used to the difficulty of mediating with Putin given how new it is to this.  
  
— British satisfaction at how the war has put in back at the top table post-Brexit for matters of European security.   
  
— Mood shifts in Germany opening up possibility of more energy radicalism on Russia oil and gas if the war darkens.

* cctv, a scene in front of the building where no apparent destruction occurs, and yet the people standing out in front of the foyer suddenly fall to the ground with blood emanating/squirting somewhere out of them (overpressure waves?)

* handheld camera, walking up the fragmented remains of a human, exploded like a grapefruit. legs intact but otherwise shredded. no head apparent. a woman wails in the background.

* in-car camera, police approach the scene
* handheld camera, in front of the building entrance, two people (say, albert and betty) are on the ground, one of them has a tourniquet on what is left of each leg, mostly missing from the thigh down. blood pours seeps into the street.
* handheld camera, a walk-around of a vehicle with a couple, both deceased, bodies slumped over one another. No obvious wounds or carnage, maybe overpressure again windshield and back windows intact, but front windows are not
* handheld camera, people discussing the scene in front of the building which, given the ATM out front, is probably a bank. several dead bodies lay around. someone walks out of the bank. the older man (beret) is walking around wailing in shock and grief. a soldier walks out of the bank and tries to comfort the other person of the couple (albert and betty)
* new handheld camera, walking to same scene. this person filming also films himself. someone with a medical bag can be seen tending to the more intact leg of the first of (albert and betty) couple. the person films themselves. he asks the people standing around questions. **it can be seen** that albert and betty are holding hands, sitting there dying in the street.

* handheld camera, firefighters in a cramped space pick up that man with a medical transport cloth thing, he is in severe pain. they lift him outside the building, and put him on a stretcher. the cameraman looks in closely at his legs and can see all kinds of debris sticking in and out of him. he is loaded into an ambulance.
* handheld camera, albert and betty are in close up. it's apparent that both albert and betty are missing all or part of both of their legs. they are holding one hand. they are lying down dying, unable to see each other because of gutter/flashing debris which has landed on the ground between them. the woman says something (reportedly, below, **please let us die in peace**)
* handheld camera, to the right, the man with the beret wails over a deceased person on the ground next to another older injured person who is struggling to move. **the man with the beret pushes on the person clinging to live who is rolling around on top of and obscuring the deceased person**. the old beret man lifts the head of the deceased person so that the injured person is not sitting on their head. the injured person is too disoriented to realize what is happening.

- The SLO, CZE, and POL representatives go to Kyiv.

- They show Putin they’re not afraid of him.

- They lead by example and persuade the western countries to continue with even harder, more stifling sanctions and embargos.

- They actually give the people of Kyiv a moment of respite, as the Russian army stops its shelling, trying not to look even more vile than they already do.

- This all leads to more acceptance for the idea of Ukraine joining the EU among the western countries, and even more unity against Putin.

- Mission accomplished.

- On the way back, Kaczyński just dies of a heart attack — it’s quick and relatively painless.

- The event is captured on multiple phones and cameras, so that no one has any doubts that it was force majeure, and no bullshit conspiracy theories arise.

Here's what you can do for refugees in transit, or seeking to live in your country either permanently, or until it is safe to go back home.   
\- electronics. Lots of students escaping, who continue their education via online classes, but can't, because they couldn't take their electronics with them when they ran. They need electronics - decent ones, not some 8 year old, wheezing antique pieces of crap. If you can afford to buy a tablet or a laptop, or have an used one that's still in decent shape (i.e can run video call apps fine, or maybe even shit like Adobe Photoshop etc), call up your local refugee aid centres and let them know that you have some. They'll likely call you back when someone comes in asking if you've got computers.  
\- battery banks. Though those are more needed at the border.   
\- adults' clothing. Good clothing - light outerwear for spring. Good footwear. Men's clothes. You wouldn't believe the kind of low quality, useless shit we get, and how much of it. Baby clothes too - we filled an entire cinema hall with baby clothes. Good quality adult clothes are needed. Nice fall/spring coats. Women have it easier, but men's clothes are scarce. Donate good quality trousers, footwear, outerwear, not just your crap.  
\- entertainment. Clean stuffies for little children, those have proven to be popular as they're just looking for something to hug right now. Shit, I've even seen solo adults get themselves a stuffie. But also donate chess sets. Yesterday we had an incredibly polite teen boy asking if we had chess, as it's something you can play with someone else.  
\- medicines. NSAIDs primarily.   
\- personal hygiene products. For women, as well as men, and general stuff. Razors for men: not disposable ones, though if you have those, it's fine. Get those razors with a single blade that you switch out, as it'll last whoever takes it through transit, and getting blades for it will be cheap.   
**- Important: clean stuff. Good quality stuff. Don't donate your junk, refugee supply centres aren't your personal trash bin.  We have to actually manually sort through this shit. You're not making lives easier for refugees in need of supplies, you're just taking up** ***our*** **time and theirs by sending us crap we have to sort through and dispose of.  Call whichever centre you're bringing supplies to, and** ***ask them what they need.*** We're actually here, getting calls and talking to people. We can tell you what is needed the most every day.

Ukraine Russia War: The Ukrainian authorities said the Dnipro airport was bombarded at night and the runway was destroyed.

Ukraine Says Russian Strikes Caused ""Massive Destruction"" At Dnipro Airport
Dnipro:
Russian bombardment caused massive damage at the airport in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro, regional authorities said Tuesday.

""During the night the enemy attacked the Dnipro airport. Two strikes. The runway was destroyed. The terminal is damaged. Massive destruction,"" Dnipro Region Governor Valentin Reznichenko said on Telegram.

AFP journalists who arrived in the area said a plume of black smoke could be seen rising from Dnipro airport.

Authorities prevented journalists from approaching the airport, which was cordoned off by soldiers, who warned it could be attacked again at any time.

Air raid sirens sounded in the area shortly after midday.

An industrial city of one million inhabitants, Dnipro is located in eastern Ukraine on the banks of the Dniepr river.

So far the city has been largely spared by the Russian advance into Ukraine, but Dnipro was targeted on Saturday by shelling that killed at least one person.",False,1647346210.0,t3_tedr1a,t3_tedr1a,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Headline reads: China financially backing Russia. 

I don’t buy it, China is not backing Russia. It’s pretending to so it gives Russia a false sense of confidence to keep it going, thus further weaken Russia’s future. 
China is not going to really back Russia, it just keeps dangling Russia around to prolong this disaster, so it will further weaken Russia and its future. 

So while publicly China supports Putin but in reality its unlikely, given the current state of this crisis China stands to benefit the most with the outcome where Russia is significantly weakened but not collapsed.

1. This is international geopolitics, there is no true friend, there is only friend out of necessity.
2. China and Russia are actually regional adversaries, they have been in war with each other for most of history, even as recently as in the mid 1900s post WW2. In fact Russia still occupies 350,000 sqmi on the pacific coast that is historically China, and Russia has shown no intention of even discussing the issue since end of WW2. This is a big sore point for China, that it is keeping quiet publicly but never forgets. 
3. Russia is, at this moment, China’s biggest obstacle and competitor as China aims to completely dominate euro-Asia. 
4. China and Russia share a very long border and in fact, China willingly agreed to let Mongolia become independent as a way to lessen its border defense against Russia. 
5. Right now, the narrative may be that China is helping Russia to survive the world wide sanction, but that narrative will change. When this is over and Russia is facing the harsh reality of a long and difficult economic recovery while seeing China prosper economically, Russia will start to feel that China was not actually helping Russia.

2.  The 400' table he's been seen at in recent pictures?  That same table and room is used for meetings in Moscow. (You can find pictures of people sitting at it all over the internet)

3. The increased police presence and the level of aggression they're showing in Moscow isn't normal.  It could just be typical fascist state stuff, but they're almost acting paranoid.

4. I think Putin planned on this only taking a few days.  If he knew the war would be going on this long, he would be staying somewhere else.

Does anyone have any more info on this? I haven't seen it talked about yet here (might have missed it,) but apparently Russia claims it was a Tochka-U fired from Ukrainian-controlled territory at a Russian stronghold, but Russia ""shot it down"" and it ended up hitting here. Ukraine apparently denied it and said it was a Russian missile.

I know that US intelligence leaked about Russian false flag operations before the invasion and during the first few days, so I was wondering if anyone else has any sources or know more about this. Mainly because I was reading that Russia discontinued the Tochka-U and only Ukraine uses them now. (I'm sure Russia has some sitting around still given the old equipment being used anyways.)

There are [214 confirmed dead tanks](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html), implying that over half of all tanks destroyed have been categorized.  I kinda feel that's sorta conservative.

We've got 58 towed and self propelled artillery confirmed destroyed, versus 150, which sounds 'reasonable'.  Over a 3rd of all claimed kills are documented.

1249 APCs versus ~450 ""APC-like"" documented kills.  (Including IMV's like the Tigr-M).  Again over a third documented.

64 MLRSs versus 23, again over a third documented.

2 boats, eh, maybe?

617 'vehicles' versus 413 confirmed, munis however many KamAZ 6x6's are fuel trucks.  That also sounds conservative.

60 fuel trucks.... too lazy to figure out how many of the 162 dead Kam's are fuel trucks but clicking randomly shows ""plenty"".

We've confirmed apparently *all* the 8 claimed UAV's.

And we've confirmed over 39 SAM systems not including the radar and jamming systems.  Those numbers *under-count* confirmed SAM systems disabled. 

If anything they could easily get away with claiming higher numbers and I'd still believe them.  I'm pretty sure they're under-claiming their tank kills, their artillery kills (random towed pieces are less likely to be photographed and shared than a tank), and their trucks/vehicles killed.  

I *know* they are underestimating their SAM kills there.

As for ""troops"", the documented APCs alone imply ~5k in losses assuming ~10 per APC.  If I assume 10 per APC killed/disabled/deserted for 1250, that's over 12k troops from APCs alone.

[This thread makes for good reading.](https://mobile.twitter.com/tomiahonen/status/1503368526127673347)

Long story short, they kind of ALREADY can't.

Short story long:

That 40 km convoy everyone was terrified by? It was a supply convoy with only protective escorts, no capability for offensive action. And counterintuitively, Ukraine deliberately chose to keep its harassments of this juicy target minimal in one of the best sucker-moves of all time.

You see, the Russian plan was that the tanks and such slamming down from (roughly) the Northwest of Kyiv were supposed to hit the outskirts of Kyiv and then flow around East to meet up with the convoy which was advancing down a ""safe"" route from the (rough) Northeast of Kyiv. The convoy was intended to supply all those tanks and troops.

And then the tanks ran out of gas 12 miles short.

Ukraine gambled that this was going to be absolutely maddening to the Russian generals. Their tanks and convoy are less than 1 hour of road travel away from each other. Except the tanks don't have the gas to attack through the Ukrainian forces to reach the convoy to get their fuel, ammunition, and food they so desperately need. Meanwhile the convoy is drowning in its own resources, but has zero ability to actually engage in an offensive assault to break through the defenses to reach the tanks that are the real hammer.

With the two forces just SO. CLOSE! the Russian generals refused to do the sensible move...take 3-5 days to have the convoy pull back, go up into Belarus, then around and down to meet up with the tanks and troops. They sent deployable bridges to try and get around the Ukrainians, these were destroyed from drone strikes. So they took some extra fuel trucks and sent them down to try and build up enough supply with the tanks for an assault. Except...not only did they have insufficient numbers of fuel trucks to make this work, but the Ukrainians were harassing the hell out of these new convoys. The result? The tanks were spending more fuel than they were getting. It's fucking COLD in Ukraine right now and you can't just start up a frozen-ass tank and go roaring into battle. You've got to idle the vehicles now and then to keep them warm just in case they suddenly fall under attack and need to respond. The massive force in the northwest consumes two MILLION gallons of fuel PER DAY...idling. That's 69 (nice) rail-tankers of fuel per day. Only Russia can't use rail...they have to do it by truck. And their trucks took most of an entire day just to make the round trip.

After a week of trying to make this work, the Russian Generals decided to try to move the convoy only...they waited too long. Guess who else was out of gas now from idling for a week?

If Ukraine had brought that convoy under full attack as everyone thought was going to happen, the easy decision would have been to cut and run, circle around to Belarus and back down. By NOT attacking, the Russians got goaded into the ultimate sunken cost fallacy that brought two different fronts to a complete catch-22 standstill.

The gradual dispersal of the convoy (which triggered proper attacks) was accomplished by sending fuel trucks down to the convoy specifically to bring back whatever trucks could make the journey so they could be repositioned.",False,1647329311.0,t3_tedr1a,t1_i0pz9wb,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

""I think it's really worth emphasising the extraordinary amount of courage it must have taken for this journalist to stage such a high-profile protest.  


We must also emphasise the likelihood that she will face pretty severe consequences  


The Kremlin has imposed pretty severe penalties against people who take part in unsanctioned protests, for example people can be sent to jail for up to eight years.  


People who publish what the Kremlin would deem to be false information about the Russian army and its activities can also face a severe jail sentence of up to 15 years. There are a whole other host of laws under which we assume she could be prosecuted.   


We'll have to wait and see what happens.Protests have continued every day since this invasion began and nearly 15,000 people have been reportedly detained.  


She's undoubtedly gong to become more of a symbol for those people. Will she change the views of Russians who largely watch state television and believe the Kremlin's line? That's more difficult to answer.""

Political opponents being jailed and locked up is considered a ""win"" in the eyes of genuine Putin supporters. See example used by Trump: Hillary Clinton's dumb emails and the whole ""lock her up"" rhetoric. Anyone with half a brain would see that violating free speech and locking up political opponents is bad, but individuals who genuinely believe they're in the right, don't see sending dissenters to the gulag as being ""wrong"". It's viewed as morally correct, similarly to how most reasonable people would want to see Trump jailed for tax evasion and investigated for potential treason. For GENUINE Pro-Putin crowds, locking up dissenters just ""makes sense"".

Who sung songs for the joyous and free?
They flew over plains and forests,
And nestled in coves on the sea!

Their nests were decorated with flowers.
Their land stretched far past the hills!
And their hearts may be larger than barrels,
But no one should misjudge their will!

One fateful eve a bear wandered in.
His eyes filled with lust and scorn!
He ravaged the nest of blue nightingales,
And caused them much to mourn!

Little did the bear know,
What lay within these lands!
Built on backs of the blue nightingales,
Who would gather to protect & stand!

They sharpened their beaks and talons.
They called on Rusalky of old!
To help push back this wandering raider,
And force his hand to fold!

For days and nights they gathered,
Swooped in down from the skies!
The bear stood no chance in heaven or hell,
As the birds let out their fell cry!

Once when the battle was over
And the birds looked long o’er their lands,
They saw destruction and sadness,
And a chance to rebuild with their hands.

Long will the bear live in infamy.
Long will the stories be told!
Of when the nightingales gathered,
And stood firm to protect their home!

Japan didn't change the flag. The Rising Sun Flag wasn't the national flag, but the flag of the army. It's still is the flag of the army, with some small modifications. The national flag is the same.

Italy didn't change the flag. It changed the coat of arms, due to going from Kingdom to Republic.

USSR didn't change any flag. It ceased to exist.

Germany did change the flag, 4 times: 

After WWI, the flag of the German Empire was changed to the colors used in XIX century by German nationalists. 

In 1933, Hitler re-introduced the flag of the German Empire, along with the flag of the Nazi party. 

Later on, he eliminated the flag of the German Empire, leaving only the one of the Nazi Party. 

Finally, after WWII it was changed again to the colors we know today.

The change after WWI was not inevitable. But the one after WWII was inevitable. The national flag during the Third Reich was also the flag of the Nazi party. Obviously it couldn't continue as national flag.

Regarding Russia, it's not linked to any specific regime or person. It was used during the Russian Empire and again by the Federation of Russia. So, it won't be changed.

So, another way to use Etsy to support small business owners is look for digital products that reach your inbox immediately so the money is released to shop owners quickly. 

Look for people selling digital arts, cross stitch and crochet patterns, and the like. I've bought from:

EmbroideryArtByNat: https://etsy.me/2nrRUSD 

NYTKADesigns: https://etsy.me/3M6vlNL

All except the last shop are active on Instagram with proof they're Ukrainian and advocating for greater support for their country. The shop I've bought from is one I've been following for ages - owner has fled to Czechia with her very young child, and donates a portion of her profits to NGOs on ground and the army, and posts proof on her Instagram.

Last shop has not been active on Instagram for a bit, which given the invasion and the reports coming out of Ukraine is a bit worrying for me, ngl, but there's enough on their Instagram to suggest they're genuinely a small business owner from Ukraine.

> So this analyst is Grigory Yudin, who I think is very insightful. And I think that he is attentive, right? Good analysts are - they largely earned their stripes by just really paying close attention to what is being said and done. And Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons for a long, long time. This is another strain of thought and action that we have observed over the years. Russia has changed its military doctrine to make it easier to use nuclear weapons. And this happened many years ago. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world, and in particular the United States, that Russia is a nuclear power.

>And, you know, I don't know that I agree with Yudin that the first target would be the United States and, in particular, New York City. I think that Putin is much more likely and has given indications on this and also seeing indications of this in the way that the Russian state television narrative is working - I think it's much more likely that they would use a tactical nuclear weapon to target, say, a military airport in Poland.


>GROSS: In Poland?


>GESSEN: In Poland - well, yeah. So the reason - Poland is a country that borders both Russia and Ukraine. It's just to the west of Ukraine. And military aid to Ukraine that is coming from Western countries is coming through military airports in Poland. Poland also used to be a part of the Soviet military bloc. In fact, the Soviet equivalent of NATO - the Soviet-dominated equivalent of NATO used to be called the Warsaw bloc. So the use of Polish military airports to supply arms to Ukraine is almost a personal affront to Putin, who views himself as an agent of restoration, who wants to bring back the former glory that Russia had in a bipolar world. And so the fact that they're using not just a former Warsaw Pact country's airports, but Poland's - right? - the country where the capital is Warsaw, is like adding insult to injury. And so there has been a lot of nuclear saber-rattling in that general direction - or actually in that specific direction.

I'm not sure nukes are on the table at the immediate declaration of war. I'm also not sure nukes are on the table the moment NATO forces cross over into Ukraine.

It's more likely nukes are on the table the moment a NATO force enters Russia. The moment planes or infantry start approaching or crossing into Russian Federation territory, tactical nukes become a strategic option for the Russian command if my admittedly limited understanding of their defense psychology is correct.

Slight note here: the infamous Dead Hand was/is a defensive system meant to retaliate in case then-Soviet, now-Russian leadership were ""decapitated.""

One thing to consider, however, is that the US and NATO are firmly not interested in being active, total war participants right now.

However, it's that 1% (hopefully .000000001%) you have to worry about.

One use of a nuke might happen, if it's purely tactical, (ie. small yield with minimal damage to civilian areas; mainly for area denial to prevent enemy troops from invading).  NATO **IS** staging troops, so it's possible Putin may actually do this, and believe there will be no response, because ""one little nuke isn't worth destroying the whole world over"".

But now NATO's in a trap, see? They HAVE to respond, otherwise Putin may think he can get away with it a second time. 

Another opening move might be to nuke a small city, intended as a warning shot; ie. ""back the fuck off or you'll get more"".  I think back in the 1970's when this stuff was wargamed out by RAND and others, it almost always resulted in retaliatory strikes and escalation.

Another strategy is the ""decapitation strike"" - directly attack the enemy's leadership with a limited strike of a dozen or so targets; so that your enemy will be so busy dealing with the damage, and loss of leadership that they can not respond.  Usually - their leadership is protected, in deep bunkers, secret locations, multiple redundancy, etc.  This is considered very unlikely to succeed, and to almost always trigger a massive response, because the enemy's nuclear forces' command structure is designed with this eventuality in mind.

There's the temptation to attempt a massive widespread first strike, (and this might be nuclear AND conventional combined) - in the hopes that your enemy will not be able to respond because it happens so quickly.  The problem with this opening move is it's actually very very unlikely to take out all of an enemy's capacity in one shot. And you still receive a devastating counterstrike. 

This is what people mean when they say ""nobody wins a nuclear war"" - not even counting the follow-on effects (nuclear winter, fallout, devastation of world economy and supply chain).",False,1647310007.0,t3_tedr1a,t1_i0p36t8,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

I really wouldn't know though, because I have never been interested in warfare education. If I was trying to determine this, I would search both [Google for education resources](https://www.google.com/search?q=siege+warfare+site%3A*.edu) and [Google Scholar for related research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,37&q=siege+warfare). For the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege) article on sieges, it makes it makes it seem like sieges hundreds of years ago could last years. (I imagine the casualty rates were extremely high back then) I also noticed that [Kyiv has been under sieges in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kiev_\(1240\)).  (once in 968, and again in 1240)

I imagine if you want to find a better answer, you'll just have to start reading education resources on modern warfare. I think people attend college for up to 8 years for this. (before probably performing research with a military, I don't know) I think it's likely there's someone who might be speculating with a better idea, but it seems like it could be a complicated question to answer because there are so many variables.

Two of my uncles have worked for the NSA at different points in history- both after the Crisis towards the end of the Cold War, but they were privy to a lot of info from reading stuff and hearing stories from coworkers. Long story short, we’re nowhere *near* as close to nuclear war as we were during the Crisis. At that point, there were literally nuclear missiles *on the way to Cuba*. Confirmed and acknowledged by everyone. The US was planning an invasion of Cuba. SAC was at DEFCON 2. The nuclear revolver had its hammer pulled back and fingers were on triggers. We came *so* close to Armageddon- but even still, it didn’t come to pass. 

Right now, we’re several steps away from that situation. Nukes are barely part of the conversation. There has been some dick wagging, sure, but US Intel has stated multiple times that they haven’t detected any change in Russia’s nuclear readiness in the past month. Nobody is talking about missile movements. Nobody is talking about launch pad construction or bomber deployments. For nukes to enter the equation, several more things have to happen.

1. Russia can win but will need alot more troops and supplies. What they point out is that the u s military needed 200k troops to take Baghdad. The russians are using 200k troops to take all of Ukraine. Putin has promised not to conscript more or use reservists. The estimates are that what is currently in ukraine is 55% of Russia combat  troop strength. They still have other defense requirements and cant just leave all of Russia defenseless. The more death and destruction for Russia forces the harder it will be for putin to maintain control in Russia.  
2. Ukraine is trading space for time. They have a ton of people volunteering for their army and are even having to turn people away because of constraints. So the longer Ukraine has the more people they can bring into the action. The longer Ukraine holds out the more weapons and tools they bring to the fight from western countries. Ukraine is also not having many stand up fights other than in urban environments which heavily favor them.  They are hitting weak points bleeding russian forces. Once again to slow russian advance. 
3. the russians have not captured anything of major significance  other than kherson. Kherson fell in the first couple days of the war because ukranian forces there believed the invasion would not happen. Didn't even have 50% of their military force gathered.
4.  The only positives the russians have is that they do have capabilities that for some reason they are not using. Those experts don't understand why they aren't using it.
5. Russia is facing a ton of logistical issues. Troops starving. Tanks abandoned because of no fuel. The number of high ranking officers killed seems to suggest thst they are at the front trying to solve some of these major issues. 
6. There is no political objective they can achieve anymore. Even if they win militarily  all they will be doing is signing up for a 20 year insurgency.

Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Ukraine is free (as any sovereign nation is) to join any alliance it wishes. NATO is a defensive alliance. Ukraine joining would no more 'trigger Russian war' as Poland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuanian NATO membership has. Check out a map. All five of those nations share a border with Russia. A Russian war based on a country's NATO membership would be the action and responsibility of Russia alone.

""A while back"". As in, when Russia invaded Ukraine. The Ukrainian army was complete garbage back then, Azov was more organized than the military, so they were absorbed by the official military in an effort to bolster Ukraine's defence against an invading Russia.

> And no, hell no i don't know of any modern country which has extremists as part of an official army. 

Russia's Wagner group, though they are a PMC funded by Russia, and it would be a stretch to call Russia a modern country given the circumstances.

> This is NOT only about de-nazification

It is in no way about ""de-nazification"", Russia actively sponsors neo-Nazis themselves.

> it is 100% related to oil reserves Ukraine has as well as other resources, Ukraine is like 2nd largest exporter of grain and metal. That is one of the TOP reasons both USA and Russia want that region.

The USA doesn't give a shit about Ukraine's oil or grain, it doesn't import them. The US gives a shit because Russia is challenging US hegemony by starting a war.

> What made Putin invade was NATO OPENLY announcing they want to move troops and missiles into eastern border of Ukraine (go check the map and distance to Moscow) and promptly accept Ukraine into Nato, which would trigger Russian war with Nato, which would be oh so much worse...

Nonsense, the Baltics are already part of NATO and much, MUCH, closer to Moscow. The only reason NATO would end up at war with Russia is because Russia would invade a NATO country.

> After the cold war, fall of Berlin wall, Warsaw pact was made where NATO was to NOT expand further into EAST, Warsaw pact countries were to be neutral grounds, but they broke the agreement. 

A verbal promise was made not to invite former soviet countries. NATO broke this promise. Putin also said they wouldn't invade Ukraine. It seems verbal agreements are worth very little.

> Also, take in mind Nato is puppet organisation - Extension of USA 

Complete bullshit, NATO countries are no more puppets of the USA than the rest of the world. Turkey openly clashes with the USA on a number of issues, yet they are a member of NATO. France did not join the USA in their mad wars after 9/11. You're completely wrong.

> 11 f million dead by USA and Nato on middle east

You realize Russia operates in the middle east as well? Georgia, Abkhazia, North Ossetia-Alania, Tajikistan, Chechnya, Dagestan, Caucasus Emirate. And of course they are still fighting in Syria, for almost a decade now.

> And now when Russia does 1 move against them, 

Who is ""them""? Outside of 1998, [there hasn't been a single year where Russia was not at war with another country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Russian_Federation_(1991-present)). Your attempts at painting Russia as a peaceful nation are completely in conflict with reality.

> they freaking shut down the internet, facebook, youtube and search engines from all the real evidence and results, this is not evil, it is freakin demonic.

It is in fact Russia that shut down the internet, that banned Facebook, that blocked Youtube and Twitter and Instagram. It is Russia that has banned any third-party news agency.

 >Tree spiking involves hammering a metal rod, nail or other material into a tree trunk, either inserting it at the base of the trunk where a logger might be expected to cut into the tree, or higher up where it would affect the sawmill later processing the wood. It is used to prevent logging by risking damage to saws, in the forest or at the mill, if the tree is cut, as well as possible injury or death to the worker. The spike can also lower the commercial value of the wood by causing discoloration, reducing the economic viability of logging in the long term, without threatening the life of the tree.

In the short term, if nobody gets into an economic fight with China over it, China stands to profit massively over the situation.

But Covid definitely threw a monkey wrench into the equation.

So because of all that, Biden is probably a lot more willing to sanction China than he would have been had Covid never hit. And that being the case, China and the US are now in a dance of well, how much aid can China give Russia before the US gets its panties into a twist and starts pulling its money out?

Russia's spent a lot of time and effort over the last ten years trying to become more self-sufficient, so even though the sanctions are chonking a third of its GDP off the top, it's actually not quite as catastrophic for Russia as it could have been.

In Russia's case, they have everything they need, they just can't get it where it needs it to be due to a lack of logistics equipment like truck. Their doctrine relies on trains for logistics, but since Ukraine cut the railway ties, they can't use trains. 

Since this was supposed to be a three day in and out deal, Russia assumed even if the railways we're cut they would be fine since the troops could carry three days worth of supplies with them. 

This obviously did not happen, and since they don't have nearly enough trucks (both due to not having enough to start with and Ukraine keeps blowing them up) to replace the trains they can't use.

 >The Ides of March (; Latin: Idus Martiae, Late Latin: Idus Martii) is the 74th day in the Roman calendar, corresponding to 15 March. It was marked by several religious observances and was notable for the Romans as a deadline for settling debts. In 44 BC, it became notorious as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar, which made the Ides of March a turning point in Roman history.

The program began in the 1920s and lasted until at least September 1992 but has possibly been continued by Russia after that. During World War II, Joseph Stalin was forced to move his biological warfare (BW) operations out of the way of advancing German forces and may have used tularemia against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. By 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union.

Kamaz stopped producing trucks a few days ago because they ran out of parts. Granted Russia still has 40 BTGs, which they could potentially cannibalize but there won’t be new trucks or just very few of them and the losses now are permanent
The question is a) how many trucks they have in storage and b) how many of those are actually in  running condition c) are those stored vehicles the same kind or older type?

 >A siege is a military blockade of a city, or fortress, with the intent of conquering by attrition, or a well-prepared assault. This derives from Latin: sedere, lit. 'to sit'. Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static, defensive position.

 >The Siege of Kiev by the Mongols took place between November 28 and December 6, 1240, and resulted in a Mongol victory. It was a heavy morale and military blow to Halych-Volhynia and allowed Batu Khan to proceed westward into Europe.

Here some causality chain.
2008 loud voices at NATO summit to accept Georgia and Ukraine
Georgia gets invaded
2014 orange ""revolution"" ( coup) leading to separatists movements
2014-2018 Radical armed groups, far right, Nazis,  bring in discussion that if government takes their arms they will fight the government (see Vice International embedded documentary)
2020-2021 lots of NATO trainers and equipment are  getting to Ukraine,  stingers and all. Radicals are incorporated every where (Azov and Right sector or whatever is named)
2021 Russia asks for security guaranties, gets denied
2022 invades, gets hit with severe sanctions, no one wants to buy Russians crude, prices for up, USA inflation goes even higher, Biden and pelosi blame it on Putin price hike! (???)
All that while Ukraine country is destroyed.


This is insanity ! Well is not even over yet either... Our politicians need to stop the belicoase rhetoric.and do all they can to stop this. Asap.

You need an education to understand strategy and read maps/orders. In the past, only the upper class had schooling, so they were given command by a ""commission"" from the monarch.

In modern times, (in theory) they identify applicants with leadership skills and academic ability and fast track them to leadership roles.

Part of it is just a general sentiment of ""US/West bad,"" on the part of India. But part of it is that they currently have a fascist party in power.

If Trump had managed to overturn the 2021 election, I would've had a hard time calling the US a democracy, either.

In the case of post WW1 Germany and post USSR Russia, there was a clearly definable fall from power. A hard line in the sand of time where things went from ""good"" to ""bad"". Or at least ""bad"" to ""worse"".

Here in the US there has not been a generalized fall. It's all been smaller and more local. The single-industry town whose industry (a mine or a mill) shuts down. The sort of event that 99.99% of the population don't hear about or don't care about even if they did. Piece by piece a growing group of upset people assembles, their own little personal ""falls"" uniting them.

And that part that's particularly interesting...is that for most of these people, the bulk of the downside to that fall is their unwillingness to adapt and change. A sort of ""My grandfather worked in this mine, my father worked in this mine, and by god I WILL work in this mine!"". Years back Hillary (I hate her, but this was actually a worthwhile plan) proposed a methodology of using federal money to take the people from those fallen towns and help retrain and relocate them free of charge so that they could get jobs in the new renewables sectors (either manufacturing or installation or operations).

WMDs aside, Saddam Hussein was a well known brutal dictator that had committed atrocities; no misinformation there.

American troops weren't told they were going on a training exercise, only to be put into an active warzone with little to no planning or preparation. Neither are they thrown at an objective without proper logistical support, or handed garbage equipment, left to starve, etc.

There was absolutely nothing Iraq, a country with no qualms about torturing their own, let alone prisoners, could offer US troops. US troops are treated and cared for beyond any level Iraq could ever offer them.

In this current conflict, Russian soldiers are now well aware of their government doesn't give a damn whether they live, die, starve, etc

losing a war is not the same thing as losing all of the people in your military who know how to run a military, which is what happened when stalin killed pretty much all of them.

and I'm not saying that Russian military professionalism was the best in the world, it had been trying to stay caught up.  

 outside of a 20 year span after WW2, the Soviets never really had a good military and when they had it, it was because they had been through the biggest war to ever occur & had extremely experienced troops because of that

It wasn't anything that the Soviet military was teaching people

once all of the veterans from the war aged out, that's when their military went to total shit again, because they didn't recognize and incorporate the qualities that made a military good or bad, politics stopped them from really analyzing why their shit was so fucked for too long, and by the time they could, it was too late

Namely, when the US invaded Iraq, we achieved nation-wide air supremacy (not just superiority) within the first hour. How did we do this?

We had swarms of planes equipped with a mixture of air-to-air missiles and radar-seeking munitions. The moment any surface-to-air radars lit up, immediately they got pounded by the latter weapons. In a VERY short period of time, they just had no radars to direct their more modern weapons, so all they had was just manually targeted flak cannons which were absolutely useless.

This is ofc both due to them having a larger army and due to part of the Ukrainian fighting force being tied up hitting logistical targets instead of advancing forces.

Think about the Russian logistics situation like this: they are carrying the injured and dead away from the battlefield nearly as much as much as they are (failing) to bring supplies to the front. 

We already know the Russians are desperately short of fuel after the Ukrainians targeted fuel trucks in the first week of the war. Now the Russians are immobile from an operational perspective. They have not moved in 4 days and are essentially hiding in the woods for while waiting for reinforcements. 

On the food front, apparently the Russians were asking for MREs from the Chinese, presumably because they think their stocks won’t last. We also have seen photos that captured Russians MREs had expired in 2015 and the soldiers are “living off the land” by looting everything. That’s tells me their food situation is dreadful.

Regarding ammo it is hard to tell. We obviously see destruction, but without knowing the total number or rounds fired per day would I don’t think anyone can say if they are shooting a lot or a little. I’d say this is probably average. That wouldn’t surprise me as the Russians have historically had good artillery, so putting up a decent arty performance in this shitshow of a war wouldn’t surprise me.

So this army doesn’t have food or fuel. How is it going to last? These soldiers are literally going to starve or get picked off one by one by Ukrainian drones.  They don’t have enough bodies to keep up the fight. At the rate they are losing (20,000 soldiers killed or wounded in 2 weeks), their entire Army of 280,000 soldiers will either be dead or wounded multiple times by the end of the year.

If Russia is to sustain this fight beyond a few months, they must start activating the reserves now. Calling up and readying their reserves will take months at least. Even a trained force of reservists take a month or two to get ready before deployment. Look at the performance of the elite of the Russian army and tell me how you think older, less trained troops in older, worse maintained equipment is going to fair?

On the other hand, the Ukrainian army had suffered 1,300 KIA. Assuming a 3 to one WIA to KIA ratio, that means roughly 5000 total killed and wounded. The Russians are losing nearly 4:1, and a lot of those deaths were in the first days of desperate fighting. Ukraine’s Army is not much smaller than the Russian Army at the start of the war and had gotten much bigger since the start of the war though activation of their reserves, men returning home, drafting military age men at the border, and foreign volunteers. These are men in uniform training now. How many? Certainly tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands? 

They could be ready by summer, maybe earlier. Do you think the Russian Army in 3 months will be ready to face a  force a much larger force? 

I don’t see how Russia’s Army won’t just give up and walk away within two months at this rate. The best of the best are destroyed, no fuel, no food, any local you see might shoot at you, drone strikes, accurate artillery strikes, and ATGMs are common, it’s cold as fuck, you might have trench foot AND frostbite, you haven’t been paid and you can’t talk to anyone.

The Group traces its origins to the summit meetings of leaders from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland held in the Hungarian castle town of Visegrád on 15 February 1991.

 >The Velvet Revolution (Czech: Sametová Revoluce) or Gentle Revolution (Slovak: Něžná Revolúcia) was a non-violent transition of power in what was then Czechoslovakia, occurring from 17 November to 29 December 1989. Popular demonstrations against the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia included students and older dissidents. The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and the subsequent dismantling of the command economy and conversion to a parliamentary republic. On 17 November 1989 (International Students' Day), riot police suppressed a student demonstration in Prague.

you apparently don’t realize the complexity of implementing such a process and especially the time it takes. seizing and stopping all *known* assets is a breeze, but it’s also just 5% of their total assets.

finding the remaining 95%, figuring out laws to stop them without stopping legal cash flows and actually executing it is a process that could take months, perhaps years. especially in tax-easy nations.

israel is actually working against the russian oligarchs and stated they will not be a safe haven for them yesterday.

This fine and will prevent some overt presence of oligarchs in israel. No corsica scenes here 

But then you have thousands of russians here that have influxed heavy money into israel for years. They have many channels and only some will be stopped short term.

They are not gonna reveal the remaining channels and the oligarchs will pay financial magicians to circumvent them.

You act like the size of the money stream makes it more opaque, but that’s now how the money-hiding game works. Especially in a nation that doesn’t look too closely to begin with.

In a country like the Netherlands (where i’m originally from) it’s harder because every breath you take is taxed, so little to no legal “black” money exists

Israel’s system is different so there is a vast amount of legal black money here.

for example first-degree relatives can transfer any amount of money, untaxed to each other.

In NL that is limited to 100K.

i could receive a couple million from a close relative and just need to sign a paper that the person is my relative. No origin check, no taxation, nothing.

[Here's a writeup I did explaining what was up with the convoy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tedr1a/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i0q1nfc/)

The long story short: The convoy was a supply convoy that was supposed to link up with a combat group, but the combat group didn't have the fuel to reach the convoy and the convoy didn't have the firepower to fight to the combat group. The Ukrainians deliberately left the convoy mostly alone specifically because if they actually started blasting away at it, the convoy would have pulled back, gone through Belarus and back down the long way, taking 3-4 days to do it. The Russian generals didn't want to do this because if somehow they could get the tanks the fuel they needed, they were only an hours travel away from the convoy.

You disbelieve western media, fair enough. But if the radars were not functional, then Russia could operate their air force with impunity. Shoulder fired weapons have a relatively low maximum altitude they can reach, only on the order of 15,000 ft. If those radars were destroyed, then Russia could operate their aircraft at higher altitudes and suffer almost no losses. Instead, they are forced to operate at low altitude, trading protection from the radar-facilities for exposure to shoulder fired munitions, similarly the bulk of Russia's aircraft sorties are their bombers taking off in Russian airspace, getting close to the border, then launching long range cruise missiles before turning around without ever getting close to crossing the border. That's certainly a strategy you can use, but that deprives them of almost the entirety of their weapons inventory which cannot be used that way. Each of those long range munitions are very expensive, and they could be accomplishing the same job with other VASTLY cheaper munitions by flying closer to their targets.
