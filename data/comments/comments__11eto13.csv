Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 1 March 2023  


* On 27 February 2023, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence confirmed it had shot down 11 Shahed one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA UAVs) out of 14 launched overnight.  

* Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv City Military Administration, reported nine of these were shot down in the vicinity of Kyiv airspace. Three additional Shahed UAVs were reportedly shot down in Chernhiv Oblast, northern Ukraine.  

* Prior to this 26 February 2023 attack, there have not been any reports of OWA UAVs being used in Ukraine since around 15 February 2023. This decrease in OWA UAV attack tempo likely indicates that Russia has run down its current stock: it will likely seek a resupply.  

* Due to the vector of the attack, these Shahed-UAVs were highly likely launched from the Bryansk Oblast, Russia. Previously, the only observed launch site since mid-December 2022 was from the Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov.  

* A second launch site would give the Russians a different axis of attack, closer to Kyiv.  

* This is likely to decrease time in the air over Ukraine and an attempt to further stretch Ukrainian air defences.

- that UA had essentially retreated from the Eastern direction.  Largely because the terrain (residential housing and park-squares) is not conducive to tactically holding it—that they need height and it’s all one and two-story collapsed houses. 

- that RF are at a tactical disadvantage in the North bc they’re in a valley there.  This contributes to UA’s decision thus far in not withdrawing.

- also that RF has failed to break any of UA’s supply lines.

- therefore, unlikely to withdraw, though possible [will be based on weighing strategic goals versus losses]

**Ukrainian Armed Forces Soldier, Petro Voloshchenko, on the battles for Bakhmut**

Currently, according to the military, the situation is controlled by the Armed Forces, the positions of our defenders are more favorable, and there are no reasons to leave. In an interview for *Donbas24*, a soldier of the Armed Forces, Petro Voloshchenko (‘Stone’) tells how the military holds the city and where the fighting is. He noted that currently Bakhmut is fulfilling its main tasks—to contain and demilitarize a huge concentration of enemy troops, and the Russians have found a calling — ""to see Bakhmut and then die.""


*Fighting continues on the outskirts of Bakhmut* 


The military officer noted that the battles are currently taking place on the approaches to Bakhmut, but **the Russians do not control any of the supply routes.** The enemy's tactics do not change—the occupiers throw men forward, who then die by the thousands, and then they climb over the corpses—all again and again.

> ""The **map looks scary, but** you have to understand that this is a war and active defense is going on. The fact that it is outlined in red where the Russians have made breakthroughs does **not mean that they have already established themselves and have absolute control**. They can be knocked back, they are under the control of our long-range artillery. Now the front line, the entire Bakhmut arc is very dynamic.""

**Implies UA withdrew from the “eastern direction”:**

> ""The occupiers entered the residential area, Zabakhmutka [the southeast quadrant]. But in the city itself, where there are high-rise buildings—there are no battles there—everything is controlled by our guys.  It is impractical to hold positions where there are only squares [single-block parks], foundations of houses, and nothing to cling to [ie, Zabakhmutka].  The Russians burned everything down with a barrage of fire—there are no left buildings there.""


**Ukrainian military advantages in the North—heights and supply lines:**


The northern direction is now the most difficult. 

> ""**Delivery continues** as before, and the **route** to Khromovo and Kostyantynivka to Bakhmut is **under our control**. We are holding the southern flank, the Russians are pushing from the north, the situation there is dangerous, because the enemy has thrown a lot of forces.  

> But **despite their advance**, in the form of a wedge between Yagidny and Berkhivka, taking positions there—**none of that means anything. We advanced** ***further***, to a **natural elevation**, and the **Russians remain in the valley**.""


Thus, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are now in a more favorable position, our soldiers hold the dominant heights. According to the military, it is the landscape of the city that allows it to be held for so long—the defense line is built in such a way that the Russians simply crash against a concrete wall.

> ""The occupiers are losing thousands of people, but we, on the contrary, are preserving the health of our soldiers. There is **nothing threatening about the situation in the city**, as the Russian military would like to present it. I think sooner or later Bakhmut will become a bone in their throat."" 

*There are no reasons to retreat*


According to Petro Voloshchenko, the Russians have now thrown all their forces at Bakhmut—regular troops, special forces, marines, paratroopers, and ""Wagnerians""—wanting to take the city ""at all costs,"" but suffering huge losses.

> ""Bakhmut was planned to be taken in the fall, then in winter; now, spring has come, but the city still stands.  Not only has Bakhmut held back an enormous concentration of troops, but we ""demilitarize"" them all there. Russians have found their calling ""they came, saw Bakhmut, they died"". We crushed their army! We count the killed and multiply the wounded by three, so that all this force does not go to Kharkiv, to Kyiv, to Chernihiv. They cannot even go to Zaporozhye! because they have nothing. Bakhmut solves a specific issue—it demilitarizes the Horde,"" emphasizes the soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to the military officer, the Russians are so eager to capture the city, not because of its military and strategic significance, but in pursuit of a political goal and try to achieve at least some kind of victory in Donbas.

> **""For the Russians, Bakhmut has gone from an ordinary small town to the personification of Ukrainian indomitability. Taking the city for them would be a political victory**, because it has no such military significance.  If the Russians fought for the Kharkiv region, for Izyum, then such a battle would be logical for them,"" says Petro Voloshchenko.

Currently, the Ukrainian military has no reasons or prerequisites for leaving Bakhmut. And even if such a decision is made, the armed forces will withdraw to pre-prepared positions with ammunition.

> ""There no goal to maintain the city at the cost of the lives of our boys—no.  Everything is done consistently. In the event of political capture, the Russians will have a check mark, but they will not be able to reach the administrative border quickly, even mobilized. This is not the pace for the ""second army of the world"". From the plans to capture Kyiv and all of Ukraine in three days, they have gone astray to this one point,"" the Ukrainian military officer explained.",1677700153.0,1677699249.0,t3_11eto13,t3_11eto13,,0,124,0,124,0,0,

I mean, what will it look like for the average advocate of this? Do they see themselves suddenly living like a multi-millionaire in Hollywood if they can just topple the west? Do they see this authoritarian alliance remaining unified with no struggles?

Russians even threw prisoners out of helicopters in midair and dragged prisoners behind vehicles. A doctor even saw a human skull mounted on an Russian APC.

>IfW economists also compared Western aid to Ukraine in the first 12 months of the conflict with Western spending in previous wars. In terms of gross domestic product, for example, Germany spent three times more to defend Kuwait during the 1990-91 Gulf War. After Iraq invaded its neighbor, Kuwait, Germany — which did not directly participate militarily in the Operation Desert Storm offensive — supplied funding to the US which ultimately helped liberate the attacked Gulf nation. Comparatively, Washington spent nearly 1% of GDP on the Gulf War, compared to less than 0.4% so far for Ukraine.

Part of the way through some people started shouting at them for supporting Americas wars.  

When it was quiet enough Kasparov actually gave them his reasoning for supporting American interventions against dictators. He said that if there was just the slightest chance of the people becoming free from a dictator then he would support America in doing so. It doesn't mean he supports absolutely every action taken in a war, but the chance of freedom and democracy was so precious to him that it was ultimately worth trying to topple those dictators and give the people a chance at being free.  

Needless to say, the people who shouted at him didn't agree.  

I've probably mangled his words a bit but hopefully you get the idea. I think he put it better than I could.  

I think he handled the situation quite well to be honest. He didn't want to ignore them and move on. He thought it important to answer their accusations even though he must have known that they would never agree with him.

After they join EU and then NATO, they'll become one of their strongest ideological supporters, like Poland. Statues, museums and movies will be made showing Ukraine as a sort of symbol of heroism against imperialism.

Russia won't fall, no one would benefit from that. If they get anything from this invasion, be either their entire claims or just a small town, they'll present it as a glorious victory, and they'll start selling energy to Europe the next day but with lots of sanctions. If they get absolutely nothing, Putin and his circle could end up replaced by a different set of elites more accepting of western influence in Russia. And they'll also be selling energy the next day, just with less sanctions.

But China is the main factor here because of USA's long term hegemonic interests. Unlike Russia, China could actually replace the USA as the global hegemonic power in the long term. This is why USA has been pushing the rest of NATO to antagonize China. The next for USA and NATO will probably include a diplomatic chess game in Asia until China makes a mistake. Taiwan, Japan, the Koreas and the South China Sea Islands will be hot for a good while. While Europe may try to remain independent from that conflict with little success.",1677729942.0,1677729231.0,t3_11eto13,t1_jak1nbi,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

An F-16, on average, needs almost 17 man-hours of maintenance for every hour of flight time that the airframe makes.

I'm speaking about the biggest cities, as we all know the government doesn't really care about and isn't afraid of minorities. Mainly in Petersburg and Moscow, it is still very possible to live, work, and enjoy past times like before, if you don't read the news. Mainly just travel to Europe is difficult, but Russians just go to Turkey or UAE instead. 

What the majority of Russians prefer is the sand that they've buried their heads in. Most still hold on to a naive belief that if they just push on and focus on the present good things in life around them, then everything will work out fine in the end. Those that don't either fled the country (if they were able), or still still and quiet in fear of retribution. With no way to organize a protest (as we can see) it's basically impossible to present any real threat to the government. 

Also keep in mind that these head-in-sand Russians are not seeing most of this news about mass incarcerations, or about the war, or any negative stuff really. They actively avoid discussing or seeing anything that might hit them in the reality box. 

That's why I don't think it's accurate to say that the Russian population at large supports Putin or the war, or that they will never be active in politics. Putin doesn't need most of the country to support him or the war, he just needs them to not care or want to know what he does. In fact, a wilfully ignorant population is safer than a non-ignorant one that supports him now, because that support isn't always guaranteed. Take the ethnofascists - up until now they've been right behind Putin and his war, but you already start to see the cracks forming and those who think he has lost his touch. Putin is afraid of his supporters moving on, and he is also afraid of anything that will bring these stupefied Russians out of that stupor and make them choose a side. That day is slowly getting nearer. We had a guy bring a duffel bag and shoot a riot police here in Petersburg last week, and yesterday jet fighters were flying over the city after some panic about an unidentified drone near the city. 

Also, my last point: it won't even need to be a popular uprising to unseat Putin. If it is clear that a majority of the population wants him gone, regardless whether they are dissatisfied ethnofascists, liberals, or just apathetic guys who suddenly realised they live in a shithole - then it would significantly incentives someone like Patrushev or Bortnikov making Putin an offer he can't refuse and letting Mishustin clean up the mess while they play puppet master in the shadows. I don't see anyone else having the means to retire Putin, but I think Patrushev, even though he basically has the same ideology as Putin, at least hasn't tied his existence to this dumbass war, and doesn't necessarily want to go down with the sinking ship. If he knows the population would largely support it, I really won't be surprised if he makes it happen.",False,1677687923.0,t3_11eto13,t1_jahnmi6,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

It was revolting, beyond stupid, and frankly soiled a 30+ year friendship. He knew of my family's ordeal, how stressed my wife and I were and said to our faces he supported Ukraine.

However, these days Serbia is much more integrated with EU countries and the EU supports Serbia with a shitton of money that they might lose if they support Russian aggression.

Hungary is historically not pro-Russia but has an illiberal and very corrupt government with disproportionate media and political control, which has been spewing anti-Ukrainian (and sometimes pro-Russian) rhetoric for years. It's not that they are pro-Russia but they stir shit to maximize their personal gain which often helps Russia too. For example they voted for all 10 EU sanction packages against Russia but first threatened with veto multiple times to get more money out of it.

If you get confused remember that Serbia is a Slavic nation with historical friendship to Russia but now much more reliant on the EU.

Second, the “Putin has nukes so we just better let him have whatever he wants” argument is also a poor straw man and a complete false dichotomy - nobody is saying “let him have whatever he wants”, however there is a very strong point to not attempt to induce total Russian collapse, at which point he would have nothing to lose.

Harvard professor Stephen Walt provides a very good summary on this in his [recent essay for foreignpolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/15/putin-right-ukraine-war/):

>	Recognizing this asymmetry also explains why nuclear threats have only limited utility and why fears of nuclear blackmail are misplaced. As Thomas Schelling wrote many years ago, because a nuclear exchange is such a fearsome prospect, bargaining under the shadow of nuclear weapons becomes a “competition in risk taking.” Nobody wants to use even one nuclear weapon, but the side that cares more about a particular issue will be willing to run greater risks, especially if vital interests are at stake. For this reason, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that Russia would use a nuclear weapon if it were about to suffer a catastrophic defeat, and this realization places limits on how far we should be willing to push it. Again, not because Western leaders are weak-willed or craven, but because they are sensible and prudent.

>	Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober. A rival’s coercive nuclear threats have little or no credibility when the balance of resolve favors us, and it is worth remembering that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ever engaged in successful nuclear blackmail during the long Cold War—even against non-nuclear states—despite the enormous arsenals at their disposal.",False,1677726276.0,t3_11eto13,t1_jakoer8,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

I do believe we have plenty of wasteful spending in the DoD, and hold what Eisenhower remarked regarding the cost of one bomber v. what that money could be spent on in its stead, whether housing and feeding the poor or sending a child to school, but we do have a strong military following WWII for a reason - to not allow for a conflict such as that to rise again. That was the idea behind the U.S. being the hegemonic police force of the world. 

Yet sadly we've blundered since the days of WWII, and we've been incapable of facing the mirror and owning our mistakes, especially in the recent decades, like Iraq. Iraq today is better, hands down, than when it was ruled by Saddam. Yet that should not detract from the issues that got us there in the first place, better world without him or not. Same with Libya - the world is better without Gaddhafi than with, yet there was no follow up to help them, which is not our strong suit, clearly. Vietnam today is a developing nation and has ties with the U.S. after that brutal, miserable and at times illegal conflict there. The list goes on, yet the world's trade and growing wealth is as a result of U.S. protection of global waters and the US Dollar (only currency that could be used anywhere without issue), as well as policies that allowed for businesses in the West, especially the U.S., to move production to the countries of SE, S and East Asia that developed them into the juggernauts today, not to mention just the flows of capital to these countries from Western, especially American, financial markets after the collapse of Europe (and subsequent rebuilding by the U.S.) following WWII. Same with Japan, as the U.S. was instrumental in rebuilding that country following WWII to where it was a growing fear Japan would overcome the U.S. as the most powerful economy in the 80s.

All to say, there are many issues with U.S. hegemony and no checks, yet the world as a whole, from the amount of spending on U.S. defense alone in order to secure that freedom of trade and navigation, has been for the better as a result. Yet the U.S. has been too selective on who should be secure in their natural rights to freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We've allied ourselves with too many despots around the world, and have helped to install them. We need to make amends and hold ourselves accountable, as we'd expect from anyone else.

A dozen more nuclear powers with varying conflicts make it much more likely someone launches.

Quoting from my other comment - Harvard professor Stephen Walt provides a very good summary on this in his [recent essay for foreignpolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/15/putin-right-ukraine-war/):

>	Recognizing this asymmetry also explains why nuclear threats have only limited utility and why fears of nuclear blackmail are misplaced. As Thomas Schelling wrote many years ago, because a nuclear exchange is such a fearsome prospect, bargaining under the shadow of nuclear weapons becomes a “competition in risk taking.” Nobody wants to use even one nuclear weapon, but the side that cares more about a particular issue will be willing to run greater risks, especially if vital interests are at stake. For this reason, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that Russia would use a nuclear weapon if it were about to suffer a catastrophic defeat, and this realization places limits on how far we should be willing to push it. Again, not because Western leaders are weak-willed or craven, but because they are sensible and prudent.

>	Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober. A rival’s coercive nuclear threats have little or no credibility when the balance of resolve favors us, and it is worth remembering that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ever engaged in successful nuclear blackmail during the long Cold War—even against non-nuclear states—despite the enormous arsenals at their disposal.",False,1677728345.0,t3_11eto13,t1_jakun0w,,2,-2,0,-2,0,0,

I disagree though that the risk of Russia launching would be extremely low, at least in a scenario of near-total Russian military collapse (which is how this whole comment thread started out, with someone calling to ignore all escalation fears and push for complete destruction of Russia).

My interpretation is that an uneasy and fragile future with many more nuclear powers is already sadly the best-case mid-term outcome, but the worst thinkable (i.e. >5% probability) outcome is the one that is induced by continued and limitless escalation of the war in Ukraine while thinking “there’s no way Russia would actually use nuclear weapons, even if they were cornered entirely” - sadly, this is a very real danger, and dismissing it with the usual fake bravado of “fuck Putin, fuck escalation” only serves to normalize this slippery path that we might find ourselves on with no way to turn back.",False,1677729582.0,t3_11eto13,t1_jakvx6g,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Why would they claim just certain parts? Are you referring to Donbas which according to the MINSK agreement that Ukraine agreed to leave alone to do their own thing but then continued to shell and kill people in the area (most of which is Russian)?

No I would fight them to the death. There is no “let them have certain parts” of my house. It’s mine. Donbas was not theirs, they agreed to that, I never agreed to letting my neighbors have my bathroom and main bedroom. Ukraine agreed. It’s apples to oranges “mate.”

No, I don’t and never would call police for trespassing. Police are the worst, like a big racketeering gang. So that’s that on that cat.

What can Ukraine use as insurance? Idk, I don’t care because it’s there problem. I don’t ask who’s gonna help my neighbor when their house burns down. If they don’t have insurance, they’re shit out of luck. Hopefully they can find people to donate to a gofundme for their troubles.
