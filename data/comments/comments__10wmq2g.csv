Day 349-350 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday Russians decided to fire a bunch of missiles from Belgorod, so it definitely wasn‚Äôt a quiet day. This time they even started firing their missiles at the exact time they were doing missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv earlier in the war, which is 11pm, so that was a bit of a throwback. It was unexpected as well, air raid alert only triggered after the first missile already landed in the city, and the explosions this time were very loud.

This was the biggest missile strike aimed at our city in the recent times, they fired at least 6, and potentially up to 10, missiles, and we heard 6 explosions happen here in the city. Some of the missiles hit a factory, though I‚Äôm not sure what it was producing, Russians said they hit a drone factory, but I have a very hard time believing that we would be producing war equipment in the city that is situated directly at the border with the enemy, there are much safer places for that.

Other missiles hit a ‚Äúvery valuable military target‚Äù, that is ‚Äì the ground in Gorky Park. It‚Äôs not he first time they have hit this park for some reason, they destroyed some attractions in the previous strikes, but the only thing they managed to destroy this time was some dirt. Thankfully there were no casualties from either of the missile strikes, though because of the time at which they did the strike yesterday we were expecting that they might do it again today at 11pm, as it was their previous missile strike schedule, but no new missile strikes happened today and it ended up being quiet in the end.",False,1675903174.0,t3_10wmq2g,t3_10wmq2g,,0,159,0,159,0,0,

This in context to all of the importance people seem to be giving Bahkmut in the current grand scheme of the war (Especially given Russia's desire to drive the narrative around any small vicotry it can manage).  Strategic objectives overall should play directly into progressing your war aims as well as represent a major setback for the opposing force if achieved, accelerating a possible end to the conflict once realized.  By all regards the Bahkmut front lost its strategic value when Russia lost its foothold in Izyum, it now in terms of value purely lies in how Russia see's it as a political/propaganda goal.  Thus Bahkmut really can only be described as a tactical success if gained by the Russian's.  It does by all means advance the war in Russia's favor, but doesn't represent a military objective that changes the general calculus of the conflict.  They now face even larger more fortified urban area's ahead, with some distance before those lines would/could be reached. 

To that end Ukraine is treating it correctly in not forcing reserves it clearly has into the struggle for the city, and instead making sure Russia has to exact a certain price in order to achieve its modest tactical victory.  Girkin himself stated today that Russia has basically set itself up to capture the objective at all costs, its willing to pay a price that goes well beyond the strategic value the place holds.  It would be incorrect for Ukraine to use its forces its preparing for a Strategic goal on one that is Tactical in nature. Thus we've seen them take modest action in stabilizing the front when needing to reform lines, but no concerted effort to counterattack.  All in all its the right move, although the harder pill to swallow, just don't interpret the more then likely pending evacuation of the city as one of a Strategic defeat.",False,1675885928.0,t3_10wmq2g,t3_10wmq2g,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

Think of it as their daily dose of propaganda to inoculate them against accidentally finding out the truth or thinking wrong thoughts. It's also to keep their morale up and make a story to explain away the war.  

Julia Ioffe has said that in Putin's mind he really does think he's fighting America and NATO. Part of the reason she gave is that we know that from Putin's perspective he thinks Ukraine doesn't even exist as a real country. He also thinks that without America getting in his way he would have won by now, so therefore he thinks he's fighting America.  

On top of that, she's said Putin's ultra paranoid KGB mind sees America as pushing democracy. As democracy and freedom for the common people is lethal to dictators, like himself, he sees America and the CIA as trying to topple him via democracy. He was obsessed with how Saddam and Gaddafi died. He sees the same fate for himself if democracy comes too close to the Kremlin.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has asked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to assess what planes could be sent to the war-torn nation, his spokesman, Max Blain, told reporters on Wednesday. Britain isn‚Äôt looking to send Typhoon jets in the immediate future, but rather sees the possibility of sending planes as a long-term solution, he said.

The remarks by Sunak‚Äôs spokesman are the clearest sign yet that the UK is seriously considering acceding to Ukraine‚Äôs biggest ask in the war, almost a year after Russia‚Äôs invasion. On a surprise visit to Britain on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged British lawmakers to provide planes, telling them ‚ÄúWe have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.‚Äù

To be sure, Blain warned that it takes five years to train up British pilots to fly the ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù pieces of equipment, while adding that trainers would look at ways to shorten that for Ukrainian pilots as much as practicable.

Royal Meeting

Zelenskiy earlier arrived on a Royal Air Force plane before heading into London to meet Sunak in Downing Street and speaking to UK lawmakers in Parliament. He later met King Charles III and will visit Ukrainian troops training in southwest England. 

Addressing lawmakers in English in Westminster Hall, the centuries-old venue where Queen Elizabeth II laid in state after her death, Zelenskiy praised the UK for backing Ukraine from the very start of the war. ‚ÄúLondon has stood with Kyiv since day one,‚Äù he said, insisting that Russia was destined to lose.

‚ÄúThe United Kingdom is marching with us towards the most important victory of our lifetime. It will be a victory over the very idea of the war. After we win together, any aggressor, it doesn‚Äôt matter, big or small, will know what awaits him if he attacks international order,‚Äù Zelenskiy said.

Speaking at prime minister‚Äôs questions before Zelenskiy‚Äôs address, Sunak confirmed that the UK would ramp up military assistance, including training for Ukrainian marines and for pilots on advanced combat aircraft.

‚ÄòDecisive‚Äô Victory

‚ÄúWe will continue to support Ukraine to ensure a decisive military victory on the battlefield this year,‚Äù Sunak told MPs.

The trip to the UK comes after a visit to the US in December, when Zelenskiy met President Joe Biden and addressed Congress, and will likely be seen as a vote of gratitude to the UK for being one of Ukraine‚Äôs primary suppliers of military aid. 

UK forces trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops in 2022 and aims to assist at least 20,000 more this year, Sunak said in Parliament. Britain is also providing Challenger 2 tanks as part of a ¬£2 billion ($2.4 billion) weapons and equipment package.

Zelenskiy previously addressed Britain‚Äôs Parliament via video link in March 2022, two weeks after the start of the invasion. He echoed World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill, vowing that Ukrainians ‚Äúwill fight till the end at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost.‚Äù It drew him a standing ovation from lawmakers. 

War Crimes Pledge

Zelenskiy‚Äôs arrival will boost Sunak, who has faced domestic criticism over a rocky start to his premiership and a lackluster cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday. It also shows that Sunak‚Äôs decision not to send fighter jets to Ukraine has not affected the relationship with Kyiv. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson had urged Sunak to increase support by sending planes.

Sunak said the UK would stand with Ukraine ‚Äúfor years to come,‚Äù and backed a call by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer for Russia to be held accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine.

‚ÄúOne of the things I discussed with President Zelenskiy this morning is our support for the work of the ICC where, thanks to the efforts of UK members, I‚Äôm hopeful we will see the first indictments very shortly,‚Äù Sunak said.",False,1675872373.0,t3_10wmq2g,t1_j7pvbf5,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

The man who helped Putin seize power has said that when Putin dies Russia will likely fall but a Putin v.2.0 will rise to take the old Putin's place. Put simply, it'll be Putin clones over and over.  

There are a number of reasons for this. For one thing, Putin has shaped the entire system in Russia so it cannot function without him. A successor would need to be a big enough tyrant to wield power and control the FSB, the military and GRU, the brutal police, the Russian mafia and oligarchs.  

Any lesser person has already been murdered, imprisoned or exiled, and usually in that order of preference by Putin. You'd have to be a tyrant like Putin or such a system would eat you alive. They have a whole culture where the leader must be a tough, strong man.  

Julia Ioffe said something rather sobering in an interview, she said that there are worse people, more extreme or hardline than Putin. Things can always get worse.  

If you're interested I definitely recommend you watch the PBS Frontline interviews with Julia Ioffe.  
[The Putin Files: Julia Ioffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1HWNcLDK88).  
[Putin's Road to War: Julia Ioffe (interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNo2FPQDQw).  
[Putin and the Presidents: Julia Ioffe (interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEu0oRajJxE).  

Julia talks about what goes on in Putin's mind and why, what makes him tick. She explains how not just Putin but also the Kremlin works and their way of thinking, why Putin declared war, etc. I honestly think that our understanding is vital as so much of what goes on can easily seem weird or not make sense to anyone who isn't from that culture.  

Our understanding is also vital as Putin, or a successor, will continue to try and destabilise our countries. They'd like nothing more than for us to not be aware of what's going on as it makes us an easy target.  

If you have time you may find the rest of the full interviews from those PBS Frontline Putin series interesting.  

If you have even more time there's also the 7 part BBC documentary by Adam Curtis called [Russia 1985‚Äì1999: TraumaZone. What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_1985%E2%80%931999:_TraumaZone). It's long at aprox. 7 hours total (1hr per episode).

He has, unfoundedly, called the assassination of Bin Laden a lie / hoax without providing any evidence, he disputes the Syrian / Russian use of chemical weapons - again without providing any real evidence. In 2007 he accused the US of funding a terrorist group, but when pressed he failed to provide any sources or evidence.

He defended Russia against allegations of poisoning Skripal - blaming it on organized crime without a single shred of evidence. Clearly just trying to protect Russia here for a yet unknown reason... 

He is also a large part of the reason why Qanon took off when he promoted the Seth Rich conspiracy regarding wikileaks. This whole operation is now known to have been a Russian set up... 

So it is clear Hersch is getting information from the Russians and pushing it out as baseless, unsourced propaganda. He is a useful idiot at best if not actually compromised.

a57a61f9c31628a96645f1f337d32fc6,10wmq2g,j7ovgxp,"Your assuming a few things here. One, that every Ukrainian service member is in ukraine, they are not, tens of thousands are outside the country training in western countries. 

Two, that every available soldier man's the front. Troops are rotated out to rest. If you can help it, you don't want troops on the Frontline longer than about two to three weeks. A soldiers combat effectiveness declines the longer they are on the front, so if you can rotate troops out, you do. 

Three, that all troops are capable or oriented towards offensives. A significant portion of Ukraine's forces are  primarily defense troops, namely the territorial defense forces, which are semi-irregular troops that are not very useful for offensive actions. Members of these groups have been getting trained into regular soldiers, but that takes time.

Four, that Ukraine wants to attack right now. Pretty much everybody agrees that Ukraine's next offensive target will be to strike through Zaporitia towards Mariupol and to the sea of Azov. That would be an attack on a wide front requiring tens of thousands of troops for just the initial push while maintaining a sturdy defense on all other fronts. It's an attack you plan for months, and only attempt once conditions are proper. Especially since attacking is harder than defending. Right now, conditions are not proper since it has been a warm winter in Ukraine so far and the ground is still muddy around the line of contact making wide front offensives extremely difficult if not untenable, so Ukraine is forced to wait. 

Five, that because Ukraine is not attacking they must be weaker than they say they are. Wars are not won simply by winning battles and gaining territory. If they were, the United States would have won Vietnam and the soviets Afghanistan. Wars are won via a combination of will and attrition/ the ability to absorb losses. Ukraine simply needs to outlast Russia to the point that the Russians decide fighting is no longer worth it. Russia is the aggressor, they are the ones that decide when the fight is over. As such, Ukraine just needs to wear Russia down. How do you do that? By playing defensively and only attacking when you know you can win for a price that is worth it. The fact is that Russia has a much higher population pool to draw from and still has deep stocks of equipment to pull from. It might not be the best equipment, but a tank is still a tank. Ukraine can't throw it's resources away, they need to fight smarter, not harder if they are going to win.

Six, that bakhmut is important to hold in the long run. Don't get me wrong, bakhmut is a location Ukraine would rather hold. If the front in Donbas can be pushed up, bakhmut could become a significant logistics hub due to it sitting on three major highways. However, Ukraine has no desire to attack in Donbas anytime soon, so holding it is not that important. What Ukraine is willing to do however is make the Russians pay for it. Defenders can usually expect a three to one to five to one causality rate when compared to attackers when defenders are in defensive fortifications like trenches. Fortifications that bakhmut has. Even in the worst case scenario, Ukraine is ""winning"" in the sense that they are losing less than the Russians for a location that, again, has little strategic importance at this point. If Russia wants bakhmut to be their Verdun, let it be so.

Finally, seven, that Ukraine is stacked with western equipment. The Ukraine war, if nothing else, is a wonderful example of how nations make due with what they have to fight a war. Ukraine, at the exact same time, has units fielding HIMARS, arguably the most advanced MLRS system in the world, and also units fielding homemade rocket launchers mounted on the back of old pickup trucks. The Ukrainian army is still a hogpoge of western equipment, Soviet equipment, and whatever cousin vlad could cook up in his garage. Ukraine is still very much in the transition phase from a cold war era military to a modern Western one, and it's arguable they won't make that transition fully until after the war. The Russians, for their part, are exactly the same. They just have more old equipment laying around. Assuming the west stays committed to Ukraine, Ukrainian equipment will only improve with time while Russian equipment deteriorates. Right at this moment though, both sides are almost evenly matched in terms of their ground forces capabilities.

So, to sum everything up. Numbers aren't everything. It's how, where and why you use them that wins a war. While I am firmly on Ukraine's side, I know this war won't be over for some time, and that we probably won't know for certain how things will shake out until the latest spring/summer offensives. So be patient, it won't be over until it's over.",False,1675851949.0,t3_10wmq2g,t1_j7or03b,,2,68,0,68,0,0,

Offensive operations are costly, so Ukraine waits for better equipment. Ukraine also keeps reserves to reinforce any area that's necessary. They would need to commit large amount of troops for any offensive operation. That would create lack of these reserves, and it could make some parts of the front vulnerable to a potential breakthrough. That's why they need to calculate when and where an offensive would make the most sense, to maximize chance for success and minimize risks for other parts of the front.

As you have seen before, their offensive operations have been mostly big successes. Even the less successful advances weren't failures, because they were cautious and didn't overcommit.",False,1675849611.0,t3_10wmq2g,t1_j7or03b,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

If 150k were in Belarus (which doesn't seem to be the case) you would need at least 50k on the ukrainian side that protect this border. You also need to prevent a re-occupation of the Kharkiv and Kherson areas that were freed. 

Even if we go with your numbers although not even Ukraine is remotely close to a 200k kill count for russian soldiers: How many troops do you think you need for an offensive on all 230k people?

I don't know when Putin and Erdogan started discussing the gas hub, but you can imagine how mixing the Russian gas with the middle eastern gas will insulate Russia from having their gas sanctioned. Now is the hub a reaction to the explosion or was the idea to destroy the pipeline and build one to Turkey?

Both are not in the interest of Ukraine at all because the current meat grinder weakens the russian capabilities way more than anything Ukraine could do on its own without really achieving much for the russian side. Even if Ukraine has to go back to the next defense line after losing Bakhmut Russia only has won a tiny bit of (now destroyed) territory for a way too high cost that even for them isn't sustainable.

Like... if Russians are attacking there over and over - Ukrainian choices on that area of the front are either to keep defending like they have or to retreat. If they retreat - Russians will find a new place to attack repeatedly so what would retreating accomplish?

In the past they withdrew in the face of Russian force concentration and traded space for time.  Why wouldn't they do that this time?

The answer appears to be that Russia *needed* to capture it after they annexed oblasts they do not fully control.  Ukraine is defending it to deny Russia an easy political win.

Bakhmut falling is not a strategic disaster for Ukraine.  What *would* be a strategic disaster is defending Bakhmut at all costs, allowing their reserves to be drawn in to the defense of a location that has little value other than its defensibility.
