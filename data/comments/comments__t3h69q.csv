5127663f04320a03ae7d844b61180a7e,t3h69q,hys7nve,"At its extraordinary meeting on February 28, 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided to adopt the EU sanctions against Russia and thus strengthen their impact.  


**EU sanctions will be adopted**  
It will adapt the existing ordinance based on the EU measures. Switzerland will put the sanctions into force in coordination with the EU. These are primarily goods and financial sanctions. The assets of the individuals and companies listed in the annex to the ordinance are blocked with immediate effect; the opening of new business relationships remains prohibited as before.  


**Sanctions against Putin and Co.**  
With immediate effect, Switzerland is also implementing the financial sanctions imposed by the EU against Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. This is Switzerland's response to the serious violations of international law for which these individuals are responsible.  


**Donetsk and Luhansk**  
The ban on imports, exports and investments concerning Crimea and Sevastopol, in place since 2014, was extended to the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which are no longer under the control of the Ukrainian government.  


**Visa facilitation cancelled**  
The Federal Council also decided to partially suspend the 2009 agreement on visa facilitation for Russians. Holders of diplomatic passports will continue to be allowed to enter the country without a visa so that Switzerland can continue to facilitate talks and negotiations to resolve conflicts as part of its good offices.  


**Entry bans for Putin confidants**  
The Federal Council has also decided on entry bans against several people who have a connection to Switzerland and are close to the Russian president. Based on the Federal Constitution (Art. 184 para. 3 BV and Art. 185 BV), the Federal Council can issue appropriate measures to safeguard the country's interests or Switzerland's external security, independence and neutrality.  


**Airspace closed for Russian planes**  
In addition, in line with airspace closures in other European countries, Swiss airspace will be closed from 3 p.m. Monday to all flights from Russia and to all movements of aircraft with Russian markings, except for flights for humanitarian, medical or diplomatic purposes.  


**Offering good services**  
In making its decisions, the Federal Council also took into account neutrality as well as peace policy aspects. It reaffirmed Switzerland's willingness to actively contribute to a solution of the conflict through its Good Offices. Russia's unprecedented military attack on a sovereign European country prompted the Federal Council to change its previous sanctions practice. The defense of peace and security and respect for international law are values that Switzerland, as a democratic country, shares and supports with its European neighbors. As before, Switzerland will examine each further sanctions package of the EU individually.  


**Aid for the Ukrainian population**  
These days, Switzerland is delivering around 25 tons of aid worth eight million francs to the Polish capital Warsaw. The Federal Department of Defense, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS) is providing urgently needed medical supplies and medicines from the army pharmacy. The relief supplies are intended for the Ukrainian population in Ukraine and in the neighboring states. The aid delivery is being accompanied by staff from the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit.

According to the poll, conducted last week over three days before and immediately after the attacks with a representative sample of nearly 1,400 people, 53% of Finns would now support Finland’s accession to Nato, with 28% opposed and 19% unsure.

In 2017, the last time YLE’s market researchers polled on the same question, only 19% of Finns were in favour of joining the alliance, while a survey for private broadcaster MTV in January showed 30% supported membership.

Juho Rahkonen, the pollster’s research director, said described the shift in public opinion as radical and historic. “Basically, the percentages of those in favour of Nato membership and those against have changed places,” Rahkonen said.

Russia’s invasion has also increased support for Nato membership in Sweden, with a survey commissioned last week by Swedish public broadcaster SVT showing 41% in favour and 35% opposed. The Finnish poll suggested that if Sweden applied to join the alliance, support for Finnish membership would rise to 66%.

Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian empire for more than a century until 1917, shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border with Russia, the longest of any EU state. Though not members, Finland and Sweden closely cooperate with Nato, allowing, among other things, the alliance’s troops to exercise on their soil.

Helsinki and Stockholm have also substantially intensified their bilateral defense cooperation in the past years, and secured close military cooperation with the United States, Britain and neighbouring Nato member Norway.

Russia warned last week that if either country sought to join the alliance they would face “serious military-political consequences” from Moscow.

The president reiterated the international community’s demand that [Russia] halt its offensive against Ukraine, and reaffirmed the necessity of immediately establishing a ceasefire.

With ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow under way on the Belarus border, Macron also asked Putin to ensure that for the duration of the negotiations all strikes and attacks on civilians and their homes would be halted, civilian infrastructure would be preserved, and all main roads – particularly the road south out of Kyiv – would remain safe to use.

Putin “confirmed his willingness to commit to all three points”, the Elysée statement said.

Macron also called on Putin to ensure international humanitarian law was respected and civilian populations and aid transports protected, and asked the Russian president to “stay in touch over the coming days to avoid the situation worsening”.

But the measures we are introducing, and that large parts of the world are introducing, are to bring down the Putin regime.""

- This was later clarified: ""We're not seeking anything in terms of regime change. What we're talking about here clearly is how we stop Russia seeking to subjugate a democratic country. That's been the message throughout.""

- On visas for Ukrainians: ""We're going further and we'll be setting out a humanitarian package to enable a routine for Ukrainian nationals that are fleeing the violence inflicted by Russia.""

a9a81c607b265493166a5b5dadd855eb,t3h69q,hys6ska,"So, I have been poking around about the mercenaries in Ukraine, specifically former SOF. There's a good background article[^1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3nqb5/ukraine-war-foreign-fighters) on this issue you should all check out.

If you all remember, Zelensky called for a mandatory curfew [^2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60539122). The reason why was due to the fact that there were assassins sent out to kill him and other government officials as well as his own family.[^3](https://intelnews.org/2022/02/25/01-3159/) This is not the first time this has happened. Back in September, there was an assassination attempt on one of Zelensky's aides.[^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/12/24/what-we-know-about-remote-control-assassination-attempt-in-ukraine/?sh=20a81624c3fd)

So, back to the mercenaries. There's a sizeable group in Kyiv right now from the United States, France, and UK[^5](https://www.instagram.com/p/CahBNC-sK5y/). I have been trying to find out if there are any former JTF2 members in the group, but it seems like there aren't any at the moment. Why is this interesting? Because they are made up of former SEALS, Green Berets, 75th Rangers, SAS, SBS, SASR. If you scroll through that guy's profile, you can see various patches denoting these kinds of connections. There are even some in Kherson right now. [^6](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/t2ry59)

Now, obviously, they aren't going to give away any details of their assignments or roles in Ukraine. But one thing they do very well is ambushing and forward observation. It would not surprise me if they were getting direct intelligence from their native government intelligence agencies as well, despite no longer being enrolled by them[^7](https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/595916-us-employs-unusual-intel-strategy-to-counter-putin). Indeed, Russians are getting first-hand experience of what that kind of military training, skill, and intelligence is like when they were confronted by foreign attackers.[^8](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/t2qg90/russian_invaders_tell_with_horror_how_ukrainians/)

What does this have to do with Zelensky's curfew mandate? Well, it appears that one of the reasons for implementing the curfew was to snuff out any saboteurs.[^9](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-saboteurs-spark-suspicion-solidarity-in-ukraine-kyiv/) It would not surprise me if the other reason was to utilize these SOF to isolate and hunt down assassins using the western mercenaries, including the one linked on Instagram. These guys are there to hunt, as they have fought against them in the past[^10](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html). They aren't there to just play war.

Mediakovskyi – who is 20 – said his mother had woken him early last Thursday to tell him Russia had invaded Ukraine. “I knew it was going to start. My hands started shaking,” he said. After spending a day doom-scrolling on social media, he decided he would try to help.

“My parents know I’m volunteering. I haven’t told my granny. She’s worried enough about things already,” he admitted. He acknowledged that a molotov wouldn’t stop the mighty Russian army. But he stressed: “It will break Russian soldiers mentally, and show them they are not welcome here.”

There’s basically been an acknowledgment by U.S officials that open source Intel plays a huge role in intelligence gathering. While many people already knew this, the actual scope of OSINT usage by intelligence agencies is shocking. 

> 'open source' intelligence that is going on in militaries and intelligence agencies around the world, including the United States. One official estimated 80% of intelligence is now sourced to unclassified sources https://twitter.com/byrontau/status/1497624830476173314?s=21 

I know people are sick and tired of hearing about Marco Rubio, but he’s privy to someone of the most current intelligence the U.S has. Him saying this is truly remarkable.

> Also much respect to the international online #OSINT community, many of whom may not realize how much of their geolocation & vetting of videos & satellite imagery is integrated into the broader work of the intelligence community. https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1497767438812917761?s=21  This was just a few days ago. 

Not only has Marco Rubio been towing a fine line between being reprimanded for leaking intelligence, but he is confirming what journalists have been getting at for the past couple years. Intelligence Agencies are at a turning point for how they operate. They are still tracking users data in ways that most ordinary citizens can’t (unless you get spyware from the dark web). Intel Agencie are using the OSINT community to authenticate all of the videos and pictures posted from ordinary people. Geolocation work can be very tedious work because you are paying attention to very small details in the background of a video or picture. With authentication comes the disinformation aspect.

Disinformation is not new either, but rather now disinformation and OSINT has truly become a cat and mouse game. Creating and manipulating fake videos or photos to throw OSINT communities off the trail is something that can easily fool amateurs, but for experts like Bellingcat, they know what they’re doing. However, as people become better with editing software and as AI gets more advanced with deepfakes, it looks like it’s going to be a lot more difficult to combat.",1646062410.0,1646061718.0,t3_t3h69q,t3_t3h69q,,0,48,0,48,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

At this point, the attack from the north into Kyiv isn’t intended to take the city.  Maybe they hoped to get a quick win or a couple assassinations but that is long out the window now. Attacking would be a messy affair with 10k+ civilian deaths and countless Russian lives lost.  Now the goal is to pin down a substantial portion of the Ukrainian army to defend the capital.  It’s also why Russia leaves the power on in the city so everyone can stay glued to the actions there.

The real thrust of the attack is coming in the envelopment of the Ukrainian forces dug in in the Donbas region.  The Russians plan to surround the troops there (I’ve read 45k), cut them off and use them as a bargaining chip for claiming everything east of the Dnieper River.  

The soldiers in the east are in an impossible position.  They cannot move without air cover and the Russian artillery will tear them to pieces if they stick around. And since the rest of their forces are pinned down defending Kyiv, no relief will come.
 
And that’s how I think this will end.  The Ukrainians pull back the troops and cede the territory east of the Dnieper River.   They can rightfully claim the heroics of defending Kyiv against the assault which will help save a bit of pride.  Then we are in a stalemate with the world and the Russian economy on what breaks first.",1646060033.0,1646059691.0,t3_t3h69q,t3_t3h69q,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Simply put, he is most likely trying to use them as leverage so we get scared and lose our resolve. But even if he is serious, it's a risk I feel we have to take. 

The other option is letting this maniac continue to crush democracy after democracy and re-create a new Iron Curtain. Belarus would've broken free of Lukashenko, Kazakhstan's government wouldn't be so oppressive to their opposition, Georgia wouldn't have a puppet government, the far right/far left parties in the west wouldn't be causing so much chaos, etc.

Let me be clear - I really don't like Ronald Reagan/am actually a liberal myself but I think this quote fits the moment:

""We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, ""Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters."" Alexander Hamilton said, ""A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one."" Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender.

Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for ""peace at any price"" or ""better Red than dead,"" or as one commentator put it, he'd rather ""live on his knees than die on his feet."" And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.""",False,1646060330.0,t3_t3h69q,t3_t3h69q,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

It is very hard to filter through as a foreigner to the region, because even the news channels which should be reliable have said things that are not correct by different degrees.

I have a friend from college who lived in the Crimea area until I think 2015. She has since moved to another country. But it's my only (minor) personal connection to the area and I wonder what is going to happen to it now that Putin's invasion has gone off-course.

You have not done this I think Crimea would have stayed in Russian hands and definitely but would have been universally recognized as a part of Ukraine as it is now.

I know that nobody can predict the future, but in light of the past week, the amount of power including bargaining power that the Russian government has lost, and the fact that Ukraine seems so ready and willing to defend herself, I wonder now whether there's any chance that Russia will have to release Crimea in any future bargaining or negotiations to lessen sanctions.

Even if that happens in a few years after Putin is gone, it somehow seems more likely to me than it did just a couple weeks ago.

The Russians with so much time to plan, with so much knowledge of the enemy, with so much build-up and more than a year preparing for this. It's failing mildly. The conveys are getting recked without any support in the air. It seems normal to you guys?! I can be getting delusional but I guess not. With a huge army, I see small attacks, I don't see scenarios where are huge breakthroughs. I see old tanks, I see old vehicles, I see missiles that don't detonate. They are marked with a letter, we almost don't see full vehicles of troops (Correct me if I'm mistaken). It's just strange... A KGB operative with a lot of knowledge about the war and failing so badly?!

― Sun Tzu, The Art of War  
“All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”

TL;DR: Russia is fighting a war but they only planned a “special operation” because they generally only fight weaker opponents so a special operation typically gets the job done, and that’s Putin’s specialty going back to his KGB days. 

That was not the case here, they made several Military Strategy 101 mistakes, and that’s why things aren’t going as planned. They severely underestimated their opponent and the magnitude of the unified NATO response.",False,1646065647.0,t3_t3h69q,t1_hysirm2,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The critics are disingenuous liars. 

The loudest are among the parties doing their utmost to hobble the UN. 

But more importantly, they willfully misunderstand what the UN is. The UN is not a government. The UN is simply a discussion forum. It only exists to help deescalate tensions between member states. It is not a world gov't and was never intended to be a 'Deep State'. It is a place for idiots to convene and talk their heads off, but on occasion to also engage in diplomacy to avoid WWIII.

Usually, the Central Bank's job is to keep the inflation at or around 2% to ensure stability and economic growth.

So if the inflation is too high, the Central Bank increases interest rates to make savings more attractive and encourage people to put their money into their bank accounts - effectively taking money off the market.

Conversely, too little economic growth the government will spend money, put money into the market i order to raise the demand. 

However, here the situation is, that Russia's Central Banks' assets have neen frozen, limiting the ways how they could combat the inflation effectively down to zero. 

The panic and run on banks has already started - meaning people want to withdraw money, tsking away even more money from the Central Bank, limiting its options even more, leading to even less options to combat the inflation.

At some point it likely will lead to a runaway inflation, which means the CB cant effectively steer the situation anymore and the prices will just continue to increase and money will effectively be worthless - which is called hyperinflation.

Combined with the rubbles exchange rate dropping, the buying power of people who own rubles effectively halved in comaprison to the dollar.

I do know that Putin needs support from wealthy Russians (not just the oligarchs) and the sanctions will test their loyalty. The potential freezing of assets by Switzerland (and others), and the inability to fly freely around Europe are both things that many rich Russians will see as *huge* negatives.

Before the war, Putin had somewhere between 55% and 80% approval rating by the Russian public. He was genuinely popular, for a dictator. I get the feeling that the average Russian is surprised that Putin actually invaded. Many Russians have relatives in Ukraine and they view Ukraine as a historic ally.

Putin seems to have expected Kyiv to have fallen by now. It appears that the only way for Russia to win militarily at this point will be to ratchet up the level of violence against civilian targets in Ukraine to a degree that will horrify the Russian public and further galvanize support for Ukraine.

2.) They have modern equipment, but likely not much. Evidenced by the presence of some few well targeted missile strikes, the few TOS platforms moving around, and the warships out and about. The lack of stockpiles of workable modern equipment is evidenced by the overall lack of supplies leaving equipment abandoned on the road, the inability to gain air superiority, and the inability to take/overwhelm Ukraine's electronic warfare apparatus.

It wasn't a blitzkrieg, as the term is used in the military.
A blitzkrieg consists of multiple echelons, the first is quick and keeps moving, leaving defenders intact behind them. Subsequent echelons, usually 2 or 3, follow and engage the defenders that were passed.

The Russians didn't have 2nd or 3rd echelons follow. Could be because they expected less Ukrainian resistance, or less effective resistance.

I've also read analysis that the Russian army is poorly led, especially on the lower levels and most of the infantry has not seen combat against a trained and motivated enemy in such large numbers.

I just find the analysis of war interesting. But the Russians may now be starting to use more deadly and controversial weapons, which kill civilians indiscriminately.

You are right that there are firm geostrategic issues for Russia to have Ukraine within their sphère of influence.  But these issues are due to an old cold war understanding of the world.  Whereas this realpolitik approach to borders is becoming more and more unacceptable in a world that is more and more interconnected.

That being said, I am under the belief that the geopolitical excuse, the building back a historic Russia etc coming out of Moscow is a red herring.  The real issue here is Ukrainian natural gas resources and how an EU centric Ukraine threatens Russian dominance in this sector.  Something like 30% of Russia's economy is based on natural gas.

Putins demands toward NATO are unrealistic and NATO  will never capitulate to such ridiculous requirements.  Asking NATO to move back to pre-1997 boundaries will never happen especially in light of Russia's current aggression.  Again, these demands and statements are more for internal reasons to solidify his base by appealing to a certain ethnonationalism.

Eventually, the economic impact combined with the losses of war and the pressure on Putin result in a ceasefire and then real negotiations that can take place on a global scale.

That's because most of the news we've been getting are propaganda. And almost all of the news posted on reddit lean towards Western narrative in this conflict, which is supporting Ukraine. Not to say that supporting Ukraine is wrong, as I support their civilians in this conflict. But reading some of the stuff posted around, one might think that Ukrainians are in counter attack and almost in front of Moscow.

As for the old equipment, Russians probably thought that this attack won't require anything newer, since they took Crimea without too much opposition in 2014. This seems to have bitten them in the ass somewhat, but we still need to see how the conflict will develop.

Ukraine is a big country. It takes time to conquer it. I read somewhere that Russians estimated that the offensive will last for couple of weeks. The attack was also slower than one might expect, as to me it seemed that Russians took care not to inflict unnecessary civil deaths so far. It sounds incredibly cruel, but what we've seen so far was mostly what an army would call 'collateral damage'.

People around here love to act like Putin is stupid and mad and doesn't know what he is doing. Newsflash, he probably does know what he is doing.

His actions are fairly rational, they're just extreme and it's still questionable whether his priorities will work out for him in the end. He's trying to land-grab because Ukraine is resource-rich and because the alternative is NATO gaining an ally that is directly south of Moscow. And crumbling the economy might have been a risk made off of the information that the USSR was economically isolated for decades and so Russia can weather the aftermath.

Frankly as others have cited, ""rational decisions are not made by irrational people"". I note three things here:

1) [Russia still operates a ""dead man's switch"" for their nuclear system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand). We don't know much about it but [the cryptic comment yesterday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/vladimir-putin-puts-russia-nuclear-deterrence-forces-on-high-alert-ukraine) would suggest to me it might have been activated.

2) It's easy to feed a narrative to someone that's sat in a bunker for a week, *if* you even need a person to turn a key now in their system. Telling them there are 300 ICBM inbound is a hell of a motivator.

3) If you're an irrational person expecting a bullet at any point from any corner, *and* you've lost, what does it matter to you what the consequences are? Selfish attitudes would do ""if I can't have a nice economy and what I want, everyone else can suffer too"".

I'm not fearmongering, just reminding everyone that this isn't a game and some probably unstable person is holding a lot of the cards. The world needs to stand up to him but it's best not to poke him with a stick.

I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=JrMiSQAGOS4) in a comment about by now like 3-4 threads ago. It makes some sense. The West did ""provoke"" Russia by trying to make Ukraine ""Western"" which they (=Putin) have said since 2 decades they will not allow.

So from a complete rational viewpoint of saving as many lives possible and as much infrastructure as possible then yes, you are right. Just let him keep Crimea and make Ukraine neutral, no NATO ever.  I mean why would US/NATO even want them to join? It makes no sense. Just increases risk for a WW.

8318d2c830b244a5cb9b353dc3be68f8,t3h69q,hyscxjc,"Copied from elsewhere:

A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible. Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646062209.0,t3_t3h69q,t1_hysccb3,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

*I've been trying to find out, but I think it's largely Russian disinformation and Propaganda. That being said, there is some truth to it.*

*It seams like the only requirement for Ukrainians to cross into Poland is their passport. Indians have not been evacuated and are trying to cross the border as refugees. Polish officials were not letting them because they aren't Ukrainians and therefore need a proper VISA to enter the country. This resulted in long wait times and chaos for the Indians.

I don't believe this.  I don't care what the rules are, it's obvious Putin gets whatever he wants.

He's surrounded by Yes-men and I don't trust that they'd stand up to him in a moment of crisis.

>Why would they launch a nuclear weapon to Ukraine when it would only hurt not only their chances at capturing Ukraine but also the entire country.

Russia has already destroyed their economy for decades as a result of this invasion.  If they can't capture Ukraine's resources then their final option might be to simply destroy as much as possible.  They're already targeting civilians and hospitals with conventional weapons, they're not simply attacking military targets.  

Again, you're giving me rational reasons why it's suicidal and stupid to use nuclear weapons.  I agree with you, it's suicidal and stupid.  My whole point is that the invasion is just as irrational and Putin did it anyway, he's not acting rationally and you can't assume he's going to make choices in his best interest anymore",False,1646061726.0,t3_t3h69q,t1_hysb3vp,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes, I think he can.  I disagree that the checks and balances are working in Russia.  I don't think you can trust those systems to stay strong if Putin wants to override them.

I already told you this.  Putin has total control in Russia and he has for decades.  He's never followed Russian law and he doesn't have any oversight or accountability.  If he orders someone to give him those codes they will.  If anyone in Russia is strong enough to stand up and say no to him he has them executed and replaced with someone that will just do as they're told.
