Strike plans not just available to military leaders but to regular civilians on Twitter, detailing equipment, targets, force numbers, everything. While the USA publicly stated that they were wary of sharing Russian troop movements after the invasion had started for fear of it being interpreted as an act of war, I have to wonder if they're either sharing intelligence behind the scenes or advising on this course of action, because it's incredibly unusual and it seems like a continuation of the earlier tactic of constant disclosure. Citizens being warned in advance of specific times and methods of attack, incoming blackouts, tactics to do with refugee flows, etc. 

On one level I'm sure the Russians were prepared for their adversaries to know what they were up to - hard to plug leaks in the information age - but I have a feeling that Putin's tactical calculus deeply relied on the shock & awe factor. If you're getting bombed and everything's confusing and the lights go out, you panic. But if you've been told two hours in advance that the enemy is planning to switch your lights off, you know what you're up against, you feel prepared, you get defiant. 

Imagine the hit on morale this is for the invading forces, too. You go into someone's country, attack their home, and they're not even surprised. You're not coming down like some god, striking terror, causing panic. Everyone knew you were coming, and here you are - gonna kill us now, asshole?

Russia’s plan to seize Kyiv, according to Ukrainska Pravda intelligence sources:

1.	⁠intensify attacks along the border, so troops leave Kyiv;
2.	⁠seize one of Kyiv’s airports, as sabotage groups disconnect the city from electricity and communications to cause panic;
3.	⁠organize arson and looting to create more panic;
4.	⁠launch a cyber attack on government websites;
5.	⁠induce more panic to create “uncontrolled columns of refugees’ from Kyiv to block highways and hinder movement of Ukrainian troops;
6.	⁠capture and hold government buildings.

Desired goal: Seize the leadership of the state (not specified who) and force them to sign a peace agreement on Russian terms, threatening large civilian deaths.

Result – Ukraine can be divided into two parts, like East and West Germany.

I discovered a people who were proud, strong, resilient, patriotic and incredibly hard working. Ukraine became my adopted home, a base that allowed me to travel all over Europe. I eventually became a professional English teacher and worked in Kyiv. I met my first love and spent 4 years with her. I have so many wonderful friends. Some of the most incredible people I've ever known. I love my life now, and it's all thanks to Ukraine. 

Last Sunday I evacuated and returned to Canada. I left behind everything except some clothes. I have nothing now, thanks to Putin. The day I left I confessed my love to a girl at Maidan. She asked me why it took me so long to say. We planned a date for when I get back. Luckily she was out of the country when that attack happened. 

I have lost my home, my job, all my belongings, my independence, my savings for education. And yet I am lucky because I got out. 

Now I fear for my friends. Anya is pregnant and has a baby due next month. Alan lives close to government controlled buildings that are prime targets for bombing. Maryna just met her new love. Yuriy and oleksi sent their wives and children to the west, but they are unable to leave themselves. My ex girlfriend, who I still care so deeply for, hears explosions and hasn't slept in two days. She's got our two pet cats with her and no way to leave the city. I have teenage students sitting in bomb shelters and friends fleeing west in cars.

So they have to keep staggering them bit by bit to be shown to be doing something as time passes. Because if you just go all in on sanctions on day one and he doesn't stop the attack, then what more can you threaten on day two? 

It all just seems like a political game where everyone is pretending to help and saying the right things, but only to save face, because they all realise their words aren't going to do shit. Only direct action is going to have an effect and it's clear that that's not going to happen. 

You'd expect the intelligence services to have an idea what kind of sanctions would truly stop this invasion, and if they had that answer then surely they'd use it before it gets too late?

I'd honestly appreciate some reassurance that I'm completely wrong because this is fucking awful

EDIT: Thanks for the responses guys. Sounds like these sanctions aren't expected to help Ukraine, but to destroy Russia over time. Seems like a bit of bullshit that the media is dominated by these sanction headlines, when realistically it makes absolute zero difference to the people and country of Ukraine. I understand its difficult for countries to actually help Ukraine directly, I just wish they'd stop pretending that these press talks are actually doing anything.

1. Invent a ""terror attack"", ""genocide"" or ""Ukrainian attack"" in order to justify Russian invasion.
2. Make several warnings in advance that this behavior will not be tolerated, and Russia will react, as to have the pretense when the attack finally comes - and present himself as the defender rather than aggressor.
3. Make several false moves as if planning to attack, but don't really attack, in order to create ""boy that cried wolf"" situation
4. When no one expects it, and public opinion stops caring about US/NATO warnings, start the real attack
5. Stop all western and Ukrainian media broadcasts in Ukraine (maybe disconnect from the internet) and make Russian news sources the only ones available.
6. Declare Ukrainian president as responsible for the actions that Russia is ""reacting"" to. (To justify the overthrow for the Russian people)
7. Prepare corruption charges (in Russian: Kompromat) for the Ukrainian president. (To justify the overthrow for the Ukrainian people)
8. Demand Ukrainian president resign and stand trial for his crimes.
9. If Ukrainian president flees to the west - declare this a proof of his guilt (""an innocent man would not have fled"")
10. If Ukrainian president remains, he will be arrested and hoisted to Moscow to stand trial. Regardless of how the trial ends, and if the former president has an ""accident"" or is released eventually - by the time that happens he will not be relevant anymore.
11. In the ensuing power vacuum, promote a seemingly independent candidate, which will be for negotiating with Russia about the removal of its' troops from Ukrainian soil.
12. Other prominent anti-Russian candidates will be intimidated, and some will have unfortunate ""accidents"".
13. All the Russian news sources will pump pro-Putin's-candidate news stories and articles, and will reveal dirt (Kompromats prepared in advance) on all other candidates.
14. In the mean time, the Russian army will remain in Ukraine to make sure a safe and stable elections and power transition to the new government
15. After the election, the newly elected president will easily negotiate a Russian troop withdrawal, thus proving he was right all along, and becoming even more popular
16. The new Ukraine will have close and friendly relations with Russia, and complain about NATO encroaching on its' borders.

Lots of Russian losses, some key objectives taken by Russia then taken back by Ukraine (esp that one airport they need for big bomber / transport support), and more Russian casualties than Ukrainian so far. Some Russian soldiers have surrendered at the first opportunity, their morale overall seems pretty low.

Russia has failed to eliminate Ukraine air force or anti-air weapons, which they likely did not expect.

However, Russia is nonetheless making progress very fast and is likely to begin a full scale attack on the capital soon. They have taken Chernobyl (and disturbed a nuclear waste dump, increasing radiation levels there significantly), so that northern forces have a direct path to Kyiv. General consensus now is that this first wave is a small fraction of mostly younger soldiers. Most forces have been held back so far.

Russia needs air bases, fuel pipelines, etc to support larger push, so that's the focus. They have also sent sabotage teams into Kyiv (and probably other cities) to disrupt critical infrastructure and cause chaos. Some explosions heard in Kyiv but so far no idea why, doesn't look like hell is breaking loose there yet. People are sheltering in subway tunnels and air raid sirens are occasionally going off (including just now, as I type this).

13 soldiers on an island told a Russian military vessel to go fuck themselves rather than surrender, and died heroes.

An old lady confronted and cursed Russian troops occupying her town, and tried to give them sunflower seeds to put in their pocket ""so when you lie down in my country, sunflowers can grow where you died.""

Protests all across Russia against this war. Over 1500 Russians arrested as a result, more consequences to follow.

US and NATO will not intervene militarily but imposed devastating sanctions, Russia's economy dropped by around half overnight.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

Or maybe despite the seemingly well executed opening moves this thing has gone wrong in some way for the Russians and they're scrambling to try to figure out what to do next.

Ukraine has been begging to join to EU and NATO since 2014( also before as well), yet the West refused to make it a member of NATO alliance in order not to antagonize Russia.  
  
  
  
The recent sanctions and refusal to cut Russia from SWIFT as well as refusal to put severe sanctions on Russian oil and gas export industry is all you need to know about lack of spine. YES, it would hurt EU and global economy, but it's a dual sword, it will hurt Russia much more. Just like getting a shot to protect yourself from the virus in your body and develop anti bodies, it will be painful, but it's far better than not developing anti bodies at all and then dying from the virus.The West still thinks these weak ass sanctions will deter Putin from doing whatever he wants. He has been invading and put under sanctions ever since Georgia invasion in 2008, he doesn't care about sanctions, especially such weak ones.  
  
  
  
Most important part: Democrat senator Chris Murphy was spot on when he said it in 2021 "" I understand NATO's concern about the prospect of integrating with a country in conflict. But, frankly, if Ukraine and Georgia had received the MAP in 2008, I don't think there would have been a conflict at all. ""  
  
Had USA and EU accepted Ukraine into NATO, Putin would have never dared to launch invasion into Ukraine and the conflict would have only been restricted in Donbass region.  
  
  
  
Ukraine gave up one of the largest nuclear weapons arsenals after they became independent in exchange from promises by 2 great powers: USA and Russia that they will never be harmed and invaded, yet here we are.

In 1993 it was estimated that the Ukraine was in the top 5 ""nuclear power"" countries in the world. After a bunch of pressure from the United States and The U.K , the Ukraine destroyed their nuclear weapons.

Huge step right? You would think that perhaps the U.S and U.K would offer a roadmap for the Ukraine to be a NATO member. After all they just gave up their nuclear weapons program which is huge. It was only until 2008 that there was a ""road map"" for the Ukraine to officially join NATO. Even 3 years prior to that there were talks. For what ever strange reason the Ukraine was given  a long and unusual run around. Now, it had only been some recent years where the subject of the Ukraine  and NATO has been brought up.

Then yeah, it should make you uneasy. It should make even NATO members uneasy too, just not nearly as much. Sure people may be happy the US has such power now, but they are a mess of corruption and have quite the recent history of electing people who aren't too different than Putin. And the sheer level of destructive power from those subs is like 100x what was dropped on Japan. If I had a unit of undue radioactivity for every time I've heard an American express their desire to ""just glass"" some country, I'd be dead from the radiation. I know patriotism runs high during world events like this, but even if the US is *relatively* stable compared to a country like Russia, we truly aren't far enough away from some awful scenarios at any point. My only solace is events during the Cold War where the actual people of the US military chose to not launch their weapons for ethical reasons. But the propaganda has aged rapidly in the prior decades and the aptitude for the dehumanization of the people in other countries is at least up to a fraction of the Nazis by now by at least enough people to follow unjust orders. I'm not too worried about it currently, but all things considered, I don't have much faith in humanity 5+ years in the future as global corruption continues to escalate and the rise of global authoritarianism marches along. 

Hopefully this current wave of newfound support for foreign countries doesn't diminish the very real threat of furthering of destabilizing governments all around the world lately, especially as we start facing new resource wars perpetuated by the afformentioned deterioration. 

I'm all for nations protecting themselves when there are no reasonable diplomatic solutions, but such situations are always dire powder kegs. Even something as simple as sanctions and repriations were enough to reignite WW1 into the much worse WW2. Old madmen with little to loose are calling the shots in far too many countries to feel like the peace in our time may be on its way out.",False,1645770595.0,t3_t0wvak,t3_t0wvak,,0,-9,0,-9,0,0,

,t0wvak,hycn847,"Here is my take on things.  1.  Russia will not take Ukraine, and even if they are able to gain a foothold, there will be an insurgency that will bleed them white.  Remember, the Russians won in Hungary in the short term, but were not able to hold it.  They won in Czechslovica in 1968, but were not able to hold it. They seemed to win in Poland in 1981, against Solidarity, but they were not able to hold it. I think that even if Russia did win in Ukraine, the win will not be permenant and in a matter of time, Ukraine will end up being a free country again.  I am sure the smart money was on Hitler in 1939, and 1940, because he just kept winning and winning, and taking over all of these countries.  But gradually, the tide turned and by 1945, Hitler was in a bunker, ready to kill himself.  I am sure the smart money was on Russia in 1979, when they swept into Afganistan, but a decade later, they were forced to leave,  and I am sure the smart money was on the United States, when WE went into the same country in 2003, but twenty years later, we were forced to leave.  The smart money was on the United States in 1964, when we went into Vietnam, but a decade later, we were gone.  So, just because things might look good for Russia now, does not mean that things will not be radically different, months or years down the road. So, any way you slice it, in the end, Ukraine WILL win out, I am not ready to just throw them in the trash just yet.  Months from now, Putin will be gone, and Ukraine will be a proud, independent country again.  Mark my words, by the end of this year, or even sooner, things will look much brighter for Ukraine, and much worse for Putin.  One year from now, things are going to look radically different.  I have faith, I have not given up on Ukraine, and I will never give up on them.  Ukraine will win, period.",False,1645771088.0,t3_t0wvak,t1_hyclj8h,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Doesn't destroy the roads.  The vehicle crews can come in separately or already be in the area getting some rest instead of commuting to a forward area from Russia in the armored vehicle.  Also you can swap existing tank crews into fresh tanks.

""I'm gonna echo what I've seen mentioned a couple of times below already. I think those were ripple-fired air-to-air missiles. Missiles drop off of the rail and then go back up again as the motor ignites and they begin tracking their target. This aircraft was very low. I think the first missile lost its target because it was pointed at the ground and went dumb because of the ground scatter. You can see the second missile go high over rooftop level. These weapons do not appear to be behaving like air-to-surface rockets.

​

If I may speculate, I think this fast-mover was trying to attack a low-flying rotorcraft and knew there was a possibility that radar-guided weapons have a chance to lose their lock due to ground scatter, so he ripple-fired. The second shot went dumb and hit the ground, so you can see why."" /u/the_denizen

Edit: Which falls in line with this tweet from the same region where they mistakenly reported these two jets as Russians.

When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and something else - something it never entered your head to conceive - comes crashing in; something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up. That will not be the time for choosing; it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realised it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last for ever. We must take it or leave it."" -C.S. Lewis

He outlined his justification in a televised speech for which the English translation is below:

875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,t0wvak,hyd0aa3,"There’s a really long explanation for that, but it can be summarised with a few things.

First - Putin is a true Soviet person. Born after WWII to a glorious USSR that won the war in Europe with the blood of its citizens.

Second - Soviet Union was in a good shape in his youth. Space programs, military advancements etc. My g-parents are the same age as him - whilst point 1 above doesn’t apply to them, point 2 - “Soviet Union was great because it took care of its citizens and we had everything we needed” - does. 

Third - KGB was a good position to have as a job and he was considered extremely loyal because otherwise he wouldn’t have been sent to E-Germany. People like him were the elite level in USSR - they had their own stores, their own summer resorts, their own spas and hospitals. If you were part of the elite, your lifestyle was much better than on average. A nice good apartment, a nice new car (which other people waited 10y for a permit to buy a car for and then another 5y to buy an actual car, for example).

So imagine when all of that collapsed. Good job gone, state benefits gone, former Soviet countries trying to get away as far as possible form Russia and accusing it of annexing them.

It long been said that Putin personally feels that Russia was severely humiliated by the west in 1990s. That if Russia wouldn’t have been so weak, nobody would’ve accepted former Soviet and socialist states into EU and NATO, that we were accepted solely to humiliate Russia and to showcase that Russia couldn’t even stop the west from being right next to its borders. 

So when he got into power, Putin and his cronies started to modernise Russia and its military, whilst stuffing their coffers. They gave their people just enough of money  for them to forget the horrors of 1990s, so they’d be ever grateful for a functioning state, however corrupt. Good oil times also meant that the average Russian was fairly prosperous during 2000s. Then - when Russia started to become again more powerful, it was their power project to show that Russia could not be humiliated anymore. Putin’s speech in Munich 2007 put it all out there, so did Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014. Putin wants us all to know that Russia today isn’t the same humiliated Russia in the 1990s, that all of us who “got away” only got away because Russia was weak and because the Western European states pandered to us, but that if we were between Russia and Europe, then we would have no other chance but to play according to Russia’s playbook. That’s what he is showing with Georgia and Ukraine - “you were able ti humiliate us then, but you cannot do it no and if you do, I will punish you and your allies”.",False,1645780881.0,t3_t0wvak,t1_hycxhvo,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

You mistake the point.

If you apply sanctions *before* someone acts aggressively, then what consequence do they have to persuade them to not act aggressively? They're already being punished for it, might as well earn it.

So, sanctions are always threatened, and then escalated.

The more aggressive they act, the more aggressively we sanction. You don't do it all at once, because, there are worse and worse things they can still do and we want to have a reason to stop.

Russian ambitions are not satisfied with occupying territory. There is no point. Wars are costly for them. The benefit of invading is long term, as the (economic) effects of having that territory accumulate.

So, the purpose of sanctions likewise are long term. They say ""Whatever advantage you had in gaining territory, will more than undone by our sanctions in the long run."" You make sure it's a net-loss for them to behave aggressively, and the more aggressively they behave, the more of a net-loss it is for them.

As to why Russia would attack when it knew the long-term consequences would be net-negative?...

Because the costs of the sanctions aren't paid by the people making the decisions. The sanctions are aimed best as they can be at the decision makers, but, there's only so much you can do.

And, because, the end-game of Russian dictatorship is their eventual demise and unimportance. All the eastern european nations that have been acting increasingly democratic have had their economic and technological growth explode.

Every year Russia waits, is another inevitable step towards inferiority.

For the US, it's free college, skills training, and free healthcare for an otherwise poor working-class young adult with no money and no future. Some enlist to escape an abusive home. I knew of someone who did. His mom was an addict. He's now in the navy.

For China, it's extra points for the college entry exam as well as citizenship to the city. China has a birth-residency system. Eg. If you're born in Alabama, you're stuck in Alabama. Your children can only ever attend schools in Alabama even if you move out. The system is designed to trap generations of people in ghettos and villages so that the elite can remain elite in tier 1 cities as well as prevent urban overpopulation. Also to keep those in villages churning out generations of 'illegal' city immigrants who will work in factories for dirt cheap. Kinda like Zion in Battle Angel Alita. The only way to move your residency is either to buy a real estate or enlist. How are you gonna buy a $500k house if you're poor and couldn't even afford college?  So you enlist. 

This is why I will NEVER blame anyone who joins the military. Everything has their own reasoning that we'll never fully understand unless we're in their shoes. If a system is fucked, blame the leaders, not the employees.",1645773888.0,1645773646.0,t3_t0wvak,t1_hycme3c,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

I respect your feelings but you are naive. Stalin crushed all dissent and kept hundreds of ethnic groups in fear by deporting any ethnic group that he was even slightly worried about. Romanticism is nice but in reality any dictator can get you to change your feelings if he is willing to kill enough people or deport your entire ethnic group to the other side of the world.

Stalin didn't like the fact that there were so much ethnic Koreans near Vladivostok so he deported all of them to Uzbekistan. So now you have Koreans in arid Uzbekistan that don't speak Koreans but eat Kimchee. Did those Koreans agitate for a Greater Korea? Nope, they were scared and had much of their ethnic identity erased by Stalin.

Depending on the weapon and how it goes off, there might be a big cloud of debris kicked up that emits gamma radiation.  That cloud blows downwind and irradiates things under it until the radioactive elements decay over days and weeks.  Being under that cloud is very unhealthy, and the gamma radiation goes through most materials.  Hence the fallout shelter.

And a short military campaign that rapidly seizes objectives and ends in an official truce (no matter how dubious) seems vastly preferable over an attempted invasion + occupation of all of ukraine. Given how well that worked out for the US in iraq, afghanistan, and vietnam (or the USSR in afghanistan). Esp given high expected levels of ukrainian resistance, and the fact that putin's army is pretty underpaid and was kinda falling apart even *before* the invasion started.

They'll probably try to seize most of the coast though, and maybe the ukrainian gas reserves in the black sea, if I were to guess.

An outcome where russia gets half of ukraine as a puppet state, *and* is heavily hit by western sanctions might even be a net win for putin, provided that russian state media can spin this as the US et al attacking russia, and take the focus away from putin / nalvany / etc for a bit. And ofc they can maybe win this while reinforcing the message that any democratic movements or protests against putin (or the russo-ukrainian war) will be crushed, and the protesters blacklisted from whatever is left of the russian economy.

Still, idk how well this play would actually work out for putin (given that many russians seem to *not* be very supportive of this war, to say the least). But this plan does make a certain twisted amount of sense, and makes more sense than any other play I could think of, tbh – it is *not* in russia's best interests to fight a protracted war, so the sooner they can seize whatever objectives they may have and end this (and in a somewhat favorable position, somehow?), the better (or perhaps less disastrous) this will end up for them.",1645776225.0,1645775722.0,t3_t0wvak,t1_hycodxm,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Between this MLRS being grossly out of position, the Russian airmen / paratroopers who couldn't hold the airport, low-flying aircraft (both helicopters and fixed-wings) getting shot down... etc. etc, its clear that the Russians are being extremely aggressive. The Russians want to end this war extremely quickly, possibly on a timescale that's completely unreasonable.

Maybe the Russians know that they can't hold the positions they've gained, so they need to advance-advance-advance, despite the dangers?

I can't imagine its overconfidence. It has to be the schedule / plan that has been handed down. A greater strategic problem. There seems to be a pattern emerging.

Western societies tend to teach children to be naive, that truth and beauty always wins. In reality, cold hard facts always win.

Russia for example is a society made up of hundreds of ethnicities that were all conquered by the Czar or Stalin through genocide. Any dictator can achieve what they want if they have the will to kill enough people. Stalin deported any ethnic group that he was worried about. He solved Chechen resistance by deporting the entire ethnic group until WW2. He was worried about hundreds of thousands of ethnic Koreans living near Manchuria so he deported them all to Uzbekistan. That how you have Korean living in arid Uzbekistan speaking Russian but eating Kimchee.

The internet military history crowd love to fawn over Finland's victory over the Soviet juggernaut ignoring how they were crushed by the Soviet and had to give up large chunks of lands and $$ for peace.

Putin worked for and ran the KGB before the fall of the Soviet Union. He was in a good position to wield power over people by having control of that pseudo-police group. He was clever and leveraged that to get power in the more modern Russia and get himself a permanent position of power.

But this statement entirely hinges on trusting him at judging what an ""aggressor"" is, reasonably. Which has not turned out well for Ukraine so far, and inspires little faith that he won't suddenly find X or Y European countries ""aggressors"" *out of nowhere.*

I'm telling you that there is no reason to believe, given his recent actions, that he won't just *make up* reasons that the West are ""aggressors"", and use that as a pretext to invade the West. And if the West defends themselves, he will say - ""they are aggressors"".
