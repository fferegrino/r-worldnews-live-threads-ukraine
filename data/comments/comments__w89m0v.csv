6a2f1cc366adb997273d0578d06471d6,w89m0v,iho8oha,"📰 [Daily War Summary] Summary of the events which transpired on Monday,  July 25^th

🪖 On Monday, **No major territory changed hands**. [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1551732603803340800), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551536606045257731.html) and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551764864615448581.html) cover all the battles.

🚧 FIRMS (NASA’s fire detection satellite) appears to indicate that Ukraine is [shelling russia’s pontoon bridge](https://twitter.com/TimInHonolulu/status/1551612229560123392) at [Dariv’ka](https://twitter.com/Shtirlitz53/status/1551603071549165568).  Ukraine shelled the permanent bridge to the Nova Kakhovka dam over the weekend, likely making it unusable for heavy military equipment.  russia continues to [rush](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1551605337874128899) men and equipment [to Kherson](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1551611816765280257?s=20) despite the fact that the lack of bridges means they may be stranded with no escape route in the very near future.

🍄 [Fuel Depot in Donetsk](https://twitter.com/Archer83Able/status/1551712965522505728) -- [another view](https://twitter.com/typicaldonetsk/status/1551716248223875073) -- and [another view](https://twitter.com/typicaldonetsk/status/1551716522821038080) -- and an [Ammo Dump](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1551682454632677388)

🌾 Turkish President Erdogan said he [expects](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551683100639469575) all participants of the grain corridor accords to comply with their obligations after russia violated the agreement on Saturday just hours after the papers were signed.  russia at first denied it attacked, then claimed it was targeting military equipment at the port, and then claimed the agreement [didn’t prohibit](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1551600130616426498) them from attacking the port.  None-the-less, Ukraine is forging ahead with grain exports and optimistically hopes to return to pre-war level of exports by the end of Autumn.

👉 russia’s objective of the moment in Ukraine is to … (checks notes) ... “[overthrow Volodymyr Zelensky](https://twitter.com/SamuelSokol/status/1551540678030770179)”.

👉 Today’s russian warcrime of the day is a destroyed [community center](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1551601923417165827) in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv.   In a sad sign of the times, reinforced concrete [bomb shelters](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551573683478609920) will appear in Kharkiv next to bus stops.

👉 Human rights watch says the whole of Kherson has become a [concentration camp](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551526849544601600.html)

🛩 We’re seeing some of the effects of the “[ammo hunger](https://twitter.com/rogue_corq/status/1551597779893440514)” russia is feeling as it’s using more aircraft and helicopters to try and maintain its front-line and in doing so, is getting more aircraft and helicopters shot down.  On Monday Ukraine reported [one Ka-52 attack helicopter](https://twitter.com/GeneralStaffUA/status/1551590224391806977), three [air defense systems](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1551755685217505280), and one [SU-25 attack aircraft](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551610666733240323) destroyed. 

💣 In addition to the “ammo hunger” russia is feeling an artillery barrel hunger.  Thank’s to its astronomical [artillery barrage in June](https://twitter.com/markito0171/status/1551649451038703617) many of its artillery systems are now damaged or unusable.  russia is starting to pull ancient artillery systems [out of mothballs](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551504230183309313.html) to scavenge what barrels it can as it struggles to return to the fight.

👉 The US is ready to provide Ukraine with as many as [30 HIMARS systems](https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine/status/1551296409051140096), currently 20 are promised of which 12 have been delivered.  But there [are reasons](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551668596803358724.html) the US hasn’t just flooded the battlefield.

🇺🇸🎁 The US donated 500,000 [COVID-19](https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/1551609643163684865) vaccine doses to Ukraine because its really really hard to kill russians when you’re hacking up a lung.  Additionally Ukraine’s Defense Minister said Ukraine will receive [anti-radar missiles](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551566876404318212).  No other details were disclosed.

🇪🇺🎁The EU Investment bank has allocated €1.6 billion euros for Ukraine to rebuild critically damaged infrastructure.  €1 billion is available for immediate use with the remainder to be transferred at a later date.

🇵🇱🎁 Polish PT-91 “[Twardy tanks](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1551490434051997696)” (Twardy means “The Hard One”) have arrived in Ukraine.   The polish people have also crowdfunded [$5 million USD](https://twitter.com/DMokryk/status/1551252842048102400) for a Bayraktar drone for the Ukraine army.

🇬🇧🎁 The first 6 [British Stormer](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1551676055257235463) HVM anti-aircraft missile systems have been delivered to Ukraine.  The stormers fire [StarStreak](https://twitter.com/KremlinTrolls/status/1504113293086142465) missiles and is intended to protect front-line troops against helicopters and low-flying aircraft.  

🇩🇪🎁 Germany delivered the first three Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine.  The initial delivery was blocked by the Swiss who supplied the ammunition for the system back in April.  Apparently Germany has sourced other ammunition for the tank.   The Gepard is expected to protect Ukraine front-line troops against [drones and helicopters](https://twitter.com/general_ben/status/1551591342752419841).  One Hundred Ukrainian troops have been training on the system in Germany and Ukraine is expected to receive a total of [fifteen](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1551523508345311232) (including these three).

🏀🎁 Former Los Angeles Lakers player Slava Medvedenko is selling his 2 NBA championship rings to raise money to [rebuild school gyms](https://twitter.com/CBSLA/status/1551708922813325312) destroyed by russia.

🔥 russia cut gas deliveries through the [Nord pipeline to 20%](https://twitter.com/123_INFO_CA/status/1551542900474904577) of capacity, down from 40%, blaming issues with turbines.  Although Canada, pressured by Germany, is willing to ship the turbine, Gazprom still continues to delay accepting it claiming problems with the paperwork.  Also, Gazprom unexpectedly and without warning [increased the pressure](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1551729993625083905) in the pipeline to West Europe that runs through Ukraine. Unexpected pressure changes has potential to cause emergency situations within the pipeline.

💰 The war in Ukraine has put the brakes on one of [russia's biggest exports](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1551552597185777666) -- armaments, costing the country hundreds of millions in current and future sales.

💰 Thanks to sanctions, russia’s cars are being sold without airbags and antilock brakes; now russia is selling [cars without A/C](https://twitter.com/KevinRothrock/status/1551429194663563265).  

💰 China’s Belt and Road investment in russia has [dropped to zero](https://twitter.com/DefenseBaron/status/1551444282648715265).  This may have more to do with China's ongoing banking crisis rather than an effort to ""do the right thing"".

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been [changing its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦 Current state of the war: Currently russia is stalled and is [unable to mount](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1551114461032890368) a serious offensive anywhere along the front lines, meanwhile Ukraine is destroying russian logistics and mounting a serious threat to the city of russian occupied Kherson.   Presently the advantage [belongs to Ukraine](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288).

>	Here are the main points in summary. Imports collapsing and domestic production at a standstill. Russia was already an economically weak power living off selling its natural resources. Its now in terrible shape to support a long war effort.

>	Final summation shows why the long-war scenario is so difficult for Russia if sanctions are maintained. No path out of 'economic oblivion'

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 July 2022
 

- On 24 July 2022, Russian cruise missiles hit the dock-side in Ukraine's Odesa Port. The Russian MoD claimed to have hit a Ukrainian warship and a stockpile of anti-ship missiles. There is no indication that such targets were at the location the missiles hit.

- Russia almost certainly perceives anti-ship missiles as a key threat which is limiting the effectiveness of their Black Sea Fleet. This has significantly undermined the overall invasion plan, as Russia cannot realistically attempt an amphibious assault to seize Odesa.

- Russia will continue to prioritise efforts to degrade and destroy Ukraine's anti-ship capability. However, Russia's targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations.

Day 153 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday at 11pm instead of a missile strike, which is what they usually do at that time, they just shelled us from MLRS. It sounded pretty loud, not as loud as a missile, but still loud. Not sure what was shelled, there was no further information about it, but a fire started somewhere on the outskirts of the city.

Today they also fired some missiles at Kharkiv, but much later than usual, at 4:45am, they very rarely send their missiles later than 4:00am, I think it happened only one other time in the entire war so far. Apparently they used S-300 missiles yet again. The targets were very worthy of using expensive missiles as usual, a children’s playground in the middle of a residential bloc, and a subway train station exit in the middle of a park.

Despite of all that terror bombing, and deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure, pretty much nobody here cares about it anymore, which drives Russian propagandists mad. People like Solovyev are furious about the fact that people are returning to Kharkiv, they are yelling “how dare they return to the city and not be scared of us” it’s extremely funny to see.

And from our observations, which is what we see out of our windows, and in the streets, about 50-65% of all people have already returned. Even though there’s no street lights, it’s not that dark in the evening, because almost every second windows in every apartment complex is lit up. It is very reassuring to see, and is basically a collective fuck you to the Russian terror bombing.

It’s insane how many people are out in the streets, and there’s a ton of children everywhere, even toddlers in strollers are a regular sight. All the stores/supermarkets/markets are completely packed with people, maybe even more so than during pre-war times. From the official numbers about 700-800k out of the original 1,5-1,8 million people have returned to Kharkiv by now. But at the same time 90% of all companies are closed because of the constant shelling, so you can imagine just how many people are out of their jobs.",False,1658856899.0,t3_w89m0v,t3_w89m0v,,0,183,0,183,2,1,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}"

A deal agreed by European Union countries to curb their gas use should yield enough gas savings to last through an average winter, if Russia were to fully cut supplies in July, the bloc's energy chief Kadri Simson said on Tuesday.

""Our initial calculations indicate that even if all the exemptions were used in full, we would achieve a demand reduction that would help us safely through an average winter,"" Ms Simson told a news conference.

It comes after European Union countries approved a weakened emergency plan to curb their gas demand on Tuesday as they brace for further Russian reductions in supply (see 11.17 post).

Russia's state-owned gas company Gazprom has already said it will limit supplies to the EU through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of capacity, as we reported last night.

&#x200B;

>**Ukraine Is the Next Act in Putin’s Empire of Humiliation**  
>  
>To humiliate someone is to exploit your power over them, making them feel worthless and dependent on you. It is clear, then, that the Russian military seems intent on humiliating Ukrainians, taking away their right to independence and their right to make their own decisions. This war is an act of imperialism, a colonial war meant to destroy another nation’s right to exist and to subjugate it. But it is not empire building in the sense of a coldly considered plan for territorial gain and economic resources; it is the next act of Vladimir Putin’s empire of humiliation.  
>  
>Russia’s president would have the world believe that his country is guided by unifying ideas of cultural pride and conservative values, exceptionalism and splendid isolation. But in reality, Mr. Putin’s Russia has no coherent ideology, it’s just a mess of contradictions: It is Soviet nostalgia and a cultural arrogance that glorifies the Russian empire; it is a Russian ethnic and Christian Orthodox superiority that sits uncomfortably with what is supposed to be pride in being a patchwork of ethnicities and faiths.  
>  
>Russia is a bastion of conservative values that has some of the world’s highest rates of divorce, and its soundtrack is a Kremlin TV that amplifies any compliment or conciliatory gesture from the West — clips of Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, appear frequently. Kremlin propaganda claims Russia revels in isolationism, but it is also addicted to seeking approval from abroad.  
>  
>But when Mr. Putin himself tries to explain why Russia is in Ukraine, he swings between what seem like very different excuses. In a speech in June Mr. Putin compared himself to Peter the Great, on a mission to expand Russian lands. Another time he claimed “we had no choice” but to act in Ukraine, a message that was repeated endlessly on television.  
>  
>So which is it? It is neither and both. Mr. Putin likes to perform both sides of the humiliation drama: from the seething resentment of the put-upon Russian everyman to cosplaying Peter the Great. This allows him to appeal to Russians’ deep-seated sense of humiliation, which the Kremlin itself inflicts on people, and then compensate for it. It’s a performance that taps into the cycle of humiliation and aggression that defines the experience of life in Russia, and now Ukraine is the stage.  
>  
>After the 2014 Russian-backed uprising in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin turned the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk into a Soviet Dismaland, with Soviet-style youth groups, propaganda parades with Soviet flags and marches of captured Ukrainian troops through the streets. This time in Ukraine, Russia repeats Soviet mass deportations, detentions and enforced disappearances of intellectuals and activists who support Ukrainian sovereignty. Humiliated people can struggle to imagine a future as they play out old traumas over and over. We won’t let you emerge into a future, the Kremlin seems to be saying to Ukrainians, we want you stuck in the past we can’t overcome.  
>  
>Mr. Putin’s manipulation of the cycle of humiliation and aggression is integral to his psychological grip over Russia. That manipulation can look like legislating to criminalize opposition to the war while also appealing for solidarity in the fight against the West. As the impact of economic sanctions rolls across Russia, Kremlin propaganda has called for Russians to show how tough they are: Haven’t they survived great trials in the past? These calls for toughness can resonate — people can learn to define themselves through surviving pain to the point of getting a certain satisfaction from it.  
>  
>The Kremlin, of course, avoids any suggestion that it is the source of any pain, now or in the past. There are no major public memorials in Russia, in the shape of museums or movies, statues or open archives, that stand as a record of how the Soviet Union sadistically slaughtered its citizens in the gulags and colonized and repressed other territories and peoples — some school textbooks in Russia celebrate Stalin as an “effective manager.”  
>  
>Certainly, Russia is not the only country with a history of colonialism and internal repression. But in other countries these histories are usually part of an active debate. In Russia there seems to be nothing in the mainstream discourse that tries to make sense of the past, take responsibility for it or imagine a different path forward.  
>  
>Mr. Putin recently declared that there are only two types of countries: “Either a country is sovereign, or it is a colony,” he said. This is the logic of internal humiliation projected onto geopolitics. For those who are chronically humiliated and humiliate others in turn, the idea that countries large and small alike could have rights is impossible: The world is split into those who dominate and those who are dominated.

basically a repeat of 1939-1940 Finland-Russia war


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War

- 1939-1940 105-day war

- Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings. In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population;

- Russian 125k dead, 250k wounded, 2000+ tanks/armored

- Finish - 25k dead, 40k wounded

- According to Molotov, the Soviets did not want to occupy or annex Finland; the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.

- Molotov blamed Western countries for starting the war and argued that they had used Finland as a proxy to fight the Soviet Union. The Western Allies had furthermore tried to take neutral Sweden and Norway along with them. The main ""villains"" for the Soviets were the United Kingdom and France, but also Sweden, the United States, and Italy, who had issued massive amounts of matériel, money, and numbers of men, to Finland.

- During the four months of fighting, the Soviet Army suffered massive losses. One Red Army General, looking at a map of the territory just conquered, is said to have remarked: ""We have won just about enough ground to bury our dead.""",1658810930.0,1658810722.0,t3_w89m0v,t1_iho9e9f,,1,76,0,76,0,0,

To elaborate: You're making the same mistake as a lot of people did when they heard that the world's supply of man-portable antitank weapons was shrinking very fast due to how many were being used in Ukraine. Namely that modern militaries don't need many of these weapons because they are merely small arms, relatively speaking. Modern militaries mostly fight with more powerful, longer range, more complex and far more expensive weapon systems. (A modern fighter or tank is just the business end of a much larger system, all of which is necessary for the vehicle itself to do its job). A fight between two modern militaries wouldn't see all that many Javelins or even HIMARS being used, so they don't keep all that many around. Also, in a sense, modern war no longer has expectations of being able to resupply from the factory during the course of the war. What's in stock is expected to largely finish the job.

The thing that has been the biggest surprise of all this is Russia's utter inability to fight a modern war. Everything from tactics to communications to CnC is from the last century.

 >The Winter War, also known as the First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. The war began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

They provided just enough material and vague promises of expeditionary relief forces in an attempt to justify an invasion of Norway to deprive Germany of access to iron.  


As the Finnish Field Marshal said at the end of the Winter War to his troops, ""After 16 weeks of bloody combat, with no rest by day or night, our army stands unconquered before an enemy whose strength has grown in spite of terrible losses. Our fate is hard. **But we also know that we have paid, to the last penny, any debt we may have owed to the West.** That an army so inferior in numbers and equipment should have inflicted such serious defeats on an overwhelmingly powerful enemy; is a thing for which it is hard to find a parallel in the history of war. But it is equally admirable that the Finnish people were able to resist giving in to despair, and instead to grow in devotion and greatness. Such a nation has earned the right to live.""  


The lack of genuine support from the British government meant that during Operation Barbarossa, Mannerheim would respond with relative disdain to Churchill's requests to limit their offensive to the the former Finnish territory.

Rail bridges tend to be lattice structures and mostly air, because trains aren't freaked out when they drive over a light-but-strong surface you can see through.  But roadways are continuous, mostly because otherwise people won't drive over them. 

By nature of a continuous structure, if your missile intersects anywhere on the roadway, the blast will be transmitted into the structure. Force transmission can damage pillars and cause spans to drop.  Concrete fractures.  It's like shooting at a glass window, the glass often spider-fractures and cracks a good bit away from the actual impact.

However, by the nature of its lattice structure, when you ""hit"" a rail bridge with a missile, there's a good chance you hit a part that's just air, and don't do much lasting damage.  Even if you hit a structural component, you break that, but the redundant elements can keep the thing intact.  Any residual forces tend to be transmitted precisely along ways that forces are supposed to be transmitted (or through air, which doesn't transmit force well at all).

He probably was FSB, but that's not my point.  My point is that the video is easy to misinterpret and can be freely mis-captioned by anyone who wants to push an anti-Ukraine narrative.

It does feel like we had to alter variable, test for feedback, increase variable, test for feedback.

Given how Us intelligence has had this nailed from the start, I do think the US has been playing a mindful, yet conservative (small c) hand, but it does feel thought out.

To go out on a shaky limb, it seems to me like we leak news well ahead of time on weapons systems we see as a risk to escalation.  I would imagine western intelligence informs western defense heads on the internal messaging of Russian leadership when these leaks occur.

When Russians were still moving in steadily, delivering HIMARS would have been incredibly high risk and yes high impact.  We saw that the Ukrainians needed top of market anti-tank weaponry and that was high impact low risk.  Boom, this was the rise of Saint Javelin and similar shoulder mounted weaponry along with suicide drones and further proliferation of Bayraktar whose impact should not be forgotten.

When it became clear there was a measurable slowing of Russian progress and the Ukrainians had the ability to regulate the battle lines the world got them MLRS to attack the back.  The risk factor was measurably lower to trickling in HIMARS once the battle lines seemed regulated.

MLRS was leaked well ahead of the dates we began to mobilize those systems and news of trainings.  Then the HIMARS were more of a back door to the MLRS news since that is all they are.

I don’t see this as coincidental.

The F16 stuff seems on brand with this.


Do I feel like “master plan”? No.  Do I see experimentation patterns emerging?  Yes.  Do I think our military leadership has the intelligence and history to iteratively experiment and measure impact of battlefield tactics and weaponry?  Yes.

That culture of experimentation is a result of decentralized C2.  This is how leadership rises in ranks based on merit as opposed to cronyism.  

For all the faults of US military history, we have at least put controls in place that values the bottom up flow of truth.  And when those truths are ignored, we have ombudsman offices to help identify this.  Which for the military is almost like the 10th man principle from Israel, but different.

Not to the extent they did in world war 2 of course but there have been many comments by US DoD and military officials about how they are ""working with their partners in industry"" to equip Ukraine both in the short term and long term. That means they're seeing what they can ramp up the production of in the coming months and years to aid Ukraine and replenish US stocks. I think far too many people are looking at current production rates for equipment and munitions and assuming there is no way any of them can be meaningfully increased. Yes some things like Stinger missiles seem bottlenecked by rare custom parts but others may have a lot of headroom to increase production. The war is already 6 months old, how long until some of those early moves start to have results?

For instance Poland just ordered 500 HIMARS, the US needs to replenish it's stock of rockets and order some more, does anyone seriously think they're still looking to produce the same amount of rockets they did last year? No there is long term business here and the defense industry will be happy to take it. We'll find out in the coming months what they've managed to do.

You look at polls and sites like 538 which have a proven track record of accuracy in the vast majority of races. Everyone talks about polls being wrong in 2016, but even when polls are wrong they are generally very close (Trump won by margins of 0.3 to 1.2 percent in the crucial Midwest states that swung the election)

In elections since 2000 the highest difference between final polls for a presidential candidate and their result was -2.8% (Romney 2012). In the most recent election 538 predicted 96% of races accurately. They also famously predicted every single state accurately in 2012. The narrative that polls are dead was a complete overreaction to Trump winning. He actually had an even smaller gap than Romney, between his final polls and result. The surprise was from the fact that he had been much farther behind just a month or two before the election. Studies have shown that polls have had a fairly consistent success rate over the last few decades.

Almost every trusted poller is non-partisan. How could they not be as they would lose any credibility if their polls never matched the results?

Finally, Democrats themselves are worried about this fall. They have internal polling and all sorts of stats they look at to see which races are competitive, need resources, etc. 

So no, it's not just a Republican narrative. It's a consensus for now. For NOW. Of course this could change say if we see gas prices falling, abortion rights groups organizing, economic growth, etc. But right now the Dems look fucked.

To clarify, I believe this is relevant to Ukraine, not trying to dump US politics on everyone. Most of the GOP is supportive of Ukraine but I also believe they won't stand up to Russian assets like Tucker Carlson or the populist right as strongly as they should. Also Trump's preferred candidates need to lose to make him less relevant cause him elected in 2024 would be a disaster for NATO and Ukraine
