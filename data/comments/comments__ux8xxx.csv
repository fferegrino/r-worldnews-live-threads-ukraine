Day 91 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was actually quiet, the city itself wasn’t shelled even once, but there are constant reports of explosions in Kharkiv oblast, they are shelling bordering towns/villages every single day. Also there was some weird shootout today in the city, one TDF member was killed, and the one who killed him was killed by the police in return, apparently there was also a third victim, but there are no details about this whole situation yet. 

There doesn’t seem to be any real movement in Kharkiv oblast, everything is stalled for now, but the situation around Popasna really doesn’t look good for us. Pretty much everyone is pessimistic about it, even Arestovich is saying that the situation is very difficult, and for now Russia has an advantage there. At the same time Russians are now starting to use their T-62 reserves, a 50 year old tank. Maybe we will see T-34 next, that would help them truly live out their fantasy of fighting against Nazis.

I also still find it hilarious that calling Russian soldiers - orcs became so commonplace, that even our official news channels also started calling them orcs. And when they were showing Putin on screen, under his name where “president of Russia” is usually written, instead it was “Хуйло”, I guess the closest translation would be dickhead, it was indeed very funny seeing it live.",False,1653525393.0,t3_ux8xxx,t3_ux8xxx,,0,120,0,120,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

> Russian forces have likely abandoned efforts to complete a single large encirclement of Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and are instead attempting to secure smaller encirclements—enabling them to make incremental measured gains. Russian forces are likely attempting to achieve several simultaneous encirclements of small pockets of Ukrainian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts: the broader Severodonetsk area (including Rubizhne and Lysychansk), Bakhmut-Lysychansk, around Zolote (just northeast of Popasna), and around Ukrainian fortifications in Avdiivka. Russian forces have begun steadily advancing efforts in these different encirclements daily but have not achieved any major “breakthroughs” or made major progress towards their stated objectives of securing the Donetsk Oblast borders or seizing all of Donbas. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai reported that Ukrainian forces only controlled approximately 10 percent of Luhansk Oblast as of May 15 (compared to 30 percent prior to the full-scale Russian invasion on February 24, 2022). Russian forces have secured more terrain in the past week than efforts earlier in May. However, they have done so by reducing the scope of their objectives—largely abandoning operations around Izyum and concentrating on key frontline towns: Russian performance remains poor.

The bump will bring the minimum wage to about $250 per month and the average pension to $320, according to the Interfax news agency.

“Our key and unchanging priority is to increase the welfare and quality of life of citizens,” Putin said.

He also tasked government officials with increasing pay for Russian soldiers serving abroad as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth month.

“Corrupt politicians must answer before the law,” Sergiu Litvinenco said on Facebook.

Dodon, who was president of the eastern European country until 2020, was detained on Tuesday for up to 72 hours following a search of his home. In a statement, he said he was innocent and that the case had been fabricated.

His arrest comes at a time when relations between Moscow and Chisinau are increasingly strained. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would carefully monitor the situation around the investigation.

Zelenskyy says he is only willing to talk directly to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about ending the war.

Addressing the panel discussion on Ukraine in Davos, the Ukrainian leader said there was the possibility of finding a diplomatic way out of the conflict if the Russian president “understands reality”.

He added that Ukrainian forces will continue to fight Moscow’s troops until they recover all of the country’s territory and called on the Kremlin to withdraw its forces back to the lines in place before Russia began its invasion in late February.

“That might be a first step towards talks,” Zelenskyy said, before also accusing Russia of playing for time in talks over ending the conflict.

“Once the President is prepared to leave his bubble of this alternative reality into the real world and talk to us, understand that a lot of people are being killed, including civilians, perhaps then, will he understand that we should start talking and should put the end to this war that he launched, his country is waging against us,” Zelensky said via videoconference at a breakfast event moderated by Fareed Zakaria in Davos. 

This is not the first time world leaders have accused Putin of being out of touch with reality when it comes to his motives for the war in Ukraine.

Putin said the Kremlin's invasion began to protect Russian speakers from genocide at the hands of ""neo-Nazis,"" despite the lack of any concrete evidence. While Ukraine does have a far-right battalion playing a role in the resistance, Putin has exploited the fighting forces' neo-Nazi ties as a pretext for the war. Shortly after the invasion began, he referred to the country's leaders in Kyiv as a ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,"" despite the fact that Zelensky is Jewish.

US intelligence assessed in March that Putin's advisers were not properly informing him about the status of the war, including Russia's early failures on the battlefield.

Speaking to Zakaria on Wednesday, Zelensky said he could only talk with Putin directly, ""with no intermediaries, no brokers.”

The Ukrainian President also said Russia should withdraw its troops and equipment as the first step in negotiations between the two countries and that Ukraine will fight until ""it regains all its territory back.""

The event was hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a Ukrainian charity founded in 2006, and the investment advisory group EastOne.

From CNN's Sammy Mngqosini in London 

The British government has approved the sale of Chelsea Football Club, saying Russian owner Roman Abramovich will not benefit from the $5 billion deal . 

""Last night the Government issued a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea FC,"" Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, tweeted Wednesday. ""Given the sanctions we placed on those linked to Putin and the bloody invasion of Ukraine, the long-term future of the club can only be secured under a new owner.""
""We are satisfied the proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or other sanctioned individuals,"" she added. 

On Tuesday, the English Premier League said its board had approved the sale of the club to a group led by American businessman Todd Boehly.

A UK government spokesperson said they will be ""ensuring the proceeds of the sale are used for humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war.""

“The steps today will secure the future of this important cultural asset and protect fans and the wider football community,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have been in discussions with relevant international partners for necessary licences required and we thank them for all their cooperation.”

Some context: The sale of Chelsea brings an end to nearly two decades of Abramovich's ownership of the club. The Russian oligarch has known ties to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin and was sanctioned by the UK shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. ",False,1653467610.0,t3_ux8xxx,t3_ux8xxx,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

**WHEN STRONGMEN INVADE, THEY BRING THEIR PATHOLOGIES WITH THEM**

*The attack … should have been a short one, like a blitzkrieg, because \[we\] did not have the resources for a long campaign. We knew that we were not prepared to fight a long war. … We had nine divisions to cover the nine roads. … Only one division advanced along each road. There was no main axis of advance and no secondary axis of advance … we were weak everywhere. … The objectives of the attack were not what they should have been.*  
  
*A paranoid but intelligent authoritarian leader decides to invade a neighboring country with little notice. He seeks to improve his country’s regional heft, settle historical grievances, and fight against “revolutionary” ideas. He expects to achieve significant military objectives in a matter of days, and therefore has insufficient plans and logistics for the long-term conflict that ensues. He wants to exploit his enemy’s internal political instability, but the invasion only solidifies popular support for the neighboring government. He overvalues his military’s sizable numerical advantage, but undervalues less quantifiable factors such as morale, combat effectiveness, and the operating environment. He has selected his advisors and officer corps based on loyalty instead of competence, and so he believes them to be unstoppable. He is shocked when they perform poorly. He tries to narrow his objectives and still claim victory.*

Not long ago, vast swathes of the planet were mostly subsistence farmers, one failed rainy season away from hunger their entire lives, two failed rainy seasons away from death.



Then, in the early 80s, live satellite television news got invented. Then, when a famine hit Ethiopia, it hit our eye-balls. When it hit Bob Geldofs eyeballs, he felt compelled to try to do something about it, and Do They Know it’s Christmas? and Live Aid and Band Aid and We Are The World became monstrous global phenomenons that ended up raising a lot of money and also spurred governments to start spending real money on food aid.




The problem was never that there wasn’t enough food. The problem was, then and now, is that the food isn’t where the people are who need it. Before Bob Geldof there were two problems. The first problem was that moving food to poor places costs money, and poor people don’t have any money. Aid from governments and NGOs solved that. The other problem was there simply wasn’t enough infrastructure to actually do it. Nobody had ever built grain-storage silos in Ethiopia before because nobody had ever tried to move grain to Ethiopia before. But solving the first problem put the wheels in motion to solving the second problem, too. And they did it! Bob saved a lot of lives. And silos got built.



Which brings us to today. The world is very different today from 1983. The trade-routes in 2022 buzz like crazy compared to 1983. Ships are twice as big, and there’s 10x as many of them. Container ports have giant robots shuffling thousands of containers around. Things that used to be so low value that they were almost impossible to make money on if you had to move them across a lake all of a sudden are getting shipped across all of the oceans.




Before Bob Geldof, loading a ship up with a million tons of grain and sailing it half-way around the world to give to poor people was a weird and one-off event. Today? Enormous ship-loads of food sail the seas looking for places that want their cargo.

Russia would back out. The future losses would be to great to suffer. and Ukraine wouldn't be worth it, Putin would also have the sought after ""off ramp"" oh ""we didn't lose to Ukraine, we lost to evil NATO!"" and ""it doesn't matter anyways we completed our objectives!""

So Why doesn't the US do it? Would it make us our our allies vulnerable? no, not at all. the US is sending it peace meal because it wants the war to continue. The strategy is to destroy as much Russian equipment possible, if they made it completely impossible to win the war they would pull out and the destruction of the Russian military would end. If the US sends juuust enough, the war continues and Russia, rather Putin, sees at least some possibility for success.

I hope to duck I’m wrong.  

Russia has resorted to its time honoured tradition of just levelling things. It wasn’t as good as UK/NATO at intelligent warfare so has just resorted to crude city levelling attacks. Crude, cheap and effective- as long as you’re ok with ‘winning’ a town or city by turning it to rubble.  It’s a victory of sorts in utter annihilation of your enemy their buildings and infrastructure is your definition is victory. 

NATO and the West’s strategy is no longer working against such crude savagery. 

So anyone got any clues what the West’s strategy is now? Like seriously, honestly, as I can see none. 

Russia is going all in for the win. It won’t stop whenever the say it will stop. After a couple of years they’ll regroup and do the same. Adding a little global food shortage, high oil prices, winning the information war in far too many countries. 

What is the West’s response?  

Seriously? Can anyone answer me this question because I feel the west needs to get serious and serious now. Am I missing something??? 

Like some long range heavy arty etc would be lovely if a little late - but that’s not a strategy. It’s a band aid, at best.

Precision strikes are again, wonderful tactics but I hardly see a strategy here.  

Maybe I’m panicking too early but am surely it’s time to get serious about this. Take a few risks. 

Maybe some big risks.

I applaud him. He has done an incredible job of nonstop campaigning. Sometimes though he and his government make stretches to get support. Sometimes, making it seem like it’s the west’s fault for some of the deaths because it has deemed the support it has received as inadequate. Secretly, they are grateful (been reported) but on the world stage it is we aren’t getting enough. 

Sadly, attention to this war is fading from public view. He may never get enough support to accomplish all his goals. Fuck amber heard and Johnny depp get as much attention if not more lately. 

I guess all I am saying is Ukraine is theoretically right to say what it will accept in terms of a peace settlement.  But I imagine at some point the resources start to trickle.

41173a5ffe4b7dcd410272e4c8f95afc,ux8xxx,i9zblst,"So lemme point out a few things from the USA's perspective.

Our last war, Afghanistan, included both US troops, as well as deliveries of advanced weapons to the Afghanistan army. That Afghan army folded immediately in 2021 against a Taliban offensive, to a degree that it caused a rather large political shitstorm in the USA.

The Taliban driving around US Humvees was not a good look on TV / internet. This literally happened less than a year ago.

I think the USA was focused on not repeating the mistake, and we may have slow-played the arming of Ukrainians as a result. Perhaps US intelligence should have been better so that we could have sent more advanced weapons at an earlier date. But in any case, the Ukrainian performance really did seem to change USA's opinion on the matter. There was indeed a big worry that all of these weapons would end up in Russian hands.

---------

I fully admit that the USA was too slow at delivering the advanced weapons Ukraine needed. But I just wish to provide some context and background into that decision making process. Since Ukraine proved itself worthy, they definitely are now receiving the shipments of weapons. But USA just didn't know that 3 months ago.

--------

The MLRS question is touchy. Traditionally, USA laws are such that we can only provide ""Defensive"" weapons to our allies. We rewrote our laws (see Lend-lease) to provide additional support to Ukraine above and beyond what was traditionally offered by the USA. I think there's a lot of people still feeling squeemish about the more-and-more offensive weapons (USA MLRS systems can have up to 300km range. While Ukraine can't strike Moscow with that weapon, Sumy could strike Voronezh).

I certainly understand why a weapon system like that would be needed in this long-range artillery battle between Ukraine and Russia. But we're starting to get into the really good stuff of the USA's arsenal. There's also the note that MLRS systems use missiles, and those missiles are far, far, far more expensive than artillery. From a shear cost-effectiveness point of view, other weapons are probably better to mass up?

The MLRS issue aside, my **personal**, Reddit-Armchair general assessment of the situation is that Ukraine needs more vehicles. I think large shipments of M113 APC and Humvee would do Ukraine a lot of good, assuming Ukraine has enough fuel to feed them.",1653511019.0,1653510413.0,t3_ux8xxx,t1_i9za4yo,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

""And for that to happen in Europe, many decades after World War II, was something that nobody could sit back and swallow.""

While there are a lot of ethnicities in Russia, there hasn't been nearly as much secession sentiments as there was during the USSR, and even now there isn't a whole lot. Some murmurings of dissatisfaction, but nothing alarming (yet). I think it would require Moscow to be utterly powerless for large-scale breakaways happening.

But to humour the idea, here are some candidates for (very) hypothetical breakaways:

The Caucuses offer a lot. Historically, before the rise of the Russian empire, there were various small nations states there which are ethnically very different from Russians, namely Chechnyans, but also Adyghe and other Circassian peoples, and then near the Caspian you have various peoples who speak Turkic languages like in Dagestan. Obviously Chechnya already has the precedent of separatism, and if Kadyrov loses influence or his life, that could potentially flare up again, especially without a Putin to pay him off. 

Tatarstan is also another one often pointed to. Some parts are slightly less favourable towards Moscow than others, and in general while Tatar people have always retained a strong sense of their own traditions and cultures, there hasn't been any strong attempts to breakaway. The problem is that Tatarstan as an area is still surrounded by Russia, so unless Russia also lost territories between Tatarstan and say Kazakhstan, they would be an enclave inside Russia, so not very good prospects. 

Sakha in the Far East is an interesting one. It has a large population of non-Russians (about 50% if I remember rightly, though the capital is obviously a higher percentage of Russians there). But Sakha is very resource rich and incredibly underdeveloped. If Russia collapsed, I could see China supporting a breakaway movement there, offering them massive investment funds in return for first dibs on cheap resources.",False,1653477547.0,t3_ux8xxx,t1_i9x57qy,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

There is a certain divide from the jingoism among some people in western Ukraine, certain hostility, frustration towards the millions of people from the east (mostly Russian speaking) from some of the so called “patriots” in the west. Their line of thinking goes somewhat like this: “you came here, fled the war in the east, you are Russian speakers and you brought the war upon us because Putin sent in the troops to liberate your Russian speaking areas… you see we speak Ukrainian here, there’s no war here”

What these so called patriots fail to understand is that there’s no way for Russia to project the war to the western Ukraine aside from a cruise missile or two…

So far this is a small but a very vocal and annoying minority detached from reality. Most people Ukrainian and Russian speaking alike are helping each other, helping displaced people and working towards a common goal to push the Russian army the fuck out of Ukraine.

But time will tell if this conflict drags on this minority will become a larger more significant annoying force hostile towards people fleeing the war in the east.

I see war hawks in here eager to kill Russians.  Often they are eager for Ukrainians to do this fighting and not so much eager to do it themselves.  If you want Russians to die Kursk, Belgorod, and Rostov are full of Russians.

Some asshole is going to accuse me of trolling for Russia because I doubt the value of leveling Sevastopol.  On the contrary, Russians are going to oppose operations northeast of Belgorod.  It is quite reasonable for Ukrainian people to insist on either forming a winning strategy or negotiating.  Generating lots of rubble is not ""winning"".   Dead Russian soldiers do not have value to Ukraine.  Dead Ukrainians cannot be rebuilt.  Not destroying your cities is the best and cheapest way to rebuild.

I hope to duck I’m wrong.

Russia has resorted to its time honoured tradition of just levelling things. It wasn’t as good as UK/NATO at intelligent warfare so has just resorted to crude city levelling attacks. Crude, cheap and effective- as long as you’re ok with ‘winning’ a town or city by turning it to rubble. It’s a victory of sorts in utter annihilation of your enemy their buildings and infrastructure is your definition is victory.

Russia's strategy is crude savagery.

So anyone got any clues what the Russia strategy is now? Like seriously, honestly, as I can see none.

Ukraine is going all in for the win. It won’t stop whenever the say it will stop. After a couple of years they’ll regroup and do the same. In spite of a little global food shortage, high oil prices, they're winning the information war in pretty much every country.

What is Russia's response?

Seriously? Can anyone answer me this question because I feel the Russia needs to get serious and serious now. Am I missing something???

Like actually taking any notable city would be lovely if a little late - but that’s not a strategy. It’s a band aid, at best.

Map quadrant saturation bombings are again, wonderful tactics but I hardly see a strategy here.

Maybe I’m panicking too early but am surely it’s time to get serious about this. Take a few risks.

Maybe some big risks.

An M777 Howitzer can fire maybe 4 shots per minute for long periods of time (6 to 10 in a minute in bursts with a good team, but you need to slow down if you're doing a sustained operation).

If the Ukrainians can find a ""safe spot"" to hold that M777 Howtizer, it could bombard enemy locations for hours, maybe even days, at that 4-shots-per-minute rate.

Of course, we're talking about fighting vs the Russians here, so in practice,  the Ukrainians are going to need to ""shoot and scoot"" (shoot a few minutes, move to a new location, shoot again), to prevent the enemy from destroying the M777 gun.

Lets say the M777 takes 15-shots in 4 minutes, and spends 11 minutes packing, unpacking, and moving to a new location. That's 60 shots per hour, and over 16 hours per day, we're looking at close to 1000 shells per day per gun on the frontlines.

No. Its because of vehicles.

Russia can move their army wherever Russia wants. That means Russia can mass up in one area and have a local advantage. Traveling along roads at 30mph to 40mph has its benefits.

In contrast, Ukraine is largely infantry. The best infantry can do is march at 3mph, especially if they're lugging around 50lb Javelins.

--------

Vehicles can always attack with overwhelming numbers, because they consolidate in one area and mass up together. That's the main advantage of tanks, IFVs, APCs. Maneuver warfare. If Ukraine moves all their infantry into Donbas, then Russia will just drive around and attack in the south.

The attacker chooses the time and place of attack. And slower movement (ex: Ukrainian's infantry-heavy composition) means that they'll be forced to fight at disadvantages. Russia can pick-and-choose to fight only in the locations that they have numerical advantages.

Lawmakers in the State Duma lower house approved the bill in three readings in a single session, with the upper house, the Federation Council, giving its assent shortly after. The bill now needs only the signature of President Vladimir Putin to become law.

State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said: ""Today, especially, we need to strengthen the armed forces and help the Ministry of Defence. Our Supreme Commander is doing everything to ensure that our armed forces win, and we need to help.""

 not really....  


Anyone buying enough debt bonds to count as ""rich people"" also get CDI, credit default insurance, for this exact risk.  For stable countries, CDI only costs a percent or two (so if you buy $1M in debts, you pay only $10k or so in insurance).  Prior to the war, CDI on Russian debt was ~5%.

It's now 70-80% for new debt.

So people who hold debt currently are covered under their existing insurance (so their insurance company gets screwed, however that's what insurance is for), but no one can afford to get CDI to cover new bonds.

It followed from these events:

 - 1991: Ukraine left the USSR; declared independence, but leased Sevastopol (Crimea) to Russia as a base. (Before this, Sevastopol was a USSR base - and Ukraine was part of the USSR. Crimea was ""given"" to Ukraine in 1954, by Russian-dominated USSR. Was it Russia's to give? Not really - but they were pretty much full of themselves in the post-WWII era).

 - 1997: Ukraine terminates Russia's lease on Sevastopol; with a deadline of 2017.  It was at this time Russia starts deeply tampering with Ukraine's politics, so they can get that lease back.

- 1997-2010 Russia's election-rigging leads to Yanokovych (Russian puppet) getting elected in Ukraine, and he extends the lease to 2042. Ukrainians are pissed.  Also, because popular opposition candidates are getting poisoned and assassinated so they can't challenge Yanukovych.

 - 2014: Ukrainians are pissed because Yanokovych gets re-elected, and there's obvious fraud. So they stage a revolt and throw him out.

 - 2014: Russia invades Ukraine, but says it's troops are just ""on vacation"" and they try to make it look like a civil war when it's not.  Then they annexed Crimea, and spent billions on a bridge across the straits, so they don't have to go through Ukraine to get to Crimea.

- Then Ukraine responds by cutting-off the water supply to the island, (because, Russia's not paying for it anymore).  

In Putin's mind, this justifies the invasion, and the establishment of a land-bridge.  Why he wouldn't just build a freshwater pipeline from Russia across the Kerch Strait bridge is beyond me. Maybe Putin just doesn't like paying for stuff and thinks he should be able to steal whatever he wants and get services for free.

I hope to duck I’m wrong.

Russia has resorted to its time honoured tradition of just levelling things. It wasn’t as good as UK/NATO at intelligent warfare so has just resorted to crude city levelling attacks. Crude, cheap and effective- as long as you’re ok with ‘winning’ a town or city by turning it to rubble. It’s a victory of sorts in utter annihilation of your enemy their buildings and infrastructure is your definition is victory.

Russia's strategy is crude savagery.

So anyone got any clues what the Russia strategy is now? Like seriously, honestly, as I can see none.

Ukraine is going all in for the win. It won’t stop whenever the say it will stop. After a couple of years they’ll regroup and do the same. In spite of a little global food shortage, high oil prices, they're winning the information war in pretty much every country.

What is Russia's response?

Seriously? Can anyone answer me this question because I feel the Russia needs to get serious and serious now. Am I missing something???

Like actually taking any notable city would be lovely if a little late - but that’s not a strategy. It’s a band aid, at best.

Map quadrant saturation bombings are again, wonderful tactics but I hardly see a strategy here.

Maybe I’m panicking too early but am surely it’s time to get serious about this. Take a few risks.

Maybe some big risks.

I would put emphasis not on numbers, but on _movement_. My take is that there were enough people to support a movement, but not enough active people to form it. Like, a calm referendum with no repercussions for either choice _may_ have ended in favor of seceding to Russia. I would put the chances of this outcome for a **real** referendum in Crimea in 2014 higher than otherwise. Totally not as sure for other East/South regions, but they did convincingly vote for pro-Russian thug Yanukovich, and we can't discard some support, some good numbers of people with strong associations with Russia. Hell, there's enough Russians that assume they should be able to speak Russian wherever they are, not just Ukraine, but France or Thailand.

So yes, I don't think there was enough movement for a real separatist movement even with Russia fomenting some dissent e.g. with that language issue; but I don't think that's about numerical support either.

Its the simple math between a 3mph infantry unit vs a 30mph tank/IFV unit.

If you're defending against tanks / IFVs that move at 30mph, you need to spread out, because those tanks/IFVs will just drive around you. You only need to be ~3 miles away from enemy frontline units to be effectively immune to them (there's no gun that can shoot that far, and its likely terrain features will hide you).

It takes infantry a full hour to move those 3 miles, but only 6 minutes for a tank/IFV force to move those 3 miles and drive around the infantry.

------

If the ""defensive goal"" is ""protect the artillery / ground lines of communication / supply train from getting hit by tanks""... and you largely have infantry, you _HAVE_ to spread your infantry out. And when that happens, the infantry are so dispersed that they can't effectively support each other. That's why tanks/vehicles are so good in warfare.

The good news is that the Russian breakthroughs have been unable to really encircle Ukrainian troops to any significant degree. Which means Ukraine is playing a good defensive game.

Russia is finally using maneuver warfare properly. The good news is that towed-artillery moves at the same speed, and there's other weapons we can give the Ukrainians that can help even the odds.

But people need to realize the reality of the combat on the ground here. Russia's 10x advantage in tanks/vehicles always existed. Its a sizable difference, and tanks/IFVs really do make a difference in maneuver warfare. Ukraine is doing a good job of killing / disabling Russian vehicles, but for the near future, they will be fighting against this rather sizable Russian equipment advantage.

That's just not true. The Russian army sucks at almost everything... with the lone exception of artillery. The Russian army has always operated on the idea that if all else fails, they can and will level an entire city to capture it. 

They have many more artillery pieces than Ukraine and of similar quality. The West has sent at most 150 pieces of artillery to Ukraine. Russia had 8000 pieces or so at the start, so that number is a drop in a bucket. The current Popasna breakthrough shows that Russia still has access to a ridiculous amount of firepower, since the reason they broke through is because they pounded the defensive positions so hard that Ukraine had to fall back.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War

An attack on an independent nation is a threat to attack all independent nations. When we forget the seriousness of the Russian threat and force Ukraine to compromise, we set a precedent that large-scale, unprovoked military aggression is a successful political strategy on our world stage - that Western unity is worthless as long as you can wait it out, and our institutions are vulnerable to threats of violence. That precedent *will* be repeated in the next decade, with a more secure nation more central to Western infrastructure. It doesn't even have to be Russia - once we've publicized the vulnerabilities in our society's bank vault, we don't need mortal enemies for someone to come safecracking. Expressing a desire to see that prevented isn't virtue signaling. It's prudence, competence, and progressive thinking.

The slate of Electoral College members are usually selected by the winning party of the Presidential election and their certified EC votes are sent to congress.  Americans don't directly elect their President, they signal their preference and the Electoral College reps are supposed to vote in accordance with that.  But in reality, they can flip.  In Hillary vs Trump, for example, there was a number of ""faithless electors"" that flipped in either direction.  (There was a Supreme Court ruling on this back in 2020, also)

They are passing laws whereby the party that controls the state government can *set aside* the slate of electors and substitute another - such that when their EC vote arrives at the capitol, it is cast for a different candidate.

On Jan 6, the plan was for the VP (who oversees the process) to disregard a slate of electors from key states.  He wouldn't do it.  There was a riot, and they tried to ship him out of the capitol, whereupon his backup - who happens to be Republican - would have presided over the certification instead.  But Pence [chose not to get in the SS car and be whisked away](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/26/pence-car-raskin-comments/).  That's how close shit came to being overturned *in 2020*.  (Fuck everything, I forgot what year it is.)

Basically the plan is, no matter which way you vote, it can be set aside *at the state level* if the powers that be deem it so.  And the powers that be happen to be Republican.  Oh, there will be kicking and screaming, i'm sure.  But they're passing laws and rules changes to legitimize their ability to pick a preferred outcome.

That's at a very high non-US-citizen's understanding, and might be total bullshit.

Russia has a lot of artillery, but they can’t cover everything at once, not by a long shot. M113s are nice. Bradley’s are even better. But they aren’t a necessity. Plenty of armies around the world operate without them (see Taliban). Take a couple of pickup trucks down a farm track and all of a sudden you’re in the rear of a Russian unit ready to raise havoc.

This argumentation is true regarding tactics and general knowledge about the purpose of a weapon system - which is why its especially easy to train ukrainian crews on new artillery systems. It does not apply to learning the handling of the instruments inside such a system - especially if its an old as fuck system from the 1960s which gave no fucks about user accessibility.

There arent any ukrainians training on M1 Abrams either despite thousands of them standing around in the desert. Why is noone complaining about that instead of crying about way too old german systems with little ammunition left that are being refurbished?

How about not moving the goal post? We are talking about heavy weapons based on western tech. Deliveries of those were only announced both by germany and the other countries after agreeing on it at Ramstein.

> Again Germany has been extremely slow compared to other Western countries, embarrassingly slow

Again, this is about sending heavy weapons based on western tech. It took 3 days after the outbreak of the war for the first german shipments to be ready, plenty of AT, guns, ammunition, fuel, night vision equipment etc. has been send by germany as well as other countries in similar timescales - but we are still talking about heavy weapons, please stay on topic.

> Except their news have been proven by lack of heavy weapons from Germany

Which lack of heavy weapons? The ukrainians are currently training on the Panzerhaubitzen and the Gepards are being refurbished as they unsurprisingly werent exactly in prime conditions. This isnt amazon with same day delivery. And, as explained above, its not as simple as training a crew on a piece of artillery, even if you refuse to believe such an obvious fact. And again: Why arent you complaining about the lack of Abrams or other tanks? Unlike the german army the US actually has a well maintained surplus it could easily spare

> In addition to not giving weapons to Ukraine, Germany also blocked Estonia from exporting German-origin weapons to Ukraine

So all you have are things from *before* the war to prove your claim that germany is currently acting slower than other countries?

So you're very selective in what you see and what you read.

People were also saying Germany did that out of desperation, so I'm assuming you're avoiding this subject in order to avoid portraying ruzzia as a desperate failed state that is losing the war.

I know, I know, your reality is crumbling around you, reading things that disagree with your vision is the last thing you would want to do.

Well, as a troll you are a stupid one.

The ""age lift"" is the whole thing that started this, dumbass. Ruzzians lifting the age for joining the army and being sent to the war scene.

The thing you immediately jumped to say ""but, but, America, ...""

Is your memory that short, or are you involved in too many arguments on too many accounts, and lost track of what the issue here was to begin with?
