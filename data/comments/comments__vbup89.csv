Day 111 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was actually somewhat quiet, they were mostly shelling towns in oblast, especially Zolochiv, which they shelled with parachute bombs in the morning, and then shelled it some more around 9pm, most likely with regular MLRS rockets, locals confirmed at least 10 explosions. They also shelled Derhachi around the same time, that’s most likely what we were hearing, as there was no confirmed shelling in the city itself, but we still heard loud explosions. 

The weirdest thing today was that they didn’t launch missiles from Belgorod around midnight. They have been doing this forever, but for some reason they didn’t do it today, there was an air raid alert at that time, but no missiles were fired. At this point we are so used to being hit by missiles at that specific time that it is weirder when they don’t do it, you basically start thinking “where’s the catch?” 

At the same time Russians are already openly dividing Ukraine into districts to integrate into Russia within 3-5 years. No, they are not just dividing Donbas, they are dividing the entire Ukraine, that they are planning to “liberate during special military operation.” Yeah, keep dreaming. 

Their officials are also hyping up the upcoming Putin’s speech, which they emphasize is very important. First they weren’t saying what it is about, but today they said that he will announce the “new world order.” Is that the same world order they were talking about in that victory speech that they posted on day 3 of the war?",False,1655259172.0,t3_vbup89,t3_vbup89,,0,67,0,67,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

From CNN's Oren Liebermann

The US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages to Ukraine during a key meeting of nearly 50 countries known as the Ukraine Contact Group on Wednesday, according to a senior US defense official.  

Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonestk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting recently. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials have said it will be increasingly difficult to halt Russia’s incremental progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. 

“We hear what they’re saying, we absolutely hear what they’re saying,” said the senior defense official, who spoke of the “urgency” of the group’s meeting Thursday in Brussels. The official would not detail what countries would be announcing new security packages or what those shipments would include but noted that the US works “very closely” with other countries to figure out what Ukraine’s armed forces need and then find those systems to send over.

The official would also not say whether the US would have a new package to announce, but said US President Biden's administration is already working on the next package.

“It’s a constant drumbeat because it’s a constant battle” with “constantly evolving urgent requirements,” the official told a group of reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The Biden administration announced the last weapons package on June 1st, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS), a system capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles that Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. The $700 million package was the first time the administration had drawn from the new $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, which received bipartisan support in Congress.A small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on HiMARS almost immediately after the weapons package was announced. But the system, which requires three weeks of training, has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would only say that it will enter Ukraine “soon.”

The US has taken on “some risk” to its own military readiness in sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said earlier this month, but it was “not an unacceptable level of risk at all.”

The senior defense official said the US and it allies had a significant amount of equipment still available to send to Ukraine.

“We have far from exhausted the resource and the multi-country security assistance for this battle on Ukrainian territory,” the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed in his evening speech on Monday that Ukraine would liberate all of the territories occupied by Russia, even the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed shortly after its takeover in 2014. But that could only happen, he said, with more weapons for Ukraine.

“It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear,” Zelensky said. 
Ukrainian officials have said 100 to 200 soldiers a day are dying in the fighting, a number that raises some doubts about the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to sustain such losses. The US official didn’t doubt the casualty figures. 

“The numbers are not out of line with what you would expect for this kind of artillery battle,” the official said. “It’s not surprising that the numbers the Ukrainians are reporting are that serious.”But the official said the US has not seen a flagging of Ukrainian morale to remain in the fight, even as the conflict becomes a grinding, brutal battle of artillery that may favor the firepower and manpower of Russia’s military. The official sounded a more optimistic note about the state of the fight, even as Russia appears to be gaining momentum in the Donbas region.

Problems of morale, poor command, and supply issues have plagued the Russian military since the beginning of the invasion. Russia was able to paper over some of those issues when the focus shifted to eastern Ukraine, since the battlefield bordered Russia, making it much easier to send supplies the short distance to units on the front line.

A lot of Russia’s high-end equipment has already been destroyed, the official said, forcing them to rely on older models. At the same time, Russia’s stock of precision munitions are dwindling, leading to the use of more artillery, which has had devastating consequences with its lack of precision. Sanctions and export restrictions have also made it higher to resupply their high end capabilities, the official said.

Despite all the challenges the Russians have faced — both self-made and a result of Ukraine’s counter-attacks — Russia still retains its biggest advantage, the sheer size of its military. But that doesn’t mean Russia is guaranteed victory, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no indication that he is considering scaling back his goals.

The capacity of Gazprom’s Nord Stream 1 pipeline to supply gas to Europe is partly constrained as sanctions make it impossible for equipment supplier Siemens Energy to return a turbine being maintained in Canada, the companies have said.

Gazprom said it has curbed supplies via the Nord Stream 1 undersea pipeline to Germany to up to 100 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, down from 167 mcm, citing the delayed return of equipment that had been sent for repair.

This limits Russian gas supplies via another important route to Europe at a time when Germany, the region’s biggest economy, questions Moscow’s reliability as an energy provider, prompting efforts to look for alternative sources.

“Due to the delayed return of gas compressor units from repair by Siemens … and technical engines’ malfunctions, only three gas compressor units can currently be used at the Portovaya compression station,” Gazprom said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to show clear support for Ukraine.  
  
In an interview with German broadcaster ZDF on Monday night, Zelensky said Germany should not try to balance its interests between Ukraine and its relationship with Russia.  
  
""We need from Chancellor Scholz the certainty that Germany supports Ukraine,"" he said. ""He and his government must decide: there can't be a trade-off between Ukraine and relations with Russia.""  
  
There has been speculation Scholz could make his first trip to Kyiv since the start of the war later this week.  
  
The chancellor defended Germany against accusations it wouldn’t deliver weapons it promised for Ukraine.

It is remarkably bad strategy for Russia to commit all their resources into a battle that both negates its strengths, and taxes it’s weaknesses.

Russia’s weakness is it’s infantry. It strength is tanks and artillery.

Tanks can’t take urban areas without infantry. Artillery is useless in close quarter fighting.

The Russian army is infantry light. That’s why Russia has lost so much equipment as its tanks have been left under defended by infantry. Russia has also been generally poor at taking and keeping urban areas in this war. Urban warfare is Russias Achilles heel.

To put it bluntly, Russia pouring its troops into the Severodonetsk grinder is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. Russia is short of infantry and it’s throwing them away on a strategically bad battle. It is exactly the environment Russia should want to avoid. Instead it’s pouring it resources into it.

The Ukrainians must be pinching themselves. The Russians are throwing huge numbers of men into an urban cauldron where the close combat negates Russias air and artillery superiority. It is difficult for Ukraine, but the losses that they are inflicting on Russia are critical and will influence the outcome of this war.

Due to the political decision to not declare war on Ukraine, Russia don’t have troops to waste.

Right now, the Russians are wasting troops.

I find it hilarious that the Russians often talk with pride how they are willing to throw bodies at a military problem…. So long as it isn’t them. 

While historically this is true, I don’t think today’s Russians are as brave as they think they are. I don’t believe Russia can generate the “hordes” they believe they can.

e61e3fa1c93925ba758ad08281b58b4b,vbup89,ice9q9j,"All throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union piped gas to Central Europe, and Central Europe piped money to the Soviet Union. That dynamic has existed for a very very long time. Back then, the Soviets never really threatened to shut the gas off. It was understood that if things ever got to that point it would be because WWIII was already raging, and would likely be over before anything like that would matter.


Then The Cold War ended. 40+ years of relative stability were over, and nobody knew what would come next. That was the first time that fretting about European energy security got serious. It wasn’t just… “what if Russia shuts off the taps?”. It was that, but there were also new countries, like Ukraine, that the pipelines passed through. Now it wasn’t just one countries’ stability Europe had to worry about. There was as much concern that some future rebel-group or terrorist-group or rogue leader could target the pipelines to exact economic pain on Europe or Russia.




President H.W. Bush was the first US President to address those concerns. Way back in the early 90s, he started talking seriously about developing a backup-plan for Central Europe. He put in to action a plan to dramatically increase global LNG infrastructure. Ships got built. Lots and lots of LNG ships. Australia built huge LNG compressors, most of the markets for LNG being in Asia, that made sense. President Clinton carried on where H. W. left off without missing a beat, and it looked like the world was on a path to having a decent fall-back option if Russian gas ever got interrupted for whatever reason.


Then 9/11 happened. Then people started asking if LNG ships were safe. What if terrorists targeted an LNG ship in Boston Harbor? Public opinion turned sharply against LNG, and a lot of plans to increase capacity got shelved. A lot of the ships were no longer needed, and got put in to moth-balls barely used.


But the worry in intelligence circles remained. Under President Obama, focus switched to increasing compression capacity. Construction started on new and bigger facilities in Australia, Qatar, Louisiana, and Texas. Finally, just last month, the last piece of that puzzle got put in place when the Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana completed their sixth and final stream.



The tankers that were built 30 years ago are small by today's standards. The best ones have been taken out of moth-balls. We’ll probably need more, and bigger, ones if the gas gets cut. That’s a job for the Koreans.



The off-load capacity in Europe is another bottle-neck, but of the three parts of LNG infrastructure, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification, regasification is by far the easiest to build. The actual wharf for the ships to dock at is the hardest part. Existing docks in Europe tend to stay pretty busy, and building new ones that would only need to get used in case of emergency was expensive. 



But there is a huge existing off-load terminal in Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port. Pipelines are already in place to transfer gas from the port there in to the rest of Central Europe. Increasing off-load capacity wouldn't be too difficult. To do it quickly, LNG would probably have to evict some other type of terminal to make room, but there are lots of places that can unload containers besides Rotterdam, so that is a solvable problem.



I don’t actually think that it will ever come to that. Between production increases in North Africa, declining demand as alternative energy infrastructure gets built, and improvement in efficiency, it’s quite possible that the world won’t ever have to do a Berlin-LNG-lift. But the sword of Damocles isn’t anywhere near as close to Europe’s neck as Putin would like us all to believe. We got this.",False,1655252518.0,t3_vbup89,t3_vbup89,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

The Moscow Exchange has said it would suspend trading of the Swiss franc against the rouble and the US dollar after Switzerland adopted new EU sanctions against Russia.

The Moscow Exchange, Russia’s largest bourse, said it was having difficulty conducting transactions in the Swiss currency as a result of new trading restrictions imposed by Switzerland last week.

“The suspension of operations is due to difficulties conducting settlements in Swiss francs faced by market participants and the financial sector in connection with the restrictive measures imposed by Switzerland on June 10,” the Moscow Exchange said in a statement.

Germany will place Gazprom Germania into long-term administration, recapitalising it with a loan to protect it from insolvency and rename it Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, a German government spokesperson has said.

A government source said the loan, from the KfW state investment bank, would amount to between 9 and 10 billion euros ($10.4bn).

Germany placed Gazprom’s German subsidiary under temporary administration on April 4 to secure energy supplies after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The new, long-term administration allows administrators to focus on ensuring supply security rather than on preserving the assets of the original owner.

Pope Francis says he refuses distinction between ‘good and bad’ in Ukraine war: Papers

Pope Francis has refused the distinction between “good and bad” in the war in Ukraine, he was quoted as saying by daily La Stampa, which reported the Pope’s conversation with editors of Jesuit European cultural magazines.

Asked if he was in favour of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, the Pope answered: “No, I am not, I am simply opposed to reducing complexity to distinction between good and bad”.

Ryan and Mike speculate that, in the end, this war will be decided by the country that can endure the longest, in terms of their economies, logistics, materiel, and political will. And Ukraine’s endurance is tied up closely with the will of the West to continue backing Ukraine with arms and other supplies in a war that could continue to drag on for months, if not years.

Intelligence sources: Putin fell into a coma after an unsuccessful operation, the Kremlin is urgently developing a scenario for the transfer of power

Information came from Russia that the president of the aggressor country, Vladimir Putin, allegedly fell into a coma after the operation. The dictator had a cancerous tumor, the removal of which could cause serious consequences for his health.

OBOZREVATEL learned about this from intelligence sources. Now the president is allegedly in intensive care, where his life is supported with the help of artificial life support systems.

According to reports, Putin showed all the signs of inhibition of brainstem reflexes, his body does not respond to pain.

The head of the Russian Federation is in a state of destructive coma, intelligence sources say.

>  
>Ukraine appears to be increasingly outgunned and outmanned in the Donbas. With the U.S., is the objective still to help Ukraine win militarily and to weaken Russia militarily?

Of course it is. That said, this doesn't essentially mean giving them enough weapons that they'll outright beat Russia, which would be nice, but not the US's original objective. Just enough to keep the Ukrainians fighting and the Russians bleeding.

To be honest, I feel like any decisive weaponry will be coming from Europe. I looked into that [$40 billion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-40-billion-aid-ukraine-buy) supposedly being sent to Ukraine, and it turns out only about half of it will be for Ukraine to 'freely use' (pending US Department of Defense approval). I'm not exactly sure how much of that money is being used to help Ukraine fight right now (i.e. buy artillery and other heavy weapons that Ukraine needs now in eastern Donbas). That said, it is better then nothing, but this feels like preparation for a prolonged conflict than a short and decisive war.

>The aid package provides $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, continuing the effort that has been vital to sustaining Ukrainian resistance, and $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe.

We'll see if the PzH2000 units will be delivered this or next week as the training should be concluded this week.

Training for the Gepard might have started this week. Deliveries are most likely in July and August, when the crews completed their training.

Premature delivery of weapons nobody can handle is just increasing the risk of an Iskander strike on Ukrainian weapons depots!

Meanwhile opposition leader Friedrich Merz (CDU) fantasizes on TV of Rheinmetall being able to refurbish 30 Marder per week. In reality they can do two. Now they have six ready to be exported. Without ammunitions!

edit: actual promises of heavy weapons
* PzH2000 artillery system: should be delivered this month
* artillery detection radar (probably COBRA): no date given, but might be delivered alongside the PzH2000
* Gepard anti aircraft: estimated delivery 15 in July, 15 in August (maybe up to 50 units, if Ukraine sends more crews for training), limited ammo of 59k (good for 2500 targets)
* Mars II MLRS: no delivery date given (there might be a software update needed for use with US and UK ammo)
* Iris-T: delivery late this year (Diehl produces two of these per year and the first has been delivered to Egypt, Germany has none in operation)

Some construction jobs were promised locally, then I imagine a few long-term jobs at the port itself, that's about it.

Anyway, the measure got voted down and it never got built. Mostly because people suspected that if our gas reserves were put on the global market then our finite reserves would get shipped to Asia, and we'd be tied into any kind of global supply problems resulting in higher costs to heat our houses in winter.

Another takeaway from it is that the shadow mobilisation has been effective in keeping Russia in the game but doesn't change the big picture overall regarding Russian manpower problems. It doesn't fix the problem, it just alleviates it for the time being.

It sounds absurd but he also thinks they have a point, can the West really stay behind Ukraine in the long term on this financially? Hopefully this is Putin's delusion undermining his strategy.

The one thing I felt they didn't touch on (and I'm really not qualified to question Kofman) is regarding Russian morale. Are Russian and separatist fighting units in danger of breaking under more losses? Is it one of those things that could happen slowly and then very suddenly?

That's the most concrete I've seen of any concessions.

There appears to be two different reports.

The first one is from The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCR):

> The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 9,931 civilian casualties in the country: 4,432 killed and 5,499 injured.

> https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/06/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-14-june-2022

The numbers appear to have been updated since the original press statement was released (4,432 vs 4,495).

The second one is from a Ukrainian police chief's report (Andriy Nebytov is the head of the Kyiv regional police):

>The hands of several victims were tied behind their backs. The gruesome work of digging up the remains coincided with the Ukrainian police chief's report that authorities have opened criminal investigations into the killings of more than 12,000 people since Russia’ invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 

>https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/police-investigating-killings-12000-ukrainians-war-85360485

OHCR recorded X amount while the police chief is making an estimation. We won't know the *precise* amount because of the number of bodies that have yet to be found and amount of time it will take to find and report them. That probably does not include any missing people and the time it would take to presume that they are dead. 

For comparison purposes, the U.S. is still recovering missing soldiers' bodies that were killed in WWII; also keep in mind that they may never find the bodies.

I don't disagree that there isn't really a good or bad guy in terms of the US/west and Russia sandwiching Ukraine in the middle of war, but I think instead of focusing on the provocation part which I think both sides were doing, he should focus on how avoidable it was.*

At least in my opinion, by 2022, and even 2021 it was just a matter of time before Putin pulled the trigger. I think if the pope wants to put his two cents in, instead of playing the fence he should question what more could have been done in the years building up to stop Russia from war, because at the point where the West and Russia were provoking eachother with troop movements and threatening to send aid, it was probably too late to cool things down. 

I think the biggest issue that ultimately led to this war starting (besides the Russian imperialism) is with the US not really caring about eastern Europe as an area of key foreign policy even though we are apparently meant to protect all these post soviet states we have invited to NATO or formed other arrangements with, creating unnecessary amounts of instability in the region. Francis should talk about how great powers shouldn't put blankets over struggling powers of the world and promise to protect if they won't, because its inherently destabilizing.  Had the US taken more of a serious tone on eastern Europe after the collapse of the USSR I think Russia would probably have felt much more confined and unable to lash out.

Yes:

 - Russia would absolutely lose in that scenario. (a lot of others would lose, as well).

 - The result of letting the starvation/extortion scenario play out, would be to watch the Western alliance backing Ukraine, likely fragment, and populist politics would get a serious boost with the resulting massive refugee crisis; and several major players, particularly the USA, would likely end up with fascist governments in the next 2-5 years.


Personally, I'm not sure which scenario would be a worse outcome for the human race.  

The thing to remember though: there really are no good options.

The Western Alliance could give up, and tell Russia to go ahead and take Ukraine, and ship the grain, and there is so much damage to infrastructure, (and mines, and this year's planting), that we're still going to end up with a massive crisis, and tens of millions starving.

Russia concentrated everything they have in some no name city (I'm Ukrainian, I can say that this is just no name city) of Severodonetsk and can't take it for 2 months straight while having 10 to 1 advantage in that place.

Russia saw that no effective action was taken after Bucha and Georgia annexation announcement, so it decided to annex Kherson and Zaporizhia in addition to Donetsk and Luhansk. Week later, nothing from EU or US. (Giving out passports, stealing grain, bringing teachers, etc.)

We had no choice but to hope that Russia had improved enough to try and chase peace.  And it was a close thing (and arguably, we could have helped more).

In any case, those efforts stopped weapons from porously leaking all over the world, and bought us 20 years of peace and 20 years of reduced intensity conflict, during which Russia's demographics, economy, influence, and ability to wage war decreased.  Even knowing the current outcome, it was a good investment.

* F35 (for nuclear participation of the B61 tactical nukes from the US in Germany, replacing Tornado)
* ECR-Eurofighter (development and buying this new version of the older Tornado ECR)
* CH-47 Chinook (replacing CH-53)
* upgrading air defense (upgrading Patriots and buying additional Systems, we talked about Arrow 3)
* Heron drone gets weapons (not the last)
* F126(former MKS180) additional ship. So 4+2
* K130 (looks replacement/upgrades for the 1lot)
* FNSM (Future Naval Strike Missiles) and IDAS for the submarines (anti aircraft missiles)
* U 212 common design (the new subs developed beween Germany and Norway)
* Puma IFV (2nd lot)
* Marder IFV replacement (not sure if it was Boxer or a different system)

Putin uses these separatist republics (in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova), as weapons against the sovereignty of those countries.

Territorial concessions to Russia would not lead to peace in Ukraine. If this wasn't clear before, if should have been clear after February 24.

Europe still doesn't want to face reality and provide Ukraine enough weapons to win war against Russia (before you start spamming, please see how much was provided and how much Russia has) and also stop trade with Russia. Generally speaking of course, with different specifics from country to country. Ukraine needs weapon and ammo, because what was provided so far is not enough not only to push back but not enough to even stop Russian offensive. Afaik, 40 artillery 155 and 12 MLRS would be enough to stop the offensive on east and start proper offensive on Kherson. the rest was asked to push back Russians to pre 24th borders.

And Poland and other Eastern European states are not going to stop as they feel directly threatened and UK support seems solid, that means that although you'd like to see continued support from France and Germany if they waver it will not even be close to the end of support for Ukraine.

Yes Germany has provided a lot of financial assistance to Ukraine as well as many smaller arms but has yet to deliver one piece of heavy weaponry to Ukraine and hasn't committed to much in the future. France has also given a high dollar value in aid and small arms but has only given 12 Caesar self propelled artillery pieces, much appreciated by Ukraine no doubt and you'd like to see more but compared to the over 200 modernized T-72 tanks that Poland has given it puts into context the relative amounts of heavy weapons supplied. Even the Dutch are apparently giving hundreds of their in storage updated M113 armored personal carriers and even more seem to be on the way from the US. The US has also supplied around 100 M777 howitzers already and looks to be sending more.

Think of it this way, in our current stage of human development, we can not create a self-sustaining colony offworld. Any outpost requires resupply from Earth.  I make take generations at the most optimistic to get to the level of fully independent space colonies.

If a nuclear war or other crisis causes the human race to massively shirk at a massive scale, it could be difficult, if not impossible for humanity to get back to today's level of advancement.

Think of it this way. If we have a nuclear war in the next couple decades, some people may survive, but these surviours will be living in a world with massive climate damage, extremely reduced populations, likely an extremely unstable geo-political climate.

And to top it all off, the majority of the non-renewable fuels we used to build civilization the first time are gone. This last point is something I think a lot of people gloss over when we talk about rebuilding civilization.

Fossil fuels act like a jumping off point for build an industrial civilization. Without them its like trying to drive a car without a starter. 

The point is, even if humanity survives it will not be close to spacefaring, any colonies off world will likely collapse due to lack of resupply. Should humanity rebuild., there is always the chance it will destroy itself again in the process. (as the rebuilding process will likely take centuries if not millennia to complete)

Interesting article that discusses ""the day after"" when it comes to the invasion, mainly because the conclusion of the invasion (a Ukrainian victory of sorts) will not resolve tensions with Russia: [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-06-06/what-if-ukraine-wins?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-06-06/what-if-ukraine-wins?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

*Given the tribulations of “winning small,” Ukraine’s “winning big”—reclaiming Crimea and all of Donbas—might seem like a shortcut to a better future. Although not entirely impossible, the stars would truly have to align for a wholesale defeat of Russia: a lightning victory for Ukraine, one battle building upon another, Russian supply lines disintegrating and Ukrainian morale driving its soldiers unstoppably forward. At the same time, the Russian army would have to collapse in retreat. Strategy would give way to the emotions of individual soldiers as panic took hold. No one has ever described this better than Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace, a meditation on the anarchy of war. “A battle is won by the side that is absolutely determined to win,” Tolstoy wrote about Napoleon’s 1805 defeat of the Russian army. Russian casualties, he wrote, “were about the same as those of the French, but we told ourselves early in the day that the battle was lost, so it was lost.”*

*But a full-scale Ukrainian military defeat of Russia, including the retaking of Crimea, verges on fantasy. It would be far too optimistic to base either Ukrainian or Western strategy on such an outcome. Pursuing it would also send the war into a new phase. Having poured billions of dollars into Crimea’s development, a symbol of Russian renewal, Moscow would interpret a Ukrainian offensive in Crimea as an assault on Russian territory, something Moscow would try to prevent by all available means. The hypothesis that Russia’s full-scale defeat would excise the cancer of imperialism from the Russian leadership and body politic rests on a clumsy analogy to Germany’s unconditional surrender in World War II, and stems from a desire not just to end this war but to foreclose the possibility of Russia starting any future war in Europe. It is an intoxicating vision, but one unconnected to reality.*",False,1655225616.0,t3_vbup89,t1_iccjubu,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Rich countries are the only ones that matter. What rich countries say, goes.

That's how the world goes. That's how the world always went. Since ancient times. So ancient the pyramids were not built and the concept of country was very fluid.

You give China as an example. China is terrified of the sanctions. The Chinese economy consists of ""made in China."" If the west decides to manufacture things somewhere else, China doesn't have an economy. And this is slowly happening, to the advantage of other countries like Thailand, India, Vietnam.

China can't even feed it's own people, it's one of the biggest importer of food, and without buying a shit ton of grains and related food products it would be a disaster. They don't have enough fields to raise crops, and those they have are of poor quality.

India is irrelevant. A shit economy, lots of poor people, their industry is far behind even Russia. While they produce enough food to satisfy internal needs, everything else is a mess. India also has absolutely no method of projecting its power. Their defense industry might as well not exist, they rely on buying weapons from Russia.

And BRICS is more or less a joke.

Their development relies heavily on the west. Their economy, finances, you name it, is heavily dependent on the song of the west. They dance however the west says.

Russia is a non issue now in BRICS, or anywhere, since they stopped having an economy at the end of February, and will not have one for a long time.

Brazil? HA HA HA!

South Africa? HA HA HA!!!

You're as delusional as Putin when he announced he's making his own G8.

If the west says ""Jump"" you ask how high, son!

And yes, in ""the west"" I include Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, etc.

Just because your country has nukes it means nothing. It's like North Korea ""testing"" rockets all the time. Nobody really cares, a stone well thrown would end North Korea.

It's one of those things that has a kernel of truth to it, and so it's paraded about as a gaffe so we can all laugh at someone who supposedly should have known better. But in truth, it not only was *a* correct way to express what JFK was trying to express, it was the *most* correct way to express that.

It is true that a Berliner is a name for a type of jelly donut in Germany. However, adding an -er to the end of a city is the accepted and common way to identify an occupant of a particular region in German. They don't have a variety of different methods like we do in English, where -an, -ite, -ian, -er, -n and more are all acceptable ways to indicate that you're from a region. So the only way to identify as a person of Berlin is to call them a Berliner.

The next thing that people say is that it's his usage of the article ""ein"" that made him say that he was a jelly donut; these people state that he should have said ""Ich bin Berliner,"" instead. However, that's also not correct. If he were to say that, he would be claiming that he is literally (using it in the correct, literal way) a resident of Berlin. Using the indefinite article, ""ein Berliner,"" is the correct way to show solidarity with Berlin without actually claiming to be a literal citizen of Berlin.

And finally, Berliners don't call Berliners Berliners. Yeah, I had some fun with that sentence. In Germany at large, a particular type of jelly donut is called a Berliner. However, it's an abbreviation - the full name of the item is a Berliner Pfannkuchen. Within Berlin, they simply call them Pfannkuchen. Similar to how, if you go to Italy, you're not looking for an Italian restaurant to eat pasta - you're just looking for a restaurant. Or how a New Yorker wouldn't call a New York-style pizzeria a New York-style pizzeria in New York - they'd just call it a pizzeria.

To provide a rough equivalent:

Imagine that you and I were Germans. And we hear that, in the aftermath of 9/11, Johannes Rau went to New York and gave a well-received speech, in which he said, ""I am a New Yorker!"" Our knowing friends then laugh and tell us, ""And you know, those people in New York had a big laugh at him, because he was really calling himself a magazine! The New Yorker is the name of a popular magazine in the city! What an idiot!""

Most importantly, we want Russia to leave Ukraine and Russia is still there.

Well, this is a very dumb way of thinking.

What the west wants is one thing, what the west is willing to do is another thing.

The west is not going to go around and invade everyone left and right just because they want different leaders here and there. In fact, not even the US is doing this any more. The 60s, 70s, part of the 80s sure were wild, but the west has a different approach today. It uses the power of money.

You gave an example earlier that Lavrov is still flying everywhere. So what? That means only that they still have a functional plane, not that he's projecting power.

Real power is when people come and visit you. That's why everyone wants to be photographed in the White House, shaking whoever is the president's hand at the time, and nobody is really there celebrating their picture in the Kremlin with Putin smiling creepily.

The ability to speak with someone and going somewhere doesn't mean you're not isolated.

Access to technology. Access to financial markets. Access to various international organizations (which Russia is willingly removing itself from). Access to... having international brand and companies operate within your borders.

You have no grasp of these concepts, you think isolation is the classical prison term. that's not it.

These countries can have a friendly stance, but none are helping. Because if they do, they get the same deal as Russia. And they like access to the west and their technology/money/economy more then they like Russia.

Talk and travel is cheap. Actions are the real deal.

You said that what rich countries say, goes. But clearly it doesn't. Using the power of money also failed. It is a well known problem that sanctions rarely work to actually change behaviour (see Iran, NK).

So now we have to use our armies to threaten? The only western country that has an army for a possible military intervention is the US. And they have definitely tried in Afghanistan. That failed. The intervention in Irak also didn't haev the desired result. Lybia is still a mess. Military interventions are rarely successful. And this is all moot in the case of Russia anyway, because even if there weren't nuclear weapons at play and the US would go all out, they would still have trouble defeating Russia, because Russia has such an enormous geographical advantage.

>You don't understand what globally isolated means, do you?The ability to speak with someone and going somewhere doesn't mean you're not isolated.

That is exactly what isolated means. It is what we tried to do to Assad (didn't work) and North Korea (also didn't work). Russia is still in a lot of international organisations. Sure, they were kicked out of some (or left before they could get kicked out), but BRICS countries are staying neutral, they are still in the G20, and they have their permanent seat on the Security Council. That is more than enough to pretend to their own population that everything is fine and that they defeated the wests 'attempts to destroy them'.

Of course no country is going to help Russia without getting something in return. Countries are usually self-interested. But they are still willing to do business. Their access to western markets is not threatened, because no one has imposed seconday sanctions (though that could change).",1655220305.0,1655220059.0,t3_vbup89,t1_icbzno3,,8,0,0,0,0,0,

Irak the same, Baghdad Bob was on TV while American tanks were rolling behind him, hat's how smooth that went.

Invading a country is one thing. The US had no desire to rebuild those countries. It had control over them for as long as it stayed there. uncontested.

It is one thing to invade and control a country, and another to subjugate that country.

The US didn't have the desire to subjugate Afghanistan, for example. Russia wants to do that with Ukraine. The US had other plans.

Yes it does. The sanctions on NK and Iran were meant to step them from getting nuclear weapons (not nuclear power plants, I don't know where you got that from). They have them (or almost in the case of Iran), so the sanctions were a failure. It is a well know problem that economic sanctions do not really change the behaviour of autocratic regimes. This is a well known problem with sanctions, so I am a bit surprised you don't know this.

>You know nothing about how the invasion of Afghanistan went, do you? The US had full control of the country in two weeks.The taliban are a different matter, by no way did they defeat the US or anything stupid or crazy like that.

Nobody starts a military intervention because they like the sound of gunfire. They start an intervention to achieve a political goal. The US wanted to chase away the Taliban and make Afghanistan into a democracy ([https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-us-democratic-project-failed-afghanistan-53292](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-us-democratic-project-failed-afghanistan-53292)). Countless lives lost and billions of dollar wasted, and the Taliban is firmly back in control of Afghanistan. This wasn't the political goal, so the intervention was a failure. I think whether or not the Taliban managed to defeat the US depends on how you define defeat. I'd say no, but they did outlast the US.
