“Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been arguing with top military brass for months, on Friday escalated the feud by accusing pro-Moscow forces of trying to blow up his men.

Prigozhin's Wagner Group troops have largely pulled back from the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, most of which they captured last month after taking heavy casualties, and handed over their positions to regular Russian forces.

When asked why the charges had been set, the officials indicated it was an order from their superiors.

""It was not necessary to plant these charges in order to deter the enemy, as it (the area in question) is in the rear area. Therefore, we can assume that these charges were intended to meet the advancing units of Wagner,"" he said.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Vpg\_ei8tw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Vpg_ei8tw)

*Sergej Sumlenny is a political expert and a founder of the Berlin-based think tank European Resilience Initiative Center. In his interview with Jonathan Fink, a founder of the podcast Silicon Curtain, Sergej talks about German perception of Russia, how Russia sought to undermine Ukraine's statehood, and why the German society was not ready to address its guilt towards Central and Eastern European countries.*

\[2:41\] I never had connections to Ukraine before I moved to Kyiv in 2015. I was born in the Soviet Union, in the territory of contemporary Russia \[...\] and 20 years ago I moved to Germany, renounced my Russian citizenship, and now I'm a part of the German political nation. When I came to Ukraine, I felt obliged to Ukraine -- as a former Russian and as a German -- because both of my nations \[...\] have tried to erase Ukrainian nationhood.

\[9:09\] In the Soviet Union, the Holocaust was a banned topic. \[...\] If you look at the monuments where Jews have been killed by the Germans, there was no mention of Jews: they were all called ""peaceful Soviet citizens"". \[...\] It was extremely important to forbid this history, not just because of anti-semitism but also because it would've raised a lot of questions about the similarities of the two regimes.

\[12:54\] For the German government that was very comfortable, because you could deal with Moscow without ever thinking about the rights of the nations between the two regimes. \[...\] That continued up 'til recently: in early Feb/2022, two weeks before the full-scale invasion, the German president Steinmeier \[...\] gave an interview about the necessity of Nord Stream 2 \[...\] because this is the last remaining bridge between Germany and Russia, and this is the way we repay our debt for WW2.

\[14:33\] He ignored the German responsibility towards Ukraine or Poland. Those two countries said: don't build Nord Stream 2, because the moment the pipeline is finished the Russians will invade Ukraine. And that's what happened.

\[19:37\] Even before February of last year there was clear genocidal rhetoric coming out of Russian propaganda. \[...\] There was a failure to react to that, and that's not just Germany -- all of Europe, America, we all failed to react.

\[27:00\] If we want to deconstruct the mythology of the Soviet-soldier-who-is-a-Russian-soldier -- and if you read the German media, they mostly use the term ""Russian soldier"" -- then who was the most effective Soviet fighter pilot? It was Kozhedub, who was from Ukraine. \[...\] Who opened the gates of Auschwitz? \[...\] A Ukrainian Jew from Odessa. \[...\] After WW2, the Russians ran a PR campaign of appropriation of history.

\[30:38\] The victory of WW2 became a Russian victory. The inventions of the Soviet era all became Russian inventions. Even if it was Ukrainians, or Georgians, or Lithuanians, etc. All the bad things that happened, of course, were the guilt of all Republics. For example, the Russians blamed Ukrainians for being Nazi collaborators.

\[37:50\] It is the Soviet narrative to discredit Ukrainians and to proclaim any attempt at their own statehood as a Nazi or neo-Nazi approach.

\[42:25\] Germany has lost two world wars. After the second time, Germany was divided and occupied -- and the eastern half was occupied by not the most friendly and progressive people. And still Germany is today one of the most successful and important countries in the world. So, from the German perspective, being occupied is not a big deal.

\[45:53\] From the German perspective, when you are in a war: just capitulate! There is no such thing as patriotism, heroism, or military duty.

\[52:07\] Ukrainians strike me as being extraordinarily detached from the terrible reality. \[...\] They are the opposite of hysterical emotional people. I've come to realize they're extraordinarily rational and capable people, so listening to them is actually what we have to do.

\[55:13\] We know that the Russians planned full-scale genocide and what they did in Bucha was just an appetizer. One month before the invasion, the Russians introduced a legal functional standard for mass graves: 3 soldiers and 1 bulldozer have to produce, within 2 days, a mass grave for 1600 bodies. \[...\] The Russians came with whole columns of riot police, barbed wire, they had death lists and everything. Only the British NLAWs, the American Javelins, and the Polish Perun anti-air missiles saved Kyiv from that fate.

\[56:52\] One of my \[Ukrainian\] colleagues told me: ""Sergej, we could never imagine this would happen! We were told we were brother nations."" And I told him: ""That's the problem. You are Ukrainian."" \[...\] I'm Russian-born, I was never told about that. I was told that Ukrainians either don't exist, or are bad Russians.

\[1:01:55\] I think we need a tribunal. These people need to know that they are being hunted... and after Vladimir Putin was announced as a wanted criminal by the ICC, he never left his country. He can say ""I don't care, I'm not afraid, ICC means nothing,"" but he never left the country. We clearly that Russia needs to be pressured in all areas.

\[1:02:52\] In the corridor of \[a TV station in Kyiv\] there was an exhibition of political posters. One of them was all black with a slogan: ""The Hague can wait."" Back then, in 2015, I didn't believe it would happen. And now we know it can happen.",1685813227.0,1685812991.0,t3_13z03ow,t3_13z03ow,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

KYIV, June 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine is ready to launch its long-awaited counteroffensive to recapture Russian-occupied territory, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview published on Saturday.

""We strongly believe that we will succeed,” Zelenskiy told the Wall Street Journal.

""I don’t know how long it will take. To be honest, it can go a variety of ways, completely different. But we are going to do it, and we are ready.""



Kyiv hopes a counteroffensive to reclaim territory will change the dynamics of the war that has raged since Russia invaded its smaller neighbour 15 months ago.

Zelenskiy said last month Ukraine needed to wait for more Western armoured vehicles arrived before launching the counteroffensive. He has been on a diplomatic push to maintain Western support, seeking more military aid and weapons, which is key for Ukraine to succeed in its plans.

Russia holds swaths of Ukrainian territory in the east, south and southeast.[Zelenskiy says Ukraine ready to launch counteroffensive](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-ready-launch-counteroffensive-2023-06-03/)",False,1685776146.0,t3_13z03ow,t3_13z03ow,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

We know the answer to that, because we saw it in 2014. A massive jump in Putin's approval ratings and Russians falling over themselves to crow about Russia's strength. And that jump persisting through Russia's murderous intervention in Syria.

There is a fundamental, deep-seated problem in Russian society that's rooted in its people rather than limited to any particular regime: a belief that Russian prestige is measured by its ability to impose its will on other countries by force, and a willingness to celebrate and approve Russia doing that regardless of the circumstances.

It's the most pernicious form of nationalism, and sadly history suggests it's going to take something cataclysmic to shift it.

It's much, much simpler. Thinking about myself, in 2014, I don't think I'd have the stones to protest. Today, in 2023, with everything going to shit in a handbasket in the RF? I might. I'd like to think I would.

Yeah. The germans did just that though. They were _fairly_ nationalistic one could say, and yet germans today (in my opinion, legitimately) tend to be seen as the most peacenik of all western nations.

Well, germans after WW1, yes. Germans after WW2, emphatically no. Perhaps the key difference there is the Marshall Plan.

But in the case higher ups show up and start asking what happened to the equipment and why is it all missing - uhh, they will need a scapegoat.

Agreed. I think people also forget just how long big wars take. A “quick” war between large countries still often isn’t over in a matter of months.

In WWII in week 66 the Blitz of Britain was still ongoing and Greece was fighting off an Italian invasion. 

By historical standards this war is happening very quickly. Ukraine also strategically knows that a failed major counteroffensive would be a serious blow and so they have to be a bit more cautious when they attack and sometimes that means waiting. Hypothetically maybe if Ukraine attacked last month in bulk they would have had a 50% chance of victory while an attack now would have a 60% chance and an attack in a month might be 70%. If you are a Ukrainian general and those are your odds maybe a successful counteroffensive last month was possible but you have to carefully weigh the odds of successes both at the moment and in the future.

Events set precedents, and one specific war will decide conflicts for years and decades to come. If Russia were to win it would show every authoritarian leader that conquest by force is back on the menu and can succeed.

I feel like historical parallels are always a bit crude, but in the lead up to WW2, smaller wars and annexations emboldened authoritarian leaders towards bigger ones. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, Nazi Germany's annexations - the failure of the international community to stand up to these and stop them showed Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan that successful aggression was possible. If they had been stopped earlier, they might not have been emboldened, or the regimes might have collapsed entirely from humiliation.

I don't think if Russia was allowed to win it would lead to the fall of the west, but it would certainly put several democracies and millions of people around the world at greater risk.

In virtually every country in Europe - probably not Hungary at the moment - annexing part of a neighbouring country in breach of treaty and international law would absolutely not have  the leader who did it on 85% approval ratings. Especially not if at the same time his goons were shooting civilian airliners out of the sky and his airforce was bombing civilians in Syria in support of a murderous regime. And in 2014 there was still substantial access to pluralist and dissenting sources of information in Russia for people to have access to facts. If what you're saying is I - who you know nothing about incidentally - wouldn't have had the nerve to protest because of how *my fellow
citizens* would react - well, that's exactly my point. 

And the difference between Germany post WW1 and WW2 is precisely the point too. It took a combination of absolute defeat on their own soil, partition by greater powers, fear of the Soviet union and exceptional western statecraft to turn Germans into the people they are today. Russia's situation after this war will very probably not be comparable on any of those points.

Walt in [his essay for foreignpolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/15/putin-right-ukraine-war/):

>	This situation also explains why Ukrainians—and their loudest supporters in the West—have gone to enormous lengths to link their country’s fate to lots of unrelated issues. If you listen to them, Russian control over Crimea or any portion of the Donbas would be a fatal blow to the “rules-based international order,” an invitation to China to seize Taiwan, a boon to autocrats everywhere, a catastrophic failure of democracy, and a sign that nuclear blackmail is easy and that Putin could use it to march his army all the way to the English Channel. Hard-liners in the West make arguments like this to make Ukraine’s fate appear as important to us as it is to Russia, but such scare tactics don’t stand up to even casual scrutiny. The future course of the 21st century is not going to be determined by whether Kyiv or Moscow ends up controlling the territories they are currently fighting over, but rather by which countries control key technologies, by climate change, and by political developments in many other places.

Concerning the “but nuclear blackmail” argument:

>	Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears.

Unfortunately though what we would like the ideal world to be like isn’t the only thing that matters, and chasing a theoretical ideal at all costs with a “consequences be damned” attitude isn’t going to work if we want to survive - whether we like it or not, a neighboring nuclear power with a significant military interest that they’ve credibly declared vital to their own survival changes the calculation, and the chances of our own continued survival are more important to us than upholding philosophical ideals of what the perfect world should look like. 

This is deeply uncomfortable to many people - the realization that our power to freely shape the world according to our beliefs is limited by something as mundane as a few thousand nuclear warheads, and especially so if those few thousand nuclear warheads are in the hands of someone who does not share our ideals one bit but has tied his own fate to the outcome of this war in such a way that we must credibly fear that he might use them rather than accept defeat.

I texted a parent about one of my students who had some back pain yesterday at recess. They took him to the doctor and he's going to see an ortho guy. I think he slipped a disk. Imagine...an 11 year old with a herniated disk...

I emailed HR about one of my supervisors lying about a reward I was supposed to get for my classes performance. I'm not mad about missing out on 25 bucks, I'm more annoyed he lied to me.

I put together a modular shelf in my basement and asked my daughter to move all the board games there sometime this week...sweet kid did it about an hour ago.

Later on, I'll probably read some antiwork and malicious compliance while I watch the Mets game (they are very disappointing this year).

Then, I have to finish mowing, go to Home Depot for a screw to secure the hinge to the door of the bathroom upstairs and then I will look to see if PSSA scores are out because I want to see how my kids did. (Building level and class level scores come out WAY before the kids and parents get them.)

Hold on. There is some inconsistency here.

You have previously said that it is not ""our war"", because we are not directly fighting but just providing weapons, which you support. But now you are saying that an Ukrainian soldier using NATO weapons counts as ""a de facto NATO strike"". Following your newfound logic, since Ukrainian soldiers are currently fighting using NATO weapons, that means that NATO is ""de facto"" currently fighting against Russia.
