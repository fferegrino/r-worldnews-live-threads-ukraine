I'm always amazed and touched at the assistance being offered to Ukraine by countries that I would have assumed did not give a flying fuck about what is happening there.

It may not be much in the larger scheme of things, but they are giving what they've got, which is *extensive* experience with landmine removal.

*How to surrender if you are alone:*

- Unfasten the magazine and hang the weapon on the left shoulder with the barrel pointed down

- Raise your hands, keep palms open 

- Lift a white cloth

- Shout loudly ""Surrender!""

- Approach only on command

- Obey the orders of the Ukrainians


*How to surrender to a group or an entire unit:*

- Place all weapons in front of you, at a distance.

- Stand directly in front of military equipment. Deactivate or switch off equipment (it should not be in a combat position).

- Choose a negotiator to notify the Ukrainian military about the desire to surrender. This must be an officer or the most senior in rank. With a white flag and no weapons.

*What guarantees are provided to prisoners of war:*

- The right to life and respect for the prohibition of torture in accordance with international law.

- Amnesty to those who voluntarily surrendered military equipment and laid down their weapons.

- Phone call to family and friends.

*What will happen to the military after captivity:*

- They will be released by exchange for Ukrainian prisoners, or after the end of the war. They return to their country.

- All seized property (money, valuables) is returned to them.

- *Important!* All those who voluntarily surrender will be issued as ‘captured in battle.’ This is to protect military personnel from possible criminal prosecution upon return to their country.

- Soldiers who have surrendered to the Armed Forces of Ukraine will also **have the opportunity to join the international legion and fight with many of their compatriots for a free Russia, on anonymous terms.**

Day 297 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet, there were no missile or drone strikes, but a couple of air raid alerts did happen, though they were, thankfully, uneventful. A couple times today people were reporting “explosions” happening in Kharkiv, but it turned out to be thunder, which was very unexpected. Thunder happening at this time of year is super uncommon, so when people heard it now, the first thought was obviously explosions, because they sound almost identical to thunder.

Today the electricity is already mostly fixed, it seems that the damage wasn’t too bad after all. In Kharkiv we didn’t even switch from the scheduled blackouts to emergency ones, which usually always happened after a new missiles strike. So at least here in Kharkiv the electricity situation is definitely under control, even though our energy infrastructure was hit by 10 missiles yesterday. 

Also, the reason why the missiles that were fired at Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia yesterday were not intercepted is because they weren’t cruise missiles, but S-300 missiles, which are ballistic, and we don’t have any real defense against ballistic missiles. I hope that the news about Patriot being given to us turn out to be true, because it can actually intercept that type of missile, unlike our current air defense systems.

>* Putin cancelled his annual press conference for the first time in a decade as well as his address to the Federal Assembly. Although the Constitution mandates communications between the President and the Parliament. Here's a thread on why this is a significant sign 1/11

>* Putin has nothing to say to ordinary Russians and the Russian elite. He can't possibly avoid talking about the war, its goals, and its course in his statements. He also lacks solid justifications and forecasts in light of the Russian army's failures 2/11

>* Putin's forces failed to seize Kyiv as well as demoralise Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainians managed to liberate several captured territories in late summer and early autumn and successfully launched symbolic retaliatory strikes upon Russian territory 3/11

>* Kherson – the only regional centre taken and even formally absorbed into Russia – was liberated. Ukraine was able to sink The Moskva, Russia's flagship in the Black Sea fleet. Moreover, they caused devastating explosions which demolished the vital Crimean bridge 4/11

>* Kremlin had to abandon its rhetoric of rescuing Ukrainians from Nazis. Instead, Putin has made it blatantly obvious he is bent on destroying the peaceful civilian infrastructure as a form of warfare against the Ukrainian people and state, and that they are the ultimate goal 5/11

>* The current situation occurs in the context of the continuing deterioration of living standards and extensive mobilisation taking place in Russia. Meanwhile, the elite and business sector have largely lost foreign assets and access to the benefits of Western civilisation 6/11

>* Putin is losing this war, as the goals are no longer clear, and both the elite and the population are bearing the costs. He can't explain the purpose of his invasion or when it will come to an end. He's not able to meet public demand so he cancelled all public talks 7/11

>* The decision to cancel all events is also motivated by fear of potential successful sabotage by Ukrainians as they have demonstrated their ability to attack targets deep within Russian territory 8/11

>* Russia’s most strategic military airfields, located 650 km from the front line, were destroyed by a drone attack. Besides, Western Siberia has already been affected by several mystery fires at sensitive Russian facilities 9/11

>* No one can guarantee that Putin won't have to address the media or the parliament while the Kremlin is on fire or a bridge over the Moskva River is in shambles 10/11

>* To conclude, Russia's domestic politics are now largely shaped by Ukraine's successful military campaign. Putin started the war to address his personal issues and remain in power. However, Ukraine already has power over his domestic agenda 11/11

>
>*Secret Russian battle plans, intercepts, and interviews with Russian soldiers and Kremlin confidants revealed new details of how Vladimir Putin botched his invasion of Ukraine.*
>
>A team of New York Times reporters investigated one of the central questions of the war in Ukraine: Why has Russia bungled its invasion so badly?
>
>The story — based on secret battle plans, intercepts and interviews with Russian soldiers and Kremlin confidants — offers new insights into President Vladimir V. Putin’s state of mind, the stunning failures of his military, and U.S. efforts to prevent a direct war with Russia.
>
>Here are eight takeaways from the report.
>
>**Reached by phone inside Russian hospitals, wounded soldiers described being sent to war with little food, training, bullets or equipment — and watching about two-thirds of their platoon get killed.** Materials recovered from battlefields point to the military’s lack of preparation: a map from the 1960s, a Wikipedia printout on how to operate a sniper rifle, a wildly optimistic timetable for Russia’s invasion. In interviews, one soldier recalled asking how to use his rifle just before heading off to battle, while another described how his supervisor revealed they were going to war: “Tomorrow you are going to Ukraine to fuck up some shit.”
>
>**Many of the people closest to Mr. Putin fed his suspicions, magnifying his grievances against the West.** A former confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social media algorithm: “They read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff.” Mr. Putin planned the invasion in such secrecy that even Dmitri S. Peskov, his spokesman, said in an interview that he learned of it only once it had begun. Anton Vaino, Mr. Putin’s chief of staff, and Aleksei Gromov, Mr. Putin’s powerful media adviser, also said they did not know in advance, according to people who spoke to them about it.
>
>**The United States tried to stop Ukraine from killing a top Russian general.** American officials found out that Gen. Valery Gerasimov was planning a trip to the front lines, but withheld the information from the Ukrainians, worried that an attempt on his life could lead to a war between the United States and Russia. The Ukrainians learned of the trip anyway. After an internal debate, Washington took the extraordinary step of asking Ukraine to call off an attack — only to be told that the Ukrainians had already launched it. Dozens of Russian soldiers were said to have been killed. General Gerasimov wasn’t one of them.
>
>**A senior Russian official told the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, last month that Russia would not give up, no matter how many of its soldiers were killed or injured.** One NATO member is warning allies that Mr. Putin might accept the death or injury of as many as 300,000 Russian troops — roughly three times his estimated losses so far. Before the war, when Mr. Burns warned Russia not to invade Ukraine, another senior Russian official said Russia’s military was strong enough to stand up even to the Americans.
>
>**Days into the invasion, Mr. Putin told Israel’s leader that the Ukrainians had turned out to be “tougher than I was told.”** But, he warned the leader, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, “we are a big country and we have patience.” Earlier, in October 2021, during his first meeting with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Putin had railed against President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine: “What kind of Jew is he? He’s an enabler of Nazism.”
>
>**Invading Russian soldiers used their cellphones to call home, enabling the Ukrainian military to find and kill them.** Phone intercepts obtained by The Times showed the bitterness Russian soldiers felt toward their own commanders. “They’re preparing you to be cannon fodder,” one soldier said. Another described a commander warning him he could be prosecuted for leaving his position, only for the commander to flee when shelling began. “His wheels didn’t even get stuck in the mud,” the soldier said.
>
>**The day of the invasion, Mr. Putin set a trap for Russian business tycoons, putting them on television “to tar everyone there,” as one of them described it.** Indeed, the businessmen present were all hit by Western sanctions in the months that followed. Even so, another billionaire at the Kremlin that day, Andrey Melnichenko, was defiant, insisting sanctions would not make him turn against Mr. Putin. “In textbooks, they call this political terrorism,” he said.
>
>**Mr. Putin’s fractured armies have sometimes turned on each other; one soldier said a tank commander deliberately fired on a Russian checkpoint.** Mr. Putin divided his forces into fiefs, some led by people who are not even part of the military, such as his former bodyguard, the leader of Chechnya and a mercenary boss who has provided catering for Kremlin events, Yevgeny Prigozhin. In an interview after being captured by Ukraine, one Russian soldier said he had been in prison for murder when Mr. Prigozhin recruited him. Later, after he was returned to Russia in a prisoner swap, a video emerged of his execution by sledgehammer.

- 85% of missiles are shot down, which are millions of dollars, each—amassing billions that are wasted.

- One reason they’ve moved to energy (rather than, for example, hitting air defense) is Russia often can’t find Ukraine’s well-camouflaged military targets.  

- cheap drones can not *actually* fully destroy the Ukrainian power grid.  Multiple missiles could largely damage, but Russia doesn’t have enough.

> > Here’s the thing: The Ukrainian power grid was built back in Soviet times to survive a thermonuclear war; it’s incredibly redundant and well-protected. There’s no way a non-nuclear warhead will blow the concrete casing that shields the generating facilities. Transformers are much softer targets, and Soviet engineers knew that as well. They couldn’t shield the transformers, so they put them as far apart as possible. A Soviet substation invariably occupies a much bigger space than its U.S. counterpart; every piece stands apart from the other, with incredible redundancy built into the system and capacities for rerouting.

> > A cheap Iranian Shaheed-136 drone will hardly kill a transformer. More likely, it will damage the coolant system, which will be fixed in a day or two. A missile can do the job, but it’s unlikely it will severely damage more than two, which cost anywhere from $3 million to $8 million apiece. An X-101 missile costs $13 million, an X-555 $7.5 million, a Kalibr $6.5 million. But the biggest problem for Russia isn’t the price of the missiles: It’s their replacement — it takes up to nine months to deliver one.

- the analyst gives an accounting of each class of missiles remaining, and the bottleneck production issues, leading to conclude that destroying a power grid built to withstand nuclear war is another failed mission",False,1671301635.0,t3_znxlsa,t1_j0lv745,,1,39,0,39,0,0,

It is takes a massive amount of time and money to train an Air Force. Russia just hasn’t done that. Air Force operations, especially combined arms ones, are incredibly complex endeavors and Russia just hasn’t prepared for an opponent like Ukraine. Recon, targeting, communication, SEAD, BDA, logistics like air to air refueling, pilot rest, maintenance, etc. It’s beyond complicated. Syria gave them a false sense of security that they could scale up. They couldn’t. Ukraine is an entirely different animal than bombing civilians in Syria. They don’t have adequate stand off precision weapons to pound from a distance and they don’t have trained Weasels to do any kind of SEAD so they can get in close. It’s an absolute failure at every level. The Ukrainian Air Force  is also proving to a very agile and competent opponent who are VERY motivated.

And maybe Russia just hasn’t been able to execute to their doctrine, but I don’t think the US Air Force would be in a similar situation.  The US focuses on establishing air superiority as a very very high priority primary first goal and is intensely interested in SEAD (suppression of enemy air defense).
  
If you haven’t seen it, there’s a really good video from The Operations Room about how the US-lead coalition started Desert Storm here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRgfBXn6Mg   Iraq (at the time) was seen as having top notch air defense and a lot of time, planning, and effort was put into neutralizing them so that the coalition could have air superiority when the ground troops moved in.  
  
So I think that differences in the up-front planning and different choices how to start the war (Russia was moving in ground troops immediately) would mean US would not find themselves in the situation that Russia is in now.  Russia might have done what they did because they wanted a 3 day war and a really fast resolution, but I would not see US doctrine supporting the initial choices Russia made.",False,1671310364.0,t3_znxlsa,t1_j0m9nf9,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Under the current conditions, sure. But that's the point of their strategy: to wait as long as needed for western support for Ukraine to wane. They will try to foster political discontent in Europe through energy warfare and the threat of nuclear armageddon to diminish enthusiasm for helping Ukraine. They'll give money and support to far-right populists that will promote ""own people first"" narrative. They'll use psy-op campaigns through social media to influence the public opinion. They'll try to overwhelm Europe with Ukranian refugees to lower support and morale. They'll keep throwing bodies at the front so that war will appear static and that there is no hope for a Ukrainian victory, and therefore any cost incurred by Western audiences is not ""worth"" it anymore. Maybe they'll get lucky and there is a significant economic downturn. 

The point is, they will try to turn and twist as many knobs and buttons of influence and control they have to change the current conditions. As it stands now, their strategy is not working. But skip ahead a year - if there are no significant Ukrainian victories and energy costs will remain as high as they are - things might be different. Hell, as it seems now in a month or two it may be the Russians taking back the initiative with a new attack. Likely though it will fail - it will create the temporary effect of Ukraine being on the backfoot. 

But I don't think they'll succeed either. However this strategy is probably their best shot, and we shouldn't idly dismiss it.",False,1671317026.0,t3_znxlsa,t1_j0n0ou1,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

137967bc9b2b9d3a964837176e53c762,znxlsa,j0kojvi,"Well the mobilisation system isn't perfect - there are intricacies and loopholes that allow some things be done. Until you pay a visit to military center and sign the papers - you aren't a soldier. And they have to personally hand it to you.  That's why you do not open the door to strangers. In case if you aren't at home - they put it in your [P.O.Box](https://P.O.Box). You open the box and throw it away - if somebody asks, you tell them ""iunno never received the paper"". This will lead to a fine and give you a month or two before they start knocking on your door again. I am not sure how many times one can do it, as repeat offenders will get bigger fines and end up in jail eventually.

The  second option one has is to move to a different flat - because they have to send the papers to a place you are registered at. You are supposed to change registration if you move to a different city, but it is not imposed at all, and it's completely ok if you move to a different place within the city.

This is one of the reasons why Moscow didn't have as sucessful mobilisation as other cities and towns.  We have more than 20 million people living and working here - I dare say that more than half of them do not have a registration (as they are not from Moscow initially) and just rent apartments which more often than not is done p2p with no mediator company. It's that hard for a military center to track down a single person especially if he did not update his data.

That's why government gave the police a job to pick people off the streets and hand them the invitation letters. A lot of men are simply too afraid of a cop so they stop when asked to. That's where the officer asks them for their passport, writes their name in his tablet and gives them a blank invitation letter. He then says something along  the line of ""you have to go to military center for a check up"". Even at this point you could technically just throw the letter away fully expecting a fine and that's it.

Of course, if government really wants your ass - the only way out is either running to the hills or self-harming with a potential lethality. And if you have visited the military center and ""awaiting on their decision"" - it's too late, running away at this point is breaking the criminal law - the punishment would be up to 8 years behind the bars, which easily can be extended to 10 or 15 or even more, if they find that you somehow ""ignored previous calls"", ""spread fake news"" and so on.

Edit: In terms of how a person can be generally safe from mobilisation -- there are several conscription categories - let's call them ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" and ""D"" (and temporary ""E"") which seem to also work in case of mobilisation. Despite what Western media says, government really does try to mobilize people mostly from ""A"" category as those are the ones with experience and have served in the army. That doesn't stop some military centers from sending invitation letters to literally everyone in hopes that those men will come in - they will pick the ones that suit the needs out of them.

In that sense, those guys that  have managed to completely avoid conscription in the past and have never visited a military center (or visited it long time ago) are safe, since military doesn't have papers on them in database. Then we have the ""D"" category - which is given to anyone that has a physical or mental condition that restricts their abilities significantly enough to make them not viable for the army. I am in ""C"" category - which is for people that have some sort of medical condition, did not serve and aren't suitable to be called up in current events, but are eligible to be drafted in case of an officially proclaimed war.",1671278889.0,1671275071.0,t3_znxlsa,t1_j0kiz93,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

The only figure known for sure where it comes from is the ""cost"" of a ""Kalibr"" cruise missile – 6.5 million US dollars per unit.

Since post-2011 (when they made the final decision to pull out of nuclear after Fukushima), Germany has shut down only around 8.4GW of nuclear. They shut down another 8.4GW as a direct response a month after Fukushima in 2011, but those were all built in the 70s and would be EoL and off the grid by now either way. What happens if you do lifetime extensions on 70s era NPPs b/c your grid relies on it is basically 'France 2022, A Field Study'.

Just **this morning**, [Germany was exporting 9GW to France alone](https://www.rte-france.com/en/eco2mix/cross-border-electricity-trading#). Right now at 01:00 when France should normally be exporting out of their ass, they're still importing 5GW from DE. Even if they hadn't shut down the plants that would still be before their EoL today, they'd still have had to spin up gas/coal to prevent a French grid collapse.

edit: just for comparison, end-of-2021, Germany had 122GW of renewable capacity installed, which produced an average 26GW over the year (this fluctuates obv., at times powering >100% of the grid). The 8.4GW more or less from the post-Fukushima NPPs wouldn't make the difference.

>if Germany hadn’t shut down their nuclear plants that wouldn’t be necessary.
