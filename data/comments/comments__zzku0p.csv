5cedcd2d5241aab6ae7e3cfffe0e5293,zzku0p,j2cl71i,"Sorta. Geopolitics in this situation here is tricky though. Let me try and explain the Turkish perspective on this:

1. The Turkish perspective	on this is that they’ve been trying - and failing - to be part of the European community themselves since 1959 with the European Economic Community and since 1999 with the EU. They have seen poorer countries with equal or worse (at the time) governance get in while their own application keeps dragging on and on. Top ‘liberal’ countries like France, Holland, and Austria have pretty directly said ‘over my dead body’ with respect to Turkey becoming a part of the EU, sometimes in not so veiled xenophobic remarks. It can seem at times, especially from Turkey’s perspective, that Turkey’s main historical problem with getting into the EU has nothing to do with reforms and more to do with the fact that some former colonial powers are uncomfortable letting a country of 80 million Muslims into their club.

2. Anti-Turkish sentiments and racism is pretty high in *a lot* of Europe to this day, including again ‘liberal’ democracies like Germany, which has a huge Turkish population. This doesn’t make the Turks feel like they should do favors for Europeans every time they ask for it. The Turks can feel that while Europe needs them and their big army (the 2nd largest in NATO iirc + at a time pre-Ukraine when a lot of European countries weren’t really investing in defense), it scoffs down at them otherwise, in general racism, visa issues for Turks into Schengen, and the forever-stalled-maybe-because-you-are-Muslim EU accession process.

3. Depending on how you lean politically, the clash between ethnic Kurds and Turks in and around Turkey is a big problem. Some believe the Kurds deserve a state, partially carved out of Turkey (as well as Iran, Syria, and Iraq), and some think that’s unfair to take land away from a country when other countries have notable minorities. Separate to the Kurdish nationalism issue is an issue of potential terrorism. Now, an armed group of Kurdish nationalists that has plotted terrorist attacks against civilians called the PKK is officially designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey + the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand…yet some members of the EU sorta look the other way and allow them to set up shop, raise/wave PKK flags at rallies, and sometimes even see PKK-affiliated or PKK-sympathizing politicians run for and enter parliament. These countries include places like France and…Sweden, which has a big Kurdish minority.

So every time they get some power over these powers that they feel discriminate against them…the Turks sometimes over do it. Fwiw, I’m not Turkish but I am from the Middle East and a general student of history so thought I would offer some perspective on this point. The Turks are in a weird place with the Russian/Ukrainian conflict in that they still have excellent relations with both. Turkish drones and facilitating agricultural exports have helped the Ukrainians tremendously, while Erdogan is still seen by Putin as one of the few leaders he trusts to be impartial (he just sent him an end-of-year note, one of the few world leaders who has gotten that)…

Anyways, I’m not saying you’re wrong in your original thought. It is depressing, but it’s a lot more complicated than it may seem at first glance and both sides here imho have stories that are valid.",False,1672467386.0,t3_zzku0p,t1_j2cdxjl,,1,28,0,28,1,0,

He thought it was going to go like the Soviets sending tanks to stop the Prague Spring in 1968, or like the occupation of Crimea in 2014 where there was comparatively little fighting, and everyone was so impressed by the show of strength that they just didn't resist. Russia evidently didn't do much in the way of real preparation for a sustained war of conquest, and it shows. They *still* don't have anything remotely resembling air superiority.

Without getting into a massive discussion about media bias, see if you can reach a middle ground with them about some facts being present. Then use the facts you can agree on to demonstrate a trend.

A good one is territory changes have trended towards Ukraine since around June.

Maybe try and discuss that in terms of momentum? When Russia has gained ground in the last 6 months, it has been small, incremental, whereas Ukraine has liberated large areas...

Another one is the sorts of equipment seen in use by Russians is getting older and older (tanks), missile strikes more infrequent, rates of shelling (artillery) are far less too.

Unfortunately when someone refuses to believe a news outlet or even a bunch because 'biased' - there's not a lot you can do if they don't want to see the truth for themselves.

It takes a lot of effort to debunk such things, particularly because any mistake media makes will be seen as confirmation of their bias or misreporting, despite most being mostly factual until you read the lines and articles that are subjective.

I think the key things here to remember are what Ukraine stated it would do in the back half of 2022 and what it achieved...

It stated it would retake Kherson and conduct offensive operations.

It liberated Kherson, Izyum, Lyman and pushed those battlelines further, clearing to the border in Kharkiv region. So it told the truth, although timelines were a bit less accurate but that's understandable as conditions change.

For 2023 they have been talking up Crimea, they've not offered much in way of timelines. They've also stated there would be a winter offensive, so we need to keep an eye on things in Jan-Feb. With the weather as it is, likely late Jan (they need the ground to freeze).

Major shifts in battle lines are more likely in late Jan and Feb, and again in summer as Spring/Autumn are wet and boggy. This doesn't mean nothing will happen, it just becomes less likely.

On logic I would expect something south to Melitopol where they have been conducting shaping operations. There is also a chance of a few more advances in the East but these are more likely to be grinding affairs with small scale encirclements but there is a good chance of some success depending on their force elements involved.

**How does Ukraine fight offensively and how does that influence predictions?**

Ukraine uses mobility to encircle the enemy and force surrenders/casualties.

They use precision munitions to target logistics, supply and C3 locations to degrade the enemy's ability to coordinate and fight.

Ukraine is patient but they take opportunities where they arise and are not afraid to do so aggressively. Izyum offensive is a good example.

They use information and official messaging, truthful and somewhat deceptive to confuse Russia. Kherson is a primary example of this.

So while I'm always willing to engage in a healthy level of scepticism, the facts as they are would lend me to believe that Ukraine will gain some significant ground somewhere. And once you break the Melitopol-Mariupol area, Crimea is cut off, so it's not hard to see how they think they can liberate Crimea in 2023.

This is strategically a good idea, we'll see if it's deception or not but I think we'll see something on that axis in the next 3-6 months at most, but that timeline is just a guess.",False,1672464459.0,t3_zzku0p,t1_j2cczgw,,3,16,0,16,0,0,

The Russian economy would have to stabilize, but it is instead rapidly worsening and that's expected to continue throughout next year.  It's a result of losing a large percentage of its workforce in key sectors, such as tech support, higher education, and tourism, in addition to downsizing in staff and production for transportation, electronics, and other industries dependent on parts and raw materials they can no longer acquire under sanctions.  Nor can it create money through investment; people can't even access their savings in many cases.    

Another is Ukraine's economy would have to fail, but every financial ally they have has instead doubled or tripled support since the start of winter.  Projections that the Ukrainian economy would shrink by 50% in 2022 have been re-evaluated at 30-35%.  Its workforce is returning, its grain is getting shipped out.  It is in worse shape than Russia's and can't access much of the steel and lumber industry being that those regions are under occupation, but there's less of a disparity now than at any other point in the year.  

Another is Russia would have to secure ammunition and replacement equipment as fast as these things are being expended.

As for ""half a degree"", the effect is much larger. Ski resorts are closing for good all over Europe because the snow is gone. They have been trying with artifical snow for some time but that is getting silly, and too expensive.

A half degree increase in temperature won't have a perceptible effect on local weather. Especially considering the temperature variations throughout a 24-hour period. The effect of that temperature's increase on climate is too complex to perceive intuitively.

One of the predictions of climate change is weakening of air currents like the Jet Stream. An weaker / unstable Jet Stream leads to more arctic air masses flowing south. Thus you get these cold snaps and record cold events. People feel colder and it's doesn't make sense if the planet is supposed to be warming up.

Another prediction that isn't intuitive is water vapor. The atmosphere is slightly warmer, so it can now hold slightly more water, which is nice because water is slightly warmer as well and evaporates at a slightly faster rate. It's one thing if it's your glass of water, but something entirely different on a planetary scale. The atmosphere can now hold more water so rain events can become more severe, there are more droughts, river levels run low, etc.

That leads to the wildfires like you pointed out, habitats will change as drought kills vegetation making large areas inhospitable, etc. If the changes are slow enough, over time, life can adapt gracefully and be prosperous. As it stands, though it seems slow to us, the changes are happening rapidly in a geological timescale.

“Nothing comes for free in life. You have to fight«  
As mayor, he has been guiding Kyiv through the war for ten months. Vitali Klitschko on the real heroes during the siege of his city, Zelensky's weakness in leadership and the Ukrainians' commitment to freedom in Europe

The winter sun shines on Kreschatyk Boulevard near Maidan Square. Kiev citizens rush along the sidewalk, the streets are crowded. It's the week before Christmas. A few days earlier there had been another heavy air raid. A few days after the conversation there will be another violent explosion in Kyiv.  
Vitali Klitschko , 51, has been mayor of the Ukrainian capital for eight years. His workplace is on the eighth floor of a magnificent Stalinist building in the style of a confectioner. His assistant invites him into the office, the boss will be there shortly. It is a room full of memories: historical cityscapes, models of construction projects, Cossack statues, autographed photos. Klitschko the boxer and Klitschko the politician, this is where they come together.  
Vitali Klitschko

The mayor rushes in. He is wearing his usual war outfit: olive-green cargo trousers and a jacket of the same color, with the coats of arms of the country, the city and a Kiev combat unit on the sleeves, which are now fighting in Bakhmut in what is currently the heaviest battle in Donbass.  
The situation in Kiev is also precarious. Russia keeps firing missiles and drones at the infrastructure. Whole districts are without electricity for days, some without heating, without water. The mayor looks tired, but at the same time fit and trained. He sits down in the middle of the conference table. Firm handshake, body bent forward, challenging gaze.  
SPIEGEL: Mr. Klitschko, you look back on a year in which the existence of your city was at stake. Kyiv is still being bombed. Do you even remember what mood you had going into 2022?  
Vitali Klitschko: We were doing well financially. The corona virus had slowed us down, but we had higher income again than in the previous year, and there was full employment. That's why I was very optimistic about the future of the city. As for foreign policy tensions, many Western and Ukrainian experts have already warned of a possible Russian attack. A huge number of Russian soldiers have been conducting maneuvers on our border. That's why I drummed for civil defense, saying that we have to prepare. But the central government had said everything would be fine, there would be no war. I was criticized for not fomenting panic. I said: don't panic, we have to be ready. Yetnobody could imagine that the Russians would march on Kyiv.  
Vitali Klitschko seems focused. Before some sentences he takes a deep breath and exhales loudly. Think for a few seconds, try to find the right German words. Klitschko is right: while he was warning of Russian troops at the border a year ago, Volodymyr Zelenskyy downplayed the danger at the time.

Afghanistan is a landlocked, mountainous country which has natural productivity advantage only in opium production, which is a highly regulated market.  Thus, the vast majority of Afghanistan's economy is agriculture, with something like ~70% of all employment being in agriculture.  However, due to the fact that it is landlocked, the lack of navigable rivers, and the mountainous terrain making roads expensive to build and  maintain, it is very expensive for Afghans to bring produce to market.  This is why Afghanistan's biggest (legal) export is actually rugs, despite agriculture being its biggest sector.  This, in turn, means that agricultural products are largely consumed domestically (and even locally).  This also means that markets do not scale and are very localized which in turn leads to warlordism (which further leads to increased prices to transport goods).

Klitschko: Now is not the time to look for someone to blame. After the win we can analyze everything, identify the mistakes.  
SPIEGEL: President Zelensky recently criticized you for not setting up enough heating points, that is, central collection points with internet, electricity and heating for the freezing population, by the Kiev city administration.  
Klitschko: We have more heat points in Kiev than any other oblast, namely a total of 500. We found generators for them without any support from the government. Zelensky's criticism was a mistake. If our citizens or our partners abroad see that we are looking for enemies at home, it is counterproductive. There is currently only one flag and it is blue and yellow.

SPIEGEL: How do you rate President Zelensky's performance in this war?  
Klitschko: He has an important function as president. We must do everything we can to support him. But nobody is perfect. It is important not to make mistakes during this difficult time. It's not the time for political games. Unity is the key to victory.  
The relationship between Klitschko and Selenskij was already strained before the war. As a comedian, today's head of state made fun of the mayor of Kiev as a dumb idiot in his television show. Later, the president's team tried to limit the office of the mayor of Kiev to representative tasks. Rumors were spread from around Selenskij that Klitschko was corrupt. Most recently, in one of his daily evening speeches, the president criticized the mayor for allegedly lacking care for the citizens of Kiev.  
SPIEGEL : Was there a turning point in the defense of Kiev for you - a moment when you knew that the Russians would not take the city?  
»Size and strength are irrelevant, the decisive factor is the will to win«  
Klitschko:I knew it wouldn't be easy for the Russians. There were a few situations that I barely survived. Someday I want to write a book. I have so much to tell. For example, I met a man, a botanist with glasses, who had balls of steel. He immediately grabbed a gun to fight. A little man with a big heart. Before the war I saw many machos who acted strong and courageous, but then they just disappeared. As an individual athlete, I know that size and strength don't matter, what matters is the will to win. The will of most people in our city is madness. People didn't ask me for help to escape, they asked for weapons. When it comes to defending our families and our children, we stand ready to give our lives. That's why I'm convinced that we'll win.  
Klitschko smiles and shakes his head as if he still can't believe what happened ten months ago. His iPhone is on the conference table in front of him. Messages pop up on the display every few seconds. But he stays focused on the conversation, telling anecdotes from the first days of the war.  
In the first week of March, a Russian missile landed in the Obolon district. The house looked like a burning candle. I came there shortly after and met many concerned people. Only one older man seemed really euphoric. He said to me: ""Mr. Mayor, do you see the hole? That was my apartment. God told me to go outside - two minutes before impact. I'm homeless now, but I'm happy.« I offered to help him drive him to western Ukraine, abroad. But he said this is his city. He wants to stay, he needs weapons. When we handed out weapons at the beginning of the war, at three o'clock in the morning we had a kilometer-long queue. It was freezing cold, windy, snowing, but there were men and women there who wanted to fight. I am proud to be Ukrainian.  
SPIEGEL: For months now, Russian drones and rockets have repeatedly fired at Kiev. Putin's goal is the destruction of critical infrastructure. Electricity, water and heating...  
Klitschko: … I would like to jump right in here: what the Russians are doing is terrorism, genocide. They also target transformers, thermal power stations. Because Putin is unsuccessful at the front, he wants to destroy the lives of ordinary people. He wants women, children, old people to die. Imagine the temperatures in Kyiv: Now it's often below zero, then it goes to minus ten, minus 20, sometimes minus 30 degrees. Without electricity and heating, the apartments will no longer be usable. Putin's goal is panic so that everyone is evacuated abroad. Ukraine as a territory without Ukrainians.  
SPIEGEL: Do you know how many people are still in the city?  
Klitschko: Yes, we count how many cell phones are in use. Before the war there were 3.8 million people here, in March less than a million, in July two, two and a half million, now there are 3.6 million. 300,000 of them are registered refugees from other parts of the country. The city is full.

For Ukraine being on the side not killing civilians is kind of important because the moment they start, and attacking the power grid does that, they will almost certainly start losing the western weaponry that is the key to their success and gain nothing.  

Now I know you are trying to make the argument that attacking the power grid and causing civilians to freeze is not a war crime but the problem is the West, and Ukraine, have the spent about 2 months arguing it is.  To suddenly go ""well its not a war crime when we do it"" is not going to hold water and again it will not gain them anything.  They are not going to suddenly flip their entire argument overnight and Ukraine is not about to try for no real gain.

There simply is not a gain to doing so.  Ukraine is winning right now.  You are missing the only strategy Russia has right now and your idea actually helps it (and is the reason Russia has considered numerous ""false flag"" attacks that would do exact what you suggest).  That strategy being to try and use their superior numbers, in this case population, to try and just kill their way to victory so that even if they are 3-4x as many a superior population will overwhelm Ukraine in the end.

Klitschko: I check the situation umpteen times a day. Almost every apartment is supplied with water and heating again. The power supply deficit is 50 percent. Sometimes we switch off the electricity in one district to switch it on in another district and vice versa. The situation is difficult but under control.  
SPIEGEL: As mayor, how do you feel when the city is under attack, when drones are circling over Kiev and you can't do anything?  
Klitschko: Excuse me, but that's a stupid question. How am I supposed to feel? I'll keep my fingers crossed for our air defenses. And I want to say thank you: German air defense systems work very precisely. A hundred shots, a hundred hits. I would like to say thank you on behalf of our citizens for the weapons from Germany. Many ask me how many guns are enough: it won't be enough until this war is over. We need more support please.  
MIRROR: What do you need most urgently?  
Klitschko: It's like asking which specialist is the most important. Every area is important! But for the city of Kyiv, the most important thing right now is air defense.  
SPIEGEL: Chief of Staff Valeriy Saluschnyi recently said that he was expecting a renewed Russian advance on Kiev from Belarus . Do you share this concern?  
Klitschko: Saluschnyj certainly has more information. But we also get information from the military and various services. More than 50,000 Russian soldiers are currently stationed on our northern border. You're getting more and more technology now. We do not rule out another Russian attack.  


SPIEGEL: You've been under extreme pressure since the beginning of the war. Can you still find a balance to the burden?  
Klitschko: Yesterday I was asked if I had electricity in my apartment. I couldn't even answer that because I haven't been home for three days. Sometimes I sleep in the office, sometimes with friends. Wherever I am when night falls  
Klitschko changes the subject, he wants to speak again about the supply of the population. If its administration fails to repair infrastructure after Russian attacks, Kyiv will become uninhabitable.  
Everyone abroad should imagine what a blackout means: You get up in the morning and the light doesn't go on. They want to brush their teeth, wash their hands - no water. no shower No sewage. The toilet cannot be used. Neither does the heating. It gets cold. You want to call someone or complain - that's not possible either: no network. No Internet. The elevator doesn't work. The subway doesn't work. Her credit card doesn't work in the store. Two weeks ago we had exactly this case for twelve hours. Luckily it was only around zero degrees. When it gets really cold, we have to pump the water out of our heating system. If this is not successful, the pipes can burst. And people freeze to death.  
SPIEGEL: In Germany you are still known as a boxing champ. Do you still come to sports?  
Klitschko exhales particularly loudly. Thinks about it, makes a face as if he's a little ashamed of what he then says.  
Klitschko: The only thing left for me to relieve stress is my training. If I have an hour early in the morning, I go to the studio to sweat. Alcohol and drugs are not my world. Sport is the only thing I can still enjoy. I am just a human.  
SPIEGEL: As a boxer, weight was a constant concern for you for years. Do you remember what you weigh today?

My point is this. They're  hitting Ukraine hard. ATACMS should be the response. I believe that at this point the Russian military are taking into full account how far (to the meter) the current HIMARS can travel. It's time to change that. 

That whole ""we'll supply you himars but you cannot use them on Russia proper"" thing should be tossed out the window, given the current civilian situation in Ukraine.
