Part of an article titled ""War makes it easier to cover up failures in economy, Putin must go"": ""Putin bears full responsibility for this irrational and bloody war. He has turned into a dictator who believes in conspiracy theories and lost touch with reality. Vladimir Putin must immediately stop the war and resign. Neither Russia, nor Putin, nor anyone else has the right to decide for another nation. The problem is not who will replace Putin, but that the Russians are not ready to take responsibility for this choice. National reflection is an inevitability for Russia, but by the citizens themselves, this time no one will make a decision for them. Do not be afraid! Resist! You are not alone, we are many! **** war, peace for Ukraine!"" The journalists included their full names and wrote ""We are looking for a job, lawyers and, probably, political asylum!""

Day 75 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Those past couple of days have been very quiet. Yesterday our city has only been shelled once. What place did they shell this time? Sokil’nyky district, that’s where our WW2 memorial is at. Of course they would shell a WW2 memorial on May 8th, that’s very much like them.

Today another 4 settlements were confirmed to be liberated, and not even by our regular army but by TDF, which is even more impressive. After recent counteroffensives the frequency of shelling has decreased immensely. If in the first months we were being shelled anywhere from 50 to 100 times per day, now we are being shelled less than 5 times per day, I’m pretty sure today we weren’t shelled even once.

We got so used to constant shelling that at this point it feels weird when we are not being shelled. It does feel good, but the tension didn’t go anywhere, we still expect shelling at any moment and probably won’t be able to properly relax until the war ends.

Though just yesterday people were partying and singing in front of our apartment building, feels pretty good seeing that people can still have fun even during the war. It almost feels normal, but there’s way less people on the streets, especially in the evening. Also, our own artillery constantly reminds us that the war is not over yet and we cannot stop being on guard.

Also that Russian victory parade was so uneventful. But Putin putting the flowers on Odesa memorial and then firing another 10 missiles at the city itself is just infuriating. What the fuck are they even targeting? Why the hell are they destroying hotels and shopping malls? They won’t even be able to attack Odesa anytime soon, if ever, but they still continue to fire missiles at it every day.",False,1652140363.0,t3_uliq6w,t3_uliq6w,,0,127,0,127,3,0,

>**On May 11, the Finnish parliament’s foreign affairs committee is expected to start drafting a short report** for the plenary on the numerous hearings it has held since Helsinki completed a security white paper in April. That white paper contained no concrete recommendation on joining NATO but described the changing security environment in Europe since February.  
>  
>Two days later, on **May 13, Stockholm is expected to publish a Swedish security report in its effort to catch up with its Nordic neighbor to the east.**

>On **May 14, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin's Social Democratic Party, the largest group in parliament, is expected to establish its position on NATO membership. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrats should do the same a day later.** Both leaders are believed to prefer membership for their respective countries, but both of their parties have, at least historically, been lukewarm on joining NATO.  
>  
>Then there's **May 17-18, when Finland’s largely ceremonial but highly influential President Sauli Niinisto travels to Sweden on an official visit.** He is also believed to favor NATO membership and has noted that “Finland’s course will be clear by the time of the visit."" So don’t rule out some sort of official joint proclamation in Stockholm during the visit.  
>  
>  
>  
>**Then there is the NATO summit in Madrid on June 28-30. NATO officials have indicated that the accession protocols for Finland and Sweden could be signed** at that time if the formal applications landed on NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s desk by the end of May.

Firstly, there will be a collective sigh of relief in much of the world that Putin did not, as was feared, use this to escalate the war in Ukraine in some form.



His speech, while wrapping that conflict in the patriotic mantle of the Great Patriotic War (World War Two), did not dwell on Russian victories in Ukraine because there have hardly been any.



Secondly, there is a glaring disconnect between the impressive and well-choreographed parade in Red Square and the reality on the battlefield in Ukraine, where Russia’s shambolic campaign is struggling to defeat a much smaller enemy.""

The decision raised eyebrows among foreign military analysts watching Moscow's Victory Day parade on Monday. The parade had been expected to feature 77 aircraft flying over the capital's Red Square, including eight MiG-29 fighters flying in a “Z” formation to show support for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow's air show was canceled due to weather conditions, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. Aviation shows were also canceled in Samara, Kaliningrad, and Murmansk, TASS wrote. 

Sounds unbelievable. It seemed sunny on what I saw. The only excuse would be strong crosswinds at the air bases the aircraft were coming from,"" Peter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Australian air force officer, told CNN.

d43cdfed8697e5ab7fc2503ae16a2ac0,uliq6w,i7zwcib,"It is “highly likely” that Finland will apply for membership in NATO, said the Finnish minister for European affairs.

Speaking to CNN on Monday, Tytti Tuppurainen said the decision has not yet been made, but called the nation’s likely membership “a very natural response” to Russia’s war in Ukraine. She added that if her country does indeed apply, she hopes “the ratification process would be as brief as possible.”

“We would, of course, prefer to have a neighborhood that would have been founded on friendship and cooperation,” she said. “But it is Russia that has distanced itself from the security order and it is Russia that has started war in Europe. It is Russia that has invaded in Ukraine. Now, people see this new reality and the time has come to join NATO.”
On Thursday, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö is expected to give his personal opinion about whether to pursue NATO membership, which is expected to be followed by a statement by Prime Minister Sanna Marin. 

Impending decision: Tuppurainen told CNN that most of the country’s political parties have already discussed the issue. The Social Democrats — Marin and Tuppurainen's party — will gather on Saturday to make their decision, which will be guided by Marin’s announcement.

“Now that the leader of the country is about to make the decision regarding the NATO application, we can say with good arguments that the whole country is ready for this,” Tuppurainen said, noting the strong public support in Finland for joining the defensive alliance.

Message to Moscow: Russia has warned it will respond if Finland – with which it shares a more than 800 mile border – joins NATO. 

The Kremlin does not dictate our decisions,” Tuppurainen told CNN, adding it would be “in the best interest of Russia to behave like an adult in this situation.”
“We've seen now what kind of a country Russia is and what kind of a regime it has. It has a ruthless dictator as leader,” she said. “We are no longer under any kind of illusions what he's up to ... and we know now that he can wage a war that is as despicable and ruthless and brutal as one can imagine.”

Finland has been a longtime partner of NATO, something that US and NATO officials have pointed to in voicing support for the nation’s membership if it chooses to apply.

Per the War in Ukraine youtube channel (which draws from both Ukrainian and Russian sources), the Russians appear to have fully taken the town of Rubizhne (directly to the NW of Severodonetsk) in the past few days, albeit after weeks of bloody fighting, and are pressing on the last village on that front between them and the city.

The also reported in their latest update (May 8) that the Russians appear to have taken the town of Popasna, to the south of Severodonetsk, again after weeks of bloody fighting, and are in artillery range to threaten the main (but not only) supply road into Severodonetsk. At the same time, the Russians attempted three pontoon bridge crossings of the river to the north of Severodonetsk; Russian sources are reporting two crossings were denied and one has established a foothold, although the channel can't confirm that.

Remains to be seen if the Russians can take advantage of these successes - we've seen at Izyum and in the Zaporizhzhia region that initially threatening Russian advances over the past few weeks have quickly lost steam.

I never fully believed one way or another about the May 9th general mobilization order (put it at 70 percent probability in my mind), but it's not insane that people thought it was going to happen.  It's not a Twitter hallucination, and I'm usually the first to blame Twitter for dumb rumors. 

Russian opinion media has been talking about it too, Igor Girkin, the former DNR guy, who's an evil but perfectly rational person, thought it was going to happen, there was that whole thing about job postings for mobilization experts (which I still wasn't able to fully understand but still), Russian social media users were talking about it, if anything Twitter was keying off of Russian sentiment for this one. 

Also, timeline wise and practically, there's some logic.  Analysis from a ton of people, including General Hertling, infers that Russian troops won't be able to maintain a full combat rotation without more backup in the next two months or so. Also the propaganda push internally would have been a boon for Putin.

Since it took some planning and measuring at the location ahead of time, the Ambassador, of course, became aware of them being up to something. He called the police on them, but the police determined their planned ""protest"" was legal, and gave them the green light.

Wittes' was then visited by the Secret Service, who also determined their plan was legal and harmless, and gave them an 'all clear'.

(For those who fancy such reading.)

(...)

*At the extremes, this kind of contempt can devolve into what the international democracy activist Srdja Popovic calls the “Maduro model” of governance, which may be what Lukashenko is preparing for in Belarus. Autocrats who adopt it are “willing to pay the price of becoming a totally failed country, to see their country enter the category of failed states,” accepting economic collapse, isolation, and mass poverty if that’s what it takes to stay in power.* 

*Assad has applied the Maduro model in Syria. And it seems to be what the Taliban leadership had in mind this summer when they occupied Kabul and immediately began arresting and murdering Afghan officials and civilians. Financial collapse was looming, but they didn’t care. As one Western official working in the region told the Financial Times, “They assume that any money that the west doesn’t give them will be replaced by China, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia.” And if the money doesn’t come, so what? Their goal is not a flourishing, prosperous Afghanistan, but an Afghanistan where they are in charge.*

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,uliq6w,i80ai14,"It is “highly likely” that Finland will apply for membership in NATO, said the Finnish minister for European affairs.

Speaking to CNN on Monday, Tytti Tuppurainen said the decision has not yet been made, but called the nation’s likely membership “a very natural response” to Russia’s war in Ukraine. She added that if her country does indeed apply, she hopes “the ratification process would be as brief as possible.”

“We would, of course, prefer to have a neighborhood that would have been founded on friendship and cooperation,” she said. “But it is Russia that has distanced itself from the security order and it is Russia that has started war in Europe. It is Russia that has invaded in Ukraine. Now, people see this new reality and the time has come to join NATO.”

On Thursday, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö is expected to give his personal opinion about whether to pursue NATO membership, which is expected to be followed by a statement by Prime Minister Sanna Marin. 

Impending decision: Tuppurainen told CNN that most of the country’s political parties have already discussed the issue. The Social Democrats — Marin and Tuppurainen's party — will gather on Saturday to make their decision, which will be guided by Marin’s announcement.

“Now that the leader of the country is about to make the decision regarding the NATO application, we can say with good arguments that the whole country is ready for this,” Tuppurainen said, noting the strong public support in Finland for joining the defensive alliance.

Message to Moscow: Russia has warned it will respond if Finland – with which it shares a more than 800 mile border – joins NATO. 

The Kremlin does not dictate our decisions,” Tuppurainen told CNN, adding it would be “in the best interest of Russia to behave like an adult in this situation.”

“We've seen now what kind of a country Russia is and what kind of a regime it has. It has a ruthless dictator as leader,” she said. “We are no longer under any kind of illusions what he's up to ... and we know now that he can wage a war that is as despicable and ruthless and brutal as one can imagine.”

The conflict is beginning to tilt from an unimaginable-two-months-ago stalemate in the East towards an outright Russian defeat, and the invaders are desperate.

(Yes, mobilization has its own huge set of challenges, not the least of which is sourcing components for anything-approaching-modern equipment.) Without another 250k-500k trained and equipped soldiers, RU is going to bleed until - like in Kyiv - their offensive collapses.

Setting aside my sharp couch-general military cap and donning my cozy couch-medium fortune telling headdress, I feel like a lack of mobilization pushes us towards a binary choice: either Putin falls from power (through a coup, or steps aside for threat of one) and the war ends, or Putin escalates the conflicts and maintains the RU presence in Ukraine through use of NBC weapons. I don't see Putin declaring 'victory' and abandoning the war as a likely outcome, and I don't see Ukraine acceding to any territorial loss which would make such a 'victory' palatable for Putin. Sometime before its military collapses, Russia must either create political space for a withdrawal - by removing the war's architect - or escalate by other means.

First, he doesn't care because I suspect he doesn't even regard many of those being killed as true Russians, or valuable Russians.

 >The Soviet invasion of Poland was a military operation by the Soviet Union without a formal declaration of war. On 17 September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, sixteen days after Germany invaded Poland from the west. Subsequent military operations lasted for the following 20 days and ended on 6 October 1939 with the two-way division and annexation of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. This division is sometimes called the Fourth Partition of Poland.

Nobody seems to be blaming you, nor was it an irrational prediction. Predictions are not prophecy. Let's review why the prediction of a Russian mobilization was reasonable. 

Putin's Russia in its current state cannot win this war. Their army is spread way too thin and their casualties have been far too severe. Ukraine may actually have a larger army now, and the constant influx of Western arms is turning this into an attrition cycle disfavoring Russia. 


General mobilization would have briefly alleviated some of these concerns and problems for Russia, and additionally would play into Putin's nostalgic worldview of WWII's total war, and a society responsive to his state's whims, not private bourgeois goals like living well, going to college, having a nice private sector job, etc.

He has an iron grip on Russia, through propaganda and his army of sycophants and yes-men. Plenty of cult of personality type leaders maintain their following despite countless blunders and failures. I truly don't think a failure in Ukraine would turn the tide against him, especially if he can blame it on NATO and the West.

Even if he fully withdrew I doubt he would be at much risk of losing his power. He has been grooming the nation to support him for over 2 decades. All he has to do is make up some propaganda spin ""victory"" and arrest any dissenters like he did with the war protesters early on.

In my personal opinion, given today's rhetoric and the general atmosphere of things recently, I think he is moving towards looking for a way out, not escalation. Today would have been the perfect opportunity for a ""fire and fury"" type speech if he really was dead set on doubling down.

The sooner he leaves the easier it will be for him to go back to status quo within Russia.

Him losing his position is still a lot more scary than the risks attached to mobilization. Sooner or later he will calculate that the risks of Russia losing the war are most concerning for his own position.

Yes, he didn't announce any mobilization today. But he never announces anything on these type of national festivities. So I am still expecting he will go that route at some point, can be days or weeks.

Ivan: The Chechens stole my ride home.

The next few years are critical on a world time scale, and, although I loathe to comment on it (or politics in general), it's not an inconceivable analysis that in the US & UK the right has finally had its Ukraine moment.  China basically got a ""don't even try it"" signal with Taiwan from this, which Xi tied his political fortunes to retaking (rather foolishly, since apart from an ancient grudge, it has no benefit to do so--he could have gotten a more meaningful victory by vocally and finally burying the hatchet instead).  NATO is...well, exploding in popularity, and SEATO may be more of a thing--disclaimer I'm not as knowledgeable on it as European politics, but it seems logical.  That basically opens the door to a world with greatly-reduced Russian influence and a near-unipolar Western order by the late 2020s.

2022 seems to be shaping up to be the year of authoritarian dictatorships having several options and choosing the worst one because *ideology > realpolitik*, and dooming themselves for years to come.  Imagine a world where this year started with Putin basically trading the donbass & security guarantees (even atomic ones) for a Russian special economic zone Crimea with all those troops on the border, China mass-vaccinating against omicron to end their lockdowns slowly & burying the hatchet with Taiwan like the Germanies did in the 70s, the US right tossing Trump under a bus to recapture some of the waffling center, and Tories admitting they failed with Brexit.",False,1652134994.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7z0lww,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I'm not so worried about it.  Ukraine is still well within the reaction curve of Russia, basically, it would takes months for Russia to train/retrain anyone it called up, and it's quite likely Russia wouldn't have the equipment to make them a formidable fighting force, in the end they'll be only a step above cannon fodder at most.  During that time, Ukraine will be getting even more western equipment and training while they take out what's left of Russia's experienced forces and filling out their own mobilization that began months ago.  


The other effect though, is that it will really bring home to war to Russians in a way that it hasn't yet.  That's a huge political risk given how badly the wars gone so far.  Who wants to go serve in a war that's gone this badly?  Even if they don't know it going in, as soon as they get near the front they'll get to learn of it first hand or from the survivors of previous efforts.  The debacle this war has been will then have even more channels to filter back to folks on the home front and further erodes Putin's support.

They wear them down, fall back to the next line, bleed them out as much as possible once again, etc. They have a lot of space to maneuver and conduct this sort of defense in depth strategy and the Russians have shown that they are not nimble enough to counter it effectively.

Ukraine is conducting counter offensives in the Kharkiv region (and rumor has it in the Zaporizhzhia oblast as well now). These are forcing Russia into a dilemma where they have to either slow/halt their offensive operations in the Donbas to shore up these areas or risk an eventual collapse along the line of contact.

Ukraine is continually attacking Russian logistics with a combination of highly mobile light infantry, UCAV's, artillery, and even sorties conducted by their air force. Without a steady flow of food, fuel, and ammunition Russian forces will slowly wither and collapse.

All of these things are keeping the Russians off balance and sapping their combat power.

The reporters that participate are not allowed to name the Defense official giving the briefings. Some of them, like Idrees Ali and couple of others (I think Detsch is one of them) are often on speaker phones. 

So, when you see these sources saying ""senior U.S. Defense official"", it is because the info is from one of these briefings and they are not allowed to name the source. I've noticed that Detsch often seems to be basically live-tweeting what he's hearing in the briefing, which is why sometimes it's a little inaccurate or confusing.

They post transcripts of these briefings on the DoD website. Here is one from May 4, 2022:

 >Europe Day is a day celebrating ""peace and unity in Europe"" celebrated on 5 May by the Council of Europe and on 9 May by the European Union. The first recognition of Europe Day was by the Council of Europe, introduced in 1964. The European Union later started to celebrate its own European Day in commemoration of the 1950 Schuman Declaration, leading it to be referred to by some as ""Schuman Day"" or ""Day of the united Europe"". Both days are celebrated by displaying the Flag of Europe.

I compared the claims of the Russian state-owned news site RIA Novosti for May 8th to those of what I'm assured is the Wagner Telegram channel for the same day. Sources for this are the Twitter accounts of [Nathan Ruser](https://www.aspi.org.au/bio/nathan-ruser), whose name you might recognize from the live feed, and [Christo Grozev](https://www.bellingcat.com/author/christo-grozev/), of Bellingcat fame. Both of these people, and commenters in their threads, claim the same Telegram channel as belonging to the Wagner mercenary group fighting in Ukraine, and reference the same *full-length* quote that confirms that the original helicopter claim was wrong.

Grozev and other osint sources have claimed that the Wagner postings are much more honest and factual about events in Ukraine, by comparing their statements to what they see on the ground, and by Wagner's willingness to freely criticize their employers.

There will be spaces you'll need to remove in the links I provide, as Reddit has blocked the .ru sites, and I'm not sure about the Telegram links.

So, on May 8, the RIA Novisti made the following claim:

>MOSCOW, May 8 - RIA Novosti. Russian operational-tactical and army aviation shot down three Mi-8 helicopters with landing troops and two Ukrainian aircraft - Su-24 and Su-27 near Zmeiny Island, Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said at a briefing.

>In addition, two unmanned aerial vehicles ""Bayraktar-TB2"" and a Ukrainian assault boat ""Stanislav"" were destroyed near the island.

https://ria. ru/20220508/zmeinyy-1787454736.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop

Also on May 8th, the Wagner channel posted this: (translated, and you can use Google Lens or a method of your choice to confirm the accuracy):

>A few compiled realities of the last days - Snake Island.
Yes, yes, this is the same island where part of the Marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine surrendered in the first days. And everything seemed to be going well, but in two months nothing has changed around the island we occupied. No separation has been created in the air defense, and the means of destruction of the enemy have not been suppressed. In just a few days, according to conservative estimates, the enemy destroyed the Mi-8 AMTSh (no, this is not a helicopter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine) with the crew and the special forces evacuation group (I hope those who were nearby are still alive), several air defense systems <<Tor-M2>> , two speedboats <<Raptor>>, launched missile and bomb strikes at the places of deployment and destroyed the supply of weapons from the sea.
>In fairness, our side destroyed one Su-27, Su-24 of the Ukrainian Air Force, as well as one to three Bayraktar TB 2 strike UAVs, but this is far from what we would like to see.
>Now, according to some unconfirmed reports, the island is still abandoned. Probably, under a beautiful phrase - for uselessness.

More precise predictions at this point would be foolish, however.  If Russia has far less of certain specific resources than we've been led to believe, it could end abruptly.  If they have more, or if they establish weapons trade with other countries, it'll take longer.  Between 2 and 8 months is the narrowest I'd put it.  

It also depends what phase or stage of the war they're in and in which region or regions.  Example:  if Russia enters a defensive position in the Donbas, they will have much greater need for artillery than for offensive units like tanks/apcs.  If otoh they keep doing offensives into Ukrainian territory, they will simply run out of those units faster.  They've used almost all the tanks and apcs they initially allocated to Ukraine (they have since gotten much more, but that amount is unknown), but still have most of their artillery.  So, in the first scenario, they can hold for many months easily; in the second, it would seem that could only go on a few more months.  But again, it depends what they've gotten into the country since those initial reports, and how much of their total military on paper is actually combat-effective.

I think this is also a shitty journalism take. Maybe it's true; maybe it isn't. I find it highly unlikely that given the energy crisis of the 1970's, that any deposits in that region were not found and exploited before about 20 years ago. 

Add to that: Russia - overall, probably was not super-happy about the post-Soviet Ukraine situation since 1991.  But were happy to manage it via bribery and extortion and ""managed democracy"".  

Russia was FINE with the situation up until about 1997; because up until then, they simply leased the port of Sevastopol as a military base from Ukraine. They probably earned back some multiple of that leasing cost just on the remote kleptocracy on the people of Ukraine, by fiat of their economic dominance. 

Then; in 1997, Ukraine voted to end the lease on Sevastopol; they gave Russia 20 years to GTFO. It was going to expire in 2017.  So Russia had to step up their political manipulation game. And that failed in 2014 with the Maiden protests, and their puppet getting kicked out.

This is why Putin attacked Ukraine.

If anybody can show me any PROOF of this claim that Ukraine has massive untapped energy reserves which were ""only discovered in 2010"" - - let me know. Because I have seen none, other than a few poorly written articles in the tabloid newsmedia. 

The shit with Ukraine's leasing of Sevastopol is real, and something that actually happened and easily provable, something that is of very long-term vital interest to Russia, (and has been for literally centuries). And mostly because this event flew under the radar of the popular media mindset of the West, because; boring policy details in faraway countries generally don't get as much coverage as made-up issues that fit popular narratives.

Was 1997 NATO's fault?  Not bloody likely.  Russia just slipped in their game; (likely due to economic fallout from their failed first war in Chechnya).",False,1652113650.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7xeqn1,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

They could also defend themselves in the air if need be.
At that speed and attack profile, it takes a high degree of skill just to get any bombs dead-on target. In this case, they appeared to do remarkably more than just that.

In a corrupt society, life tends to be (very) good for the minority that is part of the incrowd, but bad for the ones on the outside.

Every Javelin that takes out a Russian tank means there's one less Javelin needed because its target no longer exists. Same with the Stingers, their #1 target is Russian rotorcraft.

Any war with China would be over islands like Taiwan and so heavy tanks are unlikely to feature, and MANPADS will be less important than air-to-air missiles and direct air combat.

Just like WW2 where the US had *completely* different equipment in the European and Pacific theatres, the same applies here to the US strategies in Europe and against a hypothetical Chinese conflict. For context, Corsairs, Wildcats, and Hellcats were not used by the US in Europe (although the UK's Fleet Air Arm used theirs over Norway), and P-51s didn't see the Pacific until mid 1945 and the P-47 was highly unpopular there despite being a total darling in Europe and the Soviet Union, even influencing an entire generation of mid-war Soviet fighter-bombers and shaping already extant British designs like the Typhoon.

*We all grew up in a very different era, when we were focused on the threat from the Soviet Union. What's happening now is we are seeing problems from a variety of places, some of it due to globalization, frankly, which has an opposite side that has created a lot of nationalism in those countries or places where people feel lost within the facelessness of globalization...to put it mildly, the world is a mess.*

Over hundreds of years, they have solidified a national identity based on blind deference to authority, lying whenever it suits them, and stealing anything and everything if they think they can get away with it. They glorify raping and pillaging, demonize and denigrate anyone who isn't one of them, and cope with their miserable lives by drinking until the pain stops instead of taking meaningful steps to bettering their situation.

Their leaders rule through propaganda and intimidation because actual beneficial policy would cut into the amount of wealth they can squirrel away for themselves. The people know this subconsciously but are convinced there is nothing they can do to change it, so they don't even try.

START Treaty prohibited increasing the number of warheads attributed to ICBMs, so Russia claimed the RS-24 was a completely new ICBM to justify the designation SS-29 instead of SS-27 Mod 2, to circumvent treaty prohibition.

Regarding the Azov Regiment: It doesn't help that they still (or again) use clearly Nazi Insignia like the Black Sun and the Wolfsangel, which was also used by the 2nd SS Division ""Das Reich"". I literally had my fair share of brawls with Neonazis in my youth and they were wearing exactly these symbols. So there are some weird flashbacks everytime I see Azov-related posts on Twitter and the likes.

Just check the talk page and look at the users and IPs making changes over the years. Add on top of that the recent change in designation by the Japanese government stating they relied too much on public media reports.

 Azov regiment was started as a Paramilitary group, founded by a Ukrainian nationalist who has held some neo-Nazi beliefs, to fight Russians in Donbass and in particular liberate Mariupol. The founder left the Regiment to serve as an elected official and claims he's not anti-sematic nor has any hatred towards Japan. Over in that part of the world it's more about being anti-Russian and anti-Communist than anti-sematic.(Not trying to excuse the beliefs.) Anyways the Azov Regiment did so well against the Russians they were folded into the Ukrainian Armed Forces. A lot of the unsavory members were filtered out. Right now it probably contains just as many neo-Nazis as you would find in most Western Militaries. 

There's another group that operates with the Azov name that is made up of a lot of the old ultra-nationalists that were weeded out. That group actually acts as a hate group. ETA: This group does not have any ties to the current Azov regiment or the Ukrainian government.

In such a situation the Russians won't have much reason to grant big concessions beyond maybe withdrawing from the Donbas, and even that might be a reach depending on the situation on the ground. If we're looking at a stalemate just with the Russians pushed back to pre-war borders, they probably aren't going to be willing to leave the LNR and DNR.

So if the West and Ukraine go into peace negotiations with expectations that Crimea will be returned and Russia will pay significant reparations, etc. it's unlikely those terms will actually be achieved.

 >Neam ""Nim"" Chimpsky (November 19, 1973 – March 10, 2000) was a chimpanzee and the subject of an extended study of animal language acquisition at Columbia University. The  project was led by Herbert S. Terrace with the linguistic analysis headed up by psycholinguist Thomas Bever. Within the context of a scientific study, Chimpsky was named as a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky, who posits that humans are ""wired"" to develop language. As part of a study intended to challenge Chomsky's thesis that only humans have language, beginning at two weeks old, Nim was raised by a family in a home environment by human surrogate parents.

The gas was going to be cheap, like in the US, and enough for the entire EU market for at least 10 years (considering a complete Russian embargo).

Look at the west response in the first 3 days: barely anything...just some sanctions. Only later on, when they saw Ukraine can hold up and deal a huge damage to the Russians, did they start giving them weapons. So yeah, I am pretty sure that if he had invaded only Donbass and maybe attack Odessa(but not really take it, or take with traitors like in Kherson), this would have drawn very little anger from the west (comparatively).

 >The blue-red proposed flag of the self-proclaimed confederation of Novorossiya (or New Russia) is a variant of the battle flag which was adopted on 24 May 2014, with the addition of the coat of arms. A white-yellow-black tricolor was presented on 13 August 2014 by Oleg Tsarev as a potential state flag. This resembled an upside-down Romanov flag, which was the national flag of the Russian Empire from 1858 to 1883. Novorossiya is an unrecognised confederation of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, claiming the territory of the respective Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

 >The century of humiliation, also known as the hundred years of national humiliation, is the term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China by Western powers and Japan from 1839 to 1949. The term arose in 1915, in the atmosphere of rising Chinese nationalism opposing the Twenty-One Demands made by the Japanese government and their acceptance by Yuan Shikai, with the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) and Chinese Communist Party both subsequently popularizing the characterization.

He may want to continue, but his personal wish can be stopped by reality. 

There are three main aspects to the Russian army failing to advance:

1- failure of human will. The soldiers becoming exhausted with the war simply refuse to advance. One person doing it can be subject to court martial but a group is much harder. It usually isn’t something as clearcut as telling a general to fuck off. Instead, infantry slow down. They take cover for longer than necessary (or even just refuse to advance from it). They leave camp then circle back. They retreat from enemy fire. The only thing that ends up firming the line is the risk of being routed; otherwise, human survival instinct rules the day. 

2- failure of production. If your troops lack food, fuel, or materiel support then they cannot advance or even defend themselves. This forces a retreat, because any group that doesn’t retreat risks annihilation. 

3- failure of manpower. If enough troops are taken out, the Russian line will be unable to support an advance. There just aren’t the people who can advance, so Ukraine repels any attack or successfully counter attacks.

 >The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich (German: 2. SS-Panzerdivision ""Das Reich"") or SS Division Das Reich was an elite division of the Waffen-SS of Nazi Germany during World War II, formed from the regiments of the SS-VT. The division served during the invasion of France and took part in several major battles on the Eastern Front, including in the Battle of Prokhorovka against the 5th Guards Tank Army at the Battle of Kursk. It was then transferred to the West and took part in the fighting in Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, ending the war in Hungary and Austria.
 
**[Black Sun (symbol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_\(symbol\))** 
 
 >The Black Sun (German: Schwarze Sonne) is a Nazi symbol, a type of sun wheel (German: Sonnenrad) employed in Nazi Germany and later by neo-Nazis. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sig runes, similar to the symbols employed by the SS in their logo. It first appeared in Nazi Germany as a design element in a castle at Wewelsburg remodeled and expanded by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, which he intended to be a center for the SS. Whether the design had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown.

They can't reach any of their objectives, is the point though. Mobilization isn't some magic button they can press that produces hundreds of thousands of useful soldiers. Mobilization requires infrastructure, supplies and training. Not just infantry training, but combined arms training which would take months if not years. This is time and resources that Russians simply do not have.

Additionally, if Russia was going to mobilize, for them it's ""the sooner the better"", as it's a process that will take months. The only reason Putin could have to ""wait"" for mobilization is to announce it today as to create symbolism that would resonate with the people. By not doing that, he's lost a valuable opportunity. If he announces it later, not only will he have wasted more precious time, but the resistance against it will be even higher. Already early reports are indicating that people in Russia are getting tired with the war, thinking it is taking too long, a general mobilization will make that feeling a lot worse.

So cold logic simply dictates that EVEN WITH the advantage he had today, it was still not worth it to call for a general mobilization, and logic also dictates that every day he waits will decrease the benefit of such a mobilization. So most likely, there will not be a mobilization at all.",False,1652095647.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7wm5ox,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

However, I'd like to offer a couple of thoughts that you might find encouraging (although I have no way to gauge how any of these things might apply to Bulgaria in particular - I'd welcome your thoughts on the matter, should you feel like offering them):

It's no secret that Russia has been expending considerable amounts of money funding far-right agitators up and down Europe (and elsewhere), particularly in the last couple of decades. Only to then - infuriatingly - turn around and call *us* ""Nazis"" while pointing to the very hate-groups they're financing. Well, that ability to throw around money is coming to an abrupt end, and soon. Considering:

* Sanctions really starting to bite, with all the knock-on effects that entails (and the long-term consequences of Russia's futile attempts to prop up the Ruble)
* The short/medium and long-term economic devastation that will be caused by the absolutely *massive* leaks of exfiltrated financial and governmental data perpetrated by private individuals and other organizations (which I shall, ahem, leave unnamed)
* The various hits against Russian infrastructure we've seen as of late, whether caused by sabotage, corruption or general vodka-fueled ineptitude. There have been many, but I'm particularly thinking of things like the Druzhba fuel depot, the GRES-2 power plant, the Perm Powder Plant, the Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant, the recent Dam failure - the list goes on
* The confiscation or freezing of large amounts of the wealth the Russian oligarchs have milked out of the already strained citizenry

Well... A lot of belts are about to be tightened considerably. Add to that the hardening of political and public will across practically any place that *isn't* Russia, China or India, which has driven the recent spate of actions against Russian 'diplomats', i.e. agitators, subversives, spies and infiltrators. My point is, Russia is loosing everything they've so carefully built up, along with the capability to finance rebuilding any of it. Let us see how long corrupt politicians elsewhere stay in Russia's pocket when it is empty. I doubt very many of them are true believers or actual idealists. Of course, then their corruption will presumably morph (China perhaps?), but at least it should expose their alignment with Russia for what it is.

As for the people who aren't getting paid with money, but rather with some rosy Soviet-era fantasy-land they can hanker to 'return to' (ignoring that it never existed in the first place), well... When the smoke clears and the dust settles in Ukraine and the US/EU start a new Marshall-style plan to rebuild Ukraine better, stronger and faster on general principles, we will soon see Ukraine made into a goddamn shining jewel on the hill. Let Russia sit in the miserable shit-hole their country is about to become (well, more of a shit-hole) and lust for what they could have had. And let everyone else bear witness to which model provides superior advantages to those living in it. Then let us see how long the Soviet fantasy will last.

The US started, before declaring war, supplying arms & humanitarian supplies to the allies since even though nobody outright knew how bad the nazis were, there was a distinct impression forming it wasn't good.  However, Japan's war with the US happened almost directly because of an oil embargo that was a direct response to the violence against civilians & general horribleness of how the Kwantung Army operated (remember, the Nanjing Massacre was in 1937, Pearl Harbor, 1941; the embargo expanded to oil in 1940).

Once WW2 kicked off the US offered dirt-cheap loans they didn't expect to be repaid, or just offered equipment for free, to all their allies.  *Most* of the USSR's truck & logistics fleet was US-built Studebakers, and the Soviets operated a surprising amount of M4 Shermans late in the war.  The US initially traded destroyer ships for overseas bases with Britain (this is known as the ""Destroyers for Bases"" deal), but when war started, they just started *giving* them ships.  Things that were paid by loan were often zero-interest and due in 25-50 *years*.  This policy continued into the 1960s for rebuilding Europe, and was limited to *Western* europe, which goes a long way to explaining the persistent ""20 year gap"" in development between East & West Europe.

The huge feeling of national pride that the US, which before WW2 had seen itself as a pretty isolationist and ""keep to yourself"" country with a small military but large industrial base, yet after it wound up with a massive army and a superpower that had immense ""soft"" diplomatic power, is part of why their country's followed the same pattern of evolution as a *lot* of similar countries that take that path--Athens when it won against the Persians, Rome after defeating Carthage, Britain after defeating Napoleon, etc.  A large industrial base, a surplus of self-confidence, and sometimes-misplaced pride, can lead to tragedy as fast as it can great things, after all; case in point: this war.",False,1652084012.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7w0u5k,,5,7,0,7,0,0,

The differences here mean that you can't just retrain the pilot to fly a different jet, because they're starting from close to scratch. In the case of some NATO jets, like the A-10C, the pilot's workload is so high that it can take multiple years just to achieve basic competency; this is probably true of the F-35.

\- Those ecosystem differences also make the F-35 incompatible with the rest of the Ukrainian air force, which is a non-trivial problem. A large amount of the F-35's force multiplier value is related to its inter-aircraft datalink. A US F-35 can keep its radar off and launch long-range anti-air or anti-radiation missiles against a target 200km+ distant, allowing the missile to be guided until the terminal phase by a completely different aircraft. They can also do this in reverse, guiding munitions for other aircraft. None of these capabilities would be available to an F-35 in Ukrainian service.

\- The airframe itself costs about $200 million \*per aircraft\*, with a massive ongoing maintenance and logistics cost. Although it has better technology than older stealth aircraft, it still uses fragile radar-absorbent coatings that require special management, and needs careful handling.

\- Instead of spending $200M on one of these, you could buy up to \*ten\* F-16s, which would be able to work at closer to their designed capability with a smaller logistics tail.

And, if you're asking why NATO couldn't just directly service and maintain these, then you're proposing an option that would probably draw NATO directly into war with Russia.

An invasion from Russia with some sanctions from the west lead to the global economy dropping some 4% in the last two months, with the western markets respectively dropping about 20% - and that's just from a simple war. Don't forget: Russia, unfortunately, is the portal through which a lot of other nations get their energy or their access to the broader world. Like Kazakhstan and it's neighbors, Mongolia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, etc. If Russia magically ceased to exist, those nations would immediately collapse and - like most humanitarian crises - that collapse would spread to their neighbors over a short period of time.

The same cannot be said of the countries that rely on Russia. If Mongolia, for example, ceased to exist tomorrow, the impact that would be felt from it would be negligible.

**EDIT**: /u/StatementClear8992, your reply to this was deleted.. but I'm going to paste my reply here to *that* reply, anyway. Discussion is a good thing, even if it's sometimes uncomfortable.

If the entirety of the EU ceased to exist, then yes - it would also lead to an economic collapse. But it's disingenuous to compare the EU, which is comprised of many countries, to a single country for this argument.

If Italy were to disappear tomorrow, how many nations do you think would actually be impacted by that? How many nations get their energy or imports exclusively from Italy? I can wager a guess and say ""none."" Again: It's not just about the economic output of a country. It's also about what other people rely on that country to survive. Russia just so happens to have many other countries that rely on it for their continued existence. Italy, per your example, does not. You can not like that reality all you want, but it doesn't change that it is, in fact, reality.

Also, don't misunderstand: I'm not saying Russia is in any way a good country, nor that what they're doing is good, nor that their leader is good, or anything to that effect; I'm merely stating that they're categorically a superpower simply by virtue that they are a single nation upon which many other nations rely on them.

Russia was launching attacks in the early hours of the morning, under cover of darkness, then somehow Ukraine got night vision superiority and started counter-attacking (in the early hours). I don't actually know how this happened, but it was strange to see Russia's night attacks turn into Ukrainian night attacks. During this, the livestreams went down and the fog of war really settled in. Edit: from memory it was when Russian forces started converging and launching strikes during the day, while Ukraine was launching counterattacks at night. Around this point we started to learn how garbage the Russian deployed equipment was. Also there were multiple attempts to land paratroopers in airfields at the time, which were complete routs (the first elite set of troops fled into the woods when they weren't reinforced).

The Kremlin quickly declared that Zelenskyy had fled the city, so Zelenskyy live-tweeted himself and his crew posing in the streets of Kyiv (while Russian Forces were still engaging in night strikes).

America offered to extract Zelenskyy and he told them he needed ammo (or was it guns?), not evacuation. At this point, weapons were being handed out to any civilians who wanted to join the defence.

Kyiv was literally the first target of Putin's botched invasion (with the goal of replacing Zelenskyy, presumably with Yanukovich, who was hanging out in Belarus or somewhere nearby). This failed effort is half the reason Russian forces got so overextended, leading to their convoys being blown to hell and back (ah, remember the days of the 40km convoy?). More specifically, the convoys became counteroffensive targets and never made it to Kyiv, and Russian forces fell back to compress their supply lines and try to prevent all the counterstrikes (noted as the tactical switch from a decapitation strike to more conventional warfare).

\-The vast Russian arsenal will be put on for sale to various parties: arms dealers, terrorist organizations and unsavory nations looking to boost their arsenal.

\-The skilled Russian military personnel can vanish and go into private military work.  After all, many places will pay good cash for the ability to kill more efficiently and brutally.

\-The rulers of the broken Russian territories will squabble and desire more land, which can cause more fights in the former territory.  International entities like the Americans, Europeans, Chinese and more will definitely pick proxies because they will crave that ability to influence the region.

\-Russian citizens seeking to avoid the chaos will flood Europe and Asia, which will lead to a refugee crisis in both regions.

\-Such a fracturing will lead to massive resentment on a cultural level from the Russian people.  Unless Russian culture is forcibly cut down (burn down icons, kill influential people), it will lead to the rise of a Putin-like or even worse sort of leader in time: one who will weaponize that hatred to get revenge on the West.

A similar idea was proposed on Nazi Germany by United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr.  It was later shelved and deemed too harsh to the defeated Germany, especially since an investigation by Herbert Hoover would find that the proposal will kill up to 25 million Germans via starvation: [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau\_Plan](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan)

Stock piling them in secure warehouses on military bases, sure. But you said museums.

However that being said, I do not believe the DoD (you said MoD, I assume this was a mistake) stockpiles that many javelins because they don't fit in to US war doctrine. They are mainly used for defense and absolutely no one is invading the US mainland. So we stockpile *a shit load* of other munitions that we actually use, mainly AT-4s and air dropped bombs and missiles. Ya know, munitions we actually used in Iraq and Afghanistan. We didn't use javelins that much because US Army relies on armored vehicles with TOWs and the US Marine/Air Force relies on aircraft munitions, with AT-4s filling the gap for infantry needing to blow holes in walls and take out unarmored vehicles in the middle east. Using Javelins for that is far far too expensive compared to the price of an AT-4. Javelins were typically used in some niche cases by special forces, and it makes no sense to stock pile enough javelies to out fit an entire ground force for a conflict we had only about 1 year or so lead time. I'd need to see some actual evidence besides gesturing broadly at the US military budget before I believe otherwise.


However I haven't seen any announcement that we're running low on AT-4s, and our air dropped munitions are incompatible with Ukrainian aircraft.

Yes, the US has enough conventional munitions to flatten Russia, but not ones that Ukraine can use.

Edit: Just checked the US Military budget, about 30,000 javelins at ~$250,000 a piece have been made and over 600,000 AT-4s at ~$1500 a piece have been made.",1652122782.0,1652119802.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7y0oas,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

There’s a lot of factors, first their rhetoric towards Ukraine boils down to they aren’t a “real” country and Russia essentially has zero respect for Ukraine, it’s hard to justify “total war” against the likes of Ukraine (in the Russian mind). Obviously it’s not hard to sell the fact this is a “war” against NATO so this is less relevant. 

But calling for further mobilization also increases the requirements for a “win” significantly IMO. If you call for even more involvement, Putin Allies/Russian populace aren’t going to view simply holding onto the same territory you already have as a “win”. That’s also assuming that fully mobilizing could even handle that much…. Imagine investing  more, and still losing ground. You’re backing yourself into a corner, and fast.

Second of all, you're right, you must be.  There was no reason for a shell that can travel 56km, because it clearly is useless militarily.  Get on the phone and tell NATO they developed something that serves no purpose.  They will be grateful for the money you are saving them.

There is also the possibility to have forward deployed troops with a drone very close to it and radio the coordinates to the artillery.  This is in actuality exactly what Ukraine has been doing with the current artillery systems.

yes, UNDER BEST SCENARIO - you can see 56 km out 

Yes, UNDER BEST SCENARIO - you can forward deploy troops behind enemy lines

Yes, UNDER BEST SCENARIO all these things are possible. 

However, such things are not the what is possible during regular day-to-day operations.

>because it clearly is useless militarily.

No, it's not useless, because it allows for things to occur under favorable conditions.  This does not mean that NATO intends for these cannons to be in use at 56km ON REGULAR BASIS.",False,1652131935.0,t3_uliq6w,t1_i7ytx7q,,7,0,0,0,0,0,
