To those that don't know, Orban made a deal with the Russian orthodox church to take responsibility of 11 captured Ukrainians with ""historical ethnic Hungarian roots"" without the cooperation with Ukraine. 
This all falls in line with Orban's expansionist ideas of a ""greater Hungary"".
Some speculate that the russians had made a deal with Orban that if the invasion was successful he would have received the Zakarpattia oblast in western Ukraine because of the high percentage of ethnic Hungarians and because that oblast ""is historical Hungarian territory""

Again why are these revanchists in NATO still? I know there's no mechanism to throw them out but at this point I see no reason to not make life as hard as possible for Orbania.

Edit: here's Orban wearing a scarf featuring ""greater Hungary"" he seems to actually want to reestablish the old kingdom of Hungary for some dumb reason.

The IDF officer expressed concerns that Iran is researching Western weapons technology and sending the weapons to its client militias in Lebanon and Palestine. The IDF officer’s claims are consistent with previous Western reports. CNN previously reported that Russian forces have been capturing US- and NATO-provided weapons and equipment in Ukraine and sending these materials to Iran, notably Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft systems. A Russian military aircraft transported those same systems and a British NLAW anti-tank missile to Tehran on August 20, 2022, according to Sky News. This Iranian and Russian defense cooperation is part of a broader and evolving partnership evident in several different fields between Tehran and Moscow, as CTP has previously reported.

""Russian air strikes and artillery barrages are currently the main issues faced by Ukrainian forces as they keep pushing forward in southern and eastern Ukraine, a senior military officer told CNN close to the front lines.

“Their aviation works in waves, as it was in Vietnam, Afghanistan. Continuously, all day long, they work either by helicopters or by airplanes, and they work all day,” a deputy battalion commander with the call sign ""Spas"" with the Separate Territorial Defense Brigade told CNN in an interview on Friday. “It's hard to advance like that.”

“In general, aviation support is sorely lacking,” he also said, adding that Russian artillery made their advance even more difficult.  

Despite the challenges, Spas says Ukrainian forces are finding ways to work around these issues.   

“We retake territory, we do not allow them to hit the columns,” he said. “We come in small groups. We use all the tactics we can. We have experience.”

“We are advancing, knocking the enemy out of positions, not as quickly as we would like, but we are moving forward. In places, the enemy is already panicking, throwing reserves here,” he added.""",False,1686947065.0,t3_14amhqd,t3_14amhqd,,0,79,0,79,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-16-23/index.html

""US President Joe Biden is comfortable with removing one of the hurdles for Ukraine to join NATO, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

According to the source, Biden would be willing to drop the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine, which was described in a 2008 agreement as “the next step for Ukraine ... on their direct way to membership.” The MAP, characterized as “the program of advice, assistance and practical support tailored to the individual needs of countries wishing to join the Alliance,” is a process that other nations have had to undertake to join NATO.

Why this matters: Its removal would represent a small step in easing Ukraine’s accession into the defensive alliance.

It is part of proposal from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and was discussed when the two leaders met in Washington earlier this week, the source said. 

The US president is most concerned about finding a concrete proposal that will be supported by the rest of the allies and would signal to Ukraine that they are making progress toward membership, the source said.

However, the United States still does not view Ukraine’s membership into the alliance as imminent due to reforms that Kyiv needs to make, and the source said the Stoltenberg proposal reflects this.

The NATO chief's proposal does not set a specific timeline for Ukraine’s membership into the alliance, which is something that has been pushed by some members of the alliance. 

CNN reported earlier this week that the US might be willing to drop the language around the MAP, according to a European diplomat.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he understands that his country cannot become a member of NATO while it is still at war.""",False,1686947403.0,t3_14amhqd,t3_14amhqd,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

During combat (stress) theory is forgotten, fine motor skills are lost, and the fighter is left with only the skills that are practiced with hours of training.

Losses include all verified destroyed, damaged, abandoned vehicles (Oryx) in the time period.

A few points to make:

1. Ukrainians have loosened some of the earlier OPSEC but are still keeping quiet on some current/recent operations, so the numbers will be skewed.
2. From the limited data, it seems Ukrainians are taking more vehicle losses than the Russians, but the disparity is greatest re: engineering vehicles (for obvious reasons) and cheaper mobility vehicles. Tank and AFV casualties are surprisingly similar.
3. A significant amount of Ukrainian equipment losses are listed as abandoned rather than destroyed. Some may be recovered, others may be captured by the Russians (less likely). (None of the Russian equipment are listed as abandoned.)

So... not much we can really derive from this yet except there's been no large formations of lost equipment from either side. Neither side appears to have committed main force / reserves.

All of these factors combine to make the per unit cost of even ""simple"" parts, like oil pressure transmitters and switches on actuators to be incredibly expensive for what they are. The system level costs are several times that of the individual components.

Then there's development cost, which goes by the same principle. You're paying a few hundred engineers really good salaries (150-600k) for a few years before a single missile gets out the door. That can cost several hundred millions by itself.

And then there's materials and components. You have to build engines, sensors, computers, explosives, control surfaces... Every single piece in there has to be extremely reliable. Everything is redundant. Everything has all these ratings where they're resistant to countermeasures or can guarantee that they'll achieve a certain outcome.

Why is ATACM less explosive than 6x HIMARS ? Well, because ATACM uses ""more explosive fuel"" on range, rather than on explosion.

HIMARS is ""very little range"", and ""mostly explosion"". Its the advantage of having less range, you can beat the rocket-equation and fill the payload with more explosives.

ATACM is bigger-and-heavier, which means it needs more fuel to travel the same distance. When you add more fuel, the fuel weighs more (!!!), which means you need more fuel to lift the fuel (!!!).

And ATACM has more range, which means it needs to burn more fuel to move the fuel a longer distance.

For millennium we never left the surface of Earth and could barely explore all the watery bits.

We're less than a hundred years from flight and being able to move more than a few people through the air, and within a living generation of going to the Moon or staying in orbit.

Just enjoy your time as a tiny pond-scum sized being living on ""a mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam.""

\---

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
  
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  
  
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  
  
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.  
  
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

The real big 'get' for Russia is to assess how effective Western air defenses are and how their missile programs stack up. It's a real shocker for Russia because they now realize they can't compete with Western tech.

As for Iran, Iran already has Javelins and Stingers from Afghanistan and Iraq. They've had them for years. The big 'get' for Iran will be drone tech and assessing how effective their Shaheds are against Western defense systems.

Russia has been promising Iran S-400 systems for years, but they get nothing instead. Russia is supposedly sending some Su-35s to Iran, but it remains to be seen if it'll actually happen. The deal is 'done' but so was Iran's purchase of an S-400.

Its the second part that is problematic here, not the first part. 

If, as you say, there's no such thing as a good Russian, it becomes a very small step to say, the world would be better off without any Russians, or to move from that to ""well, lets exterminate them, they're all bad anyway"".

I'm on the side that is against genocide, period. And one of the first steps for that, is a complete dehumanization of the other. For example with such general claims as ""there is no good Russian"".

They are certainly in the minority, but please remind yourself of those protesters laying flowers at ukraine monuments, those protesters with blank signs, the father who got arrested because of his daughters drawings.

The Russians fighting on  the side of Ukraine(or at least the one of those two armies that  isn't extreme right), etc.

We must keep in mind that it is *not all Russians*,  so that we remind ourselves not to become like them.

This is completely unfair, since they have been doing nothing of the sorts for the last two hundred years, and yet i expect us to keep it in mind.  But thats what it is.

We are human just like them. And we have their capabilities of hate, just like they have our capabilities of love. They're human, and complex, and the vast majority right now is  stuck in a perpetual hell of their own doing, with violence and hate being sowed and reaped generation by generation. 

But would you have been  any different growing up in such a hell? 

Look. I know dehumanization is necessary by the soldier as a survival mechanism. But for us armchair generals, can we please leave out the complete dehumanization?",False,1686905669.0,t3_14amhqd,t1_jobsg5n,,4,-1,0,-1,0,0,

(This sort of complementarity is also standard in Nato, aside from the US (and France whenever they decide to be snotty). For example, Britain's post-WWII naval strategy makes no sense unless you know that the primary job of the Royal Navy is no longer to defend shipping in a world-spanning empire, but instead to stop Russian ships coming through the GIUK gap and to conduct anti-submarine operations; Luxembourg effectively doesn't have an army, but it has world class airborne C3ISR capability; etc. It's so much cheaper to have each country with a small number of specialties that can be put together into one fearsome unit, instead of everyone redundantly building out independent fighting forces.)
