Day 388-389 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past 2 days were actually very quiet, there were no missile or drone strikes anywhere after their last tantrum when they launched 16 Shaheds at our cities. We still had some air raid alerts, but not that many, Kharkiv only had 8 of them during the last 2 days, and cities farther from the frontline had even less alerts, like Kyiv which only had 2 alerts in the same time frame.

The situation with electricity in Kharkiv has also pretty much completely stabilized recently. The electric public transport is back on the streets, blackouts are not being used and even the street lights are already back. It’s amazing to see just how fast our energy infrastructure is being repaired after each new missile attack.

And as I was predicting just before the last big missile strike aimed at Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure happened, the street light in my district have also started to be turned back on 3 days ago. I expected that it will happen soon, but it was still very unusual to see after more than a year of complete darkness outside. The lights are only being turned on for about 2-3 hours per day from 5-6pm to 8pm, so it’s still completely dark outside most of the time, but it’s great to see that they are back anyway.",False,1679273092.0,t3_11vaqoo,t3_11vaqoo,,0,149,0,149,0,0,

The conversation was nuanced and covered a range of points including some I hadn’t heard. One point that I hadn’t heard was that apparently in the US support for arming Ukraine has gone up whenever Ukraine seems to be doing well in battle and seems to drop when things look grim. This is a pattern that we also saw with US aid to the allies in WWII prior to Pearl Harbor. She also seemed to believe that Ukraine will not stop fighting as long as Russia is occupying their land because the consequences of occupation for the people in Russian held territory are potential genocide.

 (1/12) ""The title of this update  is 'Bakhmut will not be taken'.
Many people are now saying that I am sticking my neck out unnecessarily, but all the elements are now in place to claim this. The situation in Bakhmut itself has not changed for.

2:""...three days; it is tough but the Russians are not advancing to the extent that they could knock us out. Time is on our side and the Russians' maximum energy has ebbed out, as anyone who follows the more detailed information available can see. 

3:""They try and try but are so predictable that ours have the bitter cough medicine ready well in advance. Since we now have urban combat, artillery must be used in a different ways than in open ground combat. Now the so-called light artillery plays a big role. 

4:""We could see this yesterday when the Russians tried to cross the canal like a bunch of headless chickens, they literally became that too.

They have to show some success so therefore they advance a few meters over open ground northwest of Soledar and try attacks at Hryhorivka.

5:""...and Khromove and Spirne, without any real results. Why they don't put everything into a single strike in one place I have been wondering for a long time now.

Yet another thing that supports my title: There are armored vehicles pouring into Bakhmut, 

6:""...and it's not Soviet era crap!!! Even the tanks that were stored near my home have arrived, at least 5 of them. The war bloggers who support the other side are screaming in anger why their strategic bombers are not knocking out our convoys, but we have plenty of air.

7:""...defense in the area. Taking further into account the large forces we have in Siversk and Sloviansk, at least to me, the plans are starting to make sense. There will not be ONE vector for the major offensive but TWO.

8:""The third thing that will decide the war before midsummer is information that have now leaked from the EU and US/Canada: we will receive up to 1 million shells within a short time. This shows that the politicians are now thinking along the lines I described a while ago: 

9:""Ammunition production cannot cope with a prolonged war; it must be decided in a rapid and merciless attack.

Yesterday also came the statement from the General Staff to our battalions that only 2 more weeks are needed until our new elite brigades are fully established. 

10:""They are ready after that a few weeks of special training and. These new brigades consist of soldiers with good combat experience. They are taken from different battalions and in their place the reserve is filled in. The reserve has also completed its basic training, 

11:""...so we are ready in time for the day T minus 0.
Of course, not everything has gone smoothly, due to corruption. Right now it can only be tolerated to a certain extent, but after the major offensive it will be hunted down with a blowtorch. 

12:""Corruption and revelations of the people who profit from the suffering of the population will be a theme in my reporting. More on that later.""🛑",False,1679213867.0,t3_11vaqoo,t3_11vaqoo,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

I think it needs to be very clear that Putin wasn’t goaded.

Goading suggests that Putin was prompted by the west to do something he usually wouldn’t do. Ukraine is not a “mistake” by Putin, it is a continuation of a pattern that has gone on for 20 years.

The psychopathic use of misinformation, genocide, invasion, war crimes, and false flag attacks to gain his political ambitions has always been Putin’s MO.

The invasion of Chechnya was predicated by a false flag attack where his agents galvanised Russian public opinion by bombing Russians in an apartment block and blaming it on the Chechens 20 years ago.

The invasion of Syria. The invasion of Georgia.

The election interference in the USA and Europe. The state condoned cyber crimes.

Putin sees his lack of morals as “superior intellect”.

He wasn’t goaded into invading Crimea and then Ukraine. It wasn’t an accident. He WANTED to do it. He PLANNED to do it.

>As I recall the events leading up to the annexation of Crimea, it seemed like Putin was caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, he was facing intense pressure from the Russian nationalists who wanted him to do something to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. On the other hand, the West was pushing hard for Ukraine to align itself with Europe and the US, which was seen by Putin as a direct threat to Russia's interests.

>From the beginning, the West seemed to be baiting Putin, making it clear that they would not tolerate any intervention in Ukraine's affairs. The US and the EU were quick to impose sanctions on Russia, even before the annexation took place. Putin was left with little choice but to respond in kind, and his decision to annex Crimea was seen as a direct challenge to the West.

>But the West was not finished. They continued to pile on the pressure, imposing even tougher sanctions and taking a harder line against Russia in international forums. Putin was forced to double down, even as the Russian economy suffered from the impact of the sanctions. His decision to support the separatists in eastern Ukraine only made matters worse, leading to a protracted conflict that has yet to be resolved.

>Looking back on it now, it seems clear that Putin was outmaneuvered by the West at every turn. The sanctions have hurt Russia's economy, and the annexation of Crimea has damaged its standing in the international community. But it's worth asking whether the West's strategy has really been successful. Putin remains in power, and Russia continues to pursue its own interests, even as it faces increased isolation from the rest of the world.

>Perhaps the lesson here is that there are no easy answers when it comes to dealing with Russia. Putin may have fallen for the West's provocations, but it's hard to say whether a different approach would have yielded better results. In the end, it may be that both sides need to find a way to work together, even as they continue to pursue their own interests.

Couldn’t agree more. There are so many people who only heard about Ukraine when the invasion began and have no understanding of the Holodomor or what Chornobyl meant for Ukrainians. To them Ukraine prior to 1991 was just part of “the Russians” and people are also so used to conflicts being morally ambiguous between two guilty parties that it becomes hard for many people to conceptualize a war where one side truly is the aggressor. There are also way too many people who believe the conflict started in 2022 and rather than the initial invasion occurring in 2014 and they ignore the broader decades long pattern of Putin (aided and abetted by the Russian people) trying to dominate and control Ukraine. It’s also worth repeating that “ethnic or linguistic Russians in Ukraine” are not Putin loyalists nor were they under any threat before hand. Hell Zelensky’s first language is Russian, he’s from the East and his electoral coalition actually looks a lot like Yanukovych’s coalition. Ethnic Russians who voted for Zelensky and have had their homes bombed by Russia aren’t sitting around cheering on Putin. 

This war has harmed billions of people already and Ukraine will not stop fighting because they believe they are facing genocide.

There's an episode of StarTalk from last year titled [How The War in Ukraine Will Shape The Future with Irwin Redlener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dchD0D5SM-c).  

From the blurb:  
>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener.  

Extended blurb:  
>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children. We discuss the current state of humanitarian aid. Is there more we can be doing to help victims of war beyond satisfying immediate needs? What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict? 

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up. 

>How do we make sure there isn’t an entire generation lost to trauma? Do we have any insights from past wars? Learn about mental health care for war refugees and how teachers are being trained to handle traumatized children. All that, plus, we discuss the importance of continuing to dream.

I think you’re referring to the Romney-Obama debate. This has sort of become a “Romney was right in retrospect” contrarian take but I don’t think that’s accurate. Romney was arguing that Russia posed a conventional military threat to the US and his solution was a reinvestment in the US Navy and more warships. 

With over a decade of hindsight I think we can safely say that Russia was in fact a geopolitical challenge to the US but Romney’s idea that the US needed more warships to challenge Russia was absurd. From a conventional military force Russia was a joke compared to US conventional capabilities both in 2012 and in 2023. In that regard Obama was right. That said it is also clear that Obama failed to realize how much of a threat to liberal democracy and the global post WWII system Russia did pose. That is what Bush, Obama and Trump got wrong (although Hillary Clinton seemed to understand it better).

If Romney’s solution to Russia was stronger US presence in the baltics and building up greater reserves of conventional weapons that could be shipped to potential allies then I would say “wow he sure nailed that.” Hindsight is 20/20 but if I could tell US policy makers in 2013 how to prepare for Russian threats today my advice wouldn’t be “more American warships.”",False,1679269461.0,t3_11vaqoo,t1_jcvry57,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

One of the most common sources of conflict is not necessarily “people assuming we are different” but rather “assuming we are the same.” I think this is very important to understand in the context of Russia and Ukraine because both the west and the Kremlin seem to have fallen for this trap.

The Kremlin believes that Ukrainians have no agency and that NATO is simply the US dominating and controlling other countries. When Ukrainians fought for their freedom and right to self determination in the Maidan the Kremlin saw this as “the US is trying to start a revolt to weaken Russia.” When the US reaffirms that countries are free to join NATO if they wish then the Kremlin sees this as “the US is taking over countries to attack Russia.” Things like democracy, human rights, the free market and self determination are lies within Russia and so they believe that these are also meaningless lies within the west as well and so when the west tries to defend these values the Russians see it as an attack on Russia.

Meanwhile in the west many people DESPERATELY want to believe that the Russians are “just like us.” They think that if they just trade with Russia and don’t build up a military them Russia will liberalize and not feel threatened. Westerners will sometimes contort themselves to view Russian imperialism and conquests as just “Russia seeking a buffer from invasion because of WWII.” They put the blame for the war solely on Putin rather than try to understand that the imperialist and nationalist mindset of Russia runs very deep and goes back centuries. Prior to the war many believed Russia wouldn’t invade because they unintentionally assumed the Russian mindset was the same as the west’s.

In most western countries the state implements policies designed to build a feeling of belonging and national identity among the population so its difficult for westerners to envision a state that actively spends resources discouraging the population from identifying with the nation state. 

60% being apathetic means these 60% likely would not care if Russia was dissolved tomorrow and broken down in to smaller countries as they view the current social construct that is ""Russia"" as merely a oligarchy.

My understanding of the 20-20-60 comment is that it is what some Russian political scientists believe to be the true feeling among the Russian population not what is seen in public polling where people might be afraid to state their true feelings. 

Publicly anti-war is way less than 20%. The interesting figure is the 60% apathetic and the fact some people view that as normal which sort of indicates what type of state structure one has been indoctrinated under.

I happen to have been indoctrinated in to feeling some ownership of the country i live in and some feeling of responsibility for its politics which i can choose to influence via voting. The school system here has as one of its stated goals to build a feeling of belonging and ownership of the country. This is the same in most western democratic countries where the school system usually as one of its many functions is supposed to build cohesion and a feeling of belonging with state or nation symbols. 

So for me its natural to feel deeply engaged in what ""my"" country is doing on the international stage and to voice my opinion on it freely and by voting. 

In the geographic region commonly referred to as Russia the local power hierarchy wants nothing more than for the people living there to tune out and feel no ownership or belonging what so ever to the social construct that is ""Russia"". 

The less people feel like they belong to a country as opposed to a fiefdom/oligarchy or as a subject to a Tsar the less likely they are to have any emotional response to anything the king does that does not directly catastrophically effect them.  

I have a feeling most Russians would not care if Moscow burned to the ground tomorrow as they likely feel very little kinship with that geographic region. They would feel empathy as any sane person just like you see a earthquake damage a large city abroad.

Ukraine has a significant army of trained volunteers (not conscripts) preparing for a counter offensive.  Logically, this is where their best trained maneuver leaders are.

A) Russia moves to the next city to attack it.  Ukraine still has to defend, and another city is leveled by Russian artillery.  More civilians killed and displaced, etc...  Or B) and the worse option, Russia pauses and digs in for defense.  This allows them to move these troops and supplies to bolster the lines elsewhere.  Frees up ammo for defensive lines in the South.  Russia will be better prepared against Ukraine counter-offensive.  Bakhmut won't win the war, but a successful counter-offensive might.  

This is the calculus.  Hold the lines, demoralize Russian troops, and keep them battering themselves against the rocks while they prepare for a knockout blow.  Keep the enemy weak.
