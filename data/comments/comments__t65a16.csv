cbce398cd34f5542e4d76375d30d5dc5,t65a16,hz92c3g,"My Dad did some work for Bruce Power up here in Canada.

Two big risks (which are probably obvious)

A) Loss of the plant's emergency management team. Nuclear engineers don't grow on trees, neither do plant operators.

B) The pools which house fissile material CANNOT be allowed to bubble off. Fissile material stays hot for hours after a plant has shut down. Normally, in the event of a power failure there are double or even triple power redundancies (turbines, diesel engines, etc). It is critical that these still run.

My dad thinks this is serious, but it DOESN'T spell doom immediately.

Fukushima happened due to basically everything fucking up at once (plant lost power, plant then lost their backups, and then a tsunami came and flooded everything).

Even a direct hit from a tank / mortar shell wouldn't be enough to cause a meltdown unless that shot somehow destroyed primary power, secondary power, and the ability for the rods to be dropped into their cooling pools.

1.) The Chernobyl style power plants have all been shut down and the currently used ones are much, much safer.

2.) The power plants in Ukraine come with three cooling systems that are built with redundancy, meaning that they all share the same function so if something goes wrong with one system or a few subsystems, the cooling will still work at maximum capacity and be fully operational. They would have to destroy a LOT of heavily protected systems to cause a meltdown.

3.) These nuclear reactors come with multiple unconnected backup generators. If the plant needs to be shut down or experiences issues, the generators take over and provide the power required to shut it down. All components are run to different generators so losing some generators will not impact shutdown capability

4.) If the backup generators all go down, most nuclear reactors also come with a big battery that they keep charged. That battery itself comes with enough power to perform shutdown by itself, and can also provide backup if the generators’ capacity is reduced.

5.) if they someone manage to mess up so bad that all of these multitudes of safety features get destroyed, the reactor will start to melt down into its three layers of containment fields. The final layer of containment is the giant concrete building it’s sitting in.

A fire has broken out in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhya, according to an announcement from the mayor of the nearby town of Energodar.

“As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Energodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel, citing what he called a threat to world security. He did not give details.

Orlov recorded a short video message which has now been shared my multiple local Ukrainian media outlets, urging Russian troops to immediately stop shelling the plant.

“As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Orlov said on his Telegram channel, Reuters reports.

Orlov earlier said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. and reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

According to a Telegram message posted by an employee at the plant, Russian troops fired at the nuclear facility.

“Attention! Equipment of the Russian Federation is firing at the Zaporozhye NPP. There is a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand a ceasefire from heavy equipment at the Zaporozhye NPP!”

UNIAN agency also reports that a fire has started at the nuclear power plant.

The city on the Dnieper River accounts for one-quarter of the country’s power generation.

Here’s where we stand right now:

Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.

Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.

Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east was Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces.

At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihivon Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say. The death toll across Ukraine is continuing to rise.

Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence.

Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance.

The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said.

The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March.

a) The vehicles are Russian. They're pushing in. This is an assault, not a shelling - SPECIFICALLY for the reason people are worried about. The Russians want this plant and aren't interested in killing themselves in the process. As of this posting, there is a vehicle behind used as rolling cover for a group of soldiers trying to get closer to the defensive position. The big flashes are from RPG fire or from flares. The smaller ones are from guns.

b) The plant isn't on fire. The admin building is. The Russians are not being indiscriminate with their fire here. Whoever is behind the cameras already panned around and showed there was no structural damage to the plant. The smoke is from the fire in the admin building and the gunfire, not from any plant infrastructure.

c) The explosions are from rockets from ground troops, and are being aimed at either defensive positions in the admin building (from the Russians) or the vehicle column in the middle (from the Ukrainians.)

This is what modern warfare looks like. This plant, like it or not, is a strategic location. Politics don't matter at this point for the people getting shot at. They're either 'trying to take the thing' or 'trying to defend the thing.'

Because war news moves lightning fast, and because many questions here can be answered/researched/clarified with a simple search, here are some tips to find better results on the conflict. I'll use Google since it's well known. 


1. (Bad) Searching *Zaporizhzhia* brings up thousands of results, anytime, anywhere.


2. (Better) Search *Zaporizhzhia*, then click ""search tools"". Change the timeframe to ""last hour"". Now you've got the most recent info. 


3. (Even better) Search *Zaporizhzhia site:twitter.com*. Now you've got results, from Twitter only, within the last hour, about Zaporizhzhia. Note that twitter.com is just an example. You can use any site you want. 

For anyone interested in even more options, just Google 'Google dorks'.

Do basic research before making drastic comments that OMG THEY ARE BOMBING THE PLANT!.

1. They are located at the entrance, there is one long road behind them and a car park on the left, basic google maps shows you this is the entrance surrounded by administration buildings.
2. The core / cores ? Main buildings are off to the side with cooling pools and contamination bays.
3. They are not shelling the plant.
4. The camera panned around which I suspect is being watched to check damage and there was no fire in the core / plant area like some doomsday people are screaming.

Scenarios 

1. They are gaining control to take over power and further limit the cities - I’m thinking they may order staff to run it but control if power is sent out / where it goes.

2. Same as above they just want control.

Reason why it’s not the end like everyone is claiming, if they wanted to cause an outright disaster they could quite easily cruise missile the main buildings.

Not sure why there is anything being attacked in the Volyn Oblast. 

Bila Tserkva is interesting because it matches an axis of advance Russia seems to be seeking to encircle Kyiv  They might try an advance here following the bombing. Russia has failed elsewhere and they have a lot of mechanized formations sitting idle otherwise constantly getting hammered by ambushes. 

Odessa is REALLY interesting. Odessa is a major port and one of Russia main targets for the war but it is purported to be heavily defended. A large landing here is expected regardless of the bombing results.  Russian ships have been off the coast of Odessa all night.

If Russian strikes are ineffective but Russian still launches their landing, it could go VERY badly for them.  They've had 8 days to prepare a welcome and Russia is running low on high quality munitions based on numerous intelligence sources. Their bombing might not be enough. Especially if they're spreading out their attacks.  

Then again, maybe the thing in Odessa is merely a feint to hold defenders in Odessa away from places like Kherson.",1646357010.0,1646356793.0,t3_t65a16,t3_t65a16,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

While the latter is irrefutable, it's such an incredibly insulting notion to insinuate that those millions who died (and would die if WW3 were to start) were some ""necessary"" sacrifice for the greater good of civilization.

If you think this way, seriously get fucked. Quite honestly, anyone not in the military calling for military escalation needs to take a goddamn seat. We are not living through some Hollywood war film, and your ass doesn't stand to get blown to shit if that were to happen (most likely). 

These sanctions are going to absolutely cripple the RF. They were preparing for sanctions for years on this little post USSR land crusade they have been on, but by all reports, they never expected it to this extent, going after athletes, boats, brands, etc. 

We changed the world after WW2 so that we would never have to bring the world-stage to a battlefront again. Defensive pacts like NATO are just that, and they are an ULTIMATE LAST RESORT. If we can stop this fascist power from growing without bloodshed, that is what needs to BE DONE.

Don't act like us going in with NATO boots is going to suddenly stop civilian atrocities. IT WOULD EXPEDITE THEM. So yes, it's going to feel like we are, ""just letting it happen,"" but the future fields have already been plowed. The RF economy is boned, the regime just got its death-clock commencement, they are isolated from the world. 

This is how we decided ""war"" needs to be fought decades ago, and Jesus Christ I'm pretty sure none of you would be saying, ""let's go in again,"" if you would've seen the beaches of Normandy that day, or any other battle zone for that matter.

I think the fastest way out of this, is a coup in Russia. Some of the higher ups in Russia realize their children, and grandchildren's lives will be infinitely better if this war stops immediately. Somehow, someway, putin is removed from power. What follows will certainly be chaotic in Russia as putin has no real clear successor.

Hopefully that power struggle is quick with few casualties. I certainly wouldn't root for a civil war. Whomever takes power would realize their #1 economic priority would be to get the sanctions lifted. In order to do that the west demands a denuclearization. The west cannot denuclearize with others like China in the mix still. So the West, along with now Russia turns their sanction eyes on China. 

We quit putting up with this inhumane, authoritarian bullshit and one by one democratize the world through sanction, with the agreement that America will get rid of nukes and demilitarize along with the countries Better Russia and China. Our world now operates on sanctions and incentive. This essentially creates a world democracy where each country gets a vote, and the votes weight is equal to that countries economic influence. It also gives the united nations some real teeth and they become the senate of the world. This becomes the checks and balances that so many authoritarian leaders need right now.

As an American that saw what our democracy was capable of the last 4 years, I don't want our democracy to have nukes either. But the only path for that to happen is an economically forced mutual denuclearization by hundreds of cooperating country. 

I know this is nonsense, but world peace has always seemed to be completely impossible, certainly in this lifetime. But I think too many people are seeing war up close, and too many people are being blindsided by the threat of nuclear war. Public opinion might push for it. Similarly the west and China are seeing how powerful sanctions are, potentially destroying country's economies without military intervention. History is changing faster now than it has since 911. Maybe we can change it in a more peaceful direction.

Basically my thoughts are this.
 
1.It is well known that nuclear fallout can spread a considerable distance. 
 
2. Chernobyl is a clear example of radiation as a result of a nuclear power plant disaster being detected in Europe. 
 
3. It is absolutely forseeable that shelling a nuclear power plant may result incident that damage the integrity of the plant. 
 
4. By intentionally engaging in the action, the Russian military can be said to have demonstrated a clear disregard for the people and nations that may be impacted if a catastrophe occurred.
 
5. If as a direct outcome of a Russian military operation, noting the intentional shelling of a place that should not be shelled, another country is subject to nuclear fallout, does it not follow that the country chose to defend itself.

The Russians are looking to take it because it's huge and likely provides most of Ukraine's (or at least a huge chunk) electricity. Controlling this would be a huge factor in the balance of how this war is going.

They are not going to blow it up. If they were they wouldnt have walked right up to do it in person It's a high stakes location for a firefight, but something so dangerous will be built stronger than pretty much anything else on the planet, I'd imagine.

It seems the fighting is happening at the offices not the coolers or any of the sensitive parts. There will be massive checks in place to help prevent the spread of any fires until the firefighters get in. Which looks like right now in my stream.

Ukraine getting bombs, Russia getting sanctions. And West is getting Russian fortune(cash, Gold, dinamonds, yachts, art)

They are giving stingers and javelins to Ukraine and boosting them up to fight Russia. They are way more active on seizing Russian assets then helping Ukraine. And they are helping to Ukraine with less then a friction of what they seize from Russia. And still looking to buy oil and gas from Russia for less. While destroying Russian economy.

Also states afraid of getting f...  by Russia are getting in line to sleep with them. And west will have more influence on places under Russian influence right now. Eventually Russia may end up going under Chinese influence.

A smart move from West. They win in all aspects. They gain fortune, they gain prestige without losing a fortune. They blocked a possible Russia-Ukraine alliance for forever.

Whatever the outcome become of this war both Ukraine and Russia will be the ones losing. And they will lose much more as long as this dumb war continues.

They should make peace without hurting each others as any further in good terms. If they had any sense.

Good summary but I wanted to correct you on a couple of details.

A. Spent fuel storage doesn't have anything to do with the fuel that's currently in the reactor. Spent fuel has been out of the reactor long enough that while it produces some decay heat, it's not enough to cause the pool to boil off for a very long time. 

B. Reactor decay heat, however, that's what you REALLY have to worry about. Shutdown heat will quickly drop from around 10% of full power to 1% of full power within 24 hours. Now 10% doesn't sound like a lot, but you're still talking about 100 megawatts of heat energy that isn't going anywhere. That needs constant primary loop circulation and cooling to keep the water in the reactor from turning into steam. Once you are steam = game over. 

C. There are EXTENSIVE systems to keep that decay heat in check. Even a Russian designed system will have safeguards and redundancies. The VVER1000 design is actually quite good, built to western safety standards. The reactor vessel itself is under multiple layers of reinforced concrete and steel. It will take a deliberate and focused strike with heavy bombs to damage the reactor vessel beyond safe shutdown ability. I wouldn't worry about a meltdown...

Established in the aftermath of World War II, the organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty, signed 4 April 1949. NATO constitutes a system of collective security, whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. The NATO headquarters is located in Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium.
 
**[United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)**

It is the world's largest and most familiar international organization. The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City, and has other main offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, and The Hague. The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars, succeeding the rather ineffective League of Nations.

 >The water-water energetic reactor (WWER), or VVER (from Russian: водо-водяной энергетический реактор; transliterates as vodo-vodyanoi energetichesky reaktor; water-water power reactor) is a series of pressurized water reactor designs originally developed in the Soviet Union, and now Russia, by OKB Gidropress. The idea of such a reactor was proposed at the Kurchatov Institute by Savely Moiseevich Feinberg. VVER were originally developed before the 1970s, and have been continually updated. As a result, the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation I reactors to modern generation III+ reactor designs.

So If everything he said he would do ahead of time has come true so far -  then there is a small possibility that he does have some new technology. I believe the very unlikely chance is more real than we realize. That is why he is so confident in this. His main objective is to get a deal. So let’s just say in theory he has some new weapon technology. He will provoke NATO in the United States into a conflict so he can legitimately use those weapons to demonstrate them. Whatever he thinks he has up his sleeve seem to be what he thinks will give him a deal as soon as the west sees it. If true. But he’s been planning this for a while and it will not be something he packs up and walks back. There is no turning back for him. He said so in so many words. 


I mean not to be a killjoy. But just because American intelligent it says it’s not possible doesn’t mean it’s not achieved. It’s very very improbable but any new technology development is seemingly impossible intelligent achieved 

I mean what if it’s just a hypersonic missile? If he lands a precise missile somewhere and doesn’t kill anybody but just shows hey “I can bomb you before your radar skin detected“. Does that give him leverage? Because with a nuke you can’t see coming that seems to be leverage to me. And what’s his purpose? Again he wants to get a deal. And he wants Cold War tactics in order to get that. And said he would use them


This isn’t ending soon. He plans for a while and he has a small amount of protection against inflation because for a few years russian but God like crazy. Why? Because they were planning a war that would instantly deflate the Rubel and even some of the rest of the world currency is going to have even more inflation

And I mean if you’re spending hours following this or care about what’s really going on why not take 25 minutes and watch what he said years ago that he would do? Do you have to take this guy at his word because so far has been true to his word. Other than saying I’m not starting a war. Which technically in his mind and threw his semantics is true. He didn’t start a war he started in incursion. Which I know is bs

It gives them back the leverage they lost after the Cold War. My theory? No. What his speeches said since 2010 and even last.

He said he will take this however far to get security guarantees. Don’t be fooled.

It’s not so simple. Look at North Korea. When you have the threat of nuclear weapons you can’t do anything about it. All you can do is try to isolate a country. And still Korea outlasted.

In 1918 Russia was forced to stop their involvement in world war I because Germany was going to completely demolish them.

And that treaty in 1918 Russia agreed to give up nearly a dozen countries Ukraine being one of them. Russia never forgot about this and it's always been a thorn in their side.

 >Tracer ammunition (tracers) are bullets or cannon-caliber projectiles that are built with a small pyrotechnic charge in their base. When fired, the pyrotechnic composition is ignited by the burning powder and burns very brightly, making the projectile trajectory visible to the naked eye during daylight, and very bright during nighttime firing. This allows the shooter to visually trace the flight path of the projectile and thus make necessary ballistic corrections, without having to confirm projectile impacts and without even using the sights of the weapon.

Learning about global warming made it worse, altho I firmly believe from what I've read and studied up on and heard from experts that the worst case scenarios are overblown (I mean, lots of people were predicting covid would collapse society and kill millions of American children, look how that panned out--still shitty, but not apocalyptic). 

Existential depression can be uniquely difficult to treat. I've been fired by two therapists because they couldn't grapple with it. It can be hard to separate what is you blackpilling yourself and what is a totally rational response to the genuinely shitty state of the world. 

The best thing I've found is to just find some kind of nihilistic, hedonistic day to day pleasure, and try to do something good. Anything, even if it's tiny. Just something. But I don't really have any advice except to say that existential depression is often accompanied by regular ol depression and if you can get help and work on managing the latter, the former becomes bearable. Humans have thrived and even been happy during really bleak times. If we didn't have that capacity as a species then sapience would have caused our extinction.

We cannot be afraid to act because an unpredictable dictator is unpredictable. He cannot be allowed to get what he wants because we are too weak or slow to act.
