""This is a psyops""

No, there is no way Putin would do that in the middle of a war, it would only demoralize his army and much can go wrong. Erdogan wasnt at war when he allowed the coup and there was the historical precedent of the Turkish army acting as a guarantor of sorts and Erdogan had to deal with that.

""He is just against Shoigu, not Putin!""

He is defacto moving against Putin and Putin is moving against him. Otherwise the FSB would not be moving against Progozghin and commanders wouldnt be asking for troops to follow Putin and not Wagner. Prigozhin moved on Putin by asking the Rosvguardia, Putin's army, to join him. Prigozhin cant openly say he is going for Putin now.

Now, what is likely true is that Prigozhin doesnt intends to remove Putin officially. His aim seems to be to turn Putin into a figurehead and establish a relationship similar to the one between the Emperor of Japan and the Shogun. At least until 2024 where Prigozhin can run for president and remove Putin in a more legitimate manner.

Now what is yet to be seen is the impact in Ukraine, could be very good for Ukraine or very bad if Prigozhin ends up being more hardline than Putin.

What we know so far is that Wagner forces seem to be in and around Rostov and heading towards Moscow with the intent of overthrowing part or all of the Russian government. There seems to be fighting between Wagner forces and Russian forces though the skirmishes have been minor. For the part, it seems like Wagner is moving towards Moscow with only slight opposition. 

If this is legitimate, which I feel it is, Prigozhin made his announcement when he did in hopes of convincing Russian soldiers to put down their arms or even help them. If what we’ve heard is true, this does seem to be happening to some extent. 

Video and pictures will be difficult to get out. Russia seems to be actively blocking internet access in hopes of suppressing news. Don’t expect much in the way of hard evidence for now. Once internet is restored, we may get a wave of videos and photos. 

In summary, we don’t know exactly what’s going on but it isn’t good for Russia’s government. Let’s just buckle up, enjoy the ride and cross your fingers for the collapse of the Russian military and the end of their pointless attack on Ukraine!

This would also mean that the already collapsing Russian positions in Ukraine would be untenable.  

Obviously Prigozhin has become the primary threat for Putin Loyalists.  They'll almost certainly have to take Russian Army forces out of Ukraine to retake Rostov.

> 
> 🔹 Unidentified men in military uniforms and tanks surrounded the buildings of the headquarters of the Southern Military District, the FSB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the city administration in Rostov. They are armed with machine guns, machine guns and even flamethrowers.
> 
> ❓ So PMCs or someone else came to Rostov?
> 
> The footage of the movement of vehicles near Rostov shows civilian tractors, on which tanks are loaded, as well as civilian pickups. This may be indirect evidence that PMC mercenaries were in the convoy.
> 
> Analyst Ruslan Leviev believes that the buildings were surrounded by fighters of the Russian Defense Ministry, and not by PMCs. He argues this by the fact that among the equipment near the administrative facilities of Rostov there are vehicles of the military police of the Russian Federation.

> The TASS state agency in its photobank signs a photo from Rostov as a photo of Wagner PMC fighters, Meduza notes.
> 
> The authorities of the Rostov region ask residents not to leave their homes, but they do not say what kind of people in military uniforms walk the streets.

> 
> 🔹 The authorities of the Lipetsk and Voronezh regions also prepared for a possible conflict. In Moscow and the region, authorities announced ""anti-terrorist measures.""
>

Putin's not dead. But he soon will be. 

Putin's in hiding. He pissed off everyone. He managed to keep it together after fucking up last February, but this is too much. Helicopters doing strafing runs on fucking M4 where M stands for Moscow, that shit just doesn't fly. 

Russia just had its the king has no clothes moment. 

Prigozhin's rebellion wasn't caused by Putin secretly dying because if he had, Prigozhin would not be the only one fighting. There are a lot of greedy sociopaths much closer to the levers. 

Prigozhin had been planning this shit for some time. Staged videos, multiple well-stocked military columns, that don't get put together in an afternoon. But also it doesn't take months. Would have likely just been days, Prigozhin's decision to rebel must have been that recent. And any conspiracy that gets to the size of military columns doesn't stay secret for long. 

Putin likely got wind and tried to go after Prigozhin, and that blew up in his face. Prigozhin's rants seem to suggest that that's what's happened. The day of unexpectedly honest news from Russia began earlier than we thought, when we got strange news of emergecy spetznaz unit 1,500 strong being airlifted with Shoigu personally in command. They got tipped off and were trying to stop a coup. 

Now Putin is off hiding somewhere. The entire country is frozen. Official news, telegram channels, governors, politicians, no one is taking sides. Putin knows that he can be betrayed by anyone at any second.

The full ramification didn't even begin to dawn on us. It's however clear that this is both real and for good, that things have changed dramatically. We can't blame the feeble-minded on twitter and right here on some unintentional comedy subreddits for not even taking reality at face value. And yet reality hits even in Russia, and when it hits it hits hard. 

And of course taking reality at face value means that Putin fucked up. 

The feeble-minded can't accept or even fathom that the supposed 5d chess GM can fuck up so catastrophically and likely fatally. And yet he did.

All of this is Putin's fault. 

Prigozhin is Putin's animal. PMC Wagner is Putin's hilarious side project. The Shoigu / Wagner rivalry is fully Putin's own doing and he stoked it and loved every minute of it until just about 18 hours ago. Wagner being in Ukraine in such numbers, getting men, getting equipment, getting fucking tanks and artillery, is all at Putin's bidding. And of course, the entire horrific context of the war in Ukraine is Putin's previous big pants-shitting moment. 

The idiots on Twitter led by Mr ""If everyone agrees with me I must be smart"" himself will keep expecting Putin to ta-da out of the casket, and then will still go on claiming Putin was a genius and blaming everyone else but himself for that which he has brought onto himself.

""Dobroye utro, good morning, comrades! Or as we've quickly rebranded it, 'Prigozhin, are you out of your blin-ing mind?' day.Now, as you're sipping your morning chai, let me paint a picture. There I was, fresh as a Siberian morning, mid-rep in my daily routine of bench pressing two fully grown reindeer, when I get this little ring on my phone. 'Yevgeny Prigozhin is trying to take over the government!' they say. I nearly dropped a reindeer in surprise. 'Prigozhin? The guy who once set fire to salad?'  
Can you fathom it? Yevgeny, dear Yevgeny, who can't whip up a decent stroganoff without triggering a national food safety alert, thinks he can stir up a rebellion. It's like a hedgehog trying to mug a bear. What’s next? The babushkas from the local bridge club launching a knitting needle insurgency?  
Now, I can see the thoughts racing in your heads... 'Should we be worried?' 'Is this the end of our beloved Mother Russia?' 'Does the bomb shelter come with a lifetime supply of pickles?' Laughs But let me calm your racing hearts. Our security forces - highly trained, highly professional, and let’s be honest, probably a little hungover - are on the case. They've stared down angrier oligarchs and chased off scarier nesting dolls. They can handle a disgruntled cook with delusions of adequacy.  
So what's the plan, you ask? Well, first, we're going to invite Mr. Prigozhin for a little 'chat'. And by 'chat', I mean we're going to surround his hideout with tanks and ask him very politely, in the universal language of big, friendly guns, to come out with his hands up. If that doesn’t charm him, we have Plan B: a non-stop bombardment of Russian Eurovision entries until he taps out.

So keep calm, carry on, and remember - if you see any tanks in your neighbourhood, it's not a military coup, it's just the world’s most aggressive neighbourhood watch program.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I’ve got a nation to run, a culinary calamity to quash, and a bear that's getting impatient for his morning wrestling match. Until next time, my fellow Russians.

This is not a coup. [Here's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7nIqdwhdqA):

* **His actions make no fucking sense.**

That's it. Coups are supposed to be brief, orchestrated events, decapitating the head of government and finishing before anyone realizes. The continuation of the 'norm' is the most powerful asset to a budding regime. It *carries* the momentum of legitimacy from the previous regime into the next--a coup wishes to minimize that gap. Typically a coup carries some kind proclamation from government officials, but even pirogue's pet general, Sulli-mon or whatever the fuck that Russian Pokemon is named, disavowed himself of the event.

Ask yourself, does this seem at all like a well-planned event? 'Cause it sure-as-shit don't to me. 

This isn't a coup because pirogue isn't capable of a coup. He's a fucking bald thumb. None of Russian high society want anything to do with that fascist appendage. Do you hear any governors? Beauracrats? Anyone within the regime, beyond members of the military, endorsing this action? No, because pirogue isn't a diplomate. He's a soldier. And a thumb. 

Wagner marches on Rostov because this is a military in revolt. This might be a revolution. And when you look at Rostov ([look at it](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rostov-on-Don,+Rostov+Oblast,+Russia/@47.0558793,38.5576854,6.21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x40e3c777c3b4b6ef:0x8248b451e48b4d04!8m2!3d47.2357137!4d39.701505!16zL20vMDF2MTVm?entry=ttu)), you'll see that it serves as the supply juncture for the entire southern half of the Russian territory serviced through Crimea. Rostov is critical to the maintenance of Crimea.  Once Wagner seizes Rostov, and it very much looks like they have, they'll have complete control of everything south all the way down to Georgia. 

So here's my insane conspiracy theory, right? I think Wagner and Ukraine did a little talking on the DL (that means 'down low' for all you squares), and Wagner essentially gave away Crimea for Bakhmut and a promise to stay out of each other's way. From here he could very easily dig in, and Putin will have no choice but to negotiate or lose the ability to supply across the Kerch Bridge. At least for the near term.

If they occupy Rostov, then things for RU troops on the frontline could become far more difficult. The city is a major rail logistics hub feeding large sections of the front; if it falls out of their control, then every shipment sent there would be fueling the rebellion.

So those supplies would have to be rerouted, which adds time and limits mobility options to fewer routes, making the shipments ever more tempting targets.

And that's if they can even get them to the front in a timely manner; if the situation persists, RU might be forced to pull back and shorten their logistics tail, or else risk their frontline running out of munitions and being overrun.

If - and it's a big IF - Prigozhin's rebellion now de-facto owns the city, and remains so, we could see major shifts in the front in the short- to mid-term. If so, Preggo's put the Kremlin on the horns of a dilemma - give me what I want, or lose everything anyway.",False,1687572739.0,t3_14hg8nn,t1_jpau25x,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

If Pig replaces Shoigu, then Pig controls most of the military and Putin is screwed as Pig has all the guns. If Putin replaces Shoigu, then he is essentially taking orders from Pig. Putin is not longer the real leader then. So this forces Putin to fight Pig so that Putin is the sole leader.

All that said you may notice one of those military dilemnas. If Pig replaces Shoigu by force, Putin has lost, Pig has won. If Shoigu goes to see Pig then Putin has lost and Pig has won, only the president can order around the MOD. All the options Pig has presented are ones where Putin loses and Putin can't lose or he is done. Pig knows this so his ""I will only march on Moscow..."" bit is set up in a way the only real outcome can be Pig marches on Moscow. Putin's only choice is to attack Pig. This also allows Pig to march on Moscow. So those military dilemnas that we talk about is Pig is putting out option that cannot be accepted by Putin so it is ""Pig says he tried to reason so he marches on Moscow"" which appears to be by design. So Putin will attack as he has no other choice. And this brings up the question of where do the militaries loyalty lay? With Pig or Putin. If enough side with Pig then Putin is possibly done. I would assume that Pig is not an idiot and has found allies in the Russian military or he would not have done this as he lacks sufficient forces on his own to march on Moscow. So sounds like all the messaging is set up so Putin loses with any option except attacking and destroying Wagner with Russian units whose loyalty is in question. All other options Putin cannot accept then Pig marches on Moscow. All that said it is still an open question if he plans on really marching on Moscow. I will add one more thing, Pig has said he will allow the Russian military to continue their mission in Ukraine. Once again, this is not his position in the military or government to do such a thing, only Putin can order the military. So once again Pig is acting like the President here too again. Also unacceptable to Putin. Any way this ends up, if Pig is not dead at the end of it, Putin is at the very least weakened, more likely worse.",False,1687584494.0,t3_14hg8nn,t1_jpbcsj9,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

>Prigozhin said Wagner field camps in Ukraine were struck by rockets, helicopter gunships and artillery fire on orders from Gerasimov **following a meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, at which they decided to destroy Wagner.**

Further:

>**Prigozhin**, who said he had 25,000 troops under his command, **said** late Friday **his troops would punish Shoigu in an armed rebellion** and urged the army not to offer resistance

Tying it all together:

>**Prigozhin claimed that Shoigu went to the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don** personally to direct the strike and then “cowardly” fled.

My take on this is, Pirgozhin blames Shoigu and thought he was in Rostov (and he was for a while). Pirgozhin redploys his troops to Rostov, but Shoigu runs away. Pirgozhin continues on to the MoD building, likely to seize evidence or anyone else that might be involved. I suspect if he finds Shoigu's helpers, there will be public executions by way of sledghammers.

If the government collapses, which still seems unlikely, that's kind of always been an eventuality that the world was going to have to confront at some point or another.

Old Prigozhin's got his kilt in a twist and he's gone and started a brawl with Putin's lads. They're having a right go at each other, tanks and all!  
Now, we Scots might love a good scrap, but we also know when to keep our heads down. We'll be watching this one from the sidelines, thank you very much. We've got enough on our plate with Brexit and the calls for independence, without getting involved in some Russian power struggle.  
That being said, we'll be keeping a close eye on Ukraine, the poor buggers. They're the ones really caught in the crossfire here. We might not have an army like the big boys, but we can still offer aid, shelter to refugees, and a strong voice in international forums. And you can bet your last haggis we'll be raising a pint to their courage in the face of adversity.  
So, Putin, Prigozhin, if either of you are listening - sort yourselves out, lads! This isn't some drunken brawl at the pub. There are lives at stake here. And if you need someone to mediate, well... we Scots are known for our diplomacy as much as our love for a good dram of whisky.

There’s a plethora of books and videos about Roman history out there, so I can totally understand not knowing where to start. Others can chime in with alternatives, but I would suggest the First Punic War as a good jumping off point when learning about Rome. It’s a few hundred years before all that Caesar/Rubicon business, but it provides some important context into how Rome became **Rome**.

If you want to learn some of the basic history with a bit of comedy thrown in, the youtube channel OverSimplified has a couple videos covering the First Punic War. I don’t believe the series is finished yet, but worth a look anyways.

[Link](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yRmOWcWdQAo&list=PLQw_XrMliWVa1cUis273NsyXIvH5DW6o2&index=1&pp=iAQB)

If you like videos, but OverSimplified’s style just isn’t clicking with you, try Extra History. Less comedy, but it presents a concise overview with visuals to keep you involved in the story.

If you prefer longer stories told over hours in a more serious, but still accessible way, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast.

I believe the episodes on the Punic Wars (Punic Nightmares) are paywalled now, but you may be able to find them for free if you search. I was able to download them on my podcast app (Pocketcasts) some time ago, but a search on it now doesn’t yield any results.

The missiles themselves, even if they have some code needed before launch, are going to have that codebook with the operator. There was even [just a sandal](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/launch-code-for-us-nukes-was-00000000-for-20-years/) in the US where the actual codes needed to launcher were all ""00000000"" for 20 years.~~
