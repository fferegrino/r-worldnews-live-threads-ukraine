""Wednesday"" came from reports on the call between Biden and NATO leaders last Friday.  So, for example, [Der Spiegel](https://www-spiegel-de.translate.goog/politik/deutschland/krise-in-osteuropa-cia-rechnet-mit-russischem-angriff-kommende-woche-a-2e10a45f-b6eb-4b1a-b692-2edc64c04adf?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) (German paper) first reported on ""Wednesday"" in its report about the calls that day:

>According to SPIEGEL information, both the US secret service CIA and the US military informed the federal government and other NATO states over the course of Friday that, based on new information, there were fears that the attack could take place ***as early as*** next Wednesday.

Of course, it was also last Friday when the US began publicly saying that an invasion could happen ""before the end of the Olympics"" - for example, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/world/europe/president-biden-is-holding-a-call-with-nato-and-eu-leaders-to-discuss-russia-and-ukraine.html):

>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a news conference in Melbourne on Friday that a Russian invasion could even occur before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end on Feb. 20.

Those Friday reports especially kicked off when [PBS' Nick Schifrin reported](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/putin-to-invade-ukraine-next-week-according-to-u-s-officials?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=pbsofficial&utm_campaign=newshour&utm_content=1644609343):

>The United States believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine ***and has communicated those plans to the Russian military***, Western and defense officials have told the PBS NewsHour. 

I emphasized the line in the above quote because I think [this report from ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-troops-moved-firing-positions-ukraine-putin-ready/story?id=82909721) helps elucidate the nature of that communication between Putin and the Russian military:

>In particular, ABC News has learned that Russian leader Vladimir ***Putin had told his military forces to be ready to go by Wednesday, Feb. 16***, but it is still unclear whether he has made a decision to attack his neighbor.

Synthesizing the various reports, it appears that the bit about ""be ready by the 16th"" (i.e. Wednesday) fits with each gloss on the new intelligence that kicked all of this off.  That's why we also frequently see the phrase ""*as early as* the 16th"".  The sources still clearly disagree about whether a decision has been made, and it's possible that the ones saying that it has, such as the PBS report, were reporting the gloss/opinion on that issue of the specific officials who acted as sources.  I.e. Those officials felt like the intelligence showed that a decision had been made, but others could reasonably disagree.

The US reaction would also make sense if this ""be ready by the 16th"" were the key piece of intel, because there's no real conceivable reason for these military preparations to be ""ready"" at that time for anything *but* an invasion.  What else is there to be ready for?

US officials have outright said that their goal in sharing the intelligence was to thwart any surprise attack - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-officials-wont-confirm-reports-possible-russia-invasion-ukraine-wednesday-2022-02-13/):

>Senior U.S. officials on Sunday said they could not confirm reports that U.S. intelligence indicates that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine on Wednesday, but said they would try to prevent any ""surprise attack"" by sharing what they knew of Russia's plans.

TL;DR: My interpretation is that all of this means that the 16th is/was the *opening* of the invasion window according to this new intelligence that broke on Friday, that the key takeaway from that intelligence was that Putin had informed the military to be ready to invade by the 16th, and that it has been entirely unclear since those reports whether that did mean, or has ever meant, that Putin had fully decided *to* invade *on* the 16th.",False,1645018557.0,t3_stmu2a,t3_stmu2a,,0,156,0,156,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

* Attempts to attack are still ongoing. Started with 600k packets of malicious traffic per second, one entity is facing 1m at the moment.

1.) He never intended to launch an invasion, and instead intended to treat this as a pressure campaign to get what he wants out of Ukraine.

2.) People inside his inner circle began pushing back on him. This is extremely rare in a long-established authoritarian autocracy, and while Putin has been in power for a long time, we're not exactly talking about the hapless boobery of the Romanovs. If this is the case, it means that a very important figure inside his inner circle pushed back strongly--my bet would be Lavrov because Lavrov has an extremely long tenure and relationship with Putin, as well as more frequent contacts outside of the sycophantic inner circle.

3.) Russia underestimated Ukrainian readiness. If the rumors from yesterday are true--that the cyber attacks were more widespread and aggressive than just what we did see, and if they were repelled because of additional preparation of the Ukrainian infrastructure and support from the United States, that absolutely must give the military commanders on the ground pause. It speaks to a much greater degree of resilience, above and beyond what the Russian command assumed they'd face from Ukraine. Further, it highlights the Ukrainian willingness to resist, which could make any incursion far more lethal than was initially assumed.

4.) Related to 3--Putin underestimated Western resolve. He fell into the classic authoritarian trap: ""The Western democracies are weak, divided, effete, and liberal--they can never stand up to my strength."" This belief is rooted in autocrats overestimating their external power based on their perceived internal power.

Russia has deployed Tu-22M3 BACKFIRE-C bombers and MiG-31K FOXHOUND jets to Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The move was anticipated and further strengthens anti-ship capabilities in the Mediterranean. The MiG-31Ks are capable of carrying the Kinzhal hypersonic missile. The missile is generally thought to have an anti-warship capability but does not appear to have been test fired in this scenario. 

Reports that the LADA Class submarine Sankt Petersburg has deployed to the Mediterranean are not credible.

Instead of killing each other because some old man we’ve never met said so, nor will he care that he got you killed to inflate his bank account or “legacy”, how about we say no.

Let me brush up your history on the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement).

> Germany had started a low-intensity undeclared war on Czechoslovakia on 17 September 1938. In reaction, the United Kingdom and France on 20 September formally asked Czechoslovakia to cede its territory to Germany, which was followed by Polish territorial demands brought on 21 September and Hungarian on 22 September. Meanwhile, German forces conquered parts of Cheb District and Jeseník District and briefly overran, but were repelled from, dozens of other border counties. Poland also grouped its army units near its common border with Czechoslovakia and also instigated generally unsuccessful sabotage on 23 September. Hungary also moved its troops towards the border with Czechoslovakia, without attacking.

> An emergency meeting of the main European powers – not including Czechoslovakia, although their representatives were present in the town, or the Soviet Union, an ally to both France and Czechoslovakia – took place in Munich, Germany, on 29–30 September 1938. An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler's terms, being signed by the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. The Czechoslovak mountainous borderland that the powers offered to appease Germany had not only marked the natural border between the Czech state and the Germanic states since the early Middle Ages, but it also presented a major natural obstacle to any possible German attack. Having been strengthened by significant border fortifications, the Sudetenland was of absolute strategic importance to Czechoslovakia.

> On 30 September, Czechoslovakia yielded to the combination of military pressure by Germany, Poland and Hungary, and diplomatic pressure by United Kingdom and France, and agreed to give up territory to Germany on Munich terms. Then, on 1 October, Czechoslovakia also accepted Polish territorial demands.

> The Munich Agreement was soon followed by the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938, separating largely Hungarian inhabited territories in southern Slovakia and southern Subcarpathian Rus' from Czechoslovakia. On 30 November 1938 Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland small patches of land in Spiš and Orava regions.

> In March 1939, the First Slovak Republic, a Nazi puppet state, proclaimed its independence. Shortly afterwards, Hitler reneged on his solemn promises to respect the integrity of Czechoslovakia by creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, giving Germany full control of what remained of Czechoslovakia, including its significant military arsenal that later played an important role in Germany's invasions of Poland and France. As a result, Czechoslovakia had disappeared.",False,1645010104.0,t3_stmu2a,t3_stmu2a,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Germany was in the grips of economically bleak austerity, post Treaty of Versailles. They were roused by a populist leader, promising a return to their Empire's former glory.

*Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the world for Putin's actions abroad, the west will never trust or allow them to proliferate due to their past actions.*  


Hitler narrowly stealing his way to power proceeded to seek returning historically owned land to the German nation, grabbing bits piecemeal under the guise of returning the faithful to the fold.  
*Crimea, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia is slowly retaking components of its old empire. Now I have only heard this description specifically from US news media, so I am taking it with a grain of salt that he would even dream of rebuilding the soviet union.*

&#x200B;

The allied nations played a game of appeasement, allowing Hitler to gobble up some smaller nations, and continued to allow him to take more and more at negotiation tables, with the assumption that he would stop once he was done.

*Harsh sanctions have shown western disapproval of Russian conquest, but to date no western nation has directly and openly gone into battle to stop the overtaking of these smaller nations.*

Russia may or may not invade. That's still up in the air. It's looking like he won't do it soon as there are a couple of problems with an invasion.

* They don't have a proper false flag to set a precedent for invasion. They'll need that in order to give Russians rationalizations for killing innocent Ukrainians and the Russian body bags coming back.  
* Just having a big force on Ukraine's border gives Russia what they want, a weakened Ukraine democracy. 
* Russia knows an invasion will only accomplish one goal, a prolonged, bloody war.
* Invading when your enemy thinks you will is a dumb idea.
* Letting your soldiers rest up before an invasion is probably a good idea too. It seems like the Russian forces were rushing yesterday to get everything prepared. 
* War is psychological. The last thing you want to do is invade when an enemy is expecting it. Instead, you want to wear them down mentally (did Ukrainian troops sleep well last night?). Russia already created a huge moment yesterday with the expectation of invasion. Now they can come out with the propaganda ""look, the west was just full of it."" Yesterday's 3am thing (thanks shitty Mirror source) played right into Russia's hand. 
* It seems like the mud is in Ukraine, so invasion can happen any time in the next 6 months and it'll probably make no difference tactically. 

So if Russia is to invade, I'd expect it to come when least expected. Russia already has what they want by sitting on the doorstep with guns.

 Was it because it makes sense to be dependent  on Russia for energy, or was it refused because Trump was in power and that would be a win for trump?

Let’s say 2/3 of those folks we’re gonna get paid no matter where they’re standing, so that cuts it to $10m/day… but there’s some overtime. So ballpark it at $15m/day.

Per diem (food lodging incidentals bullets etc): $30/person/day x 200,000 = $6m

Vehicles: let’s say there are 50,000 vehicles and they average a cost of $250/day each = &12.5m

So that is… uh… $30m+ per day, just based on this conservative est. so I’d say like $200m/week easy.

,stmu2a,hx5q9me,"> The problem we face as individuals is: ""What is fact? What is fiction?""

I'll ease your trouble: The facts are that the Russians have 150k troops on the ground near the border, ready to go at a moments notice. There is an ongoing invasion of Ukraine since the Russian annexation of Crimea. Russia claims to retreat the troops, while in fact there is 0 evidence to support that claim. 


The Russian parliament has voted in favor of recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics which needs to be approved by Putin before the Russian Federation actually recognizes them as such. We can only guess why, but I personally believe that such a recognition is illegitimate and serves one purpose only: It enables Russia to defend ""independent republics"" - technically avoiding ""invading"" Ukraine.


Putin has also claimed there's a genocide going on. There is also 0 evidence to support that claim. 


Furthermore, Putin claims that NATO seeks to threaten Russia by ""forcing"" Ukraine to join the alliance. There is also 0 evidence and the statement is wrong on so many levels. The first error being that nobody is forcing Ukraine to join NATO. In fact, the only country forcing Ukraine's hand with regards to the NATO decision is Russia. The second error is the claim that NATO seeks to threaten Russia. This discussion is muddied by claims of ""whatabout Iraq huh!??"" but these edgelords fail to understand that nobody is threatening Russia - even as the Russians have 150k troops surrounding Ukraine.

\-Serves as the President's principal adviser on U.S. foreign policy;

\-Grants and issues passports to American citizens and exequaturs to foreign consuls in the United States;

He was nominated by President Biden on November 23, 2020; confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 26, 2021; and sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris the following day.Over three decades and three presidential administrations, Mr. Blinken has helped shape U.S. foreign policy to ensure it protects U.S. interests and delivers results for the American people. 

He served as deputy secretary of state for President Barack Obama from 2015 to 2017, and before that, as President Obama’s principal deputy national security advisor. In that role, Mr. Blinken chaired the interagency deputies committee, the main forum for hammering out the administration’s foreign policy.During the first term of the Obama Administration, Mr. Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. This was the continuation of a long professional relationship that stretched back to 2002, when Mr. Blinken began his six-year stint as Democratic staff director for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Then-Senator Biden was the chair of that committee from 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.

During the Clinton Administration, Mr. Blinken served as a member of the National Security Council staff, including two years as the senior director for European affairs, the president’s principal advisor on the countries of Europe, the European Union, and NATO.

In the face of defeat and Russian invasion, Ukraine signed Minsk agreement. Then reneged and Minsk agreement 2 was signed.

The US makes up 1/3 of a continent so U.S. Students spend a lot of time memorizing 50 fucking states and their capitals. Something I'm sure students from other countries don't worry about. 

U.S. students spend a fair amount of time on Western Civ which is mostly Europe and Med/Middle East with exaggerated amount of time spent around 1600-1950's. 

There's plenty of history to study in most countries and the U.S. was one of the most dominant histories of the past 100 years so of course there's going to be some bias there. 

The only thing that's a fair critique is lack of U.S. history on East Asian area where very little is taught outside of Japan in WWII and brief mention of China and the Mongols at various times. 

Still do Chinese students learn about Napoleon? Probably very little if any. 

We should be teaching important lessons from history besides. We focus way too much time memorizing dates and names that don't mean shit later in life. It's the lessons that mattered and why those times are significant.

Trump is Putin's boy he owns Trump and Trump jumps when Putin tells him.

So with that in mind why would putin wait until his puppet who is in charge of most of NATOs muscle (the only ones who could actually stop him from militarily taking Ukraine) is out of office. Wouldn't it make much more sense to invade knowing that your biggest military threat the United States is not a factor. 

Also if anything I find it suspicious that last time a democratic president was in office putin took over parts of Ukraine but when Trump was in power Russia didn't make a move.

Finally if trump really was a puppet to putin he was a terrible puppet because he did more to hurt Russia militarily in the middle east and Eastern Europe than Biden or Obama. When Obama was in office Ukraine only got some food and medical aide. First thing trump did was start giving Ukrainian soldiers AT weapons to fight russian tanks.

The aircraft is the product of the PAK FA (Russian: ПАК ФА, short for: Перспективный авиационный комплекс фронтовой авиации, romanized: Perspektivnyy Aviatsionnyy Kompleks Frontovoy Aviatsii, lit. ''prospective aeronautical complex of front-line air forces'') fighter programme, while Sukhoi's internal designation for the aircraft is T-50. The Su-57 is the first combat aircraft in Russian military service designed with stealth technology.

The Weeds seems slightly more impartial, but the most recent episode discussing the crisis was on 3 Feb. I wasn’t that impressed with the guest, he seemed to speak about solutions to the tension in a really facile way, and spoke about Putin as if he’s not likely to be a highly intelligent and self aware man. He didn’t support the notion you’re putting out at all though- he spoke openly about how the US is treading a careful line between avoiding conflict and not making agreements that can’t or shouldn’t be given. Overall I’d say he was pretty supportive of the stance and direction of the US response, unless I missed some major statement (my attention is pretty divided because I’m at work).

I'm here taking my morning dump and figured I'd give you some advice: You just need more practice bud, it's okay. The thing is, you don't bring anything original to the table. 

""Wut, u mad bro?"" Is for kids and rookies, and if you aren't one like you claim, you can do better. Yet it's the only thing you used. That's boring.
