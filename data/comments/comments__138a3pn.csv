>Appeal by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Command and fighters of the
Wagner PMC to the Chief of the General Staff, the Minister
of Defense, the Supreme Commander and the people of Russia:

>1. On March 16, 2022, we were asked to immediately
defend our Motherland;

>2. On March 19, 2022, all units arrived from various
directions from Africa and entered the first battle;

>3. We independently chose the direction of our offensive, the most prepared fortified area of the Armed Forces of Ukraine;

>4. On May 9, 2022, we took the village of Popasna, giving the
first significant victory in the Donbass:

>5. After a series of failures of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in various sectors of the front, 8 October 2022 together with General of the Army Surovikin
It was decided to conduct the operation ""Bakhmutskaya
meat grinder"";

>6. The operation ""Bakhmut meat grinder"" showed its highest efficiency, diverted a huge amount of enemy forces and
enabled the Russian army to take advantageous defense
lines and continue the offensive;

>7. In September-October 2022, during the flight of units of the Russian Defense Ministry from Krasny Liman, Izyum and Balakleya,
units of the Wagner PMC near Kremennaya held back the enemy's onslaught, occupying a 132 km defense line, as well as a 207 km second
echelon line;

>8. After these events, the units of PMC ""Wagner"" fell out
of favor with envious near-military bureaucrats. An artificial shell hunger began. An attempt was made to create
an artificial personnel shortage;

>9. By May 9, 2023, we were supposed to take Bakhmut, but knowing this, from May 1, near-military bureaucrats practically cut us off from any artillery ammunition;

>10. The units of the Russian Defense Ministry, which are designed to cover our flanks, are having difficulty holding them back. The named number of troops is very different from the real one, there are postscripts: instead of tens of thousands - tens and rarely hundreds of fighters.

>11. The offensive resources of PMC ""Wagner"" ended in early
April, but we are advancing, despite the fact that the enemy forces outnumber us five times. This is with the standards of at least a threefold advantage, which should have been on our side during the offensive;

>12. Due to the lack of ammunition, our losses
are growing exponentially every day, 13. Despite this, the council of commanders of the Wagner PMC
decided to hold positions and continue the offensive on Bakhmut until May 10, 2023, in order to meet the sacred holiday for Russians - May 9, Victory Day with the brilliance of Russian weapons;

>14. I formally address the Chief of the General Staff, the Minister
of Defense, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the people of
Russia. I declare on behalf of the Wagner PMC fighters, on
behalf of the Wagner PMC command, that on May 10, 2023, we are forced to transfer positions in the Bakhmut settlement to units of
the Ministry of Defense and withdraw the remnants of the Wagner PMC to the rear camps to lick their wounds. I am withdrawing
Wagner units from Bakhmut because, in the absence of ammunition,
they are doomed to a senseless death.

>15. I appeal openly, since not a single letter of mine
was considered, I have reported all the problems since March

> RF Armed Forces change plans, again 

> On May 2, the Armed Forces of Ukraine conducted several successful local operations. Sources on both sides confirmed that Ukrainian units in the Avdiivka area advanced towards Spartak and carried out a raid, reaching the Donetsk airport. Then, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation hastily pulled in reinforcements, counterattacked and are holding the southern part of Spartak. The remnants of the DPR militants are fighting there. 

> A successful operation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine south of Bakhmut was also confirmed. Reserves of the RF Armed Forces have also been deployed to that direction. 

> In the Kherson direction, the RF Armed Forces tried to liquidate the bridgeheads of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the left bank, using artillery fire and also inflicting damage on the Ukrainian group on the right bank. As a result, civilians in Kherson itself and its surroundings suffered. 

> In the Zaporozhye region, in the area of ​​Orekhiv, the Armed Forces of Ukraine conducted reconnaissance in force, which the Russian command at first mistook for a full-scale offensive. 

> Recall that the commander of the Russian Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, proposed not to meet the Ukrainian offensive at the front line, but instead, to withdraw troops to the rear, leaving barriers on the front line. He hoped in this way to avoid numerous small encirclements and chaos, to identify the main directions of the enemy’s movement and to strike in response with the forces of troops gathered into a fist. 

> Well, it seems that that plan collapsed under pressure from the political leadership, which—according to sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation—demands to keep the ‘new territories’ and prevent the advance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Fulfilling the new instructions, the Russian troops began to pull the troops that were already withdrawn to the rear in the region of Donetsk, Bakhmut and north of Melitopol. According to one of the Russian sources, heavy artillery is being transferred to the Kherson region in order to intensify strikes against the AFU bridgeheads on the left bank. 

> At the same time, the local headquarters, contrastingly, left the front. According to our information, the headquarters for Donetsk was moved closer to the border with the Rostov region on the night of May 2-3. The following night, the Melitopol headquarters was relocated  ‘towards Crimea.’

> “We are changing plans, again, as we go. One leg goes to the right, the other to the left, and between the legs, our generals are surprised. We have __ [*woman hating slur*] __ , stupidly driving people and equipment back and forth,” says a source at the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces grouping.

First off, Prigozhin staged that scene for maximum impact—I’m certain of it.  

The likelihood those men all (1) died yesterday, (2) in Bakhmut, (3) were all *collected* yesterday, and were (4) immediately all stacked and displayed like that yesterday is zero.

More reasons I find it not credible: (a) Russians don’t collect their dead immediately.  (b) *Especially* from a zone that is getting others killed.  If these guys couldn’t protect themselves, neither could the collection team. And we know it’s not an attack all at once—there’d just be body parts in such a case.  They are in-tact bodies.  (c) And bodies are transported in bags, anyways.   They’re tugging these corpses around by their limbs?  No chance.


In fact, we don’t even know that (d) they were all Wagner, or (e) even all dead, for that matter.

Why?  Two reasons:

What I think—[just as I predicted yesterday immediately after the video was posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1379cy8/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jiwapyd/)
—that it’s public rationale for retreat.   Initially,  I pointed to the fact that he deals in death, he’s not impacted by it, these can’t be emotions from death—he’s wholly indifferent to death.  And so is his supposed target audience in the ‘Arbat Military District’—complete indifference to dead bodies.

But today, I remembered—he wants to keep his other military contracts around the world.  He probably even like his UA lane hardened—so this has to be about (1) leaving on a high note, before UA pushes them out, explained above, and because (2) Prigozhin wants control of his supplies—he wants to be able to directly negotiate with the Russian defense sector, and the MOD wouldn’t be the middleman.  As of now, PMCs are funded by the [MOD budget](https://fakty-ua.translate.goog/ru/413702-prigozhin-formiruet-v-chvk-vagner-brigady-kotorye-v-chas-ch-budut-gotovy-k-reshitelnym-dejstviyam-vnutri-rossii?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), and it makes them dependent on the MOD, who is indeed starving them of weapons (@VolyaMedia).  Iirc, he can contract directly with arms suppliers for other missions, like in Africa.  But he’s not allowed to “compete with” RF MOD. **He wants full liberty to contract directly with the Russian defense sector and compete with the RF MOD**.

It is clear the intent of the Kremlin drone attack was to stop the May 9 parade.

And the number one suspect is Putin.

Putin doesn’t want to do the May 9 parade. It’s going to be another propaganda own-goal.

The bunker gnome will be sitting in public view for several hours. The most entertaining thing will be waiting and watching to see if he gets a rifle bullet to the head.

Threat of assassination aside, it is very likely the parade will get bombed in some way. There’s a host of threats: vigilante Russians, partisans in Moscow, misfiring Russian air defence, and of course UAVs coming long distance from Ukraine.

Even if that doesn’t happen, the likelihood of there being audible air defence in the background is extremely high, and I don’t think that’s the look Putin is going for.

If by some miracle there isn’t a discernible attack, then there’s the issue of having enough trained non-dead or non-amputee soldiers to March, enough equipment spare to roll out, and the T14s not breaking down.

In short, I don’t think it is going to happen.

Putin needed the drone strike to call off the May 9 parade without the country going into uproar.

_____

Ok so for the record, the best sources for what’s happening in Zaporizhye behind enemy lines are (1) Mayor Federov, and (2) Ria-Melitopol [pro-Ukraine].  (Note both employ loads of sarcasm, so can seem not credible, but it’s how they cope w being occupied...) These are who the Ukrainians trust, and these two often quote each other. (And to a lesser extent, the Zaporizhye OVA channel, though they focus more on humanitarian..)

So Ria M says several things.

That the mandatory applied to children and elderly.  (Previously, parents were to go with their kids.  This announcement seems would allow separation...)  [Claims headed to Berdyansk](https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/318735/v_zaporojskoy_oblasti_deti_doljnyi_vyiehat_na_otdyih_v_berdyansk_podrobnosti.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

That there’s [traffic jams](https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/318736/cherez_melitopol_uvelichilsya_potok_transporta_na_granitse_s_kryimom_obrazovalsya_zator_(video).html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) out of Melitopol. Another from Berdyansk down to Crimea 

There’s [lines as gas stations](https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/318724/gotovyatsya_v_melitopole_okkupantyi_zapravlyayut_vse_mashinyi_i_razdayut_trudovyie_knijki.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
 and folks are stalking up on water.

Children are supposed to be [evacuated](https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/318724/gotovyatsya_v_melitopole_okkupantyi_zapravlyayut_vse_mashinyi_i_razdayut_trudovyie_knijki.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

> First of all, children are taken out, but local collaborators are also allowed to take seats on buses.

> In Energodar, parents were told to pick up their children from kindergartens and schools. Those for whom they did not come are kept in basements. Local residents collect disturbing suitcases and stock up on water.

That people are already [hiding their children](https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/318727/pod_melitopolem_lyudi_pryachut_detey_ot_orkov.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

> But the concern for the population, as always, turned out to be window dressing. According to local residents, 40 buses left Berdyansk for evacuation today. Later, the busses were seen on the Zaporozhye-Mariupol highway, accompanied by Russian soldiers. It is noteworthy that half of the transport was empty. Considering that there are only 30-40 seats in each bus, one can imagine what a ""huge"" number of people the invaders are ready to ""rescue.""

> In Melitopol, evacuation has not yet been announced. However, local residents need to think about their own safety and try to go to a safe place.

Prigozhin admitted to founding Wagner and is running it 5 or so months ago.  Now Mikhail Mizintsev (Deputy Minister of Defense), who was fired a little over a week ago, is top echelon of Wagner.  Crazy videos of Prigozhin calling out Shoigu, including calling him a ""faggot"" (huge insult in Russia) and claiming he was coming for him, and the classic scorched earth (phosphorus bombs) blanketing Bahkmut.

Shits gonna be spicy.  Oh, and Prigozhim sent a letter to the MOD that he was pulling out troops on 5/10, respecting the countries Victory day (be like pulling out troops in a losing war on July 5th in the USA).  Russians love paperwork.

Spicy. Now, they are shaping the Russian population for total loss, including the idea that Crimea is gone.  But not at Putins fault.

Almost as if every major news organization is posting ""Head of Wagner says they plan to withdraw...""

I think two of the issues that are causing problems is referring to Prigozhin as ""the head"" of Wagner, and the other being, calling Wagner a ""private"" mercenary army.'

Prigozhin is the **public facing** head of Wagner, in order to separate its activities from Putin, I.E. ""The state isn't responsible for deaths among Wagner Troops, it's a private unit"" or ""It wasn't The Kremlin that ordered Wagner to attack US troops in Syria, they are a private military unit"".

Wagner isn't a ""private"" merc unit.

Yeah, it’s pretty clear the intent was to stop the May 9 parade.

I think it’s pretty obvious Putin doesn’t want to do the May 9 parade. It’s going to be another propaganda own-goal.

Threat of assassination aside, it very likely the parade with get bombed in some way. There’s a host of threats: vigilante Russians, partisans in Moscow, misfiring Russian air defence, UAVs coming long distance from Ukraine.

Even if that doesn’t happen, the likelihood of there being audible air defence in the background is extremely high, and I don’t think that’s the look Putin is going for.

If by some miracle there isn’t a discernible attack, then there’s the issue of having enough trained people to March, enough equipment spare to roll out, and the T14s not breaking down.

In short, I don’t think it is going to happen.

Putin’s needed the drone strike to call of the May 9 parade.

There was a virtually 100% chance that Moscow was going to launch some sort of retaliatory strike for the Kremlin drone bombing. They had to. 

Russia is using Khinzhal because they are running out of any other sort of guided missile. They’re using fixed wing adjustments to rig dumb bombs into guided missiles - that’s in all likelihood why they accidentally dropped a bomb on Belgorod a couple of weeks ago - they fired over Russia territory to evade Ukrainian air defense, the wings failed to deploy and the bomb  dropped straight down. 

Khinzhals and other nuclear capable (emphasis on CAPABLE, not armed) missiles have been used in this conflict before, because the Russians are throwing absolutely everything they have in storage at Ukraine. 

Look, here’s the best argument against a surprise nuclear attack. I’m not saying it’s impossible, because nothing is impossible, and the Russian armed forces are stupid, corrupt and reckless. But here’s the counter argument. 

The second a nuclear bomb is used offensively against another country, in this case Ukraine, for the first time since World War II, the defense structure of the entire world changes instantaneously. This process will be vast in scope and largely automatic. The United States will move to DEFCON 2. Nuclear weapons will be readied in silos. The nuclear submarines of every country in NATO will leave port and go silent. Russia’s nuclear submarines will be tracked at sea and targeted in port. Nuclear weapons will be loaded into long range bombers and fighter jets will take off from every country that has a functional Air Force. 

OK, so in this scenario you’re describing, none of that has happened yet, right?  But you’re Russia, you’ve got two nuclear bombs on the tarmac, ready to drop on Kyiv.  You know that the second those bombs go off - even if you’ve taken the world COMPLETELY by surprise and they weren’t tracking the bombs the second they came out of storage or the moment the plane took off, you go in the nuclear crosshairs of every nation on earth, even purported allies like India and China. 

So what do you do?  You’re the only one who knows the world is about to change. Do you leave some of your submarines in port, leave bombs in storage, change nothing about your nuclear posture just to make it an extra-special surprise?  Or do you drastically level up your nuclear readiness, so that you’re ready for the stand-off?

Surprise is great to win battles, but in this case surprise means accidents. A nuclear launch that surprises the West drastically increases the chances of a general exchange that turns Russia (and most of the Northern Hemisphere) into a glowing radioactive slurry. 

Again: not impossible. They are very, very stupid. But if they’re in a suicide-committing mood, there are more likely ways to go about it.",False,1683298798.0,t3_138a3pn,t1_jiyapsu,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

No, that would be a meme-level understanding of the war rather than an attempt to actually understand what's been going on. Russia has a much lower threshold than the West for when they are willing to massacre civilians, but their preference is that they would rather avoid unnecessary civilian death when they believe they can. That's why they didn't start the war with a terror campaign but reverted to one when they started taking losses. At Mariupol, their choices were to hold off sieging the city or kill civilians, so they chose to go in and let the civilians die. When it comes to Southern Ukraine, they will attempt to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from areas they expect to see heavy fighting, because there's nothing they have to gain by killing all of them and making themselves look even worse.

In a much less eloquent way that’s what I was saying, I just don’t think that organization and the goons that run it have anything but power on their minds and their isn’t much hope for them. The world should stand up against the evil in the US instead of mocking it. 

I see the world right now being a sucker for click bait and would rather make fun of the US like it’s some middle school playground than stand up and stand behind the US and hopes we fail. Whether or not one wants to admit it, a troubled US is a troubled world. Consider the war in Ukraine, the US has sent more than 10x the largest individual country aid in bilateral commitments, 3x all of EU shared commitments, and 2x of all major contributors including the EU shared commitments. Meanwhile that is still on par from a GDP contribution with the majority of other major contributors…i.e there’s a lot more where that comes from when that only represents less than half a percent of GDP (also consider a huge amount of our GDP is in military spending). 

An example of the world mockery is that plenty of us fight for tighter gun laws and we let a private organization buy off another private organization (the NRA and the GOP) and then convince their constituents that’s what they should stand for. Going further into that example in my state gun laws are at a level that has been pushed for federally and would make a world of difference, and doesn’t involve stripping everyone of their guns or rights to have one, yet people of my state are convinced those federal laws are an injustice to them and they are going to lose their rights and have zero clue that it would mean zero changes for them.

How about in Obama’s last term where they refused to do their job and vet out his nominated SC justice?

They have lost huge amounts of troops in Ukraine, cannon fodder and experienced.

Maybe they just don't hold up in actual war.  It's one thing to decimate isis or rebelling Syrian groups, it's another to find yourself fighting an equal enemy, as they've found in the UA.

For example, you won't intercept a hypersonic missile with an Aster-15 or Aster-30. But will you with the BMD versions.   

Patriot is a system of systems with a variety of different missiles designed for different target types.   

What do you think the Kinzhal is? It's a ballistic missile, it isn't a manoeuvring hypersonic glide vehicle.",False,1683282248.0,t3_138a3pn,t1_jiy1aq3,,6,8,0,8,0,0,

I disagreed with the first half of your post because it doesn't make sense given all of their war actions so far that RU would go through the trouble of organizing the evacuation of civilians because they care about their welfare in the event of a massive shelling defense situation as proposed. Organizing active evacuations is a cost in planning and resources that could go toward other endeavors. If there were no other considerations, I expect they'd be fine to leave them right where they are and let them get caught in the crossfire if they happen to be in the way. Tons of examples of this behavior throughout this invasion.

( I was stationed at one of the monitoring locations in the 90s, but who knows what cool stuff its replacement, [SBIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-Based_Infrared_System) can do).

Aircraft caring Kinzhals can loiter outside of their target's airspace where the distance is much, much shorter to the target.  Even if being shadowed by interceptor aircraft, does NATO have anything in their arsenal that can catch one from the side, or behind after its launched?  Can it close the distance in time?

Kinzhals, even if just moving at Mach 4, only give the target just over 2 minutes warning from 175km away.  Less than a minute at its supposed maximum range at Mack 10.  And if the missile has a nuclear warhead, even a tactical one....

But my point was more about the press using the panic to ""sell copy"" rather than believing the thing actually worked as stated.  Nor do I think Putin or the Oligarchs have the balls to launch nukes.
