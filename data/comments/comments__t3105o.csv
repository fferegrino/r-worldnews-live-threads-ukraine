> But a handful of key leaders — notably including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — were reluctant to proceed with some of the harshest proposals.

> Then Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dialed into the meeting . . .  In just five minutes, Zelensky — speaking from the battlefield of Kyiv — pleaded with European leaders for an honest assessment of his country’s ambition to join the E.U. and for genuine help in its fight with the Russian invaders. Food, ammunition, fuel, sanctions — Ukraine needed its European neighbors to step up with all of it.

> Just that quickly, the Ukrainian president’s personal appeal overwhelmed European leaders’ resistance to imposing measures that could drive the Russian economy into a state of near collapse.

The peace movement has been very strong in Germany for obvious reasons. There were not few people to call for the Army to be disbanded all together. Every debate to up military budget by a single € was a month-long struggle and increasing military budget was a surefire way to tank opinion of the party doing it. The military is almost invisible in Germany. Most soldiers do their best to hide their occupation. Almost nobody wears uniform unless in the barracks.

Today, the decision was taken to massively rearm Germany, in a way not seen since the height of the cold war. In back then it was drawn-out, far slower build up. The last time such an investment in military was announced was in the 1930s.

There has been no debate, no outcry. Just the government stating that Germany is rearming. I think for outsiders this may be not the biggest news, but as a German, this is the on the same level as Switzerland ditching neutrality or the US taking over the metric system.

More bad economic news for Putin.

The European Central Bank said on Monday morning that Sberbank Europe, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sberbank Russia, which in turn is majority-owned by the Russian state, is failing or likely to fail along with its Croatian and Slovenian units.

“Sberbank Europe AG and its subsidiaries experienced significant deposit outflows as a result of the reputational impact of geopolitical tensions,” the ECB said in a statement. “This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position.

“There are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position at group level and in each of its subsidiaries within the banking union.”

My parents are hardcore FoxNews conservatives. FoxNews, Newsmax, and paying directly for Bill O’Reilly. For years I have tried to get them out of that bubble, to get some less-biased perspectives on politics and news.

Enter this conflict. They were frustrated with looping footage and breaking alerts and people selling fear and tension, so I pointed them in the direction of France24, Al Jezeera, and DW. We’ve spent the last two days talking about how news outside of the US is full of calm, rational people, basic fact reporting, meaningful interviews with people who are involved in a given situation, fewer commercials, less yelling, less anger, and overall just a better quality broadcast.

We're on Day 5. Ukraine is still fighting relentlessly. A couple days ago, it was being predicted that Zelinskyy would be dead by daytime. He's still alive, and still boosting the morale of his people. No major Ukrainian cities have fallen, most reported events have been in Ukraine's favor - although it is always difficult to say what is psyops and what is truth, reports by both the West and Ukraine, along with the lack of reports by Russian media, suggest that this war is indeed going very badly for Russia.

Russia has been humiliated on the world stage. Any illusion that their army is somehow ""invincible"" has been shattered. Putin has been revealed once and for all as a spineless, cowardly, deranged bully with other cowards backing him, and his population at home is speaking up as well - the protests are still ramping up in size and strength as information slips through the cracks of the struggling propaganda machine. There has been [red dye thrown where a tsar was assassinated](https://twitter.com/burgessct/status/1497586743872131074), and the Ukrainian information machine has been ramping up its attempts to reach out to them by [establishing ways to get them to know what's been going on](https://www.barrons.com/news/ukraine-launches-website-for-russians-to-find-killed-soldiers-01645959609?tesla=y).

Better yet, all of this is Putin's fault. His ego and overconfidence, and the corruption within his own forces that are a direct result of his corrupt regime, have led him to both severely underestimate the Ukrainians, and overestimate his own strengths. Every single outward result of this war, for the moment, has been in direct opposition to what he seemed to want: NATO is stronger, Eastern European states are closer to them, and Ukraine's Zelinskyy has gained international respect. The US intelligence revealed Putin's plans every step of the way, leading Joe Biden's government to seem to have outsmarted him, and his depraved troll army have been ineffective at countering it.

I'm going to bed, but Ukraine has been absolutely amazing in this. No matter the outcome of this revolting attempt by a fascist dictator at stamping out another nation, they'll go down in the history books. Their resolve has been fantastic, and for once, the war crimes by a major power may remain in the world's spotlight for some time.

Although this is a terrible time for Ukraine, and I'm afraid that they may not last long (or that Putin may resort to deadlier methods), this was not the crushing, desperate defeat I think most were expecting it to be.",False,1646005434.0,t3_t3105o,t3_t3105o,,0,82,0,82,0,0,

As for nukes - it's extremely unlikely anything happens. And even in the highly unlikely event it does, it's even more unlikely it escalates to a global level. Russian oligarchs and other higher-ups around Putin probably would not let him carry out any nuclear attacks knowing it would spell their demise.

Besides, nobody knows how well the Russian nuclear machine would function (their military showing has been unimpressive and far below what their expected capabilities are). Plus the US and other Western countries have spent decades improving missile defenses, and nobody knows the actuality of what their real capabilities are (likely higher than the public numbers).

Vitali Klitschko ordered a curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8am Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorised person outside during this time could be considered a saboteur.

“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,” Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian saboteurs were killed Saturday night.

Russian troops’ advance on the city has been slower than many military experts had expected but the overall Russian military advantage is well-known to all.

“I just talked to the president (Zelenskiy). Everybody is not feeling so well,” Klitschko said, adding that city government employees were in shock but not depressed. “We show our character, our knowledge, our values.”

There's a lot of logistics involved before that point and you'd hope like previous ''scares'' in history that people would refuse to launch, like the radar glitch that showed the US had launched Nukes against the USSR; even if it means they get shot as a result.

Because lets face it - wouldn't you rather die that way refusing to facilitate the launch, even if NATO fought in Ukraine - even if NATO invaded Russia itself? Because complying with that means not only are you dead anyway, but your family is, your country is gone, and humanity almost certainly nearly is, apart from some vague holdouts.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646005063.0,t3_t3105o,t3_t3105o,,0,53,0,53,1,0,

The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars also tumbled, while the safe-haven yen rallied as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, the fourth day of the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.

The euro declined 1.15% to $1.1140 in early Asian trading, on track for its biggest one-day decline in nearly two years.

The rouble was indicated as low as 104 per dollar, a more than 19% tumble.

The Aussie slid 0.98% to $0.71625, while New Zealand’s kiwi lost 1.10% to $0.66630.

The yen climbed 0.36% to 115.06 per dollar.

Roughly translated:

> A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, intra-Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to gain a foothold for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said

> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

> The first would always be a complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

> Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations

> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

> Russia has formed a delegation to negotiate with Ukraine

> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? In the fact that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. After that, swinging at Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe alone, did not have the strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is coming back.

> Russia brought to Ukraine an agreement to organize negotiations, Peskov said

> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation brings huge costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

> Russia's rights in the Council of Europe have been suspended

> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.

> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

> No one in Europe wants to fight Russia, said the French Defense Minister

> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646006116.0,t3_t3105o,t3_t3105o,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

I don’t see much night vision or IR lasers for night fighting, 90% of their weapons don’t even have modern optics mounted. This is slightly unusual because when they invaded in 2014 and later in Syria the were using better gear than now.

Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

addition: men 18-60 are no longer allowed to leave

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

I want to say that the whole set of restrictions against Russia is so absurd that we can only laugh at these fruitless attempts. They froze the void there. Complete confusion!

And yet, despite all this comedy, the time has come for tough revenge, and measures must be mirrored. For comparison, they should look like this:

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Eurodiplomacy Josep Borrell must renounce their statements, otherwise the Chechen Republic, given the impudent and pretentious nature of the statements of the above persons, reserves the right introduce the following sanctions:

- Close the Chechen sky for the flights of their jets;
- Freeze all of Johnson's ruble assets in Chechen banks;
- Introduce an embargo on all assets of the British oligarchs in Achkhoy-Martan, and in case of deterioration - in Samashki;
- Recognize the left-hand drive movement as a vile relic of the Middle Ages;
- And to admit, finally, that there is no English tea!

I just imagine Russia getting mad and NATO telling Russia “technically, we’re not fighting you so can’t do anything to us” and Russia is just like “this is bullshit!!”

I get the whole not sending our own troops in to potentially die but we could fire from a distance or send our own drones if that was the issue

So, the last few days have given my an idea - mind you, this is just an opinion, nothing I'm claiming as fact - that the US has actually been playing rope-a-dope for the last few decades. 

Letting is seem like Putin was a master tactician. 

Not doing too much to stop his constant crimes against Eastern Europe and the rest of the world. 

Even looking the other way (mostly) when he interfered with our elections. 

All because they knew - or at least some key policy makers knew - that he was going to eventually overextend himself. 

The best way to get rid of a powerful enemy is to give them enough rope to hang themselves. 

And Putin has been given all the rope, and is now in the clusterfuck of all clusterfucks. 

It's cold calculous, and I hate that so many lives have been lost and ruined. But when you're dealing with a potential global threat, while trying to maintain order, and minimize hurting millions of people, you have to play the long con. And if that's the case, the US actually played this beautifully.

Another fun fact: a little while ago, the password for road signs in the US was `DOTS` (Department of Transportation Services). Get yourself a vest and a hardhat and you can make signs say whatever you want; the lock is trivial to pick (if it's locked at all). The hardest part is walking away when you're done, since as long as you're near the computer people seem to think you're ""fixing"" it. If you walk away from a road sign saying the wrong thing, people start asking questions.

But according to the Levada Center polling group, only 32 percent of Russians had savings as of October. Because Russians are paid in rubles, the value of their salaries in real terms stands to drop dramatically.  
  
Putin has long presented his rule as the stable alternative to the chaos of the 1990s. In an interview two years ago with the Russian state news agency Tass, Putin said that during the 2008 global financial crisis, he thought, “What I will not allow is a repeat of the 1998 situation, when all citizens completely lost their savings.”  
  
In 2014, Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine coincided with a precipitous drop in oil prices. In December of that year, Moscow faced a currency crisis that saw the ruble plummet and forced the Russian central bank to raise its key interest rate from under 11 percent to 17 percent in a single day.  
  
Since then, Russia has tried to build an economy that is less dependent on imports, particularly in the food sector, to soften the blow of such shocks. But Russia largely doesn’t manufacture consumer goods such as cars, electronics, computers and appliances, leaving consumers vulnerable to sudden price hikes as the ruble sinks.  
  
Russian markets plummet amid broader sanctions fears  
  
If it does, the seeds of Russia’s latest economic catastrophe will have been sown over the past week, as European officials gradually faced a reckoning. At the same time, President Biden during a White House news conference, when asked why the West had not taken action to lock Russia out of SWIFT, replied, “Right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.”  
  
The increased popular demand for a strong response, including by kicking Russia out of SWIFT, and Biden’s calling out of Europe “really ramped up the pressure” to act, said one person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. Without SWIFT, Russian institutions will be forced to fall back on telex and other less convenient and more costly alternatives.  
  
One European official said that there had been “uninterrupted communication” between the technocrats of the European Commission and the White House in recent days as they tried to coordinate the complex choreography of the sanctions measures.

But a handful of key leaders — notably including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — were reluctant to proceed with some of the harshest proposals. Scholz told reporters on the way into the meeting in Brussels that he wanted to focus on implementing sanctions that had already been approved before enacting new ones.  
  
After a perfunctory debate, the presidents and prime ministers quickly approved sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and some of Russia’s biggest banks. Talk of barring Russia from the global financial messaging system known as SWIFT, however, stalled amid skepticism on the part of Scholz and the leaders of Austria, Italy and Cyprus, according to officials familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations.  
  
Then Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dialed into the meeting via teleconference with a bracing appeal that left some of the world-weary politicians with watery eyes. In just five minutes, Zelensky — speaking from the battlefield of Kyiv — pleaded with European leaders for an honest assessment of his country’s ambition to join the E.U. and for genuine help in its fight with the Russian invaders. Food, ammunition, fuel, sanctions — Ukraine needed its European neighbors to step up with all of it.

“It was extremely, extremely emotional,” said a European official briefed on the call. “He was essentially saying: ‘Look, we are here dying for European ideals.”  
  
Before disconnecting the video call, Zelensky told the gathering matter-of-factly that it might be the last time they saw him alive, according to a senior E.U. official who was present.  
  
Just that quickly, the Ukrainian president’s personal appeal overwhelmed European leaders’ resistance to imposing measures that could drive the Russian economy into a state of near collapse. The result has been a rapid-fire series of developments boosting Ukraine’s fight to hold off the Russian military and shattering long-standing limits on European assertiveness in national security affairs.  
  
The actions culminated on Saturday, when the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union announced they would bar several major Russian banks from the global financial messaging system known as SWIFT, crack down on Russian oligarchs, and prevent the Russian central bank from bailing out the domestic economy. The unprecedented moves led Russians to crowd ATMs in a desperate bid to withdraw cash and sparked a furious response from Putin, who called them “illegitimate” and ordered his nuclear forces to a higher state of alert.  
  
Surprised by the unusually rapid European decision, the White House scrambled over the weekend to catch up in drafting its own related measures, according to one American and one European official. The latest sanctions mean the Western allies are effectively waging financial war against Russia, matching Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine with attacks on the foundation of a $1.5 trillion economy.

“The Russian ruble has been crushed and it’s going to get crushed further,” said Chandler.

For the kleptocrats basically it's very difficult for a business to be really successful without being owned by one of the Oligarchs to operate in Russia. So, independent entrepreneurs get the fuck out of Russia, and start up businesses in the US or EU. 

For the engineering problem, they are faced with a similar issue, many (not all) of the smart people who would otherwise join a company in Russia, and ""retire"" to teach new engineers are getting the fuck out of Russia. Furthermore, there isn't as much funding in the State to keep the engineers on staff... even for military advancements.

This obligation of mutual defence is binding on all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries which are NATO members.

To begin with, the quality of their arsenal isn't certain, but it's incredibly unlikely they can actually deploy all their warheads. Look at the disrepair we've seen with their conventional military hardware in Ukraine and consider the expense of maintaining a submarine with nuclear payloads. Has Russia been able to keep all their weapons launch ready despite decades of economic difficulties and cut military spending? Probably not, which means they have to be more particular about where to use them. 

Second, the number of sites they'd have to target effectively to win a war is enormous. We all tend to shorthand a potential WWIII as Russia vs the United States, but NATO has two other nuclear powers, France and the UK, which Russia would need to destroy simultaneously in a first strike scenario. A nuclear war is almost surely followed up with a conventional conflict with NATO ground forces, which means Russia also has to disable non-nuclear militaries all across western Europe as well as the 400,000 strong Turkish force. That's a vast amount of opposition that Russia has to account for, all of which will be hellbent on their defeat.

Lastly, the primary targets in a first strike situation are going to be military in nature, particularly American nuclear launch facilities, air bases and hardened command and control points, etc. As a rule, US nuclear weapons are either mobile or stationed far away from population centers, with permanent silos in empty stretches of North Dakota, Wyoming, etc. That's where Russian warheads will be going, because those are the things that can punch back. Cities like New York and LA may end up as secondary targets because of the economic damage their loss would inflict, but the Russians aren't going to waste an ICBM on irradiating Cleveland, as there's no military advantage in doing so.

Usually this will lead to either a period of sustained readiness, with a combined stand down from both nations in tandem. 

Secondly, Putin doesn’t have a big red button in his desk he pushes, there is a chain of command that is followed for any launch. Thankfully, that does involve humans and funnily enough, when humans are asked to wipe out all life on earth as we know it, they don’t tend to ‘simply follow orders’. One of the greatest weakness of nuclear weapons is simply they’re controlled by humans, and most humans are pretty rational.

Using nukes against Ukraine means destruction of the place he’s trying to control, effectively rendering the entire place inhabitable, thus eliminating the entire purpose of the invasion.

Yes. A lot. The US' nuclear missile stockpile is estimated to cost [a little over $60 billion per year](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57240). It costs money to train technicians, maintain security, test everything to make sure it works, replace worn-out parts, and on and on and on.

My scorching hot take is that the vast majority of Russia's nuclear stockpiles are nonfunctional, but there's no way to tell, you only need one of 'em to kill 5.8 metric fuckloads of people, and ""Well, we might only lose a few cities instead of ending all of human civilization"" isn't exactly the most rewarding calculus of foreign policy.",False,1646005959.0,t3_t3105o,t1_hyplcbf,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

There are also a couple other missile defense systems (THAAD, AEGIS) that could be used to attempt to intercept ICBM's but the success rate would be even lower.

Overall, the US could intercept maybe ~20 warheads total. The defense system is mainly designed for a small attack from a rogue state like North Korea or Iran. A full on attack from Russia would absolutely be unblockable and devastating.

I try to give those posters the benefit of the doubt here as well due to this same factor, e.g. I would expect many of the people posting about Myanmar here are likely from SEA or have close ties to someone who does, so there's a perceived unfairness/frustration that Ukraine is getting a lot of the west's attention/help when they've pretty much been left on their own. People in tough situations will misattribute blame to racism, they're wrong but hey I get that they're frustrated.

The aircraft supplied to Ukraine are the same type they are/were operating until the war; MiG-29s.
A total of 11 aircraft.

Former Warsaw Pact nations within the EU, such as Poland and Slovakia operate a small number of these aircraft, which are pending replacement.

Gifting these to Ukraine, means Ukranian AF pilots can operate them near immediately, because they will require nearly no retraining, since they differ minimally from their own destroyed MiG-29s.

Sending other aircraft is no use, because they would require months of retraining for Ukrainian AF pilots.

Since combat pilots in EU Air Forces sign on for a minimum of 8 to 12 years, they are often near combat flying retirement age when bowing out of service.
They sometimes remain in service as commanders and “desk pilots” in bureaucratic and commanding roles afterwards. If not, they often become commercial pilots, losing currency on the fighter aircraft.

45 year old ex-fighter pilots flying Airbuses or Boeings for KLM, Air France, etc. are not the kind to become mercenaries.

It's not possible to use nukes unexpectedly, unless it's one you can pack into a van and drive to the target. ICBMs have a sub-orbital trajectory and from launch to impact would typically take 30 minutes. Even if Russia launched every single one of their missiles at the US, the US would have every one of theirs in the air before the Russian ones landed. That's why MAD is *mutually assured* destruction; one launches their nukes, the target also launches theirs, guaranteeing anihilation. Also, the US has nuclear triad whereby its capabilities are from silos, submarines and aircraft. Russia couldn't even hope to destroy enough of the US (or anyone else's assets) that the retaliation won't be all-encompassing.

Ukraine are using Javelins they received from the US to great effect.

If Russia invaded, lets say Poland, the entire European Airforce, would inside of a couple of hours, make them pay for setting one step over the border. Europe wouldn't use Nukes, cause they don't have to. The Russian army would crumble inside of 2 weeks. Europe wouldn't shoot nukes, and if Russia starts to use them, then well, I'm gonna grab as many bottlecaps as I can.

I do not believe that either Nato or Russia want to win the peace in a nuclear winter. I do not think that even if there is a war between Nato and Russia, it would become a nuclear war.

The amount of fissile material in even  large bombs is relatively little. Obviously not good to be spreading that stuff around, but not so bad.

> successfully intercepted

Unfortunately you're going to want to temper your expectations here. ICBMs are typically MIRV-type delivery systems, with each deployed missile containing many warheads. As an additional measure, they will have many dummy warheads to eat up defense system capacity.

Russia also fields nuclear subs with lower vectors of attack and shorter travel times, which are also difficult to intercept.

They also have nuclear torpedoes, which when detonated off the coast can produce a tidal wave 500m tall, that spreads radioactive material across the entire area of devastation. Unless something stops the torpedo before it detonates - underwater, miles off the coast - the damage will be done.

However it won’t be the same as a nuke hitting near the ground and irradiating all the debris that will spread in the form of fallout.

Asked by German broadcaster ARD whether he could imagine letting nuclear plants run longer than planned under Germany's exit plan, which foresees shutting down the country's three remaining plans by the end of 2022, Robert Habeck said: ""It is part of my ministry's tasks to answer this question. I would not reject it on ideological grounds - but the preliminary examination has shown that it does not help us.""

Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim 2 remain the last nuclear plants that produce power in Germany after the country a decade ago decided to phase out the fuel in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster.

The three plants are owned by German energy firms E.ON (EONGn.DE), RWE (RWEG.DE) and EnBW (EBKG.DE), respectively. Habeck said the three operators have pointed out that extending the life-spans would not help for the 2022/23 winter season.

""Because the preparations for the shutdowns are already so far advanced that the nuclear power plants could only continue to operate under the highest safety concerns and possibly with fuel supplies that have not yet been secured,"" Habeck said.

And the real danger of nukes is that it may not only be one, so multiple targets means more chance of missing, and one miss means a disaster. That's why Iron Dome/Star Wars protection isn't realistic for large scale attacks, it has to be 100% effective, or it's not effective at all. Iron Dome looks to be rated 90% historically, and that's considered exceptionally high for such systems. It's better than Patriot.

A counter to a known defense system is to launch swarms of missiles at once, and perhaps with many of them non-armed rockets to ""waste"" the defensive hits and improve the odds of the nuclear ones.

402851388ac1858cf6fcc82823c39a3c,t3105o,hypq0f1,"A more realistic answer would probably be: It depends.    

I’m not an expert in this but I have a degree in political science and have taken multiple national security and international relations classes. But I’m still just a random person on the internet so like… yeah.     

Anyway, if Russia dropped a nuke on Ukraine and you don’t live in or near Ukraine you’ll probably be fine. At least for a little while.    

I think they’d only use one nuke, if they are going to nukes at all, because of what a huge escalation it would be. One nuke would send the message loud and clear all on its own. 

The US or any other nuclear power would probably not immediately retaliate with nukes. Putin would claim it’s a dispute between Russia and Ukraine and that nobody else should get involved. And the rest of the world will have to ask themselves whether we should end the world to retaliate for Russia nuking a Ukrainian city.    

I think the nuclear states would decide against nuking Russia in response. But I think damn near the entire world would come together, way more than we already have, to isolate Russia from the world more than even North Korea is. Zero trade with Russia. And I mean zero. Not allowing Russia to fly in any other country’s airspace on Earth. Sanctions that make the recent ones look like nothing.    

This would pretty much ensure Russia collapses in the near future.    

Russia, at that point, may start threatening to nuke countries if they don’t reverse the new sanctions. Who knows if they’d actually follow through though. If they do, that’ll probably happen years down the line. So I guess move to the middle of nowhere and get ready for the looming apocalypse.      

That’s all assuming Putin remains dictator of Russia. If he launches a nuke, or even tries to, I think someone in his inner circle would take him out. The Russian oligarchs just want money. They want to keep doing business and living like kings. That’s all they care about. They don’t give a shit about Putin’s dreams of rebuilding the Soviet Union. They’re not going to die for that.      

However… if Putin drops a nuke on a NATO country… all you can do is make peace and prepare for the end. Because you might have under an hour to live once that happens.",False,1646007708.0,t3_t3105o,t1_hypn5kc,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The current model of nuclear deterence of most nuclear nations is one where the statement 'If there is no *insert nation*, then there should be no world' is evaluated as true. So should a nuke be launched every other nuclear nation retaliates against the nation launching, which cascades because then nations see the US launching for example and lob a missile our way as well. This leads to the death of more or less the entirety of the human race between initial explosions, nuclear fallout, radiation sickness and then nuclear winter. Depending on the targeting of the missiles some remote places may survive, but it effectly neutralizes the last two thousand or so years of human history. But the US will be gone because there is likely a nuke aimed at every major population center AND military bases, which means even states like North Dakota, Utah and Idaho are going to get hit.

Now, it is highly, highly unlikely to come to this as I believe the Russian high command will execute Putin before they allow a launch, but in that very unlikely scenario, the human race functionally ends.",False,1646007773.0,t3_t3105o,t1_hypn5kc,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

I saw you continuously interacting with other hive mind discussions and ignoring what seemed to be the one potential constructive conversation at the time. Call me crazy but why would someone do that? Why? Why would someone who has shown so much effort to be a part of a discussion on this specific topic retract themselves? Do you do this in “college”? 

When someone has a differing opinion in “lecture” do you just walk away and pretend like you don’t hear them? I understand walking away from being berated. Who likes that? But that wasn’t what was transpiring. You also wrongly responded earlier with insinuation that I seemed to be in favor of fully closing borders purely because of nationality, which is not the case. This is odd because I actually specifically described that is NOT the way I would like my country ran in an earlier comment. So you are either generalizing me, forgetting what I’m saying, or you’re so caught up in the 35 other discussions you’re having on here that you can’t even think straight.

Or you’re a bot.
