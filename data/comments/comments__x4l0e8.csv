Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 3 September 2022


- Since 29 August 2022, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been conducting renewed offensive operations in the south of Ukraine. One element of this offensive is an ongoing advance on a broad front, west of the Dnipro River, focusing on three axes within Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast.

- The operation has limited immediate objectives, but Ukraine's forces have likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise; exploiting poor logistics, administration and leadership in the Russian armed forces.

- With fighting also continuing in the Donbas and Kharkiv sectors, a key decision for Russian commanders in coming days will be where to commit any operational reserve force they can generate.",False,1662194226.0,t3_x4l0e8,t3_x4l0e8,,0,68,0,68,0,0,

A storm continues in the Black Sea, so the ships and boats of the enemy fleet continue to take shelter closer to their base stations along the coast of the temporarily-occupied Crimea.  Except, however, two Kalibr surface carrier ships keep 16 high-precision missiles at the ready.^1

Day 192 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled a couple of times starting in the morning. Around 10am we started hearing some quite loud explosions not that far away, and they were repeating pretty frequently, one every couple of minutes. They continues for about an hour, soon it was said that Derhachi was shelled, which is most likely exactly what we were hearing, as it’s only 5km away from us. 

There was also at least one explosion in the city itself and not just in the bordering towns, it was reported that we were shelled, but there’s no information on the target. In the evening there was more shelling, mostly on the outskirts of Kharkiv. When it’s getting dark they almost always use illumination shells before starting their regular shelling, which is what people were seeing today as well, at around 8:30pm. A bit later a fire has started at the place where people saw the illumination in the sky.

And as usual there was a missile strike, this time it happened at midnight. They fired just 2 missiles and the explosions were pretty loud here. Right now there’s no concrete information about what was hit, but we do know that those missiles landed in Kyivskyi district, in the sector with private houses. We don’t know if there were any casualties yet, but hopefully nobody got hurt.

Ukrainian officials say their military’s southern offensive is going slowly. They also say that is precisely the plan.

The announcement Monday of a thrust in the south raised hopes that Ukraine could reclaim territory Russia seized early in the war, including the regional capital of Kherson.

But success could take many shapes, say officials and Western analysts. Even without quickly regaining much ground, Kyiv can achieve progress by forcing Russia to expose its troop locations and supply bases, take a defensive posture and thereby appear weak or pull troops from other parts of the country. Ukraine can also gain intelligence about Russian formations, vulnerabilities and will to fight.

Ukrainian officials say they have neither the armor nor the manpower to make a quick advance. Instead, the military aims to weaken front-line Russian forces while also using long-range artillery and rockets, such as Himars provided by the U.S., to hit critical installations behind Russian lines such as command posts and ammunition depots.

Kherson sits on the west bank of the Dnipro River, which Russian troops must cross to enter, resupply or leave the city. Ukraine’s military says its strikes on bridges across the Dnipro and the smaller Inhulets River to the city’s northeast have largely cut supply lines to Russian forces in the city.

Russia has roughly 20,000 troops in and around Kherson, Western officials estimate, cautioning the figure isn’t precise. Trapping them could potentially force a surrender, allow Ukraine to decimate them or force them to flee. Whatever happens, Ukraine hopes to retake Kherson without having to engage in bloody street fighting.

Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, called the strategy “the systemic grinding of Putin’s army.” He said Kyiv’s forces are working “to uncover their operational logistical supply system and destroy it with artillery and Himars,” a process that can take time.

“There’s no rush,” he said.

While Ukraine ultimately wants to evict Russian forces from Kherson—the city’s occupation is one of Moscow’s most significant gains since invading on Feb. 24—Kyiv could still boast of success if it retakes towns outside the city, captures or kills a large number of Russian troops or compels some to retreat.

The Kherson offensive also represents an element of Ukraine’s broader strategy to strain Russia’s entire invasion force, from around Kharkiv in the northeast to Crimea on the Black Sea.

By attacking in so many places, “you keep the Russians wondering where the Ukrainians are going to strike next,” said retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Twitty. “You want an unpredictable fight to keep the Russians on their heels.”

Gen. Twitty, who participated in Operation Desert Storm, said not to expect a massed attack.

“We’re going to see multiple locations of small units, which is going to wreak havoc on the Russians and is a great way to fight,” he said. But he cautioned: “In this type of fighting, you have to take a long-term perspective.”

Ukraine’s fighters may advance and pause to prepare for a subsequent attack, said Billy Fabian, a former U.S. Defense Department analyst. “You’re always thinking about the next operation.”

Ukrainian forces will move slowly because they are attempting an operation that military planners consider exceedingly difficult: dislodging an entrenched defender without overwhelming force or air superiority. Kyiv has a limited number of skilled or veteran troops and must deploy them across a vast front line. Ukrainian commanders want to put at risk the smallest number of troops possible.

Attempting “a deliberate storming of Kherson city would likely be a mistake,” said Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank, in an analysis posted Friday.

Instead, Ukraine is capitalizing on the region’s geography, aiming to push Russian troops against riverbanks. Ukrainian forces appear to be advancing on land from the north and west while increasing the tempo of strikes on bridges and supply facilities. Their goal is to starve Russian forces of supplies while closing in on them.

“We need the enemy to be unable and unwilling to resist effectively,” said Mr. Arestovych, the Ukrainian presidential adviser.

Russian attempts to retreat across the rivers would make rich targets for Ukrainian drones, rockets and artillery.

Ukrainian forces appear already to have retaken some small towns outside Kherson, according to open-source intelligence reports. Gen. Twitty said the incremental gains count as a tactical success because “these little towns mean a lot” to Ukrainians, who see compatriots liberated, and to Kyiv’s Western backers, who want to see progress against Russia.

Ukraine’s larger strategic objective of regaining its land and repelling Russian forces is vital because the war is likely to end in some form of negotiation, Gen. Twitty said.

“The long-term perspective is, the more gains Ukraine can make, the better off they will be at the negotiating table,” he said.",False,1662245543.0,t3_x4l0e8,t3_x4l0e8,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

the pro-Ukraine publication from Mariupol.  He was in the Mariupol school system for 41 years, last assignment was director out in the suburbs. 

**Why so many good teachers are now collaborators:**

(1) *lack of leadership + teachers are bot-like.* There was no initial meeting or organization 2/22-2/26 giving instructions, then bombing started and people scattered:

> “Everyone makes their own choice. Unfortunately, many chose not benefit their country. Perhaps this happened also because people felt left to their own devices. Our teachers are used to being controlled. They do not have their own position on topics. They do what they are told. And then bang!—and no one says anything. They are already at a loss, they don't know what to do without instructions. Maybe that's why there is such a high level of collaboration among Mariupol teachers.""

(2) *some have always lacked patriotism.* “Many teachers used to stand silent when school sang national anthem,” implying never loyal to Ukraine, anyways; He calls this the result of having a very liberal state, which allows differing opinions.
 

(3) *Some are actually Russian, others have long said would retire to Russia.* A few are Greek. He said the school where he was principal, he knows that 10 of the 80 teachers have chosen to be collaborators.  

> “Of those ten teachers who betrayed the state, **half were always non-citizens**. And it was known to everyone. So these people continued to raise children in the same spirit that they themselves have. But that didn't bother anyone.”

**Sidebar: the Refuse-niks**

> ""It is important to say that among the Mariupol teachers there are also those who remained in the city, but fundamentally refuse to cooperate. This is a very strong position. These people are driven by two feelings—fear and hope. Fear already dominated them in the spring. Now they hold on to hope."" 



**Toll on children’s psyche:**

But there is another side to this story about teaching—the children. Some of them live in **constant dissonance**. They were born in Ukraine, they don't know any other country, and their parents always insult the country, look in the direction of dew. At school, these children sing the national anthem of Ukraine. **Russian tv channels are watched at home**. [Because Mariupol speaks Russian—but Kyiv produces Ukrainian programming.] Now the occupiers have come to the city. And there is no need to sing about Ukraine. [and, they will be subjected to the “deprogramming” course of study that Russia has made the curriculum.]

Soon, Ukraine will return its territories, and children will again have to adapt to new conditions, a new truth.

> ""This is a great tragedy. There will be deep brokenness and deep disbelief. Like in that movie—the reds have come, the whites have come, we change hats. We are facing a very painful process in society because of all these things. And the result is a **great risk of losing these children morally and psychologically**. Because depending on how long the occupation will last, how long these children will be exposed to, their consciousness will change. And not everyone survives.

Russias problem is that Putin isn’t even an amateur general.

He’s a politician. It’s been the problem with this invasion from the start.

As a politician he prioritises political goals over military ones.

He’s holding Kherson because it will be a political disaster to lose it.

He’s continually attacking in the east so he can trumpet any victories back home to keep the Russians believing they can win.

He doesn’t care that these are suicidal military decisions. It’s all about looking good.

This is what happens when you get a sociopathic politician in his late 60s with absolute power who is out of his depth. He is simply unable to admit his failures and so is doomed to continue them.

Russia doesn’t have any good generals because Putin has ensured the army leadership is incompetent for political reasons.

Putin has no experience or talent in military strategy, and he is getting found out. But as a politician, he will just keep doubling down on his failed gambles because he knows that to do anything else will make him politically vulnerable.

All the while, Russia’s political influence, wealth and its military assets all get flushed down the toilet.

What I see here is what is known as a Narcissistic Collapse (a bit like what is happening to Trump right now).

First package has allegedly entered [the international shipping stage](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1566108543320633344), which means it should arrive to our contact's apartment in Kyiv in about 2 weeks. We're hoping for less. We've been buying express shipping for these packages, but who knows if that actually makes a difference once outside the US.  
  
\- We've collected 156 items total so far! We're now aiming to get up to 200, the sooner the better. Shipping these is really expensive for the person doing that (about $150 a package including insurance) so it's best to put as much as we can together at once.  We're estimating that we'll be able to do a couple more weekly shipments.

If you can procure supplies and get them to Ukraine yourself, or want to contribute money directly to Hospitallers, you can find all that information [on the Hospitallers website](https://www.hospitallers.life/needs-hospitallers). If you can't afford all this (totally understandable) share the registry or [our fundraiser's tweet](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1565348075832430598) on the topic.  
  
I'll try my best to keep updating. Things might slow down a bit as we wait for your contributions to arrive, and for the packages to arrive in Ukraine. We'll keep the registry up until we basically can't afford to ship stuff anymore, lol",False,1662224463.0,t3_x4l0e8,t3_x4l0e8,,0,54,0,54,0,0,

> Regarding the situation in the Mykolaiv direction of the Kherson Front (from the Ochakovsky Liman to Snyhiryivka):

> The front line is unchanged (which means that no enemy advances, including those near Ternoviye Pody, have taken place in reality). Enemy artillery has become very numerous - self-propelled guns. They come from different sides, fire a few rounds at the maximum range and retreat towards Mykolaiv. There are mines and grenades being thrown from quadcopters at our positions. The main strikes are aimed at artillery - the infantry are hardly being bothered.

> Himars hit the crossing several times a day. No idea how many they have. They're raining dozens of them every day. Yesterday 4 Himars ""packs"" (6 rockets each) were fired at pontoon ferries of the Russian Armed Forces. Despite being hit, the ferries continue to operate. Supply of equipment and ammunition to our troops continues in spite of inevitable difficulties.
The enemy is also trying to use manned aircraft in the attacks, but their effectiveness is close to zero.

> The enemy's intention, I assume, is to suppress the artillery by preventing the supply of shells and by directly destroying the artillery. This is a necessary condition for the success of their offensive operations.
Our troops conduct active counter-battery fire and strike at the places of concentration of the enemy units and subunits.

If their no.1 goal was just to liberate Kherson, they would've gone about it *very* differently. They wouldn't have been declaring from the rooftops since June that an offensive in Kherson were imminent. They would've been talking about liberating *Mariupol* or *Luhansk* if they just wanted to reclaim territory as easily as possible. Or not talk about it at all.

Ukraine wanted the west bank as full of ruZZians as they could possibly lure in. As much equipment and elite troops as possible. Ukraine wanted the *liberation objective* to be hard so that the *attrition objective* would be more successful. They didn't want to take on all these russian forces anywhere else but the west bank of Dnipro. They *knew* they had to take on them *somewhere* for the Blyatzkrieg to end. Liberation is *almost* secondary here; to the point that only attrition will bring about the liberation. 

If and when Ukraine were struggling to reclaim land in Kherson, it is all a part of their own doing. And it is not an accident.

Bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO, and the Black Sea will basically be another NATO lake, with strictly controllable access.

WARNING: might be considered NSFW, although there's no blood or any gore shown.  
Some notes from that thread, for those who don't wanna skim through 500+ comments:  
\- russia claims the attack took place around 6 in the morning, the guys watch shows 11, but the bodies show no sign of degradation  
\- there is not a single drop of blood or wounds, or burn marks, or explosion marks or any damage to clothing or anything.  
\-the guys seem to lie quite comfortably, and none of the faces are shown  
\-of course, in the good russian propaganda style, SOF landing during daylight behing enemy lines would carry stacks of US $, nazi patches, Blackwater patches, and one of them even his UA issued weapon permit. Probably the Sims 3 cd's were lost.  
\- one of the guys in the video is wearing ""Impact Sports"" branded, 30$ Aliexpress headphones . One could expect SOF would use those stacks of dollars to buy better kit, but logic is not part of russian propaganda.  
\-some of them seem to have tourniquets on, but there is not a single drop of blood to be seen.  
\- beside coming from water, all of their kit is awfully clean and dry.  
\-for an attack supposedly repulsed by arty and helicopters, there is zero damage to the area where these guys are.  
And plenty more information in that thread.

This is obviously a relative term, because while some units close to Kherson city may be well supplied, the units further north, like that Special forces brigade that was at least partially cut off when the offensive started are probably struggling with supplies comparatively speaking. But overall i don't think supplies are a huge concern right now for the Russian forces.   


When it comes to bringing supplies to Kherson, Russia has some pontoon bridges that they can use, as well as ferries, and of course if things get desperate enough they can use helicopters too. 

The biggest challenge Russia is facing on the west side of the river is a lack of manpower, they are basically stretched too thin through the frontline and Ukraine has been able to exploit that to break through the line in a few areas. At the moment it looks like the entire frontline is under fire by Ukraine, leaving Russia with basically no reserves to plug the gaps that are forming on their line.   


I'll not dare predict when the Kherson front will colapse for Russia. Ukraine has had some pretty significant successes in the north of the Oblast, that are definitely of major concern for Russian forces, however they are taking significant casualties, and this fact appears to have caused a change in tactics for the Ukrainian army now, reducing the pace of the offensive in order to reduce casualties, this is obviously a double edge sword, because it might reduce casualties in the short term, while increasing them in the long term because the Russians will have more time to prepare additional defense lines in their attempt to hold against the Ukrainian counter offensive.   


Ultimately i do believe that Ukraine will be successful in Kherson, unless something drastic changes like a significant deployment of additional russian forces to that front, it is a front that is crumbling under pressure, the question is how long will it take and how much will Ukraine pay in blood and treasure.",False,1662187181.0,t3_x4l0e8,t1_imw9fnd,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

They're a crossroad country. In the last 500 years their borders have shifted, and they've been pulled into the spheres of influence or outright conquered by the Ottomans, the Austro-Hungarians, the Nazis, and the Soviets. Seeking always to look out for its own interests and independence of its affairs while accommodating the regional powers on its doorsteps.

To that end, we might think it strange that Hungary today has any affection for Russia, since elections under the barrel of Soviet guns to get the ""correct"" Stalinist result, and Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest to quell student uprisings remain in living memory. But Hungary also remembers that even when they reluctantly joining the Axis to avoid German occupation, the Nazis still bombed them to coerce them into raising an army to march east to Stalingrad, where casualty rates were nearly 90%.

They're no more eager to throw their fortunes in completely with Moscow than they are with Berlin. And few could doubt that the EU is fundamentally a Franco-German enterprise (with France as clear junior partner).

As a result, their key priority for the last three decades has been to balance those interests; trade from the EU and security guarantees from NATO, while keeping sufficient ties with Russia to give them levers over energy, monetary, and policy independence (as well as attract Russian and Chinese investment to stay afloat when Europe has fiscal meltdowns). Hungary does *not* want to be Greece.

This approach carried a lot less political and diplomatic risk before the 2014 Ukr revolution than it does today. But it shouldn't be surprising that Hungary is willing to push the limits - short of Hungexit, anyway.",False,1662229507.0,t3_x4l0e8,t1_imxd47l,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

**Economic Sanctions against collaborating teachers** https://glavcom.ua/country/science/ukrajina-zaprovadit-sanktsiji-proti-vikladachiv-kolaborantiv-872548.html  Introduced today, past the criminal liabilities for cooperating with the occupiers, economic sanctions for 5 years will be imposed on them.

The Rada will not charge parents with collaboration if they choose to send children to these Russian-controlled schools, where children will be subjected to “reprogramming,” but will work with parents after war to get children assistance in coping with the psychological dissonance caused by the propaganda.

______

*Since some users have spread some disinformation and/or criticize Ukrainian intention to impose criminal liability on teachers who work for the occupiers, here’s their rationale:*

The [minister of Justice,](https://protocol.ua/ua/treba_rozriznyati_svidomih_kolaborantiv_i_slugbovtsiv_yaki_v_okupatsii_dopomagali_lyudyam_vigiti_zastupnitsya_ministra_yustitsii_ukraini_valeriya_kolomiets/)

 approved by the Rada, promises to absolutely **prosecute every teacher who chooses to work for the occupiers**, disseminating their propaganda (ie, that there is no occupation, that Russia is a hero liberating you, that Ukrainian sovereignty is a fake invention, that Ukrainian democracy is naziism, that Ukraine has no history independent of a common Russian history, that Ukrainian greats in literature or science were Russian, etc.) and receives paycheck or benefits of the Russian state.  

The Minister of Justice, as well as the *Servant of the People* deputy who chairs the education committee both explain that there’s **no such thing as “collaborated because just trying to survive,”** and that teachers who collaborate have made a **free choice** to do so—that Ukraine has provided many alternatives, including 2/3 pay and literally just staying home—or flee, do online school from Ukraine-controlled territory at normal pay.  Indeed, reading articles from occupied areas, there are many teachers who remained but sit at home, refusing to cooperate.",False,1662185276.0,t3_x4l0e8,t1_imw60gg,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

Iirc, at the time before Desert Storm, the Iraqi's were viewed to have a decent army having been rebuilt since their prolonged battle with Iran. They were the *4th largest military in the world* with approximately 1.6mil troops (including paramilitary/militia) and armed with halfway decent Soviet equipment - they had the defenders advantage and were defending their own soil (and occupied Kuwait). US was itching to utilize a ton of their newly developed tech (Abrams, Cruise Missiles, F117, and so much more).

It's not like it was viewed to be a bitch slapping from the start, it's why the coalition amassed nearly 1mil for the invasion. 

Coming into the Ukraine war before Russia invaded, they were viewed to have an inferior army to the Russians with mostly older Soviet equipment (T-62's, non upgraded T-72's) and less professional troop strength.

In that since, Ukraine was viewed to not be symmetrical with what was (the paper tiger of) Russian military strength.

It’s easy with hindsight to say Putin’s original plan was deeply flawed, but given that his goal was aggressively expanding Russias borders in a modern Europe where that kind of behaviour is not in any way condoned, I can’t think of a better plan.

I think history will actually say the chaos that happened with COVID probably saved Ukraine.

Trump would have been in power in the USA. There would have been no meaningful sanctions or military aid for Ukraine.

They are unable to tolerate a middle class.

A country’s middle class drives changes and innovation because they have both the means to pursue change, and the motivation to make change happen.

The super rich have the means, but at the end of the day, the status-quo works well for them.

The poor don’t have the means to do anything, let alone be innovative.

Russia has achieved stability by not having a middle class. The problem is that it has stagnated culturally, politically and scientifically. Why? It has no middle class to drive these things.

The other contemporary example of Autocracy is China. It has followed a policy of developing a middle class. The advantage is it’s economy and science is progressing well. 

The issue is it’s becoming unstable. The Chinese who now have a medium amount of wealth want to be able invest their money in enterprises they can control. (And not get screwed over by government protected corruption).They are better informed and educated and so are asking their relatively antiquated government questions that it doesn’t have answers for.

It just makes sense for Ukraine to attack here the most carefully. Preserving the Ukrainian strength for later, harder fights. Meanwhile, every ounce of energy Russia expends on defending Kherson is two or three ounces of strength they could have had in Kharkiv instead.

They are losing on average 10.7 a day, most *estimates* at the start of the war were that they had ~3k active and ~3k reactivatable. 560 days worth. So at the current rate we can estimate September 8, 2023.

Two experimental engines were tested at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in 1961 and 1964 respectively. On 1 January 1957, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to study the feasibility of applying heat from a nuclear reactor to power a ramjet engine for a Supersonic Low Altitude Missile.

The problem is that war is not Putin's specialty. He's not *bad* so much as he is a rank amateur. He's approaching strategy in the same way an upper-management type approaches a specialized task when a specialist isn't at hand. He tries to use common sense. 

>Oh, Ukraine announced they're launching a big offensive. Better send a lot of resources to go hold Kherson. 

>Oh, the Airfields in Crimea are blowing up. Better withdraw the air force to safer ground. 

>Oh, my army isn't making any real progress. Better group them together and level the area with artillery. 

The problem is that he's completely reactive to the problem at hand, not thinking about the new problems his actions create. 

>The bottleneck at Kherson.

>The reduced response time of his air force. 

>The rapid degradation of artillery and the extreme casualties. 

Meanwhile Zelenskyy is tapdancing around Putin because he's not the one handing out the orders; that responsibility belongs to Zaluzhnyi, a man who spent his entire life mastering the art of war. And this isn't even counting NATO intelligence, or the advice and collective experience of every NATO high general. 

What Putin needs to do is retreat. He needs to pull back from Kherson and then he needs to freeze the front line. He needs to cease launching pointless offensives in the Donbas--you're not going to take it, dude--and then he needs to draw the borders in such a way that they minimize length and maximize defensive capability. This isn't about resource and prestige anymore. It's about survival. 

Along that new border he needs to construct a massive network of fortifications complete with defense in depth. Once they're finished, Putin should pull his people back to man said defenses, then peel off every extra person he can and PROPERLY train and prepare them for combat. He needs to cycle troops in and out of the front line regularly to provide for rest and recuperation. Then he needs to launch a general mobilization and get Russia's economy on a war fitting.

So the answers reflect their normal behavior, what is the problem? The study is not called “What Russians *Really* Think—100% Accurate Mind Reading.” It simply register how they prefer to respond.

But Putin isn’t even an amateur general.

He’s a politician. It’s been the problem from the start.

As a politician he prioritises political goals over military ones.

He’s holding Kherson because it will be a political disaster to lose it.

He’s continually attacking in the east so he can trumpet any victories back home to keep the Russians believing they can win.

He doesn’t care that these are suicidal military decisions. It’s all about looking good.

This is what happens when you get a sociopathic politician in his late 60s with absolute power who is out of his depth. He is simply unable to admit his failures and so is doomed to continue them.

Russia don’t have any good generals because Putin has ensured the army leadership is incompetent for political reasons.

Putin has no experience or talent, and he is getting found out. But as a politician, he will just keep doubling down on his failed gambles because he knows that to do anything else will make him politically vulnerable.

All the while, Russia’s political influence, wealth and its military assets all get flushed down to toilet.

>But how do would you get this? 

I'm in Russia right now, and I speak to Russians all the time. Nearly all of them are in favor of the war. Support is going down a bit, but not because they disapprove of the war. No, they're getting tired of how long it's taken, saying things like, ""The ruble is so strong now and I can't go shopping in Italy."" or complaining that ""America"" is making all the prices go up in shops. They whine about how they want Spotify, Etsy, Canva, etc back, thinking that the second the war ends, all of those things will be available again. 

Others might not support the war directly, but definitely support the *reasons* behind the war, even though those reasons change weekly. Gay, drug-addicted Nazi super soldiers supporting BLM and trying to spread liberal values and NATO bases by way of biologically engineered birds to Orthodox Christian Russia or whatever the government tells them to believe. 

Yes, many Russians are non-political, for various reasons. You'll see that in 1420's videos. That doesn't mean they don't support the war. They just don't want to talk about it because they think they don't understand it. Politics is a game played by the ruling class and completely incomprehensible to the average person. Some Russians even think that this was all a big plan created between Poland, Russia, and Ukraine to partition Ukraine. Yes, I'm serious. 

Do you know how many people I've met who I'd say *don't* support what's going on? One. One girl who's about 20-21 who went to protests in the first few weeks, then stopped, and now she's bored of it all. 

Also.. don't be so quick to say they should be commended. They have ties to another Russian youtuber who has ties to *another* youtuber who is almost certainly a Russian government asset.

For some reason, you’re repeating this falsehood again. No, there are no penalties for answering surveys.

And yes there is widespread support for this ""special operation"" but we can't simply know how many Russians are really for it because no one of us has a clear picture (I doubt even Russians themselves have any idea because no one can openly talk about it if he isn't in line with the regime). The only thing that seems clear: It is way more likely that you support the war if you are older and live in rural regions.

And even if we assume that the question ""Do you support the special operation?"" was answered truthfully it wouldn't even give a perfect view about the opinions because in the ideal next question all would have to define how they see the special operation. If you i.e. believe that Russia needed to kill some Nazis before they could attack (and so really think your country is doing something good for the world) it is a very different view on the events than wanting to genocide all Ukrainians.",False,1662208188.0,t3_x4l0e8,t1_imwu463,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

FFS.....**It is factually correct that we dont know how many would be honest.** How can that not be a fact? We literally dont know. I dont, nor do you. 

This is getting absurd. Should anything coming out of Russia be trusted anyway? 

Its pretty obvious Russians dont feel safe voicing negative opinions on their leadership. If you cant see that, well.. whatever... i dont really care, its obvious to anyone else watching.
