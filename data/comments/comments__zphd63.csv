I asked them why they spend so much money and increase the military capability in the area around the Baltics so much. The answer was - in a closed meeting, with Alexander Vershbow (US diplomat, former NATO Secretary General - author's remark), although it was a closed meeting, but now I can tell... Their thinking was that in 2019, Russia will be ready to test NATO. If everything went as it did back then. And they would have tested that on us \[Lithuania/Baltics\].

Variables:

Reported $82 Billion spent as of November

A very very conservative estimate of 3 % contraction of Russian GDP in 2022

2021 Russian GDP figure of $1.776 Trillion

If you take those numbers into account, and play that out over a full year (So adding three months roughly from when the $82 billion was reported) you end up with Russian spending $110 Billion for a full year of war in Ukraine.  Taking into account contraction of their GDP to $1.610 Trillion, that gets you a military spending budget when percentage of GDP of %6.8. (Please note that many believe Russian GDP will continue to contract into next year so this number could probably be even higher, but didn't want to guess what would shrink in the first two months of the year.  Also keep in mind if Russia decides to Mobilize again the numbers will all jump again).

Now for some data comparisons:

Russian 2022 Military budget before war roughly 4.3%

The US Mil Budget as % of GDP = 3.7%

If the US decided to match Russian spending for this war as a percentage of GDP, the US Military budget would exceed $1.564 Trillion.  Given the Russian economy may contract another 3% into next year, there would be potential that the US Military budget would in those circumstances pass the entire Russian GDP for the year.

You could certainly run deeper with these numbers but all of this is to say that Russian military spending as a percentage of GDP is far exceeding that of a ""modern society"" and it appears those numbers will only escalate as the GDP shrinks and the army attempts to get bigger.  Russian is in deep, and is only digging themselves a deeper hole.

You should be able to find the source of these number by searching government websites, however the Russian numbers were provided via a Forbes article that sites Meduza numbers, take them with appropriate grains of salt.",False,1671464460.0,t3_zphd63,t3_zphd63,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

Day 299 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet with no missile or drone strikes, but a couple of times throughout the day people were reporting hearing explosions, and we even heard some of them as well. We don’t know what they were exactly, but some people were saying that it was the sound of our forces’ outgoing artillery shots, which is probably what it was.

The situation with electricity in Kharkiv is pretty stable, but I’m pretty sure that after the drone attack on our energy infrastructure in the morning we had emergency blackouts announced for our region, though I’m not sure if they were actually used. Just recently, about 30 minutes ago, there was some emergency on one of the energy facilities in my district, so some people have no electricity right now. There were no hits on our energy infrastructure just now, so it’s some local problem which, hopefully, can be fixed fast. 

Russians fired 35 Shaheds at our energy infrastructure today most of which were intercepted, but some still made it though our air defense and damaged Kyiv’s energy infrastructure, which is why they have problems with electricity right now. Russians were launching those drones all throughout the night, so I guess they got a new batch of them delivered from Iran, according to our officials they got about 250 Shaheds this time, so they will be able to do similar attacks for at least a week.

f93e97559e928b5accd99f6c5ea987ee,zphd63,j0uw9ds,"I’ve been scratching my head about what is going on with Putin, Belarus, and the supposed Russian plan to launch a new attack on Kyiv. It’s a situation where I trust and believe Ukraine that Russia is planning this, I just have trouble wrapping my head around what Putin could possibly hope to achieve. However, Putin is definitely a gambler and may be desperate enough to double down in the hope of a miracle. I have noticed that not a lot of the people enlisted during the “partial” mobilization are now at the front line. It’s only been enough people to plug the holes in the existing units. That makes it likely Russia is holding the bill in reserve for some sort of offensive. 

Here’s a couple of scenarios. Mind you, this is all speculation. 

1) 
Russia launches the expected offensive straight at Kyiv from Belarus in an attempt to force Ukraine to withdraw troops from the southern front. The last thing Putin has as a win from the war is the land bridge to Crimea. If he loses that, Russia has no gains. The Kyiv offensive is a feint to pin down Ukraine. It’s likely to get completely smashed and have no effect on Ukraine’s other offensives due to Ukraine mobilizing first and fully, but it’s an attempt to shift the balance back in Russia’s favor. 

It’s probably predicated on the belief that if Russia had just focused on one offensive axis, they would have won the war back in February. That may have been true, it may not be. However, Ukraine back in February wasn’t fully mobilized with lots of NATO toys. Now Ukraine has this thing called a lot more fully-trained troops, with more ever month since July. So it would be unlikely to divert too many Ukrainian resources. 


2) 
Russia doesn’t strike at Kyiv, but instead tries to take the areas along the western border to cut Ukraine off from its allies. To me, this is the slightly smarter plan. It’s hitting an area that has been less reinforced but is vital for Ukraine’s war effort. If Russia believes Ukraine can’t hope to fight without its western aid, cutting off access to that aid is a logical move. It has the bonus of creating a land bridge to Transnistria so Russia has can annex all the territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists. 

The problem is that it’s a lot of territory to take on unfavorable terrain. It puts Russia right up against the borders of several NATO allies, particularly Poland. Poland would be quite happy to join the fight. The moment any Russian weaponry or boots accidentally cross the border if not tread too close, Poland would invoke at least NATO Article Four if not Article Five, giving Russia the full taste of NATO capabilities. 


3) 
This has been a ruse by Ukrainian intelligence to drive a wedge between Lukashenko and his army and/or Belarus and Russia. It’s very clear Belarus wants nothing to do with this war. Even if Lukashenko wanted to join it, his military doesn’t and Lukashenko is a dead man without his military. Putin is desperate to bring Lukashenko into the war, giving him a bunch of fresh, trained soldiers instead of what amounts to useless meat to be sacrifice to slow down Ukraine. If Russia annexes or forms a confederation with Belarus as a lot of people are expecting to be the consequence of Putin’s visit to Minsk, sending Belarusian soldiers into the war would be his first order of business. The question is how successful the attempt will be, even if Putin and Lukashenko merge countries or something. The Belarusian military and people want nothing to do with the war. Could Russia pull it off or would it become a disaster with lots of Belarusians resisting it?

The thing to understand about trench warfare is that infantry cannot stand against artillery, even when protected by trenches (trenches protect infantry from infantry).  But, modern artillery can fire from far enough away that the infantry cannot overrun the artillery before the defender drives the attacker back to their original position.  In a WWI style battle the tactical attacker has the advantage, but because of the slow speed of infantry advance under fire, the strategic defender always wins.

My honest opinion is the rumblings of an attack from Belarus are a distraction or an attempt to divert Ukrainian focus away from the front but more specifically the Russian's are sabre rattling because they're beginning to fear losing Crimea. 

We've seen them trying to prepare defences there the last few weeks ands there the rumors of an imminent advance by Ukraine due to happen sometime in near future to punch through to the Sea of Azov and cut the Russian land bridge, liberate Melitopol and the ZNPP and take back the rest of Kherson Oblast.

Ultimately even if Putin tries attacking from the North through Belarus it doesn't seem very viable, their forces and supplies are lacking, the defenders are far more prepared, they risk a repeat of ""CONVOOOOOOOOOY"" and we know how much of a shitshow that turned out for them as well as the only roads being narrow and easy to snipe them from. 

Lukashenko is also perilously close to losing power too, he's only somewhat secured right now only because of Putin but if he sends his own military in he loses his only insurance against being Mussolini'd. If Putin tries to remove him it's likely to backfire too.

I'm curious how much modern technology helps with friction. In WW1, you *maybe* had a wired field telephone and runners to carry messages back to command. Maps were paper affairs that were likely to be totally wrong amidst all of the artillery blowing features up.

Today, there are mechanized infantry with modern radios using drone and satellite reconnaissance. Can they keep up the momentum of an attack sufficiently to capture guns (or at least force the guns to retreat to avoid imminent capture)?

 >The Battle of Bakhmut is an ongoing series of military engagements near the city of Bakhmut between Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Russian Armed Forces during the battle for Donbas in 2022. Shelling of Bakhmut began in May 2022, but the main assault towards the city began on 1 August after Russian forces pushed in from the Popasna area after the Ukrainian forces withdrew from the city. The main assault force primarily consists of mercenaries from the Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group, supported by regular Russian troops and DPR and LPR separatist elements.

Rockets, including the Javelin, only travel at Mach1 to Mach2 (and only after a delay, because the rocket cannot go 100% speed from the start).

It may take a while to reach its target). In contrast, tank-shots are basically instantaneous since they're significantly faster. Tanks can do tricks like firing 2 or 3 shots before the enemy even knows about the first shot, due to Mach5 speeds of their bullets (5x faster than sound, so if you're 3000m away, you can get multiple shots before the sound-wave reaches the enemy).

Depends on what you mean with ""any objective accuracy"". Of course they can't know the exact numbers - they are just estimates. And there's a good chance some of the ""killed"" were not hit or were just lightly wounded instead. And of course Ukraine goes with the highest reasonable estimates because it's good for morale if you ""kill"" more enemies.

However, I have the impression that that's what it is - highest reasonable estimates. It's not outright lies or pulling numbers out of thin air.

To survive artillery, the infantry need to be in deep dugouts.  Well underground.  Or, another way of saying this, is they need to not be there at all.

What happens when the artillery stops, and the attacker leaves their trenches to move forward, is there is a race to first line of trenches.

If the attacker wins they'll be able to fire down on the exposed heads of defenders, if the defender wins, they'll be able to machine gun the attackers.

Because of the power of artillery the attacker almost always win the race to the first trench line after the artillery barrage stops.  (Also, because the barrage doesn't actually stop, they 'walk' the artillery further into the defender's position so the infantry are advancing under artillery firing over their heads.)

Because the attacker's artillery can almost always clear the first trench line, the defender generally doesn't defend the first trenchline very strongly.  The defender generally defends the second trench line.  Which is where most the killing happens.

Finallly, the defender keeps a counter attack force in 3rd trench line behind everything.  As soon as the attacking infantry start to exhaust, stop for food, sleep etc. and dig in for the night.  The defender's artillery opens up and oblitirates the attacking infantry.  Then the defender's counter attack force retakes all the ground which the defender lost.

Tanks and airplanes solve the problems because they can reach the counter attack force and artillery before the attackers need to rest.

But, any army that through either lack of equipment or skill cannot use combined arms to reach beyond the counter attack force in 3rd trench line or the artillery, is going to be stuck in a WWI style stalemate.",1671499891.0,1671499427.0,t3_zphd63,t1_j0wzu3n,,2,-2,0,-2,0,0,

Well, no.  Clearly not ""forever"".  Resources are finite and will, eventually, run out.  But perhaps that's a pedantic point, if ""eventually"" is too far in the future.  That is not clear, though.

But even if they *can* do so, the question we really should be asking is whether they *will*.  There's a point when it's no longer politically sustainable to do so, and that point will almost certainly come before the resources run out.

So, let's start with your premise: Ukraine has liberated Crimea.  At that point, the humiliation for Russia will be total.  It's pretty much inconceivable that Putin will be able to hang on to power.  The internal domestic chaos within Russia will be significantly preoccupying for whomever takes over.

The war has different meanings for Russians and Ukrainians. For Ukraine, it is truly an existential war, where the outcome of victory or defeat actually matters. 

While for Russia, despite what propagandists are saying (and nobody actually believes them even in the country), the war's outcome is not important. Instead, the Russian mentality is one of extreme cynicism. Whether Russia subjugates or fails to defeat Ukraine, it has already cut itself off from the West and many Russians will die. Both Putin and the liberal opposition (Navalny + the LDPR crowd) support imperialist Russian policies. The only way this is avoided is if somebody other than these two factions takes power, the chance of which is next to none, or if the country itself fractures which leads to more internal violence all around. As Wagner said when justifying the strikes on power plants on Telegram, there is no going back to the peacetime era before Feb. 24, so anybody with that mentality is foolish. So given this, they may as well inflict as much suffering to Russia's enemies (here, Ukraine and the West) as possible.

I talked to someone from Moscow who said he would actually welcome this happening, as it might be necessary to ""shock"" the Russian discourse out of this mentality.

ce76e3050cd464a225d8bdb7fba2ad41,zphd63,j0wtawc,"If Putin were to die for any reason, it would be a huge catalyst for change with a very wide range of outcomes. I can think of some scenarios and even those scenarios have many variables. While the reason for his death or the supposed reason given by Russia would definitely matter, there are matters that would supercede any recourse or retaliation. 

Continuity of government would have to be ensured. Currently the Russian contingency for such an event would be for the prime minister to assume the role of president. It could be on an interim basis or it could be like it was for Putin where he got into power when Yeltsin resigned and never looked back. The elites could also totally make it up as they go and no one would be surprised.

But for now, under the current plan, if Putin were to die or for whatever reason be removed from office, a guy named Mishustin would be acting president. Mishustin was appointed PM in early 2020 after the current PM at that time resigned...along with the entire Russian government pretty much. This was widely held as a move to consolidate power and succession by Putin. Nobody really knew anything about Mishustin before that moment, which obviously sets the stage for just being a Putin henchman. It is no secret he installed cronies in those government positions after the previous government resigned. His background was tax service and he did some good work there, no known ambition for politics though. 

So if he were to become acting president, here is where the variables start coming into play. The public doesn't know much about this Mishustin guy beyond his LinkedIn basically. No idea what his tendencies or beliefs really are. The real question is probably who would control him? He was installed as PM, in the first unopposed PM vote in history. He did not get there on his political ambition.

In something that hasn't changed from the Soviet days, the power structure in the Kremlin remains segmented and almost regimented. Putin isn't totally dumb. He knows that he is old, his health is questionable, and no doubt there could be a power vacuum in the event of his death. He will have tried to plan ahead, but how and what is unknown. Putin knows the elites may be keen to establish a new heriarchy. There will be some elements who want to walk this war back, blame it on Putin, give Ukraine their land back, and go to the negotiating table with the west.  There will be other elements who will want war with Ukraine to continue and will not relent. There could be extreme elements and there could be some elements loyal to Putin. The one thing they all have in common is they are rich and powerful. In order to get back to stacking money on cheap energy they would have to walk it back or defeat Ukraine/West.

Outside of the elite power circles, Russia remains a segmented and diverse collection of ethnicities and regions. To be expected in a place that large I suppose. Some of these ethnicicites and regions have been under the Russian boot on their neck for a long time, and having seen cracks in the armor, may bring their own power struggles and tensions to the table depending on whether Russia can keep control. Its unknown if the general public would in any way want anything to do with any of it.

The other thing to consider is that casualties come with activity. Troop movements, hospital beds filled, stuff like that. They don't disappear like a video game. And people monitoring that activity have said that Ukraine's numbers are fairly reasonable given that evidence. Certainly we know that Russian deaths are far higher than Ukrainian ones.

After that, US published the number of killed + wounded, which is more difficult to compare directly to ukrainian numbers. Although if the ratio is the same, ~100k killed and wounded suggests ~27k killed.

None of those are concrete numbers.

Nor does US or anyone else have as much information as Ukraine or Russia. For example: People kept memeing the CIA number, which was 15,000 you're right. Except do you know where the CIA number came from?

CIA just takes whatever Ukraine and Russia were claiming, and averages it out. Completely nonsensical. Pentagon was saying 28,000, CIA was saying 15,000, Ukraine was claiming 36,000.

But there is something called fog of war. No one is actually counting every dead solider. What occurs is if say for example an APV can carry 8 people, and on average 6 people are in that APV. Well they will assume 5 people, and every APV destroyed is +5 dead.

That's where the actual numbers come from, from visual/claimed kills from, or wounded from grenades being dropped, to 100 different factors. Ukraines numbers aren't accurate, they were never intended to be. They are estimates, and yes, this is how every country and every conflict figures out wounded and killed. Through assumptions. Tank crew is 3? Well tank gets destroyed, 3 people died. That easy. 

That said: We know the number is far higher than 27k, most estimates from other countries are in the 60-75k range, who have less information then Ukraine. No that's not to argue Ukraine is more accurate, but you would assume since they have more information they would be the closest to being accurate, assuming they are acting in good faith which they haven't given a reason not to yet. Does this mean numbers are inflated? Some days sure, some days it's also likely an undercount.

The opposition figure’s few comments on the Ukrainian region came in the swirl surrounding Russia’s initial 2014 invasion, when Putin first launched his revanchist project in Ukraine. In a LiveJournal post, Navalny wrote that the fact that Ukraine controlled Crimea—an area transferred by Soviet authorities to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954—was “wrong, unfair and insulting to any normal resident of the Russian Federation.” Asked if it was “right that Crimea belongs to Ukraine,” Navalny responded, “Of course not.” (In 1991, Crimea, just like every other Ukrainian province, voted for Ukrainian independence, a fact that seems to be lost on every Russian nationalist.)

>Even after Putin’s claimed annexation, Navalny said he didn’t see any Ukrainian future for the region. “I advise the Ukrainians not to kid themselves, either,” Navalny said. “It will remain part of Russia and will never become part of Ukraine in the foreseeable future.” When asked directly whether, as president, Navalny would return Crimea to Ukraine, he responded, “What, is Crimea a ham sandwich or something that you can take and give back?

And according to the International Press Institute:

""Since 2015, independent media in Poland are faced with an ever growing threat of legal repression. Journalists are frequently harassed by spurious lawsuits brought by the members of the ruling camp, and reporters are subjected to disproportionate police measures. Taken together, these obstructive efforts are meant to discourage investigative journalism.

In the latest Reporters Without Borders press freedom ranking for 2022, Poland has dropped to 66th place. In 2015, the country was ranked as the 18th best in terms of freedom of press out of 180 countries. """,False,1671463607.0,t3_zphd63,t1_j0uipsb,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Where are you getting 27k from? 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63580372

From general Milley, who suggests 100k russians already killed/wounded. 

That was from Early November.

https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/u-s-quietly-sharing-its-estimate-of-russian-war-casualties-more-than-75000-killed-or-injured/

Biden Admin claiming 150k, and that was July 27th.

>If the Biden administration’s current estimate is accurate, it represents a staggering toll. Estimates of the number of Russian forces in Ukraine ranged as high as 150,000 in the spring, meaning roughly half could be out of action.

I am seeing estimates from France saying the same, as well as UK and others. 

Again: You're looking at loose sources from different departments with varying information they have access to. No one is claiming Ukraine is accurate, but if you assume good faith, they would be the most accurate. It doesn't mean they are counting every body, literally nobody does that in any war ever period. 

This isn't me arguing for or against Ukraines number, but the questions you are asking are kinda flawed because they are meaningless.

Ukraine claims 40k dead, doesn't make claims on wounded.

Pentagon states no it's 20k dead and 80k wounded(August 8th), but claimed different numbers etc. You just don't seem to be getting how they get death numbers at all. No one is counting bodies. They count estimates from witnesses, to estimates from assuming X number of people are in a vehicle that is destroyed, or X number of people are in a base that was blown up at any given time.",False,1671471423.0,t3_zphd63,t1_j0v0ztm,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I see missile defense aid coming in from all around the EU and the US leading the charge. You know NASAM systems need to be actually built first, right? And they've been on that. As for doomsaying — well you be you. I'm obviously not going to convince you of anything. 

The war is brutal, and horrible, and still sucks. The tactics have changed yet again, but I see an overall loss of effectiveness. They will hurt people but can't extract any actual gain out of it. People will die in terror for even less reason than there was before, if that were possible. But hey, give Russia a challenge to go lower and they'll find a way. 

There can never be enough Western aid to completely take away the suffering. So it's the thankless job of the Ukrainian authorities to keep asking for more, more, more. They need to do this, it is their role. And it makes them sometimes look thankless because there never seems to be enough. Which I notice Zelenskyy goes out of his way to very conspicuously do — thank people — for the aid that they get. 

It sounds like you are trivializing the aid that the West is giving because it isn't enough. But that's a problem because there cannot ever be enough. The Ukrainians know this. And I still don't know where that argument ""an excuse to not send aid to Ukraine"" comes from.",False,1671482927.0,t3_zphd63,t1_j0vvali,,8,4,0,4,0,0,

That needs to be taught everywhere and not specifically to Europe. Nationalism is on the rise again worldwide. 

We see extremes in places like Afghanistan that don't really have a national identity so much as tribalism. That's not meant as an insult and could be my lack of knowledge speaking.

If Ukraine starts killing Russian civilians it will mean those Russians, rather than flee the country when there is a mobilisation will line up around the block to enlist, it will bring a country closer together and they will rally around the RU army, it will bring the people into the war and that is the LAST thing Ukraine needs.

Don’t confuse my pragmatism with supporting Russia as that is not what I’m doing. What I am doing is pointing out how utterly fucking stupid your idea to bomb Moscow civilians is and how it will have the complete opposite affect on the war. If you doubt my support for Ukraine, I suggest you look at my comment history.

And besides that, it is a war crime and if we are to fight for what is right and just and good in this world you don’t stoop to the level of evil tyrants. On top of that Ukraine is better off bombing important military bases and stock piles as that is both tactically and strategically a better use of their resources than targeting non-combatants.
