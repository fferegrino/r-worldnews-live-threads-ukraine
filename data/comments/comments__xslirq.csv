*Russia’s military, depleted and losing ground, is likely to be faced with a decision that involves shuttling resources from other parts of the front to slow Ukraine’s advance or continuing to lose chunks of the Donbas.*  
  
*Some of the nearest Russian reinforcements are roughly 25 miles to the southeast, around the city of Bakhmut. Wagner group, an infamous paramilitary unit that reports directly to the Kremlin, has battered the Ukrainian defenders there but has failed to seize significant parts of the city.*  
  
*Ukraine’s slow moving offensive in the south toward the port city of Kherson has largely been overshadowed by events in the east. But fighting there remains fierce as better trained Russian forces have put up staunch resistance against advancing Ukrainian troops.*

Day 220 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet again, no shelling, and no missile strikes, though air raid alerts are still very frequent, but thankfully they are uneventful most of the time. Even though they can’t really shell Kharkiv anymore, they do still continue to shell towns that are closer to the border, and they also fire missiles at them. This is probably the reason they don’t fire them at us as often, they just changed targets.

As if the civilian convoy that was destroyed by Russian missiles yesterday in Zaporizhzhia wasn’t bad enough, today another destroyed civilian convoy was found. This one was in the gray zone between Kupiansk and Svatove, and it was destroyed at the end of September. They killed 24 people, out of which **thirteen were children**, apparently they were killed by small arms fire as well, which means they were close to them, and they knew who they were killing. What kind of fucking monsters can see that their targets are *literal children* and then proceed to mow down 13 of them? 

It was funny seeing Russians hyping up some grand counterattack that will save Lyman during the past couple of days, and then it just never happened. Now they are out of Lyman, and they are already losing territory they annexed less than 24 hours ago, so congratulations to Putin for losing “parts of Russia”. 

I really don’t get why people think that they are retreating because they are going to nuke those territories. No, they are just running for their lives, it’s not some planned retreat to lure us into a trap. Pro-Russian were also hyping some *brilliant trap* around Izyum and Kupiansk when Kharkiv counteroffensive was happening, but that also never materialized, they just lost both of them and that was the end of the story.",False,1664672261.0,t3_xslirq,t3_xslirq,,0,109,0,109,1,0,

> 3:32pm, September 30th, San Francisco
1:32am, October 1st, Eastern Ukraine

> Moved north.

> its a slaughter

> cut them off west of kreminna. got to go.

> Stay safe. Lyman totally cut off?

> I think so, engadging thos going east.

> Ok, talk to you on the other side

> 10:19 pm, September 30th, San Francisco
> 8:19 am, October 1st, Eastern Ukraine

> Only a few mins here. Ran out of ammo and backed off south. Am a bit traumatized and need some sleep. I have no idea what is going on except we engaged a lot of elements headed to Kreminna. They have to be coming from Lyman and Zarichne. Right now we are in a safe area, it seems.

> I have never seen so many dead, soon to be dead, and wounded people in my life. People begging for help, but no way we can help them. We have little to help them with, a small medical kit each, no morphine, and no time to render any kind of useful aid. No idea if they will live or die. You just keep moving.

> One guy had obviously stepped on a mine by the side of the road. One leg was gone at mid-thigh, the other one was broken lower down and his foot was backward. He was trying to crawl somewhere on one good knee, trailing flowing blood out of a busted artery. Unless he got help quick, he was gone. He was talking calmly in Russian, saying over-and-over, “I will be home soon mother.”

> Christ. You and your guys ok?

> Yeah, just tired and mentally warped. At one point, we were running down the side of the road and —— slipped in a pool of blood running into the ditch from a still living Russian laying across the stripe (dead people don’t bleed very fast…only gravity feed), and he slid onto the shoulder and got up cussing with blood all over him. “get me some water, this fucking cunt probably has some kind of fulminating disease.” We almost fell over laughing.

> Are we talking hundreds? Were they on foot or vehicles? There’s a video on Twitter somewhere purportedly from west of Kreminna. Actually just audio, nonstop gunfire.

> Lots, just us, maybe 140 dead Russians. Like hunting squirrels in a pecan orchard. I have to think Lyman is under our control, but we have no info on that.

> We all got split-up into smaller groups, too much contact going on to stay together. here with about 20 guys, trying to make contact with someone to get ammo.

> Lot of people on foot, some running down the road, some trying to make their way through the forest to the south of the road. A half-a-dozen Russians came into the woods where we were in a hide to catch our breath and eat, they almost ran into us, but as usual, were moving fast and talking. We cut them down before they knew what was happening. They had little ammo, no med kits, very little food, and no info at all on them except for their phones and some family stuff. Trying to get intel off stiffs here is a very disappointing exercise.

> I can’t imagine.

> The road has been mined by artillery laydown, not all that accurate, but accurate enough to create bottlenecks, which creates a free-fire zone.

> When you engage a vehicle, then seem to unass it in-place and head for the fields or the forest.

> They probably see the same videos of vehicles going up catastrophically.

> I came away shaking like a leaf, not scared, just wired and sick of killing people. On the way back —— got in a stream and washed off, and vomited his guts out. I was looking at his eyes and he was seeing things way back home.

> How long ago did this happen? Is it still going on?

> It is still going on. We had to back out to try to get resupplied. Artillery is going over our heads. We have to try to sleep, get ammo, and get back up there.

> Take care of yourself, please.

> There is a Yook Lieutenant here who is trying to get some kind of info, but so far nada. We don’t know if we are to go to Kreminna or head (direction).

> Did you guys link up with the Ukrainian SOF?

> We did, but all got separated, we took a lot of fire at first and had to move away, and lost contact with the main group.

> I am ok, just too much jammed into a short time.

> It must have been just chaos.

> Yes.

> The key is to get ammo.

> It’s 8 am there. This went on all night?

> Yeah, but then it became just killing people. I wish I knew what was going on toward Lyman. I think we will move (direction) and connect with an armored group, get some kit, and head back to (direction) of Kreminna. That is the talk anyway. And, that is kinda what I thought would play out.

> Ok, I gotta try to sleep a bit, cause I think we will be moving before long.

> That’s a good idea. Rest up, we’ll talk later.

russia continues to misunderstand UA's war aims of breaking the back of the russian armed forces.   why advance when you know fresh russian targets are going to show up tomorrow already in range of your artillery.   UAF operates from a western/NATO perspective of depleting unit combat potential to remove their ability to resist, since even 5 or 10% casualties renders a unit unable to do anything more than basic defense.

I am not an expert in russian military doctrine by any means but their approach seems to imply they don't believe in silly things like unit combat effectiveness or morale.

Well, in the Russian information space,  
an information coup has begun against  
the Russian Ministry of Defense, to be  
more precise, its leadership and command on the  
ground.  
In the same row, Ramzan Kadyrov, Yevgeny Prigozhin,  
channels controlled by Lubyanka, representatives of security  
officials of all stripes - from the Russian Guard to  
the  
Armed  
Forces of the Russian Federation, State Duma deputies -  
people from the Russian Ministry of Defense are connected.  
One thing does not suit everyone: the  
accumulated effect of many years of  
“successful” reports from the local  
command. Now it has resulted in another  
failure at the front.  
There have been similar attempts to stir up  
society before. But now they are initiated from  
above. Whether this will be of any use - time will  
tell.

If it is, this is likely to be much larger than the one around Kharkiv.

And here’s why.

Russia has been aware of the situation in Lyman for at least two weeks. It has had all that time to prepare for a break in the frontline in that area.

If Zacirine has fallen quickly like it seems it has then Russia’s fall-back position has been taken. This also probably means that any reserve troops are gone, and ALSO any reserves that could be brought in over the last 2 weeks from adjacent areas from Belgorod to Donetsk have also been used …and destroyed.

This is not like Karkiv, where the break has been achieved by the element of surprise. This time, the break has come because the Russian forces are spent.

But I'm starting to get really hard.

At this point I'm all but convinced that Russia is basically finished. Of course it may unfortunately still take a long and unneccesarily deadly road though.

All of Putins recent moves are nothing but total desperation and completely empty blustering and chestpumping. Of course he can still end the world with nukes, but his army is completely, 100% demystified and exposed as nothing but a corrupt, incohesive, band of alcoholic thugs with absolutely no cause or ethos but the love for common banditry born out of utter hopelesness and desperation.

This whole tragedy started out as a military operation that was supposed to decpaitate Kiyv and pacify Ukraine within 3 weeks. Putin had been training his army for years, in border conflicts and middle eastern bombing campaigns. This was supposed to be the real entrance of this fearsome revived military power on the stage of grand geopolitics. He wanted to show the world Russia was again the big bad bear and certainly to be feared.

And within half a year he's gone from recruiting minorities to mercenaries to criminals to protestors to absolutely fucking everyone.
His crack, elite Invasion force rode out half a decade old rustbuckets before the vanguard even managed to get their blown out tires out of the mud arround Kyiv.

His fearsome warriors are abandoning their war machines and running for their very lifes wherever Ukraine moves on them.

Putin has hypnotized himself and got drunk on his own moonshine which convinced him that what he had made the world believe was actually the truth. He lost this gamble before he even realized it was one. 

Now he is starting to realize that he has nothing but a pair of 6s in his hand and the worst thing is, so is everyone else at the table.

Here's one of my posts from a while ago to explain why...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/xo8j80/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/iq1j5j5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/xo8j80/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/iq1j5j5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

*copy-paste:*

Someone has probably posted something like this at some point but I figure it's worth reiterating.

**Why do many analysts think Nuke use is extremely unlikely?**

Firstly, what does their use achieve in a risk/reward context?

Rewards - widescale destruction

Risks - escalation to the point of losing (ramped up US response or MAD), ostracisation by CCP/India, radiation issues.

Russia can and has already achieved widescale destruction with conventional weapons, so there isn't much in the way of a reward but there are many risks.

Another, often overlooked fact is what are Putins priorities? What does he value most?

Most likely, he values being in power. While there are many other priorities, like Russian victory, etc, him staying in power is most likely to be number 1.

And a decision to use Nukes would appear even weaker than mobilisation, achieves almost nothing and risks everything.

Thus it's extremely unlikely.

Putin has made many poor decisions based on poor information but on this issue things are more clear as there is a long period of precedent.

Even a loss in Ukraine is easier to handle than the alternative. In the last 70 years there are many examples of strong, nuclear armed nations losing conventional conflicts and packing up and going home, without resorting to Nukes.

This war is far from over, but all indications are that this is just sabre rattling by Russia and there aren't any indications that using Nukes would change things in Russia's favour.",False,1664603330.0,t3_xslirq,t3_xslirq,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Knowing that a clash is inevitable, he will use the following years for re-arming and re-building his military, and will try to coax countries with anti-Western sentiment into forming a new alliance- a modern-day Axis, if you will.

Even more than before, he sees now that NATO is the greatest threat to his revanchist ambitions and will need to be dealt with first, prompting him to go all in again and initiate a conventional war against his neighbors under the guise of ""liberating them from Western occupation"" (while ironically gambling that MAD doctrine keeps it from being apocalyptic).

Due to the optics, Putin would never admit to being a conqueror or imperialist, instead he will continue to frame war as one of *absolute necessity*, as if to say, ""This is not expansionism.

Voenkor IZ I Lisitsyn  
4 208 The Cossack regiment, which heroically defended  
Krasny Liman with other units of the Volunteers, by  
order from above withdrew to other positions and took up  
defense along Kremennaya. The enemy moved to advantageous  
artillery positions, from which he began  
to fire at the city of Kremennaya, the city of  
Rubizhnoye, the city of Lisichansk, the city of  
Severodonetsk. And this is the Russian Federation.  
Now more than ever, we need to use all methods of  
warfare and hit the accumulation of enemy manpower. We  
have long been at war not with the Ukrainians,  
we are at war with the whole world. All of Europe  
supplies the mercenaries and nationalists with  
all the necessary weapons and  
high-tech means of reconnaissance and additional  
reconnaissance, means of communication,  
etc. Leaving Red Liman was a crime. Throwing  
some militias and volunteers is also a crime.  
And it was necessary, knowing this situation  
a few weeks ago, to take measures by the  
entire group in order to protect the Krasny Liman  
and the civilians living in it, to use heavy  
aircraft in order to smash and destroy the  
accumulation of enemy manpower, which insolently  
accumulated its forces realizing that small units  
are standing against them: one fighter against 40  
mercenaries from NATO countries. Now we must make  
a quick retaliatory move. If Krasny Lyman  
remains under the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a  
long time, then the above cities, which have just  
begun to recover, will be under systematic shelling  
by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and there may  
be casualties, both among our military  
personnel and among the civilian population of  
the Russian Federation.

Generally, it is accepted that mobilisation does not and will not change the course of this war. That means Ukraine will continue to defeat Russia on the battlefield and will gain more and more land from the “annexed” territories.

Putin has stated to the West but more importantly he has stated to his own people he will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons to defend “Russian” territory. Strategic ambiguity is now gone, he was clear on what he considers Russian territory and everyone knows what to expect from him.

So when Russia inevitably faces another defeat and people in his government and society as a whole find out about this, the pressure on him will ramp up. Military bloggers, families of the conscripted, nationalists, soldiers and the like will start calling on him to keep his promise. So he knows he has 2 options. He will either be replaced by someone else who will attempt to improve the situation (who and what he will pursue is unknown) or he will have to use a nuclear weapon to stay in his position and maintain support.

There is a shot of column of vehicles in front of him. Considering he published it at around 2 am it means that evacuation of Lyman and Kreminna was decided by upper echelon. Earlier on that day there was a column forming from Lyman trying to escape the encirclement. Due to FoW I couldn't get any more information, but from reports of a volunteer in UA army the road this column was traveling was mined. They found around 140 dead bodies with very little ammo and food and no medical supplies, which would explain the evacuation order for Lyman. Considering they probably were supposed to reinforce Kreminna defence - and it didn't happen - evacuation order for Kreminna would make sense. Artillery from Kreminna was moved out earlier.

39c8ffe440c9efacb802dfa5122b7a71,xslirq,iqlsrql,"Ukr soldier (and interviewer) :

Only a few mins here. Ran out of ammo and backed off south. Am a bit traumatized and need some sleep. I have no idea what is going on except we engaged a lot of elements headed to Kreminna. They have to be coming from Lyman and Zarichne. Right now we are in a safe area, it seems.

I have never seen so many dead, soon to be dead, and wounded people in my life. People begging for help, but no way we can help them. We have little to help them with, a small medical kit each, no morphine, and no time to render any kind of useful aid. No idea if they will live or die. You just keep moving.
One guy had obviously stepped on a mine by the side of the road. One leg was gone at mid-thigh, the other one was broken lower down and his foot was backward. He was trying to crawl somewhere on one good knee, trailing flowing blood out of a busted artery. Unless he got help quick, he was gone. He was talking calmly in Russian, saying over-and-over, “I will be home soon mother.”

> Christ. You and your guys ok?

Yeah, just tired and mentally warped. At one point, we were running down the side of the road and —— slipped in a pool of blood running into the ditch from a still living Russian laying across the stripe (dead people don’t bleed very fast…only gravity feed), and he slid onto the shoulder and got up cussing with blood all over him. “get me some water, this fucking cunt probably has some kind of fulminating disease.” We almost fell over laughing.

> Are we talking hundreds? Were they on foot or vehicles? There’s a video on Twitter somewhere purportedly from west of Kreminna. Actually just audio, nonstop gunfire.

Lots, just us, maybe 140 dead Russians. Like hunting squirrels in a pecan orchard. I have to think Lyman is under our control, but we have no info on that.
We all got split-up into smaller groups, too much contact going on to stay together. here with about 20 guys, trying to make contact with someone to get ammo.
Lot of people on foot, some running down the road, some trying to make their way through the forest to the south of the road. A half-a-dozen Russians came into the woods where we were in a hide to catch our breath and eat, they almost ran into us, but as usual, were moving fast and talking. We cut them down before they knew what was happening. They had little ammo, no med kits, very little food, and no info at all on them except for their phones and some family stuff. Trying to get intel off stiffs here is a very disappointing exercise.

> I can’t imagine.

The road has been mined by artillery laydown, not all that accurate, but accurate enough to create bottlenecks, which creates a free-fire zone.
When you engage a vehicle, then seem to unass it in-place and head for the fields or the forest.

> They probably see the same videos of vehicles going up catastrophically.

I came away shaking like a leaf, not scared, just wired and sick of killing people. On the way back —— got in a stream and washed off, and vomited his guts out. I was looking at his eyes and he was seeing things way back home.

> How long ago did this happen? Is it still going on?

It is still going on. We had to back out to try to get resupplied. Artillery is going over our heads. We have to try to sleep, get ammo, and get back up there.

> Take care of yourself, please.

There is a Yook Lieutenant here who is trying to get some kind of info, but so far nada. We don’t know if we are to go to Kreminna or head (direction).

> Did you guys link up with the Ukrainian SOF?

We did, but all got separated, we took a lot of fire at first and had to move away, and lost contact with the main group.
I am ok, just too much jammed into a short time.

> It must have been just chaos.
Yes.

The key is to get ammo.

> It’s 8 am there. This went on all night?

Yeah, but then it became just killing people. I wish I knew what was going on toward Lyman. I think we will move (direction) and connect with an armored group, get some kit, and head back to (direction) of Kreminna. That is the talk anyway. And, that is kinda what I thought would play out.

Ok, I gotta try to sleep a bit, cause I think we will be moving before long.

> That’s a good idea. Rest up, we’ll talk later.

Later

Sure, they held some key cities and strong points across the Kharkiv line, but they were never dug in. They must've figured it wasn't worth their time?

So when Ukraine did counterattack, not only were they unprepared and undermanned, they had no second or third lines of defense that they could retreat to. Once the first line was breached, there was no stopping Ukraine as the threat of encirclement due to poor defenses forced Russia to retreat. Then they never really established a new defensive line other than Lyman because it was already a front-line city. Again, one strong point doesn't stop an attacking force when they can literally just go around it.

While Russia claims they're falling back to the ""Svatove-Kreminna"" line, I can guarantee you they don't have any dug-in defenses there, either.

https://amp.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/24/russia-neo-nazi-football-hooligans-world-cup

> In August 1998, Shprygin, who was by then editor of Dynamo’s fan magazine, claims he received a message on his pager asking him to call a mysterious number. It was a meeting request from a prominent rightwing opposition politician. The next day Shprygin claims he visited the State Duma, the lower house of the federal assembly of Russia. In the lobby, he saw one of the hooligan leaders from Spartak Moscow. The pair were ushered into the politician’s office and offered jobs as his assistants.

>Shprygin’s role was to act as a liaison between the politician and the firm, who would routinely provide security for his party. “We were never fists of the party, per se,” Shprygin explained, when we met in a football-themed pub in Moscow. But, he claims, they would provide the politician with security, and in return, his party would pay for buses and trains to take the hooligans to away fixtures. No money changed hands, but Shprygin says the expectation was clear: the fans would thereafter vote for the party in elections, and fight when called upon.

We often focus on Putin's focus on recruiting and building up the far-right, but his troll farms also focused on the far-left as well. Fomenting further distrust in government institutions and pushing the ""both sides are the same"" narrative.


The far-left is very open to lies and misinformation if it confirms their biases. A great example is Gary Webb's suicide and the conspiracy theory around it. For those who don't know, he died from suicide in 2004. I'll put the method in spoiler tags though it is relevant (if you find yourself thinking of suicide please get help, life is worth living) >!he shot himself in the jaw and then in the temple, but the misinfo posts always leave out that part and just say ""twice in the head"" leaving people to assume it was twice in the brain!<. So the left wing conspiracy theorists assume the CIA did it to silence Webb because in 1996 he claimed in a newspaper series that the CIA knew and helped the Contras run cocaine into the United States (they didn't know, but were employing the traffickers for other purposes and the traffickers used that as cover for their activities). Except that he died in 2004, his reporting didn't hold up to scrutiny and he was known to be contemplating suicide.


But the conspiracy theorists run with it, because it confirms their biases and what they ""know."" Namely that the government is evil and the CIA pushed Crack cocaine into inner cities (which is a racist lie, because crack cocaine was discovered in multiple cities at different times by different people. The assumption that Black drug dealers wouldn't be figuring out how to stretch their product is very problematic).

\- Both far-left and far-right are always looking for controversial fringe viewpoints to defend, since they are in eternal opposition and tend to have very low numbers of continuous supporters. They mostly just mobilize protest voters and tend to defend radical and unrealistic positions to differentiate themselves from other parties.

\- The far left has ties with Moscow dating back to the Soviet Union and the Cold War, when the KGB built up a large support network throughout European left-wing parties. These ties are still active today, far left-wing parties get illegal financing from remnants of the Russian communist party and the KGB. Bear in mind, the Russian KGB never ceased to exist, it was merely split up into 3 agencies and renamed.

That's the reason. Kremlin funding of far-right parties who aligned with the Kremlin's Neo-Nazi ideology (a run-of-the-mill brand of ""identitarianism"") started in the early 2000s, funding and support of radical left-wing parties goes back to the Soviet Union. For example, the German Die Linke was basically the legal successor to the SED, and there are literally old Stasi connections with Russia as well as new ties.

NATO of course wants to keep the door open; they're not going to reject an application from Ukraine.  But they are going to delay ruling on any application Ukraine submits until the conflict looks very different than it does right now.  They may sit on it for years.  The chances of *even one* of its constituent members ratifying their application as-is are basically zero.  That's not 'Russian disinformation' (why has this become the watchword of the illiterate?  Anyone with a shitty argument includes somewhere in their block of text that people who don't agree with them are secret Russian spies, it's like a fucking playground in here); that's just the charter itself.  None of your sources refutes this.  

Where they would be wrong, however, is in citing a single issue (an unresolved border).  In reality any single issue could be overlooked when the 30 members individually meet to ratify.  But there are many other issues that would likely prevent membership.  Remember the *application* was 'fast-tracked', not membership criteria or the ratification process.  Ukraine's current economic situation alone presents difficulties with membership.  

I happen to think early NATO membership would have been enormously beneficial to Ukraine and given Russia an easy out.  I don't think it would have lead to an all-out war with NATO.  But at the same time I don't see any constituent country satisfied with Ukraine's current contributions as a member.  Members like Macedonia or Albania cannot vote for another country that would be unable to pay for its own defense.  Progressive members will want securities from Ukraine on a number of outstanding human rights issues.  Anti-corruption watchdogs cannot vote for Ukraine without a major overhaul.  Ukraine recently arrested a small ring of politicians and former military who were embezzling American donations.  You can't have that shit happening in a time of war.  NATO is willing to work with Ukraine to achieve all of this, but they can't do it inside a year.  

So yeah, the borders and the burden of defense is not the whole story, but at the same time seeking membership is pointless right now and for the foreseeable future.  It would break every code NATO has rather than just stretching one criterion.  

People seem to think Ukraine fast-tracked its app yesterday with some expectation of it being fruitful.  No way.  It was done as a sarcastic jab at Putin right on the heels of his speech.

Hopefully whatever NATO and the US is telling Russia for the consequences of using nuclear weapons is enough to stop him.

An impassable nuclear tundra would be infinitely better in Russia's eyes than a NATO/US/Western Aligned naval base at Sevastopol. 


Without a base at Sevastopol, Russia cannot get its black sea fleet out into the world. It cannot expand to a true Blue Water navy without warm water access. If NATO had a base there, Russia's entire black sea fleet would be absolutely fucking useless. That base would be unacceptable to Russia. If Ukraine joined NATO then Russia is boxed in on the west and Russia's imperial ambitions are effectively over. The border (on which they must dedicate massive amounts of their military to defending) remains long. A destroyed Ukraine that they control would narrow that defensive space / cost significantly. 

Nuclear use would be absolutely disgusting. It would garnish a fierce response from every country on earth. It would absolutely be the haybail that crushed the camels skull. That's why they won't do it even though it is advantageous to do so.

5 years ago I would agree with you 100%. The problem is Putin is dying. Whether of the rumored Cancer or simple old age, he turns 70 this year. Each year that passes, his dream of rebuilding the USSR fades a little more. On top of that he has spent his life being ""the strong man"" and faced with the inevitably fate of losing the power he's spent his life building, possible medications for either illness or recreation, and the long standing fact that he doesn't care about human life, friend or foe, citizen or foreigner, Allie or Enemy, I no longer trust that he won't lash out and nuke everyone if he feels he's going lose, just to watch the world burn.  

I'm no psychologist, but Putin also strikes me as a [""Family Annihilator""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familicide) - *""Male family annihilators are typically driven by loss of control, including financial crises, separation or divorce, and may demonstrate evidence for domestic violence...""* and *""Men who murder their entire families usually do so because they believe their spouse performed a wrongdoing and that the spouse needs to be punished, they feel that the family members caused a disappointment, they feel that their own financial failings ruined the point of having a family, and because they wish to save their family from a perceived threat.""* I'm not certain Putin isn't going to take Russia down with him simply because  ""Russia can't survive without him"".   Yes, this is all speculation and may be wrong, but from the last 7 months, It seems to be more plausible.

 Now the #1 argument that they won't use nukes, has been ""The people down the chain of command will stop him first."" While I hope this is true, I would not bet on it. There are plenty of people who buy into his rhetoric, and he's had years to put people into place that are unquestioningly loyal to him, and there are many that are going ""Do It!"" like the Chechen leader Kadyrov. I wouldn't count on those in the military doing anything to stop Putin using nukes.

Yes, Logically Russia and Putin gain nothing by using nukes, only death and destruction. But I don't see any logic at all coming out of Russia, and I see a leader that is paranoid, increasingly unstable, possibly medicated, and who really know what he's capable of in that state. While I hope by all that is good and great that you are correct, but to state ""There is no chance Nukes are going to get used"" is as much a fantasy as ""I'm going to win the lottery"" Yeah, it's still very unlikely, but it is a possiblity.",False,1664653751.0,t3_xslirq,t1_iqnncv7,,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,

>would they just slaughter millions of civilians to cause a collapse of a nation? If so, Russia will inherit a wasteland and the worlds largest humanitarian crisis right on their door with millions of victims

yes absolutely they would. and they would probably see all those costs as a plus side. say they nuke kiev. the wounded can be left to rot n die, moscow wont care. those that flee will either flee to countries hostile to russia (bonus for russia as that causes instability and strife. they were already arranging this shit before the war) or into russia which fits their plans well anyhow as that is what they have been doing to Ukrainians in captured locations anyway.

>would they strike all along the front to hit centers of Ukrainian forces? well it would kill a lot of Ukrainian troops, but it would also kill a bunch of Russian ones as well. And at least for a few weeks a nice irradiated wasteland would block any sort of advance. It's not likely that a military strike like this would really accomplish much at all for the ""special military operation""

possibly, tho i doubt it would actually  stall the Russians at all. this is the army that sent people to dig trenches in the red forest. they care nothing for the well being of their pawns. i do think this is probably the least likely scenario tho.

you are absolutely correct that there is very little military value to dropping a nuke right now but with all the stupid bs and munitions wasted on destroying the fuck out of worthless non military targets and disregard for the lives of Ukrainian civilians and Russian soldiers the reasons not to nuke seem to dwindle down to ""what would the world's response be"" and ""does putin think he can get away with it / would it help him at home"" luckilly for now the answer to both of these has been no and i really hope it stays that way",False,1664653930.0,t3_xslirq,t1_iqnncv7,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

Regarding the railroad, I don’t know how much of Ukraine’s logistics uses rail (unlike Russia, which relies on it). Also, I don’t know if Ukraine will or is using rail to supply its armies near the front line. So the train station in Lyman may be operationally moot for a time. **/e**

It puts Ukraine close to Kreminna and Lysyschansk-Severodonetsk (L-S). The latter [twin] city in particular is part of the Russian logistics network at the moment, though Kreminna lies on the P-66 Highway (and there's a rail line going through there), which parallels the front line between Svatove & L-S. That highway leads into Valuyki/Urazovo, RU, which is currently the closest north-south road for resupply in and out of Russia (Ground Line of Communication).

Symbolically, retaking L-S in particular would be a huge blow for Putin's propaganda, since it's a major city center in Luhansk Oblast.

Practically, every part of the Russian logistics/transport network (GLOC) that is reclaimed by Ukraine puts a further strain on Russian resupply & maneuvering, because they have to take longer paths further east of the Ukrainian advance. So if the Ukrainian armed forces retake Kreminna, Svatove, and L-S, then Russia is in even deeper shit in the north-east. Starobilsk (railway hub & H-21 highway) would probably become the next north-south GLOC in Luhansk for Russia on Ukraine's interdiction shitlist.

Though I personally wonder if Ukraine will solidify a line in Luhansk once they retake the P-66 axis.

Both armies started out from a bad place - mired in Soviet era doctrine and corruption. However, Ukraine realized after 2014 it’s very survival depended on doing better. With a lot of Western help, they engaged in a concerted program of military reform, concentrating on the basics - logistics (cleaned, as much as possible, from disabling corruption); and professionalism - particular in the NCO corps. 

Russia, on the other hand, engaged in a program of military reform that heavily emphasized flashy military hardware and performance for show - putting together a military that, on paper and on parade, looked very impressive (in a 2020 article that has aged like milk, the Economist called the Russian military “dazzling”). 

No-one ever called the Ukrainian military “dazzling”, before this war. 

What they are, is pretty good by Western military standards - with good morale, and of course very motivated. Not some sort of elite, put competent, the result of some solid training and now, actual military experience. Plus success is its own tonic (though that has to be weighed against battle fatigue, which is very real). 

What makes them really shine, is that their Russian opponents are, by Western standards, terrible. The Russian reforms aimed at the wrong things, did not concentrate on the basics of professionalism. The “reform” Russia did was strictly a “Potemkin” reform, aimed at impressing observers, not at fighting battles; their morale is bad, and getting worse as they keep being defeated; their leadership is not well versed in military strategy; and of course they never did anything to counter corruption.

A more strategic move would be to surrender the city and move to the other side of the Dniper which is more defendable and logistically easier but that’s politically untenable for Putin.

The result is basically a constant bleed from the Russian side in exchange for holding it longer as Ukraine is able to destroy troops with artillery and russia can’t. And this is a perfectly satisfactory outcome for ukraine, the more russia bleeds the easier the outcome will be on the other fronts.

Russia of course has the advantage of being in a civilian city which Ukraine doesn’t want to destroy, if this was just a random hill which you could destroy with artillery as you pleases that would be a complete rout. Regardless slow bleeds can be done while generally keeping civilian infrastructure in tact.

Timely retreats are important in any decent military doctrine and Russia seems to have started to take the “no step back” approach and particularly locked themselves into this through annexation (early on the war the goals were vague enough that Putin could excuse retreats, not anymore). Lyman being a premiere example of that and from all accounts the Russians got slaughtered. Similar is happening in Kherson at a slower pace.

The fire bombing of Tokyo was extremely more deadly and combined with other cities killed many more civilians with both short term and long term consequences, but even conventional explosives had more casualties than the atom bombs.

I think to avoid a nuclear war, NATO would launch a massive air campaign using conventional weapons, 99% decimating Russia's ability to wage war in Europe.  Their Black Sea fleet would be taken out, Russia's Air Force erased, every military base in Western Russia that could threaten Ukraine or Europe would be gone.  This could all be done with conventional smart bombs and cruise missiles, drones and stealth bombers, accurate fire hitting important targets and knocking Russia back in the 1800s.

* On Russian soil, in violation of the Test Ban

* In international waters

* On Ukrainian soil, but somewhere that will have few (if any) casualties - think something like Snake Island, which is essentially unoccupied but symbolic

* On Ukrainian soil, targeting military force concentrations

* On Ukrainian soil, targeting civilian infrastructure

* On Ukrainian soil, targeting the civilian population

Nobody knows what NATO's plan is, but they will respond in a manner proportional to what happens. A test on Russian soil is different than hitting Snake Island or taking out a dam.

The ""lightest"" case is likely more sanctions, declaration of Russia as a terrorist state (cutting off trade from India/China), more arms for Ukraine, and a push to expel Russia from the UNSC.

The others vary from a no-fly zone, to destroying every piece of Russian equipment outside of Russia (including their fleets) _but not invading Russia itself_, to a massive cyberattack shutting down the Russian power grid, internet, water, etc., to boots on the ground and pushing Russia back over the border (but again - not crossing the border itself).

The key is that it has to be _more expensive_ for Putin to use a nuke than it would be otherwise. They have to make it obvious, no guesswork - Putin will be worse-off if he nukes than if he doesn't.

Cause if you think about it, any replacement for Putin right now will still have massive problems and troubles and no one in their right mind is going to want to inherit this shit sandwich. Best bet is that they'll let Putin be the man in the chair for the worst of it. 

At that point they can issue new talking points to the state media goons pinning all of this on Putin, have him arrested for betrayal of and crimes against the Russian people. They'll probably let a faceless and character less figure like Mishustin (who is anyway the acting president in lieu of Putin) to take over. 

The problem with all this is that there'd be a power vacuum behind Mishustin (or whoever takes over acting president) and potentially a big struggle. There's maybe a small chance that one of the siloviki like Patrushev decides the best way forward for Russia is to make at least a show of backtracking and attempts to make reparations with Ukraine and the west, but I'd like to hope that neither will move an inch on sanctions or negotiations about the future of Ukraine until sincere attempts to reform corruption, media control, protections for speech freedoms, and of course relations with Ukraine: recognizing by constitution the inviolable sovereignty of Ukraine over all its territories including Crimea, as well as the sovereignty of all other relevant nations (Georgia etc), full reparations for the damage done, and recognizing the war crime trials conducted by the ICC.

Him using nukes isn't a win button. Will he saturate the battlefield where all Ukrainian troops is?

However it does make sense for Russia to do it.

Nordstream 1 was shutting down. Nordstream 1 and 2 both have 2 pipelines each in case one gets destroyed, backup purposes, shut down purposes etc.

Russia needs Germany and Europe to stop helping Ukraine and to stop facilitating arms transfers and stop sanctions.

Shutting gas off was to shock Germany. It didn't work.

Not all pipelines were destroy. Both Nordstream 1 were, which would shut down after nordstream 2 goes online.

Only 1 of the 2 nordstrean 2 pipelines were damaged.

This is Russia saying ""soon if you guys don't smarten up nothing will be left and we can't go back"" meanwhile Germany and other countries desperately want the war to end and get cheap gas back.

Russia leaving a single pipeline is there last ditch effort. The last chance. Soon to be gone.

Moreover it shows Russia has the ability to destroy the pipelines, and moreover if no one can prove it was Russia is sends another message: nice pipelines you got there, like ones from Norway to Denmark, or other Baltic pipelines.

Be a shame to lose them. Who knows who did it? Clearly not us.

It legit 100% makes sense it would be russia, and I dunno why people can't understand this.

That said, to be fair we just do not know yet confirmed who did it. But it actually makes no sense for west to do it. It's infrastructure that can be used in future after the war.

On the opposite side of your post, there isn't a reason for anyone else to blow it up either. Every country that would be open to receiving the gas already had it shut off on them. What would they get out of blowing it up? The countries in the area that didn't want it build just watched it get shut down, why blow it up now?

The only wildcard in the region in the area is the country who just started a war against their neighbor for no real reason. If we are only jumping to conclusions then Russia would be the prime suspect. The only other country that might have an interest in doing this would be the country that they are at war with and it would be very difficult for Ukraine to achieve something like this. Still, even after saying that I have to question... What advantage would Ukraine get from bombing it?

There was a long lecture floating around on youtube whch popped up quite a bit a few months back which was a (Finnish?) professor explaining the history of the Russian culture and the mindset that is created from it.

In that he was of the opinion that the ""normal"" way of thinking about the government for Russians was that the leader was an all powerful great guy and the people under him were fucking it up.

That is, in his opinion I believe, why they have that tv show every once in a while where people get to raise their disagreements with Putin directly and he sorts the problems out.

I have no knowledge of the Russian mindset but it made a bit of sense to me the way he described it. It would explain what you are seeing there and finding hard to follow. Worth a watch if you haven't seen it. About an hr from memory.

""Heavy losses"" is an extremely loose and relative term: we will not know until the relative rate of casualties and equipment losses are known; Neither I nor the Times knows. But Ukraine's ability to do the Kharkiv blitzkrieg and then with a brief pause, a sustained assault against a heavily defended Lyman suggests that the heavy losses are heavily weighted against Russia.
Ukraine's ability to wage another offensive in the next 2 weeks will provide further clues as to the level of it's losses. Effective use if Himaes and modern Nato artillery, as well as anti artillery and anti-air, as well as coordinated rapid attacks, I think have significantly changed the rate of loss in Ukraine's favor  Russian forces seem confused, badly led, ill-rquipped and ill-supplied.

It would take many nukes - dozens - along the front or in a particular section of the front. You wipe out the Ukrainian forces there, or obliterate their supply lines. Then you rush your forces in through the gap before they have a chance to regroup.

You might ask - well surely the troops will get irradiated - and this is true. But these are the same people who were digging trenches at Chernobyl. The bigger flaw in this plan is that we found Russia \*can't\* rush forces through an open gap, because their logistics are shit.

So in theory there is a way to do it. Small yields, decimate a section of the front line, guard your forces against radiation and burst through clear of the radiation zone into the enemy rear. Or, systematically target the rear so the front lines can no longer be supplied and collapse. But Russia seems unlikely to be able to successfully implement or exploit either method.

The boats were formerly classed as MTBs (motor torpedo boats) but, from 2009, the Royal Norwegian Navy has described them as corvettes (korvett) because their seaworthiness is seen as comparable to corvettes, and because they do not carry torpedoes. They were built at the Umoe Mandal yard. With a maximum speed of 60 knots (110 km/h), the Skjold-class corvettes were the fastest combat ships afloat at the time of their introduction.

The relevant precedent, of course, is how the PRC got the seat to begin with. [The vote never went to the security council for Taiwan to veto.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758) It was obvious that the UN was not going to allow things to happen any other way, so the Taiwanese delegation stormed out and declared that the UN had violated its values.

In order for Russia to meet a similar fate, there would need to be a similar process, and a similar feel of inevitability. Ukraine has already pointed out a loophole - _technically_, Russia was never given the seat to begin with; it followed Moscow.

That is literally a lie

	

>In February this year, Bolsonaro met with Putin in Moscow, shortly before the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, and expressed solidarity with Russia.

>""We are in solidarity with Russia. We have a lot to collaborate on in several areas. Defense, oil and gas, agriculture and the meetings are going on.""

>	In July, during a conversation with supporters, he openly criticized the sanctions against Russia.
> 	In the same month, Bolsonaro stated that he would propose to Zelenski that he do what Argentina did in the case of the Falklands in 1982, accept defeat and surrender.

All in all I would say that bolsonaro is more pro-Putin than lula

Pros: 

Very effective to use tactically to stop the current Ukrainian offensive.

Cons: 

Saber rattling is what keeps the west from intervening directly. Using nukes almost guarantees higher-level western involvement which spells the end of the war and probably Putins power.

Support from CCP/India probably ends instantly, and the already pretty brutal sanctions become universal with no relief from anywhere. Russia becomes a total pariah state, cut off economically from essentially everyone.

Unless they're *very* lucky and plan *very* well, a nuke going off in Ukraine WILL spread fallout into Russia. Support among the population of Russia will dry up at a much faster rate when they cant drink the water or eat the food without risking radiation poisoning.

 >The Morgenthau Plan was a proposal to eliminate Germany's ability to wage war following World War II by eliminating its arms industry and removing or destroying other key industries basic to military strength. This included the removal or destruction of all industrial plants and equipment in the Ruhr. It was first proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. in a 1944 memorandum entitled Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany. While the Morgenthau Plan had some influence until July 10, 1947 (adoption of JCS 1779) on Allied planning for the occupation of Germany, it was not adopted.

Gonna repost an old one of my comments

&#x200B;

Things to remember-The US using back channels to let Russia know the consequence of a tactial strike is not new and has been ongoing for months. This does not mean a tactical nuke is close to imminent-The conscription of 1 million means Putin and Russia are planning for the long term-Ukraine for months has been using western weapons to strike targets on Russian soil and also in Crimea.-Russia is suffering and rightfully so, but they are nowhere near the brink of collapse you would think they were if you only spent your time here. Reminds me of reddit overplaying Bernie Sanders' chances. There are still so many economic options on the table to punish Russia-""People thought they wouldn't invade Ukraine"" The US government did. And the US government and several close to it still believe it's highly unlikely that Russia resorts to a tactical nuke in the near future. They have been blunt with Russia upfront for months letting them know the deal. The recent public comments are only in response to being asked by media about Putin's recent round of empty threats.-You think a man so paranoid of death is going to want to resort to dying in nuclear fury? There are several lines of escalation here. Russia STILL hasn't attacked many of the Nato Supply lines they know about in Ukraine. Putin has and is still doing everything he can to avoid NATO. If Russia does somehow face revolution that is a threat, it will be a threat because it has the backing of the Russian military turning against the Kremlin and therefore this ""big red button"" (which isn't a button, multiple chain of commands involved) won't even be on the table.-The fact that Putin is even holding these sham referndums to justify sending conscripts to those area show this is a man trying to do anything at all to protect himself/not a mad dog with nothing to lose.Take a deep breathe. This is a lot and can feel scary, especially after the last few years. Keep the Ukrainian people fighting for independence in your thoughts.",False,1664654185.0,t3_xslirq,t1_iqnvfw2,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Dr Stranglove notwithstanding, how exactly are we going to get all the Russian nukes?  

To your second point, they would not stop at Ukraine.  The entire point of mutual assured destruction was to prevent any nukes from going off. Because once they start going off, it becomes increasingly urgent to go all in to limit the enemies ability to Counter-Strike.

Yes. And I'm just following the playbook.

One nuke from Russia forces NATO to strike back. You're pretending like I don't know the basics of this or MAD theory.

That's how it has to work.
