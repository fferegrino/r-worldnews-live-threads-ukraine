*The counteroffensive of Ukraine has begun? It looks like yes*

*On the Zaporizhzhia front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine switched from preparatory strikes and attacks by light forces to a full-fledged attempt to break through the front in the Orikhiv region. All signs point to this. Namely:*

-

— Using of great forces.

— Appearance of Leopard 2 tanks in battle.

— Attack in three directions at once and continuous pressure.

— The first results and positions recaptured from the Russian army.


-


*There is no point in guessing whether the breakthrough will be successful, especially since we do not fully understand what results the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already achieved. Simply because the only source of information is the Russian side. But even from their messages, you can learn some information.*

*First of all, they don’t hesitate to report on the local successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine — the liberation of 1-3 small settlements or their outskirts. In addition, the rhetoric of the Z-channels is strongly reminiscent of the one that was at the very beginning of the Izium operation. It takes 2-3 days for them to begin to recognize the obvious. I do not rule out that the same thing may happen on the Zaporizhzhia front.*

*However, the attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot be taken too optimistically now either. As I said, so far we see only an attempt to break through. This is a war between two sides. And it isn’t at all necessary that the Ukrainian army will win all the battles. Now we need to observe and analyze what is happening, keeping a sober head. It is important that the main direction for the first attempt was exactly Melitopol. About why, in my opinion, it is preferable, I wrote back in the spring. In short, this is the closest road to the Crimea and to the “land corridor” of the Russian army.*",False,1686250940.0,t3_143yos2,t3_143yos2,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

>
>1. Avoid the temptation to bothsides a calamity. That's not journalism.
>
>2. When a Russian spokesperson claims that Ukraine did something (e.g. blow a dam), this is not part of a story of an event in the real world.  It is part of a different story: about all the outrageous claims Russia has made about Ukraine since invading in 2014.
>
>3. Citing Russian claims next to Ukrainian claims is unfair to the Ukrainians. What Russian spokespersons have said has almost always been untrue, whereas what Ukrainian spokespersons have said has largely been reliable. The juxtaposition suggests a false equality.
>
>4. If a Russian spokesman (e.g. Dmitri Peskov) must be cited, it must be mentioned that this specific figure has lied about every aspect of this war. This is not insult but context. Readers picking up the story in the middle need to know the background.
>
>5. If Russian propaganda for external consumption is cited, so must that for internal consumption. Propagandists long argued that Ukrainian dams should be blown. A Russian parliamentarian takes for granted Russia blew the dam and rejoices. See @JuliaDavisNews
>
>6. When a story begins with bothsidesing, readers are instructed that an object in the physical world (like a dam) is just an element of narrative. They are guided into the wrong genre (literature) right at the moment when analysis is needed. This does their minds a disservice.
>
>7. Dams are objects. How they can be destroyed is a subject for experts. This NYT story has the  merit of treating dams as physical rather than narrative objects. It becomes clear that the dam was likely destroyed by an explosion from the inside.
>
>8. Russia was in control of the relevant part of the dam when it exploded. This is an elemental part of the context. It comes before what anyone says. When a murder is investigated, detectives think about means. Russia had the means. Ukraine did not.
>

The ex-commander of the Polish Land Forces Waldemar Skrzypczak told Ukrinform on June 8 that the Western military has ""no doubt"" that Russia was behind the Kakhovka disaster.

""Russian propaganda and the money of Russian oligarchs, who still finance Western mass media, sow these doubts. But no one in the military has any doubt that the Russians did it,"" explained the Polish military expert.

Skrzypczak, who previously served as a deputy defense minister, said that Russian forces mined the dam already in 2022 and used the destruction to hinder Ukraine's counteroffensive plans.

I have kept quiet on the counteroffensive and this is by design. But I want to say this:

The Russian troops at many parts of the frontline are getting pounded by tubed and rocket artillery, Storm Shadow, JDAMs etc. Sometimes tanks and IFVs join the fray. The long range strikes such as in Tokmak and Melitopol in the last hours are even more interesting. 

**Most if not all of that ""repelled"" attacks Russians claim are in fact them surviving barrage after another one and having a chance to report them.** In some limited cases Ukrainian forces launch probing attacks and even get through. There are already permanent liberated areas, but that is not the purpose of probing attacks. 

Those few videos which sometimes appear are almost all videos from Russian sources and obviously cherry-picked. But they are not impressive either. **Yes, when an army advances or launches probing attacks there are inevitable losses. During D-Day allies lost 2000 men in the first hour.** But the enemy loses far more and, more importantly, the enemy has already to react in a forced way.

**The main strike hasn't arrived, yet. It can arrive anywhere and anytime at the front**, even areas which have not been intensively shelled. Btw. I'm still on track with my predictions. Russians, however, are currently burning down their limited (mobile) reserves which they have in order to deal with the current situation. Intelligence gathering plays an important role at this stage, too, without going into details.

Overall what I see right now is what I would expect from an Ukrainian counteroffensive. Keep calm and wait for the events to unfold.",False,1686238853.0,t3_143yos2,t3_143yos2,,0,115,0,115,0,0,

They are not about to unleash their best troops.  They're dead Dave. They're all dead.  (well maybe not all dead but so many of them are and who can resist a chance for a Red Dwarf quote?)

They are not organised enough to enact a fighting withdrawal.  To enact a controlled fighting withdrawal for the best of Western troops takes years of training and is generally under the cover of superior air or artillery. Mobiks, first handed a pointy stick a few months ago, are not going to be working as a cohesive unit under fire , we've already seen that multiple times on offensives,  Why would people suddenly think they will be so much more efficient on the defence?

Once the first line of defence is breached they are going to roll up. There's my prediction and I'm sticking to it. We saw it at Kharkiv which only ran out of steam when Ukraine got too far ahead of their own logistics train that they had to stop giving Russia time to reorganise and pile fresh bodies into the line.

Kherson in August 2022 had the best of the remaining VDV and other elite units defending it (however degraded some of them were, they were still good) .  Most of the frontline is now manned by recent mobiks with a few better trained troops held in reserve. Kherson also had the opposite geographical advantage for the Russians that Ukraine now holds. For more context see next paragraph.

I've made this point before but it bares repeating. The front Russia has to defend is now around 550 kms (if you accept that an incursion over the Dnipro is now unlikely) To get troops or supplies from one end to another of it is more like a 1000 kms trip.  From their most central point it's 300 kms to either end of the front

Ukraine on the other had can set up logistics hubs and reserves pretty centrally that can move to any part of the front less than 100 kms away.  a fraction of the distance and with more direct roads/rail \\ravel time too. When they find a weakness they are going to hit it hard and open it right up. Russia just do not have the time to shift forces from one part to another.  Ukraine will out manoeuvre them. Forget any western weapons, doctrine, anything else, Ukraine have an incredible advantage because of geography.

The Russians are going to break and run.  Their reserve of good troops is stupidly stretched and these deep logistics hits are going to leave them unable to react

Yes there will be losses in the reconnaissance in force that are taking place in multiple spots across the frontline.  Yes there will be losses when the line of defence is broken. Once it is and it most certainly will be IMO the Russians will roll up very quickly based on the evidence of three things -1. the last year, 2. the 1991 Iraq war (similar equipment on both sides, Well Ukraine actually have better now HIMARS< and Storm shadow for example both came into action after the Gulf War) and 3 the known command structures of the two different armies.

They do not have the manpower or equipment to defend a front this big. They just don't.  They will not be able to defend in depth against the speed of the Ukrainian forces and the covering fire of the now far superior artillery and rocket systems.

Iraq showed that you can just bulldoze trenches and bulldoze or flail the minefields and roll through them, we've seen the equipment to do this sent to Ukraine although it was less heralded than some of the things that go boom.  The only thing that could stop this from happening is a concerted artillery and air bombardment along with ground support of the equipment in action.  After the last year of total failure of combined arms from the Russian army what in the world makes you think that they will suddenly pull this off? The Iraqis couldn't and they really were a well trained army, fighting with decent equipment.

Had they had their entire original invading army of decently trained troops (and there were many very good units there despite all the jokes) and better tanks and artillery advantage they may have been able to hold.  They don't.  They are so severely degraded they can't even deal with a small incursion GTA'ing around Bilihorod.

I cannot see how the evidence of the last year and recent wars both Russian and Western can be viewed any other way and yet still people bleat on in this very thread about how it's going to go wrong for Ukraine.

It's honestly bizarre.

&#x200B;

EDIT - By roll up, I mean quickly lose a lot of ground and defensible positions - I don't think Ukraine will be swimming in the Azov by tea but I do believe they will inflict such a break into the Russian line that a very large withdrawal will be inevitable. I hope it will be so devastating they can push through 2014 lines as if the Russians get to reorganise and defend a much smaller frontline they will become a lot more effective.

There are even voices that maybe, just maybe Russia should save some of those cruise missiles for military targets...

The loom and gloom mood is even visible in articles of  correspondents like WarGonzo:

> Can 'HIMARS' play a decisive role in the offensive?

>Of course, we possess a whole array of advantages when on defense. It would be foolish to dispute this. The enemy needs to expend far more human, armored, and finally, fire resources to achieve results. Our goal is to hold out. Their task is to break through somewhere.

>One could argue endlessly about the quality of soldiers on both sides. I agree with our military correspondent guru - Sasha Sladkov. Our fighters are more experienced on the frontline than the training reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). And our air force is also more powerful. But there are nuances, it must be admitted, particularly in terms of trends I, unfortunately, see regarding the use of the notorious 'HIMARS.'

>It used to be thought that the enemy was extremely cautious with them, operating in our deep rear areas. However, over the past week, I have received data that these golden - in terms of price - ammunition of the AFU have begun to be used without restraint right at the forefront. There are several examples on the Avdiivka direction. Similar reports are now coming in from my guys at @wargonzo - already from Zaporizhia. They are hitting directly at the advanced fortifications.

>That is - they are not particularly conserving them now. And apparently, the stocks that we destroyed, alas, we did not destroy completely. Moreover, the West demonstrates its readiness to make any economic sacrifices for even the ghost of Kyiv's success. Everything - for the neo-Nazis, everything - just to hurt Russia. There's no doubt in this motto. Our boys in the trenches fight heroically. And they will, of course, continue to fight. But the enemy isn't stupid, they've tested the waters - in places, received a slap when trying to push through with armored groups and infantry - resulted in a lot of burnt out equipment and casualties among personnel.

>I fear that now they will try to carve out a corridor with this weapon - the 'HIMARS.' Well, why not - they have nothing to lose, as the saying goes - all or nothing.

> This is, in a sense, combat reconnaissance. The enemy is thus trying to calculate how much our BC, if it runs out, will go directly to the LBS. No matter how many stocks there are, all stocks tend to run out. For the same ""Gradom"" will not drive a truck or KAMA3 with BC. He shot back, he needs time to recharge. The question is how long it takes, how far, convenient/inconvenient to go to the food point. With the waves of offensive that are now going on, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to find not so much gaps in defense as to find weaknesses in our supply logistics. At the moment when we are conditionally empty, when we are reloading, they will try to take the main assault … Counterbattery work is added. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will try to play on the depletion of our ammunition. The offensive is a voracious story. All battalions ask for fire and the more, the better. That's how they plan to catch us now. And we haven't seen all the NATO toys on the battlefield yet. For some reason, the ""Leopards"" and Bradley don't go to clear the fields in the front rows. [Sarcasm? Impossible to tell with machine translation.] One enemy attack is not the whole offensive. They don't care how much they burn now - one brigade, two brigades. They have reserves. Therefore, the density of our fire should not decrease. The bigger and more stable it is, the faster the enemy's motivation will end. It is important to understand that this is just the beginning. We keep our ears on the top of our head.

However, I worry about our  MIC capacity and stockpiles with any real conflict with China over Taiwan. 

No matter how bad and corrupt the Russians are, they don't have the manpower and manufacturing capability of China. Therefore, we must build an even bigger stockpile and have the capacity to rapidly escalate production in wartime. Ukraine has fought a blistering war of attrition with our MIC table scraps, but they have also paid for it in lives lost.

Unless we (the citizens of the United States) want to face a similar fate in the future, we will need to arm the shit out of our Pacific allies and prepare for a tough fight. That said, we should put everything on the table for Ukraine as a lesson to those who think they can build empires in the modern world with acceptable losses. The idea of attacking Taiwan should be unthinkable.

So I have changed my mind about the MIC, they were right the whole time. We must be strong against the bad actors of the world, and be prepared ten times over for a long hard war that will test our valor.

Key Takeaways

1. Ukraine has conducted counteroffensive operations with differential outcomes in at least three sectors of the front as part of wider counteroffensive efforts that have been unfolding since Sunday, June 4.  
2. Ukrainian forces conducted a limited but still significant attack in western Zaporizhia Oblast on the night of June 7 to 8. Russian forces apparently defended against this attack in a doctrinally sound manner and had reportedly regained their initial positions as of June 8.  
3. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) responded to the Ukrainian attack with an uncharacteristic degree of coherency and praised Southern Military District elements for repelling the attack and regaining lost positions.  
4. Russian sources provided explanations for claimed Russian successes during the June 8 attacks, praising Russian forces’ effective use of electronic warfare (EW) systems, air support, and landmines against Ukrainian forces.  
5. Russian forces appear to have executed their formal tactical defensive doctrine in response to the Ukrainian attacks southwest of Orikhiv.  
6. Ukrainian attacks in western Zaporizhia on June 8 do not represent the full extent of Ukrainian capabilities in the current counteroffensive.  
7. It is additionally noteworthy that the Russian Southern Military District Forces deployed in this particular area are likely to be a higher quality force grouping than Russia has elsewhere in theater, and their defensive performance is unlikely to be reflective of defensive capabilities of Russian groupings elsewhere on the front.  
8. Russian forces and occupation authorities continue to exacerbate the humanitarian ramifications of the flooding resulting from the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP) dam break.  
9. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly postponed his annual press conference from June 2023 until November or December 2023.
Russian forces continued to conduct limited ground attacks on the Kupyansk-Svatove line and around Kreminna.  
10. Ukrainian forces made limited gains around Bakhmut, and Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line.
Ukrainian forces continued to conduct limited ground attacks on the administrative border between Donetsk and Zaporizhia oblasts.  
11. The Russian MoD continues to posture itself as a firm authority over the defense industrial base (DIB) through emphasizing its ability to transport new equipment to the front.  
12. Russian occupation authorities are reportedly resorting to punitive measures against civilian populations in occupied Ukraine due to Russian occupation authorities’ decreasing influence over civilians.",False,1686276834.0,t3_143yos2,t3_143yos2,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

It’s definitely possible that Russia intentionally allowed the water level in the reservoir to raise in order to maximize damage. My question, though, is why did Russia allow the water level to sink so low before the water level was raised? Would a lower water level allow the Russians to more effectively sabotage the dam with the intention being to “blow” the dam at a later date? Or was there some other reason to let the water level sink so low (another way to mess with the civilian population, or just plain old Russian mismanagement and incompetence, etc.)? It just seems weird to me that there are two anomalies here: a really low water level followed by a really high water level. But I could also be making mountains out of molehills, too.

We love Girkin doom-posting, and he is usually spot on. This is quite worrying, if Girkin is this calm, my bet is that we will not see many successes in near future.

Girkin post translated: 

*""Perhaps, now we can reliably say that the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began 5-6 days ago. It began with an auxiliary strike west of Ugledar in the Volnovakha direction. At the same time, attack-demonstrations (with tactical purposes) were launched on the Donetsk front - in the Vodiane-Experimental area, tactical attacks are being made in the Bakhmut area. Well, the day before yesterday, an offensive was launched in the main direction - in the Orekhov region towards Melitopol.*  
  
*To date: the auxiliary attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have not led to any results, except for heavy losses. We failed to take Novodonetskoye, in the rest of the sectors - at best, small tactical successes, measured in a few kilometers of the ""gray zone"" and several hundred meters deep in our forward positions. Near Donetsk - no change. Under Bakhmut - small (and insignificant from all points of view) tactical advances of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.*  
  
*On the main axis, the enemy goes ""for broke"", stubbornly attacking our positions in order to break through the front. At the moment - after a day of continuous fighting, it is indirectly known about minor penetrations, there are no breakthroughs. And there are big losses. A significant part of them are in minefields in the ""gray zone"" and from our air strikes there.*  
  
*It suddenly became clear that our aviation was ready precisely for such a development of events as a massive night attack, was able to fire guided missiles at night no worse than during the day, and prepared in advance for an enemy attack.*  
  
*Now the ""partners"" have two options: stop burning their reserves in frontal attacks, crawl back and regroup (in fact, curtail the offensive at the very beginning) or still try - using the significant superiority created in the number of people and line units - to first push through the front , and then try to break through it (as they did last year near Davydov Brod in the Kherson region).*  
  
*I assume that the enemy will not stop the attacks that have been launched, will not change plans on the go, and we will have a long bloody battle. Depending on the success of the enemy, it can last from several days (4-5) to 2-3 weeks. If the enemy manages to achieve at least minimally encouraging successes, he will beat and beat in the hope of a breakthrough. No - the attacks will gradually fade as losses increase.*  
  
*Once again, I state that the obviousness of the direction of the main attacks of the enemy did not allow him to achieve operational surprise, just as it was not possible to divert reserves to secondary directions and direct them (despite the hysteria of Prigozhin and Co., who seemed to ""play along"" with partners) to Belgorodskoe a direction to repel the sorties of the DRG (which does not mean, of course, that it was impossible to repel them there much more effectively without attracting reserves from the Southern Front).*  
  
*Our counter-offensive after repelling an enemy offensive is not to be expected even in the most optimistic scenario - the enemy, even after the defeat, will have a serious superiority in manpower and the number of combined arms formations. Without broad mobilization and the creation of new armies and corps (an additional 300,000 military personnel - at least more or less normally trained, armed and equipped) - the RF Armed Forces will not be able to successfully attack with the strategic goals of defeating the enemy.""*",False,1686238697.0,t3_143yos2,t3_143yos2,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

First of all, while the destruction of the dam can absolutely be seen as a war crime and it is a type of escalation in this conflict, it in **no way** presents an escalation that warrants a military or direct response. The red lines in this conflict drawn by NATO are in regards to nuclear incidents, use of biological weapons or other WMD, and any type of incident happening in NATO territory. In a way, this is no different than Russia systematically killing, torturing and raping civilians, or systematically destroying civilian infrastructure such as the power grid. So in that sense, while heinous and barbarous - it's sadly nothing ""new"". Just because you feel that this crosses some type of moral and ethical boundary, doesn't mean that this has any significance in relationship to NATO in the context of this conflict.

This means that any type of reaction that Western nations might want to give, will lie in the indirect realm. For example, by adding to weapon deliveries or sending aid. That is already a mature process that is well underway. You can't just yeet a couple of tanks on a boat and ship them to Ukraine at this stage. Nor does this event fundamentally change any of the existing considerations when it comes to sending certain types of weapon systems. People have been clamoring for ATACMS as if they present some type of magic bullet and *if only* the US would stop being afraid and send them, things would be different. But fact is, the whole escalation with long range weapons taboo has been broken already, and what is left are other inhibitions, such as effectiveness, logistics, integration and available stocks. Those fundamentals do not change because of a destroyed dam. 

As for a non-response somehow emboldening the Russians, that is also complete nonsense. You cannot take the absence of a reaction to crossing a non-existing line as a positive reinforcement. This is not a gradient where Russia gets to boil the frog. It's a binary situation: they either cross the line or they don't. As long as they don't, there will not be a reaction. When they do, there will be reaction. Nothing more than that.

""Jake Sullivan, Yermak’s counterpart in Washington, has established very consistent contact, occuring on a regular basis. It is no longer just the two of them but also, as I recall, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, and the leader of the military forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Negotiations are well underway, but Sullivan has publicly declared his opposition to such a choice [granting Ukraine long-range weapons], and he has reported his opinion to the President.

There is one word here, Escalation. They are dragging their feet because the White House is afraid of escalation. Jake Sullivan, in my opinion, has made a huge error. I believe this block is still in place due to him and numerous other White House aides.""

1) The UA military is still a bit behind when it comes to high level coordination and planning (compared to the US)

2) Do they have enough equipment?  Most of the promised equipment is still not operable on the front line. Ukraine needs overwhelming force to break through.

If Ukraine can reach the threshold of overwhelming force, and maintain adaptable cohesive decision making down the chain - I think they will break through.

I just hope they have enough equipment ready to breach the defense lines and maintain forward momentum.

I know Russia is a mess, but they have also been anticipating an advance in the south for a year.  While they have 550km of Frontline to defend, there are far fewer locations that would make for an effective counter-offensive.   Those locations are heavily fortified with 3-4 lines of defense.  While it sounds easy to just barrel through, this would only work in a very narrow path, which exposes advancing forces to artillery fire.

I am hoping for the best, but I don't think it's a cakewalk by any stretch and the casualties will be horrible. Then, they have no other choice, it's only going to get harder and harder as the defense lines become more and more fortified.",False,1686238341.0,t3_143yos2,t1_jndqk56,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Of course public persons need to protect their reputations, but I think there's more than that behind it. It's been my personal experience that the more you learn about a topic, the more you understand how much you *don't* know. To a lay person everything seems simple: ""Tank X has better specs than tank Y so that side will win"". The truth is that we just don't have a lot of data on large-scale modern-age near-peer conflicts to draw conclusions with any kind of confidence. Is thermobaric rocket artillery more valuable than a palletized logistics chain? Does troop morale count more or less than a nuclear deterrent to prevent the war from spilling over into your own territory? It's very hard to say. 18 months ago no one knew that a 100$ drone toy from AliExpress could work as a massive force multiplier. This war might have plenty of surprises in store for us yet.

Attacking is very different from defending, and the current situation is very different from Kharkiv. For all their losses, russia still has more tanks than Ukraine, more artillery, more shells, more aviation. They also have a complete disregard for human life and happily sacrifice literally tens of thousands of men to capture the burnt out remains of a town with no strategic values. What for any other country would be a tragedy they celebrate as a victory. Attritional war with russia is a hellish nightmare. They also don't see themselves as bound by any international laws or customs for war. Their main weakness has been disorganization and lack of discipline. These problems can be solved, or maybe not. It probably doesn't even matter. Large-scale wars don't tend to be won by the capturing of trenches. It comes down to who can maintain the largest defense industrial production. Clearly the West has the largest potential here. But after a year and half we're lagging behind russia when it comes to ramping up production and putting it on a war footing. I think Ukraine will have some success on the ground but that won't necessarily determine the outcome of the war. The biggest threat to Ukraine is Trump winning the White House. The biggest threat to russia is Prigozhin turning on the Kremlin. 

I do very much hope that you are right but I don't at all see how one can look back at all the twists and turns of this war and feel confident in any kind of predictions about how it will evolve over the next 500 days.

It doesn't help that so many people in the West act like the Leopard2 and Abrams are some kind of magically invincible tank that will shrug off shrapnel from nearby 152mm shells and grad rockets.

When you put a piece of war material on a preposterously high pedestal like that, it only inevitably helps Russian propaganda efforts later.

Russian trolls love that shit. Now they can demoralize low-information audiences by pointing to this single destroyed tank and acting like it means something.

This is always one of the risks in the back of mind of Western countries that are donating their weapons and vehicles to Ukraine. They are always concerned that when one of their most highly touted platforms ends up destroyed in a Russian drone video, their citizens will be outraged and act like their government has lied to them about the efficacy of these weapons and all the money that's been spent on them across decades.

The Ru MOD is going to try and show that it's putting it's best foot forward and Ukraine will have loses. It's war, after all, but offensives are hardly won in a day. Campaigns hardly in months. 

Those expecting instant results and updates are likely not going to get them unless we see a decisive rout of Russian forces or a Ukrainian Vuhulidar style lemming train. Both of which I think are unlikely, but the latter moreso than the former.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,143yos2,jnh5air,"It's mines and artillery. That Leopard2 was killed by artillery because when your advance vehicles reach a minefield, you're a sitting duck until the mines are cleared. Clearing mines is 100% safe as long as you have enough anti-mine equipment for the job and the enemy can't shoot at you. But that's not real life in a war with no air supremacy.

Unlike the Americans in 1991 and 2003, Ukraine can't break through minefields with 100% assurance that the enemy won't shoot back while hundreds of air-dropped, precision-guided bombs blow everything with a 152mm barrel to smithereens. Ukraine doesn't have the time or clearance on the ground to slowly use their mine-clearing vehicles without taking losses. So, what happens? Your front squad of vehicles finds some mines (either by accident or on purpose) and they get to work. But your vehicles to the rear get targeted by artillery while they wait.

This is the conundrum Ukraine was well aware of before this offensive. The only ultimate solution to this problem is to pack more mobile artillery into your armored spearhead than the enemy has guarding their position. You need to beat the enemy with a greater concentration of artillery so that the enemy artillery will be unable to shoot at your mine-clearing columns.

And that's no small task. It is almost impossible to do. You can only achieve it if all the following are true:

- You have hundreds of operable, functioning mobile artillery vehicles
- Those artillery systems can out-range the enemy artillery
- You stockpiled enough ammo over the winter (probably over a million 155mm shells and several thousand HIMARs rockets all told)
- Russia doesn't find out where you're hitting them in time to re-route their reserve artillery and get it in range in time to outnumber your attacking artillery
- Once you actually start attacking, it is a guarantee that Russia will now know you are there, but they will be slower to arrive than a reserve unit that knew you were coming; now you also have to artillery-bomb their resupply roads so that Russia can't more slowly re-route the third-layer reserve artillery forces to your position

All of those bullet points have to be true for Ukraine, or the particular axis in question will fail and will have to halt its advance or be destroyed. Only *after* all of those things are achieved can they safely work on the mines.

Ukraine probably *can't* achieve all of those conditions for *every* one of its avenues of attack. So, in order to increase their chances that they catch the Russians out of position, Ukraine has to use a sub-optimal, Tier-2 minefield strategy: They aren't just concentrating in one place. They are concentrating in as many as eight different places.

They are also attacking Russia in areas where they can't hope to achieve any breakthrough at all, such as up near Bakhmut. The purpose of the Bakhmut assaults is not to break through, but to force Russia to reposition badly needed artillery reserves to that location so that they can't kill Ukrainian armored columns in the south. This is called a ""holding"" attack.

They also have a third-tier strategy, which unfortunately is the least safe but is nonetheless necessary: they just fucking go for it and try to get through a mine field and hope the Russian artillery doesn't respond in time before they are through. This is the very least optimal condition to attack under, but unfortunately it's necessary. Many of these advance Ukrainian mine-clearing columns will be destroyed in their entirety. They will hit mines, they will get blown up by artillery, and the rest of their vehicles will effectively be frozen in place, unable to retreat before the rest of the Russian bombardment finds them and destroys them in detail. This happened more than a dozen times to Ukrainian armored columns attacking the Kherson salient. It is extremely bloody.

But Russia doesn't appear to be achieving this *everywhere*. So far today, there are at least three areas where positive breakthroughs have been reported by Russian milbloggers. One of them, according to American defense sources, is already as deep as 5-6 kilometers.

I would guess that things are going about as fast as Ukraine realistically expected them to. The reality is that this is going to be a very slow advance for at least a week or two, and that is *absolute best case* scenario. It will take a long time for the artillery and counter-artillery fire battles to work their courses. We're talking about weeks of artillery duels even in the best conditions.

A *lot* of Ukrainian vehicles will be blown up before the smoke clears in these initial front-line engagements. We're talking about hundreds of vehicles that will be gone by the end of this week -- MRAPs, Hummers, APCs, and yes, probably quite a few Western tanks. No vehicle on Planet Earth can survive the artillery onslaught Russia has prepared for the AFU on the southern front. It's just a question of whether Ukraine can find, destroy or isolate those artillery batteries in the coming weeks, while very slowly and painfully picking their way through miles and miles and miles of minefields.",1686276804.0,1686275439.0,t3_143yos2,t1_jnh2xgb,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

To challenge him you have to want to, which most don't, and have more guns and support than he does. Only way to do that is team up, because no one force is strong enough to take on all the people who might be loyal to putin, with those exact other people who are personally loyal to putin.

It's not a major escalation. It's just an escalation. Blowing up dams is part of conventional warfare (even though it is a war crime), and Russia has been killing civilians en masse for the past year. Just because this is a big event, doesn't mean it really represents anything new. 

>  Increase in weapons capabilities and distribution is more than fair

Sure - but that doesn't happen overnight. The stage of weapon deliveries is currently at the point that you can't just snap your fingers and make it happen. Nor, as I said, do the existing limitations in the current deliveries suddenly change because of this event.

The point is people are angry and upset, and demand some type of immediate justice and response to make them feel better. When they don't get that response, they point fingers to the Western governments and blame them for being supposedly weak. That is a naive approach to the situation. 

Fact is, this is not about us, and our feelings. People treat this whole endeavor like some type of television show. They cheer for Ukraine, they get angry at the Russians, they react to major happenings and expect global players to cater to their feelings and emotions. So when Russia blows up a dam, they ""demand retribution"", so they can go back to feeling good about Ukraine. It's disgusting, frankly.

Yes, ethically and morally they've taken it a step further.

Perhaps because Elon himself is a well-financed insincere actor, he believes everyone lies in their own self-interest: so everyone is equal and there are no good guys to protect, so everyone should be able to say anything they want.

For a systems guy he really sucks at even seeing the parts of big picture he doesn't understand. But that's kind of critical to be good at that job, the job he says he wants. 

It's like he cannot imagine a world where everyone doesn't think like him and he's just better at it than anyone else. Think about that statement for while and you can see what's wrong with it.

If it's 0.1% of the population that's 44,000 potential pilots, at 0.01% of the population that's 4,400 potential pilots.  So the barrier to building an airforce isn't the down range war fighters, it's the availability of equipment, air frames and parts, consumables, fuel and ammo, training cycle for your potential pilot pool, and technology.

If you contrast that with ground forces, by accounts right now Ukraine has an army of 480-500k along the front with something like 200k being down range war fighters.  While the potential manpower pool for ground forces is much larger the sheer numbers of active combat personnel needed makes manpower a real barrier.

Basically an airforce is the a military branch that expends money and industrial capacity rather than people.  Yes there are down range war fighters that are suffering attrition, but the potential pool of pilots is so absurdely large in relation to the amount of pilots that it's economically feasible to employ that really manpower isn't a barrier to an Air Force.

The problem with Air Forces in war, is that the training cycle for pilots is so long that it's incredibly tempting to cannabilize your training staff as war fighters.  Which was the US's 1st major innovation in WWII.  A system of deployment that never cannibilized the pilot training program.

So who is being massacred and who is doing the slaughter? If Ukraine is talking losses (as you correctly, it seems, state) then the paragraph implies Ukraine is the subject of the massacre. But if the Ukraine is doing the slaughtering then your sentence following confuses and works against that point. 

""Bloodbath"" might be a better choice for a colorful word that is less directional. Yes it's going to be brutal. Ukraine will take losses. Yes Russia will presumably be routed in places to be yet seen. We won't know until it happens. 

But furthermore, Twitter has always been sometimes the best news source available whilst simultaneously being a terrible news source. Reddit has always relied on it since day 1 of this war, and I've commented on that before. But Reddit does also have Ukrainians on the ground reporting, but the good ones there are being quiet because they've been asked to (and that's smart). And TV news is useful but very imperfect itself, and is subject to time constraints and the need to simplify complex subjects into a neat package.

No, NATO will not prevent an incident. There is no way to know beforehand if situation will devolve in a nuclear incident or not. A nuclear ballistic missile is indistinguishable from a conventional warhead. By acting before something has happened, there's a much larger chance of NATO eliciting a direct conflict by mistake. The onus is on Russia to NOT do these things. This is not even a question.

> I believe that Russia is testing the waters by blowing the dam, and is gauging the response.

Your belief is founded in suspicion and fear, and not in reality. You're making it way to complicated. This is not a gradient situation where Russia gets to boil the frog. It's a binary situation: they either cross the line or they don't. As long as they don't, there will not be a reaction. When they do, there will be reaction. Nothing more than that. Hence, the absence of a reaction when Russia is *not* crossing a predefined line, can never be seen as an escalation or the testing of a limit. It only seems that way to you because *you* feel that Russia has crossed a boundary. That boundary however is an ethical and a moral one, but not one that has any significance in relationship to NATO in the context of this conflict.

Furthermore, you are vastly overestimating Russia's plans here. They are not working by some grand design where they are slowly escalating things.

You are clearly purposely diminishing the significance of that link by referring to them as ""lawmakers"", by not accounting for the fact that they both occupy key positions in their respective committees on defense. These are not random politicians but key players, and what they say matters.

Additionally, this is precisely how such things are generally signaled. You will almost never see the executive (or in this case, NATO) coming out with clear terms to the public because reality is complicated and there by necessity and reason needs to be room to respond. 

Lastly, we also know that there have been explicit warnings regarding nuclear strikes in Ukraine from the US to Russia in private. The consequences also laid out by former generals to the public, rather than the US saying it outright in line with the same type of mechanism I referenced above. We don't know exactly what has been said there, but we do know that as a whole the line has been drawn pretty clearly in regards to nuclear.

It's actually fairly simple. They just map out their minefields. Mine-field laying is part of the science of military engineering. The planners and designers endeavor to create meticulous mappings of their minefields, with gaps in the minefields for reconnaissance, resupply, and retreat. Often, a well-designed minefield will even encourage the attacking force to *use* the mine-free road, as bait to cause them to bunch up and die when you brutalize them with a battery of pre-sighted grad rockets.

>Yes this is going to be a horrendously hard fight for Ukraine, but eussias defensive lines hold a lot of similarity to everything else they've done in this war... amateur as fuck

Yes and no. Minefield tactics are some of the easiest military planning initiatives to pull off. Even Iraq in 1991 did it fairly well. But Iraq got fucked very quickly because there were literally more American bombers in the sky than Iraq had artillery tubes to fire at the approaching tanks, and all of those artillery systems were smashed to bits the moment they fired a single shell.
