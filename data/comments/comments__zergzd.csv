- Russia has recently started extending defensive positions along its international border with Ukraine, and deep inside its Belgorod region. On 6 December 2022, the governor of Belgorod announced he was establishing local 'self-defence units. Trench digging has been reported in Belgorod since at least April 2022, but the new constructions are probably more elaborate systems, designed to rebuff mechanised assault.

- There is a realistic possibility that the Russian authorities are promoting defensive preparations within internationally recognised Russian territory to burnish patriotic feeling. However, it probably illustrates some Russia decision-makers' genuine (but false) belief that there is a credible threat of invasion by Ukrainian forces.

- Paucity in strategic assessment is one of the critical weaknesses in the central Russian government architecture: as highlighted by Russia's original decision to invade Ukraine. Impartial official analysis is almost certainly frequently undermined by a tendency toward group-think and politically expedient conclusions.",1670398155.0,1670396228.0,t3_zergzd,t3_zergzd,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

I thought the real problem would be societal, with high chance of Russians rising up and refusing to die in a war that has bogged down and seems to be going nowhere.

Originally, the modernization efforts were meant to catch up to NATO circa 2008, after the short Georgian war. But by the time it really got rolling, NATO was looking further into the future, developing capabilities based on what it experienced fighting global unconventional threats whilst keeping an eye on Russia and China.

The newest Russian AK, was meant to be a lot like China's new AK/M-16 hybrid, but because Russia refuses to accept how much the culture of lying holds them back, they had to settle for a rifle that is worse than Poland's modernized AK from the Iraq era. In fact it's worse than most AKs modernized by random US citizens who just want a project and want to show their fellow gun nerds that they're ""not like all the other girls"". 

Meanwhile Poland saw modernized AKs as an evolutionary dead end and wanted to make a fancy modular polymer rifle like the Belgians, Germans, and private US firms had made. 

Until Russia takes a step back, accepts that it will never be a global power, and really tries to fix corruption, it will never be able to modernize as best it can with the military budget it has. Because unlike China, Russia's economy isn't suited to catch up to where NATO was 10-15 years ago. It's barely good enough to catch up to where Poland was in '05",1670437165.0,1670428691.0,t3_zergzd,t3_zergzd,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Putin added, ""Nevertheless, we have a strategy... namely, as a defense, we consider weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons — it is all based around the so-called retaliatory strike — that is, when we are struck, we strike in response.""

The Russian leader said that US nuclear weapons were located in large numbers on the European continent, while Russia had not transferred its nuclear weapons to other territories and is not planning to do so, but ""will protect its allies with all the means at its disposal, if necessary.""

Putin says he still views nuclear weapons as a deterrent measure. ""We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, they are in a more advanced and modern form than those of any other nuclear country, this is obvious,"" he said.

While they're relatively dangerous people with sinister plans, let's not forget that they're actually a bunch of idiots who actually wanted to destroy German infrastructure with EMPs. And then just march into the Bundestag and declare themselves the correct government and expect that to work.

Edit/Addition: The whole 'Reichsbürger'-movement is kinda like a fringe group of flatearthers grinding on technicalities... their main point is, that the current German state and government is actually not based on contracts/formed by the people, but acts as a big corporate business after the second world war. All this in order to suppress the good German people (good in this case: arian and not immigrated).

They try to issue their own official documents and circumvent German government and are often in conflict with the law. They have a relatively high visibility in media, since their ideas/behaviours are widely regarded as absolutely stupid and can easily be made fun of. Nevertheless, the moment someone makes actual plans to threaten infrastructure, people and institutions fun is over.

They will not be able to do another one for some time.  While Russia's behavior is certainly childish and unmeasured, I think at this point it's more realistic to consider these strikes strategic rather than tantrums.  The tantrums are the 3-4 missiles a day shot into fields in Kharkiv or Chernihiv for no strategic purpose.  Whereas these infrastructure strikes can only happen irregularly after a period of relative downtime as a result of massive logistical maneuvering.  

15% missiles getting through means it has to come in very large volleys at multiple targets.  To do this even weekly or biweekly they have to scramble missiles from bases on the other side of the country, attach warheads to mismatched body casings, weed out duds in storage, select targets, move artillery, have ground, air, and sea coordinate the attack in the span of a couple hours.  It's an effort at this point.  

Doesn't mean they can't respond capriciously in other ways.  Shahed drones were used for the first time in weeks the other day.  That was likely a snap decision by somebody.  Hard to say whether as a result of the UA attack succeeding or the RU attack mostly failing.

 >Diffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when other bystanders or witnesses are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so. The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group.

Russia has been deteriorating in multiple ways (except a bunch of guys getting insanely rich) for years now, but Ukraine, while battling systemic corruption and old ways ingrained by Soviet times, has been looking for a ""way out"", looking West-wards for an alternative (just as most ex-Soviet states), to Russias great annoyance of course. But the important thing is that, for better or worse, Ukrainians know Russians.

This isn't Putin outsmarting U.S. politics with his ""4-D chess"", the one trick he played on the U.S. before they at least wisened up to his modus operandi and upped their vigilance; no, this is Putin talking to himself and slapping himself in the mirror, no lies will do. Russia is learning the hard and painful way that all they can do and come up with, Ukraine knows about and can also do. They're divergent cultures with the same progenitor, for lack of better description.

If Putin thinks he's going to wage his ""long war"" like battling Chechens or Afghanis again, he's got another thing coming -- Ukrainians are like Russians if Russians had evolved naturally to more prosper as a nation rather than to learn to set up shady off-shores and scam the world for money and invent better robbing schemes. Ukraine, knowing Putin quite well and much better than the West does, will look to shut a ""long war"" down ASAP exactly because they know how Russia will feint whatever only to recover and come back swinging. Or Ukraine will prepare to brace themselves accordingly but make no mistake about it -- they are wise to most tricks Putin has to play because Russia has taught them everything! The son will murder or mutilate the father, to obtain his freedom, and the son knows quite well how the father thinks.

That's also what Dudaev was talking about (linked elsewhere in this thread) saying how bordering states have learned Russias treacherous ways, through living through them unfortunately. Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine -- this is why they're so harsh call bullshit on Russia when Putin and his lackeys are scheming and playing games with the rest of us.

>More like 10-20 and I still don’t understand how that has any effect on nuclear war.

Diet has no connection or correlation.  No relevance whatsoever.  (A smoked red herring also has.no relevance)

The problem is the dialogue.  Putin announces concerning statements about nuclear weapons.  Then that gets posted in here as if it were relevant to tbe thread's topic. 

One group of idiots (The Ruzzians) wants Ukraine to surrender because of heart disease.  Then here on reddit people retort that ""there is no heart disease"".  From the content of their posts you can tell they just loath the idea of Ukraine capitulating.  Arguing that heart disease is not a problem is stupid.  People are so eager to write anything supporting Ukraine that they will argue that red herrings are going extinct from global warming and over fishing by Chinese factory boats.  

Vietnam has no nuclear weapons.  USA lost a war in Vietnam.  France and China have nuclear weapons.  They both lost wars in Vietnam.  Both USSR and USA fought wars in Afghanistan.  The Taliban are in control of Kabul.  Algeria is independent from France.  The entire British empire is no longer the British empire.  The idea that Russia's nukes have any bearing on Ukraine's willingness or ability to wage war is absurd.  

The backlash from Ukraine supporters is justified.  But those who are lashing back tend to dismiss the nuclear problem.  That is just wrong.  The arms limitations treaties need to be renewed.  There are many reasons to worry about a nuclear exchange happening in the 21st century.  

IMO it gets worse.  Ukraine did it right.  We are supporting Ukraine *because* they got rid of the nuclear weapons.  The narrative is inverted.  The Budapest Memorandum is why HIMARS and Javelins are flowing into Ukraine.",False,1670456037.0,t3_zergzd,t1_izblqom,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

I left a few days after mobilisation (I bought my ticket out of the country the day the new territories were annexed, because I knew mobilisation would start shortly thereafter), so I know how weird things were getting for foreigners. Did you hear the health checks are now mandatory, and will be more strictly enforced by threat of cancelling your visa or just reducing the amount of time on it? 

I don’t know how it is in Saint Petersburg, but I got  weird looks I got whenever I spoke English or another language in public in/near Moscow. I couldn’t tell if they were looks of, “Why are you even here?” Or “Get the fuck out of my country” looks, but I wasn’t interested in staying in the country long enough to find out if those looks ever turned into something more sinister. I believe they will over time. 

Russians I knew even went quiet whenever we walked together and passed random groups of people, saying it was better if strangers didn’t hear me speak. I can speak Russian well enough, but I have an accent, so we didn’t switch to Russian in case they heard me. 

Really, I have so many stories of going somewhere with Russians and them warning me not to speak. Even a vet clinic. This person didn’t want their vet to know they were with a foreigner. It was so, so weird at times. 

Peter is a much more non-vatnik city from my experience, so maybe your experience is a lot different. 

I don’t usually give people unsolicited advice, but you really should consider leaving before the next mobilisation. I had friends who were English teachers. They have also left. I know the pay rate hasn’t gone up so much as to make life there worth it nowadays. Too much unnecessary stress. I feel like I aged five years in six months. 

Maybe you have an issue with your wife needing a visa to your home country. I don’t know. The few foreigners I know still there are married and have issues getting their partners visas for their home countries. Still, they are very actively working on their exit plan.

However, in my example, I never implied any of your arguments. With that being said, and as you see in my example, NATO only expands through democracy and a certain level of capitalism in the economy.

If you are the leader of a decidedly undemocratic society with an oligarchic economy, NATO's expansion to a neighboring state within your historical culture profile is absolutely a threat to you, especially if the state of your authority is relatively weak.

Yes only because I was responding to your comment, which completely ignored any factors that are in Russia's favor. Most posters in general do this so I see nothing wrong with what I said.

>But if the factors were as you suggest, the behaviors of the two sides right now would be reversed.

How so? What I've said gels with how the lines have shifted. Ukraine exploited Russia's lack of manpower to force territorial concessions. Ukraine's manpower pool is so deep that it is able to sustain massive casualties and keep on ticking, meanwhile Russia employed a smaller force, relying on small amounts of separatists and Wagner members for many situations. To rectify this, Russia has been mobilizing and recruiting more troops. The vast majority of the mobilized have not even completed training yet, only around 80k of the initial 300k has been deployed.

What these events DON'T suggest is that Russia took 100k KIA since that would imply 2-300k wounded which would effectively account for Russia's total military presence in the country. It makes no sense. There would be no army to man the existing line, yet that's clearly not the case, and they are even on the offensive in the Donbass still.",1670463930.0,1670463671.0,t3_zergzd,t1_izcbjx7,,1,0,0,0,0,0,
