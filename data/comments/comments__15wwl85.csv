At the suggestion of his deputy, Valery Chekalov, the companies began to actively steal assets in a variety of ways.

> One of the most common ways is to accumulate so-called ""dead souls"" on paper state and collect their salaries. Basically, financiers and accounting staff make money in this way. In some departments, the number of such ""zero"" employees reached 30-40 people. Multiply that number by an employee's average salary of 50K to 100K and you'll be surprised at the numbers that add up. And it's MONTHLY. This is finally being looked into by Mikhail (*likely Gen Col Mikhail Mizintzev, former deputy defense minister who joined Wagner after being fired in April*).
> 
> A separate interesting scheme exists for the security arm. There is another gold mine there. Craftsmen plunder Prigozhin's budget and profit from the purchase of equipment. Covering them all is the same deputy Valery Chekalov. How the scheme works: Prigozhin receives applications to purchase equipment for the security service, including for surveillance (yes, SURVEILLANCE and EXTERNAL SURVEILLANCE are also handled by a businessman's company). The applications indicate foreign equipment, they say that it is very expensive. Under this, Prigozhin allocates a budget, and as a report he receives fake receipts. In reality, they do not buy anything, money goes straight to someone's pocket.

> Employees of a lower rank simply steal what they can and put it up for sale online. Many enterprising people in Prigozhin's structures continue to strip it for assets, while fighters participating in the war are not compensated for injuries.

This is coming from a Z source closely connected with Russian intelligence services, so should be taken with a grain of salt. The channel has high-placed sources in the anti-Wagner camp.

> ‚ÄúI will pull you all out right away, get you to the hospital, you'll all be resting soon. Just chill for now.‚Äù

> Excellent footage shows the destruction of a Russian stronghold by the Erebus Group's aerial reconnaissance unit. The military of the Russian Federation arranged a ""lair"", which, together with its personnel, was obliterated by a flock of our kamikaze drones.
>
> Of particular note is the interception of enemy conversations that accompany the video in real time. The commanders of the invaders were stunned by what was happening, promising to help the wounded only in words, but in reality they were unwilling to even send in a rusty ""loaf van"" for them.
>
> After the excellent work of the drones, our warriors took this position.

The comms, not yet translated into English, have the Russians in the dugout screaming for help, their light wounded becoming heavy, and heavy becoming dead. Commanders continue to lie to them about medevac being on the way, only to eventually admit that they never sent it out to begin with due to kamikaze drones. 

The video also highlights:

1. Russian comms continue to be a joke and Ukrainians continue to listen to them in real time. Shoigu's new Azart radio sets flat-out never worked, so Russians rely on commercial walkie-talkies and personal cell phones going off of Ukrainian towers. We've known for months that forward units have spotty to no communications with their commanders in the rear.

2. Everyone on Russian comms was extremely concerned for someone with the callsign of Uho, The Ear. Likely an officer, this supports a steady trickle of obituaries for Russian officers, captains and majors getting regularly killed in action at a rate we had not seen since Feb-Mar 2022. 

3. Dire lack of vehicles. We have seen a chorus of complaints from front-line Z sources. Shortage of vehicles is so critical unit commanders are unwilling to send them forward. Units instead use stolen or donated civilian vehicles; there are constant funding drives in Russia for loaf vans and cheap 4x4s organized by specific units. There is also a steady flood of protests because Military Police continues to stop, confiscate, and destroy these unofficial vehicles, often throwing anyone they find in them into the brig.

\---------

1/ Russian propagandist Alexander Sladkov says that Ukraine's occupied Donetsk region is a place where ""they applied everything that we talk about but cannot put into practice"", and calls for a similar regime to be adopted in Russia. ‚¨áÔ∏è

2/ In a newly published video, Slavkov praises the way that the 'Donetsk People's Republic' (DNR) deals with dissidents and offenders by imprisoning them in basements, using them for forced labour or sending them to the front line, and calls for Russia to do the same.

3/ ""In the Donetsk People's Republic, especially at the dawn of its birth, they applied everything that we talk about but cannot put into practice. Well, \[due to\] our routine, our legality, conservatism, indecision. Let's say curfew: if you get caught, no matter who you are, even the Pope, you still go to the basement. There was a strict order, now there are already indulgences. ... Unfortunately, we have to follow instructions, directives, decrees.

4/ ""God forbid, someone was caught drunk ‚Äì they go to the basement. And representatives of different detachments came there and could choose their own ""robots"": ... to wash somewhere, to clean something. ... Sometimes a nightclub was working somewhere. They would come, pick them up and take them to the front line. And these glamorous boys and girls in short skirts and stilettos, they were unloaded on the front line and they walked back to Donetsk on their own ...

5/ ""So the DNR was once such a normative and practical testing ground for putting into practice all the things we think about but cannot do.""  
As Slavkov observes, the DNR (and its counterpart in Luhansk, the LNR) have been lawless zones for years, where citizens have been seized from the streets and forcibly mobilised into its 'People's Militia'. Many thousands have died as a result.

6/ Both have been annexed by Russia but Russian law doesn't yet operate there. The Russian army has taken advantage by imprisoning and torturing dissenting soldiers in improvised basement-prisons in the region without legal challenge.

7/ Such imprisonment is illegal in Russian law, a situation which Sladkov regrets. His call for similar measures to be adopted in Russia highlights how the human rights abuses seen in occupied Ukraine may end up spreading to Russia as well. /end

They want to blame the former chairman of Roskosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, for the crash of the Luna-25 space station. According to our information, information about the loss of the station had already reached the president, and he was simply furious. At that time, next to Vladimir Putin was the head of the Presidential Administration Anton Vaino and press secretary Dmitry Peskov.

Putin called the incident a shame for the entire space industry and even broke into a cry. It is worth noting that the financing of the Luna-25 project during the work on it increased by almost 8 times and instead of 1.5 billion rubles, about 11.5 billion were spent. The Luna-25 station was Rogozin's flagship project during his tenure at Roscosmos.

The current chairman of the department, Yuri Borisov, told the president that communication with the station was lost during landing, but he could not give any clear reasons. Rumor has it that he told the president that what happened could be caused by errors at the design stage. In a closed conversation with one of the leaders of the government, Borisov uttered the phrase: ""Rogozin killed Russian space.""

The President instructed to sort out the reasons as soon as possible and punish the perpetrators, ""regardless of their status."" There are rumors that Rogozin may be detained as part of a criminal investigation.

---------------------------------------------------------------

>Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations on at least two sectors of the front and advanced near Robotyne.

The real news is the lack of counter-battery fire. Looks like all those blown up tubes Ukraine's been claiming are legit. Interestingly enough, RF milibloggers aren't whining about shell hunger, but rather a lack of counterbattery fire across the entire front. Pay attention to this because it's not a logistics issue; it's a personnel and equipment issue. Those aren't things Putin can solve by showing up on Kim Jong Un's doorstep with his hat in hand. This is a systemic problem. It feels safe to say the RF counterbattery issues won't improve until the winter break at the earliest.  

A lack of artillery makes the mines easier to remove. After that it's just douche bags in trenches. We're about to see some serious movement of the lines in the next week or two.

>Ukrainian strikes against Russian deep rear areas are generating discontent in the Russian information space and sparking criticism of the Russian military command, as Ukraine likely intends.

You don't say. 

This isn't significant enough to become relevant any time soon, however. Don't expect a rebellion this year. [Not from the civilian population, at any rate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/15u6e9l/explosion_in_moscow_area_reported/jwo87de/)

>Ukrainian strikes on Russian rear areas are demonstrably degrading the morale of Russian forces in Ukraine, which could threaten the stability of Russian defenses.

This is key. It's just another sign spirits among the Russian forces is shit. Any one who's played any MoBA knows that a defeatist attitude is often a self-fulfilling prophecy. But the ISW is right: morale won't become relevant until something breaks. Think of this more like potential energy, like unburnt gunpowder. It just makes every spark the Ukrainians throw that much scarier.

>The Netherlands and Denmark confirmed that they will transfer F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine but did not specify when.

Huazzah! Thank you Netherlands and Denmark for taking the first step! Previous Absolute Chads of countries include, 

* United Kingdom for the first MBTs
* United Kingdom for Storm Shadow. 
* Poland for playing the role of Pitbull of Democracy. 

F-16s won't show up until the pilot's training is done sometime next spring. 

>Russian officials have reportedly drafted a plan to conduct a decade-long ethnic cleansing campaign in occupied Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast.

When Mussolini fell the Italians hung him from a lamppost. I expect no less from the Russian people in regards to Putin.

>Wagner Group commanders accused two high-ranking Wagner representatives of betraying Wagner, possibly representing a growing fracture within the Wagner leadership and suggesting that the Kremlin‚Äôs and Russian MoD‚Äôs efforts to disband Wagner are partially succeeding.

Wagner's star continues to wane. Putin is a skilled and effective politician, whether we want to admit it or not. Prigozhin might still be walking around, but I doubt he has the capacity to threaten Putin directly. Not anymore. My guess is Wagner won't become relevant until Putin's regime falls, at which point we might see a resurgent Lukashenko. A quick annexation of Belarus might see Lukashenko move in to fill Putin's power vacuum, using Wagner as muscle. That's a long-shot scenario, however. 

>Russian forces conducted offensive operations near Kupyansk, Kreminna, Bakhmut, along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line, and in western Donetsk-eastern Zaporizhia Oblast on August 20 and marginally advanced near Bakhmut.

Oooh! Five spoiling attacks! That's two more than yesterday. Shit's heating up. 

>Wagner Group fighters continue to commit violent crimes after returning to Russia.

Wait, there's consequences to pardoning violent prisoners, giving them PTSD, and turning them loose on the civilian population? Well fuck me. Who the hell saw that coming? 

>Russian officials continue to forcibly transport mothers and children from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia under the guise of medical retreats.

They really can't call a spade a spade, huh? At least the Nazis were up front with their genocide. There's not a lot of ambiguity in something called the 'Final Solution'.

> Russian forces have been making a push near Kupiansk in recent weeks, with significant shelling of the northeastern city and surrounding areas prompting the first major Ukrainian evacuation in months.

> Speaking on national television, Maliar said Ukrainian forces ""repelled attacks south of Pershotravneve and Synkivka villages and east of Petropavlivka village,"" in the Kharkiv region where Kupiansk is located, claiming ""last week's battles all ended in defeat for the enemy."" 

> Fighting is also ""quite intense"" near the strategic city of Lyman in the Donetsk region, Maliar said. The main fighting is around the nearby Serebryansky Forest, she said.

> According to Maliar, the number of attacks in Lyman and Kupiansk have decreased, but ""the enemy is currently regrouping, additionally pulling up forces there.""

> In Bakhmut, Maliar said Ukrainian troops have taken ""key dominant heights"" in the northern flank and that ""fighting is heavy,"" with Russian forces trying to knock Ukraine's troops out position in the eastern city. Ukraine has liberated 3 square kilometers near the southern flank area of Bakhmut, bringing the total area recaptured to 43 square kilometers, she said.

See the impact cluster munitions is having on the battlefield, this is without even GLSDBs, the ultimate artillery, arriving in Ukraine yet. The truth is Ukraine only needs to reach half the distance to Tokmak for the 2023 counteroffensive, even if this will make the 2023 CO a failure. This would seal the war for Russia unless Trump wins or there is another mobilization. Why? Well, consider the following:

If Ukraine in 2023, where Ukraine is weakest and Russia defenses are stronger, can reach halfway to Tokmak then it is a no brainer that a 2024 fresh offensive with more of everything, GLSDBs in the fray, eventual F16s and more degraded Russian Army will be able to at least reach and take Tokmak.

The problem is that if Tokmak is taken, Melitopol becomes unsustainable, without Melitopol the coast becomes unsustainable and without the coast Crimea is unsustainable.

Lets assume the absolute realistic worst for Ukraine (aside from Trump winning) and the best for Russia, with Ukraine having to devote a year for each major target. 2024 Tokmak, 2025 Melitopol, 2026-2027 Crimea. Right now there is doubt that Ukraine can reach Tokmak, but once reached, for those informed enough, there is no doubt Russia is done absent maybe another Russian mobilization. It is a chain Tokmak-Melitopol-Crimea and the subsequent tier of each chain cant survive without the previous one, its logistics just depend on them.

""But the West will get tired in such a long war, right?"" The Russia-Ukraine war ending in 2027 would make it 5 years, WWII lasted 6. A 5 year war is actually average lenght leaning to the shorter end for the type of war it is. A long war would be around10 years, 8 if we use the Iran-Iraq war as a benchmark. If Biden wins the GOP will not be in the White House until 2029, so the West getting tired before 2029 does not make sense. Furthermore any such major win per year would renew the hype and support for Ukraine.

Note, I am talking about the absolute realistic worst for Ukraine and best for Russia. The more realistic year is that any such major gain would compound on the improvement of the Ukranian army and degradation of the Russian one making a crumble of the Russian lines more likely. And honestly unless Trump wins Putin is likely to sue for peace if Ukraine makes it as far as Melitopol.

Can Russia do anything to stop it if Ukraine keeps advancing in the south? They could call for a general mobilization but the result of that is a toss up. It could improve the situation and freeze Ukraine in the south, but it could also worsen logistical problems or cause unforeseen problems in Russia.",1692650571.0,1692650072.0,t3_15wwl85,t3_15wwl85,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

So Ukraine will get F16 next year. There has been a broad discussion about how Ukraine will and can use them effectively. I think most commenters here and other opinion pieces were quite clear, that F16 are unlikely to be used offensively due Russian anti-air systems.

But I do wonder why that is? I mean we're at day 544 and Ukraine is sending drones and missiles (mostly HIMARS) to Russian occupied territory for a while. Is Russia even using their S300/S400 to defend against those?

What I want to say or ask is rather simple: Shouldn't Russia soon face the same problems concerning air defense as Ukraine before they got Patriot / IRIST and so on? Their supply is not endless and building those anti-air missiles can't be a lot easier that cruise missiles. Is there information how much they used until now?

Its aim is to domestically build 6,000 drones by the summer of 2025 ‚Äî enough to reverse the Russian army‚Äôs chronic shortages of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, on the front line. If it succeeds, the sprawling new drone factory could help Russia preserve its dwindling supply of precision munitions, thwart Ukraine‚Äôs effort to retake occupied territory and dramatically advance Moscow‚Äôs position in the drone arms race that is remaking modern warfare.

Altogether, the documents indicate that, despite delays and a production process that is deeply reliant on foreign-produced electronic components, Moscow has made steady progress toward its goal of manufacturing a variant of the Iranian Shahed-136, an attack drone capable of traveling more than 1,000 miles.

Ukraine seems to have full artillery superiority at this point; longer range, more powerful shells (1 cluster shell supposedly === 4 standard 155), better accuracy, invincible counterbattery (HIMARS) and now (5.5 million shells just unlocked via Biden) near-unlimited ammo to prevent ""10% of required shell rations"" and ""fire-support-triaging"" from ever happening again.

I don't see any way that the Russians could last any longer in such conditions. Deep down, I was suspecting we'd end up needing to take our gloves off and send stealth F-35's (or at least some retired F117s) to help Ukraine get a full victory over Russia.

We know that MiG-29 has been used as a platform to launch AGM-88 HARM. F-16 will add native support for real-time targeting of those missiles, reducing the decision loop from half an hour or more to seconds.

Since Ukraine has been given DPICM, it‚Äôs possible they would also receive munitions like BLU-97 - that is, cluster munitions with precision guidance and which potentially have active targeting systems built into each submunition.

F-16 is also a current electronic warfare platform. Depending on donors‚Äô risk tolerance, ECM pods are available to degrade local SAM and communications systems. That would reduce the degree of risk to the F-16 and allied aircraft as they approach the front line.

Finally, they‚Äôll finally have access to modern actively radar guided missiles to replace their semi-active ex-Soviet missiles. That extends their anti-air range beyond the front line, and allows the launching aircraft to flee without trashing the missile while it‚Äôs in flight.

Russia is inflexible on the battlefield. Ukraine is not. By forcing Russia to make difficult choices you also force Russian commanders into a position where they might make the ***wrong one***.

I mean, a Russian six year old might repeat something they heard their parents say, but I would never think they meant (or even understood) it.

I'm reminded of the following:

>Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for
the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that
others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You
don‚Äôt want to act, or even talk, alone; you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äògo out of your way to make
trouble.‚Äô Why not?‚ÄîWell, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear,
fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.
>
>‚ÄùUncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it
grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‚Äòeveryone‚Äô is happy. One
hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would
be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside
the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your
own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly
feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not so bad‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre seeing
things‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre an alarmist.‚Äô
>
>‚ÄùAnd you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can‚Äôt
prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you
don‚Äôt know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one
hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other,
your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with
your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.
>
>‚ÄùBut your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged
themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or
gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little
organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of
your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated
from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a
further deterrent to‚Äîto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do
anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a
troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.
>
>‚ÄùBut the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join
with you, never comes. That‚Äôs the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole
regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions
would have been sufficiently shocked‚Äîif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ‚Äô43 had
come immediately after the ‚ÄòGerman Firm‚Äô stickers on the windows of non-Jewish
shops in ‚Äô33. But of course this isn‚Äôt the way it happens. In between come all the
hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not
to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did
not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.
2‚Äù
>
>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in
upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor
incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‚ÄòJewish swine,‚Äô
collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and
changed completely under your nose. The world you live in‚Äîyour nation, your
people‚Äîis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all
untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits,
the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed
because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed.
Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not
even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed.
Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The
system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain
itself it was compelled to go all the way.

That's not even remotely true. Drone footage and what's provided by foreign intelligence agencies have wildly different uses.

The drones used by the Ukrainian armed forces are significantly better at real time actions and attacks since they're up close and don't require a satellite to be overhead or a drone over the Black Sea looking at a very specific place. Intelligence provided by the West is used for planning attacks and identifying things out of range of battlefield drones, intercepting communications and plans, etc. They both serve their purposes differently.",False,1692642702.0,t3_15wwl85,t1_jx4tc5r,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

People here deny that it's true, and then a prominent Western or Ukrainian official comes out with an alarming press release announcing that it is in fact both true and urgent, and it gets spread around like wildfire all of a sudden. Meanwhile, on more measured subs like CredibleDefense, the bad news is discussed as soon as it comes out in a relatively calm, even-keeled manner, and they don't panic and doom-spiral when a press announcement comes out later making it sound worse than it really is.

This is especially commonplace here because many of the users only get their info from this thread, and they don't check it everyday. They are told by most of the active users that it's nonstop good news for Ukraine and react with shock and horror when the occasional story comes out lending questions to that narrative.
