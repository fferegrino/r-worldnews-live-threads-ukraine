* Russian banks VEB and the Russian Military Bank are blocked from international banking
* Russia is blocked from selling sovereign debt
* Members of Russian Government and their family members are being personally sanctioned.
* Supporting Germany in the stopping of NordStream 2
* More Sanctions queued up if Russia takes another step forward.

Also, more US forces are being deployed to NATO nations that have asked for extra security.

Analysis: The two bank moves seem small, but they actually are huge because they make it nearly impossible for Russia to buy new parts and materials from outside of the country (such as electronics).  The inability to sell sovereign debt means that the the Ruble is going to further tank, and bring about runaway inflation in the country.

Biden has also made it clear that he recognized that Putin was directly threatening  not just Ukraine but members of NATO in his speech yesterday, and that the US will stand with our allies.

&#x200B;

""Last night, Putin recognised the independence of the two regions.

Today he exerted that these regions extend deeper than the ones he's currently recognised as independent.

If you listen up to his speech last night, he's setting up to go much further than these territories.

Who in God's name does Putin think that he has the right to declare countries. This warrants a firm response from the other countries.

I told Putin a month ago, that we would act.

Today, I'm announcing the first tranche of action, closely coordinated with our allies and partner. The sanctions will target FIB and their military bank. We will cut off Russian Government from Western finances, so that they cannot trade its debt at Western market. We will also impose sanctions on the oligarchs profiting from this corrupt system

We worked with Germany to ensure that Nordstream II will not move forward.

**If Russia continues, our sanctions will increase. USA will provide additional equipment to Ukraine, and to strengthen our Baltic allies. This is a defensive motive - we will defend every inch of NATO territory.**

I hope I'm wrong that Russia will invade Ukraine, including Kyiv. Russia has Ukraine surrounded, form the North to Kyiv. Russia has amphibious ships in the Black sea and blood banks at the borders.

**You don't need blood unless you're planning a war.**

Last week, you have seen the Russian playbook Blinken laid out played out - you've seen the Russian Security Council meeting, and the recognition of the Independence. And now Russian Parliament has voted to send Russian military to Ukraine. This sets the stage for further pretext.

None of us should be fooled. If Russia proceed, it's Russia and Russia alone that bears responsibility.

We stand ready to protect American businesses and consumers. We are making sure that the price of our sanctions is paid by Russian economy, not ours. I wanna limit the pain of the American people at the gas pump - that's important to me.

I met with the German chancellor, Harris met with Zelensky last week. We stand united with our allies against the Russian threat that Russia is making

**Last night, the entire world heard clearly Putin's vision - nothing in his remarks indicates that he's willing to negotiate. He threatened countries that are now thriving democracies and NATO members.**

The US and its allies remain open to diplomacy if it's made as an honest effort.",1645596359.0,1645558648.0,t3_syv6z0,t3_syv6z0,,0,223,0,223,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

>Putin is no mere opportunistic predator. He may not always have a clear plan and acts expediently at times, but he knows what kind of world he wants and, even more so, what kind he does not. He seeks a world without NATO, with the U.S. confined to the Western Hemisphere, with Russia dominant over the former Soviet Union and able to do what it likes to its own people without condemnation or oversight, and with the Kremlin enjoying a literal veto at the UN Security Council over actions that any other state wishes to take beyond its borders. He has been working towards such a world since the moment he took office. His most recent statements suggest that he thinks he is getting closer.

EDIT: My point was that a diplomatic solution seems like a fantasy at this point and that Russia seems to just be waiting to put the finishing touches on their forward deployments. To use a WWII analogy since that seems to be popular these days it reminds me a bit of Stalin refusing to organize Soviet troops into defensive positions out of fear that it would antagonize Germany. Since Germany was set on invading anyways, it only meant that the Russians weren't able to properly organize a defense until about Moscow. Now thankfully for the Soviets they had hundreds of kilometers and millions of troops. Ukraine doesn't have those advantages.

 If they try to fire (back) on Russian positions (in a serious manner) in occupied portions of Donbass, Russia then moves in en masse immediately, likely surrounds and crushes the Ukrainian troops there, and more broadly assaults, bombs, and invades the entire country. In other words, you get a full, quick, and swift Russian invasion attempt of the entire country in this scenario.

On the other hand, if Ukraine doesn't fire/fight back in a serious manner, then Russia slowly takes the occupied regions, and then likely we'll see some form Russia trying to incrementally encroach on the rest of Donbass controlled currently by Ukraine, again relatively slower than the first scenario. Long term, possibly Russia keeps chipping away.

“You’re going to be looking for a mass influx of IL-76s to a few select locations. So far I haven’t heard much about VDV amassing at airfields yet, but I’d expect to see it occur around the time the aerial campaign begins.”

As reported a few hours ago:

“Sentinel-2 imagery taken this morning 08:36 UTC shows at least nine Ilyushin Il-76 military cargo aircraft departing🇷🇺Taganrog-Central Air Base near Taganrog in Russia, located on the shores of the Sea of Azov, 40 km from 🇺🇦Ukraine (DPR).

https://mobile.twitter.com/Gerjon_/status/1496208784171151360

They’re most likely flying to one of the primary airfields for an airborne operation. Ivanovo, Tula, Engels (seen them use this one before but it’s less likely) would be my main guesses. Would expect some IL-76s from across central and eastern Russia to be heading over to the west now too.

When Russia announced the withdrawal of troops last week, I wrote they would likely shift some Crimean units near the Donbas four days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/warinukraine/comments/suyhvq/buildup_near_donbas/):

“All this talk of genocide in Ukraine, mass graves, recognising DPR/LPR and yet, hardly anything is deployed in the vicinity during this buildup. What gives?

My guess: Crimean units may swing over that way and reinforce that buildup while Russia says they’re de-escalating/pulling troops out.“

This has been confirmed.

This won’t be the main front but those BM-30s are monsters. 

I also wrote that the LSTs may go home and it was possibly just a feint so russia could score a PR win on “duping” the west again. I no longer believe that to be the case. They’re going to use them, and the naval assets in the Black Sea are prepped for a massive naval fires operation.

We’ll likely see the LSTs move on Odessa and Mariupol concurrently in tandem with the overland push from Crimea following the massive naval fires, after air superiority has been achieved.

I could be wrong, but that’s the posture Russia is currently projecting. 

The Donbas buildup though is still the smallest by far, which should give everyone cause for concern who thought we were seeing *the* Russian invasion. The others in Belarus, Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk and Crimea are all 3-4x larger. 

Note: most of my posts are informed by the distribution of Russian mil forces. State rhetoric, media narratives, etc. I don’t really account for here. It doesn’t matter.

If he waits, most likely Ukraine will only get stronger through continued support financially and weaponry from the west.

What could have a much greater effect on Russia--eventually--is if the market for Russia's oil and natural gas started to go way down.  So if the USA can up their LNG production and significantly increase their shipping capacity to Europe (or else sourcing the natural gas from elsewhere on the continent).  Also helping Europe to rapidly retrofit away from using oil/natural gas for heating and power, which both helps the planet and hurts Putin.  Once you can get Europe mostly free of energy dependence from Russia they won't put up with as much BS from them.

Which also makes no sense to me. One, for the reason you stated, Putin is going to invade no matter what and he does not care about sanctions.

Secondly, China committed their full support to buffer the repercussions from any sanctions that are imposed. The sanctions are not going to hit as hard with Chinese support.

Third, he has illegally put 75% of his military on Ukrainian territory, he has not done this so he can only occupy what he has already been occupying for the last 4 years. He intends to go for the jugular and attempt to annex all of Ukraine.

If the ""severe sanctions"" are being saved for a ""full invasion"", what does that mean if he is going to be taking bits at a time? Where is the line actually drawn? And if we think the ""severe sanctions"" will do the trick, won't it be too little too late? Especially with  all the time Russia has to work with China to buffer the repercussions since they are being delivered incrementally?

Lastly, Putin has already been taking these last years to prepare his economy for the sanctions as much as he can. Let's be real, Putin has known his game plan for years now and has not prepared his invasion on the basis of light repercussions (even though it would be a gift if he did, and now we see he has). Putin has prepared in the event that all of the sanctions possible would be implemented once he has fully invaded.

This all leads me to believe the U.S., having already announced they will not put boots on the ground to fight against Russia, already decided to sacrifice all of Ukraine with the hopes Putin doesn't have the balls to go further and cross NATO boundaries or make an attempt on Non-NATO countries.

Putin's best case scenario out of all the things he prepared for is being played out before him. He is happy as hell and that's why the asshole even had fireworks going off in fucking Donetsk after his speech yesterday.

It seems like NATO will stand by militarily and allow LNR/DNR to be taken with only economic penalties and with whatever resistance Ukraine itself provides militarily. However I strongly suspect any further suspected action against Ukraine would be met with admitting Ukraine to NATO and moving troops into Ukraine proper to defend it.

Also how the hell does Russia still have a seat at the UN. Expel them. They clearly do what they want anyways, they don't deserve a place, especially if they break international law without regard.

Thirdly, this should not be an American problem. At least not yet. It is definitely a major concern though. One thing that Trump was right about was NATO allies needing to pay it's fair share. They need to put up or shut up. UK is pulling their weight. Germany waffled until the invasion started due to energy dependence (really glad you abandoned those nuclear plants aren't ya?). France has done useless dialog. All these NATO countries need to be ready for war.

This reeks of Hitler 2.0. He won't stop with Ukraine. He will want everything up to Germany to reunite the USSR at its height in power. Baltic states will come after Ukraine. Sanctions are just too weak of a response. Something stronger must be done.

If you put aside the equipment and salaries, (which, perhaps you may reasonably do because they've already been budgeted for... the guns are made, the tanks are already built) it is probably not terribly costly from an operations perspective. The movement of equipment and troops isn't terribly costly across these short distances.

Assuming they're not increasing the size of their standing army or manufacturing a ton of new equipment to support the effort, it would take a pittance to maintain this course action, from an operational perspective. Keep in mind, Russia's standing army is over a million troops, with another two million in reserve. This invasion force is under 200,000.

To put that into further perspective, the soviet-afghan war lasted many years, deployed over 600,000 troops and cost about 18B Rubles (not sure if that's adjusted value or not) -- 3B of which were costs that would have occurred in peace time irrespective of the war effort. So, considering this force is less than 1/3 the size, is significantly closer to home, and has far less opposition, it probably will cost significantly less than that, even if it keeps up for many years.

The real costs must be imposed by outside actors. Sanctions will cost Russia countless billions as long as they keep this up... if the EU and others stand firm against Russia, like they say they will.",1645565820.0,1645565380.0,t3_syv6z0,t1_hy0kcue,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Debt trading is weird and a PITA to explain, but basically debt trading involves buying/selling a loan with interest (i.e. a bond).  The idea is that, when one buys debt, one will eventually be able to recover one's money *plus interest* (usually greater than a liberal estimate of inflation rate, thus making it a high-likelihood way to profit off of non-liquid capital).  They are typically regarded as a comparatively stable form of investment.

For Russia, being able to sell their debt as bonds helps them get short-term funding for whatever--in this case, probably buying imports to keep living conditions at home good (placate masses), bail out corporations going under due to market crash (placate oligarchs), and to fund more military stuff.

Basically, by putting sanctions on debt trading, the US and allies are making it harder for Russia to acquire funds to maintain their war effort *and* at-home stimulus that would be used to keep the population from revolting.

An interesting thing about debt trading is that, in theory, a large economy can sell *massive* amounts of debt, and keep increasing the net debt as long as they are able to pay back soon-to-expire bonds.

A letter of credit is a notice from a buyer's bank for a seller's bank that the buyer's money exists and will be payed when the goods are confirmed to be shipped.

SWIFT is the same thing except for bank to bank transfers, without membership in SWIFT, it can be hard for large sums of money to be moved into or out of a country safely.

First off, the sanctions have to still leave room for improvement; room for even more draconian sanctions to be able to keep up with potential further actions of russian aggression. If they continue to be aggressors, more severe sanctions will be added - if they stop their efforts, potentially some sanctions will be lifted. Thats how this works.

So with that in mind, the package that Biden hinted at, would be quite a serious and impactful package of sanctions to start. 

In my opinion, most people who say that its nothing just wanted the most draconian santions possible right out of the gate - if that doesnt work its right to war. I dont know where this expectation and borderline hoping for war comes from, but it is something i have observed around here over the last few weeks and months, thats for sure.

I think what makes him a decent wartime leader is that he's willing to listen carefully to his advisors--he doesn't, based on his actions, think *he personally* has it all figured out or that he's the smartest man in the room.

I don't even think he is really trying to make that claim any more? The show where he talked to his advisors about recognizing separatists and chuckled about how Ukraine should be made Russian, made it pretty clear. And then his rambling speech about how Ukraine should not exist.

Putin wants Ukraine. Plain and simple.

Russia has also had two long term goals. Access to warm water ports and protections form invasion.

For the warm water ports, Russia has desired control over the Black and Baltic Seas.  This is why Russia has invaded both Regions on multiple occupations. Asia is mostly landlocked, and Russia actually has a warm water port on the pacific, but this port is far from its major population centers.

For the protection from invasion, Russia has that covered from 4 sides. The vast tracks of empty land in Asia protect the core of Russia from the south and East. The Arctic protects Russia from the north. 

The west is a different story. The western boarder of Russia is flat, and open. If Russia is invaded it will come from the west.

This is why Russia has consistently muscled and bulled the Europe. The nation has a fear of being invaded, and the European boarder is its most valuable.

* The new approach to public diplomacy during the lead-up.  Namely, the transparency with which the US shared certain intel to other countries and to the press, in an attempt to get as much about Putin's plan out into the public sphere and halt/throw a wrench into/thwart/otherwise delay Putin's plans.  To my understanding, this was a fairly novel approach to diplomacy during times like this, which is nice because I assumed we were just going to stick to the same, tired, Cold War playbook.

* Secondly, I wondered what a non-military response could look like other than the same sanctions game we've been playing with Russia in recent times.  Today, we're starting to see the answer: cut Russia off from modern technology.  The Administration has been reportedly working with Taiwan, Japan, and other countries to arrange trade sanctions on tech, microchips, etc.  This may not deter Russia, but is a nice step that goes farther than just asset freezes/general banking sanctions.",False,1645557617.0,t3_syv6z0,t1_hy00yny,,1,-21,0,-21,0,0,

I dont understand either. The resounding answer I keep reading is ""if we put on the most severe sanctions now, then Putin will have nothing to negotiate on and he will figure this is the worst it can get and so go full on invade"".

Which also makes no sense to me. One, for the reason you stated, Putin is going to invade no matter what and he does not care about sanctions.

Secondly, China committed their full support to buffer the repercussions from any sanctions that are imposed. The sanctions are not going to hit as hard with Chinese support.

Third, he has illegally put 75% of his military on Ukrainian territory, he has not done this so he can only occupy what he has already been occupying for the last 4 years. He intends to go for the jugular and attempt to annex all of Ukraine.

If the ""severe sanctions"" are being saved for a ""full invasion"", what does that mean if he is going to be taking bits at a time? Where is the line actually drawn? And if we think the ""severe sanctions"" will do the trick, won't it be too little too late? Especially with  all the time Russia has to work with China to buffer the repercussions since they are being delivered incrementally?

Lastly, Putin has already been taking these last years to prepare his economy for the sanctions as much as he can. Let's be real, Putin has known his game plan for years now and has not prepared his invasion on the basis of light repercussions (even though it would be a gift if he did, and now we see he has). Putin has prepared in the event that all of the sanctions possible would be implemented once he has fully invaded.

This all leads me to believe the U.S., having already announced they will not put boots on the ground to fight against Russia, already decided to sacrifice all of Ukraine with the hopes Putin doesn't have the balls to go further and cross NATO boundaries or make an attempt on Non-NATO countries.

Putin's best case scenario out of all the things he prepared for is being played out before him. He is happy as hell and that's why the asshole even had fireworks going off in fucking Donetsk after his speech yesterday.

But as he gets blow back from this tranche of sanctions he may stop to reassess.  Keep in mind his biggest fear is being overthrown.  No poor Russians couldn't.  But all of Russia (including the oligarchs who we are mostly targeting) could.  Also keep in mind Biden has been planning this since around October when Putin started the buildup.

Correction - after terrorizing the citizens of eastern Ukraine for close to a decade, illegal conscription of Ukrainian citizens, torture, kidnappings, etc most people have completely left the region. Russia then goes in and conducts a bullshit poll and stupid stupid people like you use that as justification. Do you believe Russians vote for Putin every election too? Lmfao. 

>Yes, the enlargement of the republic beyond areas they already control is a concern

Maybe because they've been doing this since 2014?

>but this enlargement still adds a population that voted against the current ukraine president.

TIL a valid strategy is to invade a country torture and kidnap its citizens trying to force anyone who doesn't support you to leave. Then you can use all the polls to go ""look this region should totally be ours!"" 


>I don't think Putin would actually invade areas of Ukraine that don't have a Russian-supported uprising for an independent state. 

You're just trolling at this point right? Every single region that has been invaded has had this happen exactly. Russia invades, installs ""rebels"" which are Russian soldiers, then invades the rebels to take the land. This exact same thing happened in Georgia. He's not even changing the playbook up and youre buying it. 

>I think the precedent of sending troops across areas of actual peace weighs heavily on Putin's mind

So you're just trolling lol

This is because you often times want to ramp up spending on your military and it’s a fast way to get cash immediately.  This means that no western country will purchase that debt from Russia anymore. If the US had this happen, it would mean UK citizens and government (or any western country) could not purchase Treasury bonds. Additionally, many countries rely on this type of funding for day-to-day functioning of the country as well. It’s how the country can operate “at a deficit”. Those big billboards that count how much debt the US is in, that number would stop going up as much. If Russia does not have significant cash reserves or other countries ready to help finance, this could create a massive economic crisis for them.

Idk how much other countries buy Russian debt but if it’s anything like the US, we’re talking 100s of billions of dollars here

EDIT: as mentioned in another comment, the main impact of this will probably be substantial inflation of the Russian Ruble, due to the rest of the world decreasing its demand for the currency (when you buy Russian debt, you “buy” the currency).

Because that is not how Russia has felt at all, so it feels like the standard American citizen along with all the presidential administrations over the past 30 years have let their guard down when it comes to Russia. When Crimea happened, I believe the USA did input sanctions. The reality is the Russia has nukes too, so we must be VERY careful with politics in that region. Not to mention making sure sanctions do not interfere in the normal lives of most people outside of those countries.

 >I can usually spot the logic errors and similar. 

""**The** logic errors"" is improper usage.  You can just say ""I can usually spot logic errors"".  It's even better if you make it slightly more familiar or less formal and rigid.  For example saying ""I can usually spot things like logic errors"".  This takes away some of the rigidity in your sentence.  

You also ended with ""and similar"".  Now it's clearly understood that you mean ""and similar errors"" but it's odd to have a sentence end in an adjective with no supporting noun.  If you said ""I can usually spot logic errors and similar errors"" that would also be off because you are now repeating the same noun within a few words.  

Most of this is inborn in native English speaking people like Americans and is difficult to teach because there are so many exceptions to the ""rules"" of English.  Your best bet would be to spend time with people that are native speakers and try to imitate their speech or take a class from someone that grew up speaking it natively.

But at the same time...my god. I've tended to be more of the opinion that Trump and Co. like Putin because they know Putin is willing to help them at a distance via disinformation and simply for the reason that wanna-be dictators like Trump tend to fawn over actual dictators. In other words, I generally tend to doubt that Russia has solid proper blackmail to leverage on them.

But to see **ALL** of these goons, on cue, at the exact same time come out to fawn over this invasion...it really makes me wonder.

> PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn’t be there and a man that has no concept of what he’s doing. I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, “This is genius.” Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.

> So Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.

> By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.

I agree. I just think they are underestimating Putin's ego and want for power. He does not care about how the sanctions will hurt his people, even the oligarchs with whom I'm sure he has already discussed and placated them promising them something.

I think Putin is going to go for all of Ukraine because it will be difficult to have half or even a quarter of the country to be under a democracy and the other half under authoritarian rule, he'd be building a political threat right next to his territory.

He'll still do it, of course, but let's not make it easier for him.

China has never committed to offset the sanctions and they have no reason to. China is not a Russia ally, they don't have anything to gain from this invasion. You could argue 'weakening the West' is on their agenda, but the way it unfolded it only strengthened it.

So far, 75% of his active combat forces aren't on Ukrainian territory, just at its borders. Isn't it much easier to commit to hardcore sanctions once they cross it? There will be way less dissent and complaints/conspiracies, don't you think? The more unanimously people and partners are behind the sanctions, the better. Let's make it easy to get behind them. 

The sanctions aren't for Putin but to raise discomfort among Russia's elite and economic leaders.

Not everyone can change the world but everyone can do their part. 

If we talk about politicians I wouldn't be so understanding.  They had the power and let greed rule them. But to lump an entire generation together is not right. It's no different than saying all kids these days don't work as hard as our generation used to. It's untrue and is going to only serve to anger people possibly into fulfilling that prophecy.

>The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man   
falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.... The question   
in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances   
and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that   
they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to  
 prevent.

\-Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, 1919

That argument against free speech was shot down in 1969, in the Supreme Court Case *Brandenburg v. Ohio.* Unfortunately for history, and for the cause of free speech, Brandenburg was a member of the KKK. 

This association has been used in recent cases regarding free speech to further reduce the right to free speech, such as any protest the government deems illegal is simply labeled as right or left wing 'radicals'. This practice, deployed regularly by the media and democratic governments, is known as ""brigading free speech with action"", a phrase coined by Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in the 1969 ruling. 

Just thought you should know that your reasoning has been deemed illegitimate by the highest authority of law in the land.

I keep reading this reasoning and though understandable, the purpose is insufficient in justifying a delay imo. Especially when the Ukrainian president almost literally said ""what the fuck y'all waiting for?""

I think people get too wrapped up in perceptions and believe it matters to the outside world when it doesn't anymore because the narratives have already been set for a very long time. There are still people who believe Biden ""wants this war"" and that America ""can't stay out of conflict"", when indeed the opposite is happening and regarding a conflict that would be absolutely justified for the U.S./NATO to intervene. unlike almost all the others in the last 4 decades.

I understand the sentiment, but I am not convinced that conflict decisions should be made with ""perception"" as the first priority. If at all imo, but that's because I believe in transparency and honesty which if foreign and lost to your people is difficult to implement and be taken as truth.

>China has never committed to offset the sanctions and they have no reason to.

>He can eliminate a good chunk of US/NATO forces with minimal casualties and infrastructure damage with a nuclear torpedo. I do not believe we will start lobbing nukes at ground forces over the destruction of carrier groups. 

The point is not to take out NATO forces.  You need a lot more than one nuke to make any significant difference.  NATO has airbases all over Europe.  The point is to force NATO to back down or risk nuclear war.

It's because they're paranoid about US missile defense.

Where is your evidence of this? Like he knew some of the people working for him didn't want him as president, but he was the first president not allowed to pick his own staff and department heads as well democrats waged massive legal wars against every position he tried to put his own person in. The only other time I could think that happened was civil war era dems. Not liking him does not mean he knew they would commit the treason to the usa they would eventually admit to.

How could he have know they committed treason until it was revealed they did. Which he took swift action after it was. It was revealed in early November 2020. And in that time he still managed to negotiate a ceasefire with the taliban and plan an entire withdrawl plan of all civies, equipment, and then soilders.... Biden threw it the trash and broke the terms of the cease fire

So you admit it's not his fault. Like again if he believed everything was going on long with his normal planned withdrawal how was he meant to verify otherwise.

If you are not going to read news stories that explain this shit why should I answer stupid questions.

 Because literally anyone who knows everything about war or the history of war knows that you withdraw troops from an occupied territory slowly. To do it all at once causes a far arger problem.
