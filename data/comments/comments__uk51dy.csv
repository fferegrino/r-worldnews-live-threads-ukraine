Day 73 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Just as I was wondering if Tsyrkuny was liberated, today we got official confirmation that it was indeed liberated. With this there are basically no more Russian troops in the immediate vicinity of Kharkiv, and they are being pushed even further back fast.

It feels pretty great not being constantly shelled, it’s very refreshing. I don’t think we heard incoming shelling even once today around my area, though the sound of our own artillery still often makes us jump as it catches us by surprise. Pretty sure Saltivka was shelled once today as well as some nearby settlements, but that’s about it.

Yesterday Russians also destroyed another “military target” – a museum of literature, a very high priority target indeed. What is even the point in doing this? Was that museum yet another Azov HQ? Maybe it had black magic books in it? Or maybe they are just mad that they are getting pushed back from Kharkiv and by destroying history they are trying to get back at us.

And as always I’m very grateful for everyone’s support, it means a great deal to us.",False,1651968299.0,t3_uk51dy,t3_uk51dy,,0,181,0,181,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

“I was elected by the people of Ukraine as president of Ukraine, not as president of a mini Ukraine of some kind. This is a very important point,” he said, according to the BBC report.

**Russia’s offensive in Donbas bogs down**

(...)

*Prior to the beginning of the Donbas offensive in early April, Russia, according to estimates, concentrated a total of somewhere between 76 and 87 battalion tactical grounds (BTGs) in Ukraine – a total of around 70,000-80,000 troops.*   
  
*According to the U.S. Department of Defense, over 22 BTGs were positioned in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, likely to be replenished and remain in reserve.*   
  
*These units essentially constituted the entire combat-capable force and reserve that Russia could dedicate to the campaign.*   
  
*The failed blitzkrieg that followed, upon estimates by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense, rendered nearly a quarter of Russia’s 120-125 BTGs incapable of any major operations.*   
  
*What stood against Russia’s offensive, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a Ukrainian force of nearly 44,000 troops concentrated in heavily fortified, urban areas in central Donbas – the cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk, and the northern parts of Russian-occupied Donetsk.*

>*Kharkiv OD. Ukraine’s limited counteroffensive of 02-05 May north & NE of Kharkiv threatens to push Russian forces back across the border into Belgorod. Russian forces in the Kharkiv OD are to spread out and weak to reverse recent Ukrainian gains.*

>*Russia cannot afford another major defeat and will likely have to repurpose reinforcements designated to the Main Effort along the Siverskyi Donets Line between Izium & Popasna or pull units from that direction to stabilize defensives in the Kharkiv OD.*

>*Severodonetsk-Donetsk OD. Russian forces continue to struggle to achieve a general breakthrough along the Siverskyi Donets Line between Izium and Popasna. Along the Izium Axis Russian forces are stalled, unable to gain ground against Ukrainian hasty defensive positions.*

>Maybe a better way to put the Ukrainian claims of Russian losses in context. During the first 12 days of the Battle of Kursk, when German losses were running at their highest, estimated Germans tank losses were between 25-350 (I have the citation in How the War was Won, p 310.

>IOT, if Ukrainian claims of Russian tank losses are correct, they are at a rate comparable to what the Germans were losing during the Battle of Kursk. One major difference, the Germans lost many old and obsolete tanks at Kursk, lots of Panzer Mark IIIs. See below. 

>However as the Germans were making many more newer, better models, these losses were not crippling. The Russians are losing their front-line armor in Ukraine, and have little ability to make up the losses quickly, and will have to use older, less well maintained AFV.

>In summation, Russian losses (if verified) are numerically similar to the German losses in the Battle of Kursk, but qualitatively much worse and difficult to replace.

Radio Free Europe posted a video showcasing some street interviews with ordinary Russians concerning the war. I thought asking them this question was rather clever since it gave many of these people an opportunity to subtly voice their opposition to the war without actually saying so directly. Some of them even call it a war or refer to it as a special operation with sarcasm so heavy that it crosses the language barrier. They spoke to a reasonably diverse set of people. There were also a few who voiced strong support and others who seemed apathetic. 

The young woman at the end said something that seemed rather poignant to me.

>The Ukrainians have systematically destroyed Russians assets on the Island and have also successfully destroyed reinforcements.

>Most interestingly are todays Russian losses: a Serna-class landing craft and SA-15 Gauntlet air defense system. The Gauntlet was either a reinforcement or replacement for the sustained losses. 

>Satellite imagery confirms the Serna and Gauntlet were lost between May 6ht and 7th.

>Also notice how many buildings and structures on the island have been severely damaged or completely destroyed between those dates. 

>The Ukrainians denied Russian reinforcements, and likely destroyed whatever remained in the process. 

>This partially due to the absence of Moskva, in my opinion. 

>I explained this below, but I seriously believe Ukraine can and will push the Russians out, and recapture the area.

The hit caused water to gush in and warhead triggered a cook off of Ak-630 gun ammo.

Captain likely thought the ship will be gone in few mins but it survived and Russians realizing the mistake decide to tow it and it finally sank after almost a day. What a shame some of the crew could have been saved but likely perished because of cowardice. I suspect atleast 300-400 crew to be dead.

**Kremlin insider says Gerasimov is out at operational command. Remains a figure head. Putin will tell him Saturday.**

*Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting via videoconference, which was attended by Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev, Director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov, Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and four other people. It should be noted separately that representatives of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces did not take part in the meeting.*

*During the meeting, they discussed the problems of conducting a military operation in Ukraine and the prospects for the development of events. Discussing the actions of the General Staff of the Russian Federation, Putin spoke in the sense that he had decided on May 8 to remove Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, from the leadership of the military company.*

*Gerasimov will continue to nominally be the chief of the General Staff, but he will not make decisions and influence the course of the military operation. Gerasimov will continue to represent the General Staff at briefings, collegiums, meetings and official events, but as a talking head, by analogy with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who now retains the post of defense minister, but does not make or influence key decisions.*

Apparently [the guy]( https://twitter.com/Bundesheerbauer/status/1496901235613523968) has a lengthy military resume and works (worked?) in the Ministry of Foreign Defense in Austria. [He thinks Russia still has a serious chance of winning the war….](https://www.blick.ch/ausland/top-stratege-warnt-davor-die-russische-armee-zu-unterschaetzen-die-bittere-wahrheit-ist-putin-kann-den-krieg-gewinnen-id17459588.html)

Excerpts from article, translated from German: 

> Russia is probably much stronger than one believes in this country. At least the Austrian colonel and top military strategist Markus Reisner is convinced of this: ""We need an objective picture of the situation. It doesn't help us if we gloss over that the Russian attackers are in poor condition,"" he explains in the world. ""Because that hides how the situation really is."" 

[…]

>Ukraine urgently needs new weapons. The arms deliveries from the West are now a race against time,"" Reisner believes. Because the Western deliveries of heavy weapons would have started too late. And in addition, Russia would capture or destroy a ""not insignificant part"" of the arms deliveries.

[…] 

>In the meantime, the Kremlin has even published manuals that state how to operate the captured weapons and use them against Ukraine. ""And that has already happened,"" says the military expert. According to US data, the weapons that the West brings to Ukraine within a week are consumed within one day, i.e. immediately used by the Ukrainians or captured or destroyed by the Russians.

> According to Reisner, Russia now wants to form two pliers in Donbass at the height of Isyum and Donetsk to encircle the Ukrainian troops. ""The problem is that the positions of the Ukrainians in this area are not as strong as on the old contact line, i.e. in the east of Kramatorsk,"" fears the Austrian.

>In the past, Ukraine also succeeded in ambushed Russian soldiers with special forces. But this tactic probably won't work anymore. Reisner: ""This had worked elsewhere in the first six weeks, but now the Russians are prepared, and the Russian special forces (Spetsnaz) hunt the Ukrainian special forces and unfortunately destroy them quite often.""

>According to Markus Reisner, one should not be fooled by the slow progress of the Russians. The Russians are now advancing ""slowly, wide and with massive infantry support, whereby the tanks on the right and left are secured by further armored trains."" 

[…]

>Finally, Markus Reisner draws a gloomy conclusion on the situation in Ukraine: ""The bitter truth is: Putin can win the war."" The Austrian concretizes: ""Winning means that Putin has substantially more of Ukraine after this armfire than before.""

Because it's so close to the border, there will always be a strip of land there UA can't repopulate; all they can do is force Russian withdrawals and evacuate the towns to safety.  Bridges to Luhansk in the west have been blown, so it's not a path they can advance with, more of a dead-end.  Nor does it free up that much equipment or manpower.  The significant things will be tanks/apcs.  The artillery has to remain, a defensive force has to remain, and of the batallions they have in the area, most (at least four) are militia and will want to remain and help de-mine and rebuild and go back to their civilian infrastructural jobs where applicable.  The 2-3 units of professional soldiers in the area will need to reconstitute themselves and in a few weeks can rejoin the fight in the east or south.  It took Kyiv forces several weeks to relocate, and most of those were militia and stayed in the region, of course.  Militia are a local/oblast-level phenomenon in the Ukrainian military.  They only move around if they enter the army proper.  

So, once all Russian forces have left Kharkiv oblast, the net gains for UA are:  

- respite for Kharkiv city
- free up some tanks and transports
- easier to conduct raids on Belgorad targets (perhaps) 
- eventually between 1 and 3 batallions can rest and redeploy

Estimates are at 25,000 dead Russian invaders so far for this months’ long campaign; but the bigger picture is the number of Russian civilian causalities may be far greater if there is a counter-response, which has not yet transpired, at least in earnest. 

The Putin regime’s offensive nuclear warfare posture, for example, which is currently poised for escalation, almost guarantees a devastating neutralization of their capacity to wage war if sanity at high levels of Russian leadership is not somehow restored. So domestic support in Russia for these expansionary policies is tantamount to digging their own graves. 

You can’t just ignore a neighboring country’s territorial integrity, invade and kill them, displacing 10 million refugees innocent souls trapped with no place to go, razing their beloved cities to ashes, and then say “stop resisting or I’ll use nukes.” 

History will prove, this is not leadership; it’s basically just a death wish, which I doubt most Russians deserve or fully understand.

I pray for the good Russian people.

It isn't that Russia thinks it needs more land, it's that it knows it has negative population growth, its cut-throat economy disparity is a bubble waiting to burst and is beginning to resemble feudalism, Ukraine was now securing elections for parties Russia never sanctioned and was moving closer to the EU and NATO.  Putin's ego and exposure to nationalist neo-fascist philosophy, possibly exacerbated by his age and health, led him and others in his government to conclude annexing Ukraine would solve some of these problems.  And of course he thought it would be completed as easily as Czechoslovakia.  

Russia doesn't have millions of people they want to settle there.  If anything the evidence suggests they wanted the Ukrainian population to relocate where needed throughout Russia to bolster its own dwindling workforce.   Ukraine's exports would also be distributed, as they are being now, domestically, especially foodstuffs.  

Basically this isn't like a Lebensraum doctrine.  It's an empire of convenience and more like the sort of plundering expeditions Rome used to sustain itself.

Once you've placed yourself on some ideological pedestal the way they have, their citizenry have a real hard time being confronted with the reality that they're really not that strong/great. 

This is all happening in real time and they're going to have to sincerely confront it one way or the other. By being pushed back and broken down militarily and economically, this is a surefire way to accomplish this, but is also the reason why we hear so many ""What if Russia gets desperate??"" scenarios.

Realistically if things continue the way they are there will have to be an established demilitarized zone or ""buffer"" area between Ukraine and Russia much like the North Korea/South Korea area (and Russia has probably already set up the mines!). Ukraine has repeatedly said they're not willing to concede any territory and Russia as is cannot hope to take anymore, and certainly not to hold nearly any.

In Russia, to be seen as weak is worse then death, and they will go down fighting rather then to concede a military failure. This doesn't make any sense to most of us in the West, because there is an inherent understanding of the value of life we all live by. Russia clearly does not. It's not about gaining more territory, although a case can be made for the resource rich areas in East Ukraine, and establishing a land bridge to the Black Sea for economic reasons, but as has been said a million times, this is all about the cultural/societal implications of Russia ""retaining"" it's past glory and former USSR territories in a bid to prove it is still ""great"" and a major power. Again, when you've drowned your population in the idea that they are from a historically powerful and significant empire, you kind of need to show them what that is, else the continued stagnation and chest thumping Russia is known for only gets you so far before they look to their West and see Ukraine becoming more democratic and their quality of life increasing, which Russia doesn't want it's own population to see and get any ideas.

I've made the argument before, but I really do believe Russia already views this war as existential, for the reasons mentioned above. They see the world moving away from them and are trying to claw their way back to relevance and standing, but are only making things worse. So they try to hide their crimes. They put out the ""it's fake news"" crap day in day out. They just want to be viewed as important to the global system as the US and Europe is, but the world is changing and there really isn't a place for old Russia in the new world, and as so many others have rightfully pointed out, had Russia not got all bloodthirsty crazy and invested in industry and their own people, they could've actually been a great contributor to the world. Problem is they got themselves hyped up on being strong and in their minds, have to go to any lengths to prove it, both to the world, and to themselves.

Asset freezing is for Russian agents. Expanding it to other people just because we don’t like them puts the whole asset freezing regime at risk. 

Murdoch is a lot of things but he is not a Russian agent - even Cohen concedes this. The Times and the Australian are not pro-Russian by any means. Even Fox News (outside one or two talking heads) is fairly anti-Russian invasion. 

What Murdoch is, is an opportunist - looking for media markets that are not serviced by others. IMO, Murdoch doesn’t lead opinion, he follows it - providing content that reinforces the prejudices of his audience. Is this morally dubious? Probably. Is it grounds for seizing his assets? Probably not. 

Most of his media empire is pretty pro-Ukrainian. Why? Because most of his audience is pro-Ukrainian so he meets their prejudice. There is a niche audience in the US for pro-Russian content, so he meets their prejudice too in the form of Tucker Carlson.  Again, is this morally right? Probably not. Should it be illegal? This is a big step to take.

Existential threat is a threat to the country and its governments existence.

Russia probably wants you to think its her pre-war borders, or at least worry about it.

**It isn't**

A common misconception is Ukraine taking back all of its former territory is ***unavoidably*** a threat to Putins existence or the existence of Russia...

Or how NATO providing equipment is..

They're not.

Any possible domestic discontent is easily managed by propaganda or security services.

The only threat to Putin is from a coup within his inner circle or upper levels of FSB and/or the military.

If he starts actually playing with Nukes or trying to, that merely increases the likelihood that a coup may happen. (I don't think it's likely to happen regardless).

Thus the whole thing is saber rattling and folks often get caught up in the 'middle ground fallacy'. I can't remember the actual name for this type of trap but that will do.

Basically it's when someone takes two of the arguments in this discussion that are at different ends and picked a point in the middle as the 'truth'.

Truth doesn't work like that.

'As always the truth lies somewhere in the middle' is one of the most pervasive and annoying hollywood tropes that's saturated into our society because while it is somewhat true, it leaves no room for nuance and most people just pick the middle point rather than considering one side may be 99-99.9% correct, which is as good as being right.",1651964324.0,1651959395.0,t3_uk51dy,t1_i7pvflw,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is exactly the type of belief over fact sort of thing that differentiates good analysts from poor ones.

What's happened is that a lot of analysts and thinkers were wrong about Russia's military strength and that's fine, it's a mistake in a preferable direction (better to overestimate rather than underestimate an opponent).

What some have done since (and what you see in that piece) is an attempt to fit the facts on the ground into that prior assumption of Russian power.

That is bad, really bad. When assessing things in a war, you want the facts to frame the prediction or analysis, not the analysis to frame the facts.

And at it's most basic, Russia is degrading in manpower and equipment at an alarming rate, whereas Ukraine is not. Russia is not gaining ground at a significant rate, which it needs to in order to achieve what it wants to before it degrades too far.

I'm not sure why this sort of mental gymnastics type thing happens so much these days (you see it all over the place), I personally like being wrong and discovering how and why so I can do better next time.

We downvoted, to the point of excluding, talk of Russian successes and Ukrainian failures. We take at face value numbers reported by Ukraine, and dismiss numbers provided by Russia off the cuff. 

That, combined with a coordinated UK/US/Ukrainian info warfare make it easy to fall into the line of thought that the Russian army is a joke, comprised of ill equipped and unmotivated amateurs, against which Ukraine is all but assured a victory. If the Russians move fast, they are fools for leaving their supply lines vulnerable (they were), and if they move slow and methodically they are weak and bogged down. If the Russians make gains, we downplay them. If they lose territory, we blow it out of proportion. 

I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of bias on an informal forum, but it shouldn't inform decisions. If you believe Ukraine is assured a win, you risk not supporting it properly anymore.

This is tricky. Russia directly funded and helped this ""civil war"" Igor Girkin put together a squad of troops to invade Ukraine, take Crimea and help put up the separatist states.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor\_Girkin#Involvement\_in\_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Girkin#Involvement_in_Ukraine)

>Girkin was one of the major ""Russian self-defence"" commanders in the 2014 Crimean crisis. In an interview on 22 January 2015, he explained that the ""overwhelming national support for the self-defence"" as portrayed by the Russian media was fiction, and a majority of the law enforcement, administration and army were opposed to it.\[41\]\[42\] Girkin stated that under his command, the rebels ""collected"" deputies into the chambers, and had to ""forcibly drive the deputies to vote \[to join Russia\]"".\[42\]\[43\]  
>  
>According to an accomplice, Girkin arrived in Crimea describing himself as the ""Kremlin's emissary,"" and soon after formed the Crimean self-defense forces. His position was above that of self-declared Crimea prime minister Sergei Aksyonov. His main task in March 2014 was the accelerated military training of the newly formed Crimean forces, and selecting the best among them for transfer to the invasion of the Donbas. Girkin personally negotiated and oversaw the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Crimea.\[45\]

So Russia pretty much funded, helped, directed and lead these separatists. So Russia had a soft invasion 2014 under the cover of a civil war only to mop it up later with a proper invasion. And yes, during the later stages of this ""civil war"" the main Russian regulars came over the border to help fight Ukraine which lead to things stalling out.",False,1651961205.0,t3_uk51dy,t1_i7pzwq5,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

They've got a shitload more on paper, but most of those probably haven't had their engines started up in a decade or more.

So it's quite likely they've brought more tanks in, but exactly how many they've brought in and how many remain is unknowable.

That said, the Pentagon released an estimate about a week ago stating that there was quite likely now ten modern anti-tank rockets in Ukrainian hands for every tank Russia had prepped at the start of the war.

 >A part of the ongoing war in the Donbas region of Ukraine, the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport began on 28 September 2014. An earlier battle in May 2014 had left Donetsk International Airport in Ukrainian control. Despite a ceasefire agreement, the Minsk Protocol, in place starting 5 September 2014, fighting broke out between Donetsk People's Republic forces affiliated with Russia, and Ukrainian military and volunteer forces. At the start of the battle, the airport lay between the separatist and Ukrainian lines of control, and was the last part of Donetsk city held by Ukrainian government forces.

Ukraine had offered neutrality before the war started but even that would not stop them. This conflict, I am convinced, is almost entirely personal. During Maidan and afterwards, Ukraine was a living example of how much freedom is worth fighting for. It was humiliating to Putin, and so now he aims to snuff it out.

Living free is so much better than life under Putin that it is worth dying a thousand times over and Putin hates that.

I've tried to watch Russian vloggers to get their perspective on it like no_fkrz, but even after he left to Tbilisi and could say whatever  he wanted all his videos kept being focused on the sanctions, companies leaving Russia, etc. and only in passing he'd mention Ukraine. Same with channels like Niki who's in St. Petersburg. They both seem more emotional about their money being worth less and McDonalds leaving than about Mariupol being wiped off the map.

And in the latest 1420 video interviewing Russians about conscription, they all said some variation of ""fuck that, I don't want to die for a stupid war"" but *no one* mentioned how they didn't want to *kill* for a stupid war. In the Vietnam protests in the US there was a big section of anti-draft protesters saying it was wrong to go to Vietnam to kill people. Drafted soldiers coming home and having ""Baby killer"" shouted at them happened a fair amount. But Russian's don't really seem to think that much about how they'd feel about killing Ukrainians. 

In short, the perspective I'm getting is that Russians really don't seem to give a fuck about anything that doesn't personally affect them.

You have a war going on, you're getting new Ukrainian recruits ready, and in all the business you get these foreigners coming up to you and wanting to help. Only, the difficulty is that half of them want to help but have no real combat experience, those who do, may not realize that their combat tour may not be representative of what they will experience in a war against russia. And among these troops, where you know half of them will be too scared to go on after the first combat encounter, some of them claim to be special forces, snipers, or who knows what. Most of them don't speak the language. And even so, they don't have all their own equipment yet, so you're supposed to give valuable body armor and riffles to these 'unknown' troops, while you're also trying to equip your own men.

So what you do, is you start slowly. You tell these troops to partially take care of themselves, and you start with low importance missions. Only once they prove themselves(and once they don't run away), will you slowly start integrating them and giving them more complicated missions.

Even then, knowing that these troops *can* turn tail at any moment, and can decide they've had enough, means that you must be careful not to integrate them too fully into your own units. 

Given all these tricky situations, you need to be dedicated as a foreigner to get things done. Some manage to do it, for example https://twitter.com/jmvasquez1974 has shown inventiveness and hard work in procuring his own transport and arms, and is now part of a team of foreigners that goes for special operations and is a huge help to ukraine.

But for some, like this Wali, the struggle is too much, or they're too shocked about the level of training of ukrainian troops, or whatever else can make it difficult to keep going in a war, and they come home.

Does that mean that the Ukrainian decision making was bad? Or was it perhaps the best they could make out of a complicated situation?

I'm not one to judge others, and especially someone who risked everything to go to a foreign country and fight a war, and hearing what he observed(two colleagues being torn apart by tank shells right in front of their eyes because they didn't stay in the trenches), i fully understand him bailing out.

But that does not mean that we need to take his perspective of how he was treated at face value. Remember that for every Wali we have probably 20+ less experienced foreign combatants who also need to be integrated, without things going badly.",False,1651922207.0,t3_uk51dy,t1_i7nwhmy,,2,31,0,31,0,0,

Syria is usually called Iran's ""closest ally"", with ideological conflict between the Arab nationalism ideology of Syria's secular ruling Ba'ath Party and the Islamic Republic of Iran's pan-Islamist policy notwithstanding. Iran and Syria have had a strategic alliance ever since the Iran–Iraq War, when Syria sided with non-Arab Iran against neighbouring Ba'ath-ruled Iraq. The two countries shared a common animosity towards then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and coordination against the United States and Israel.

>Syria cooperates with Iran in sending arms to Palestinian groups including Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have designated both Iran and Syria as State Sponsors of Terrorism in part due to support for Hezbollah.

Now on the front lines and forced to fight he comes across a squad of Russians preparing to execute a group of ukrainine civilians.

Unable to do anything himself he attracts the attention of a nearby ukrainine patrol; they of course fire at him and he leads them to the group where they and the 'Bad' Russians essentially wipe themselves out but save the civilians 

Tyoma comes out from hiding and takes a Pistol off a fallen Russian. It's not his pistol, but it should do 

He heads back to Russian lines while the battle rages in the city around him.

Walking through an open field with littered with destroyed Russian tanks a shot rings out.

A Russian sniper is looking through his scope at Tyomas fallen body and his partner asks ""Why did you shoot him?""

2. Terror bombings meant to demoralize the enemy (proven to not work every time it's used, but regardless that appears to be the rationale)
3. Putin's pissed bombings, usually to send a message or just throw a tantrum because Zelenskyy is having meetings with world leaders and ships becoming submarines.
4. Targeting infrastructure but missed.

After the first week and no instant win it seems Russia tried to use cruise missiles more for the purposes of terror.

A few of them could be said to be misses and they were actually aiming for strategic targets, because proximity and trajectory lead one to believe that.

Any use of Marx & Lenin as an analytical framework would show the modern war as another ""war of imperial aggression"", and since one side is clearly using the proletariat as cannon meat...yeah.

Meanwhile, the impression I've gotten is that pro-modern-Russia nonsense or slapping ""People's Republic"" on concentration camps infuriates actual pro-Soviet tankies just like it does you, whereas the 50 cent party cares about their job of sentiment control short term over all else.

I'd think the long term effect will probably be driving out organic support, oddly enough, just like they did with Russian-sympathetic Ukranians.  Then again there wasn't much to start with; in the past almost anyone I ever saw in the wild who was a tankie from gaming was ultra hard-line anti-Putin, many anti-China, and a lot of them *were Russian or Eastern European*.",False,1651976919.0,t3_uk51dy,t1_i7qp9ol,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

To explain it a bit better, when a jet fires a missile, you can still see the missile. The trail of the missile makes it easier to spot, but the actual missile is visible. Those missiles are not that much different in size from artillery and the missiles are usually traveling faster than the arty.

Fun fact: Sometimes you can even see rifle bullets in the early stage of their flight too.

It’s infinitely easier to see these things if you can see them leave the barrel as it gives an idea of where to look. But trying to see the rounds in flight when the barrels aren’t visible is next to impossible.

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1,000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. The handling of the crisis by Vladimir Putin, who was prime minister at the time, boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months. The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September.

Russia has already shipped that many to Russia many against their will during this conflict (including children taken from their parents).

The reason you are being called a troll is because you give ANY credence to anything Russia says.  Russia has been proven time and time again to do nothing but lie.

Nato expansion threat; utter bullshit.  Made up lies that people in the west have bought into after hearing it for years.  Nato has not once threatened Russia.  Russia has expansionist dreams.  It has for HUNDREDS of years.  If folks could acknowledge that then we would have a starting point.

Russia has fed generations bullshit and because of the fucked up shit the west has been involved with (and lord knows the west is FAR from perfect, but Russia and the USSR have virtually nothing to complain about honestly) it has snuck into the collective conscience as truth.  It is NOT true.  It is propagandic bullshit.  

Russia has NO (and I can't underline that enough.. abso-fucking-lutely no) reason to be in Ukraine.  If they felt there was a problem in the east they could have gone to the unsc during trumps time and had no veto concerns.  They didn't.  You know why?  Because their bullshit was made up.

Hey wikibot, what's [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)?  
  

>The numbers are so small as to mean nothing. 

This poster is saying to ""denounce *everyone* supporting this active genocide""

>To compare ""BoTH SIdeS"" is just trying to justify the right wing by pointing to exceptions. 

Maybe I misread, but they're not comparing both sides.  They even say ""(mostly far-right/far-left)"" which could potentially be taken as (mostly-far-right)/(far-left) if you squinted hard enough  
  
They're saying ""call pro-shit people shit"" and giving Tucker (right wing) as an example   
  

>That is a righ wing thing to do.
