Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 12 August 2022
 
- On 9 August 2022, explosions occurred at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea. The original cause of the blasts is unclear, but the large mushroom clouds visible in eyewitness video were almost certainly from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas.

- At least five Su-24 FENCER fighter-bombers and three Su-30 FLANKER H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts. Saky's central dispersal area has suffered serious damage, but the airfield probably remains serviceable.

- The loss of eight combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war. However, Saky was primarily used as a base for the aircraft of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet. The fleet's naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded. The incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception. Crimea has probably been seen as a secure rear-area.

Day 170 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling again, so it was mostly pretty quiet, other than the usual missile strike. With yesterday’s missile strike they destroyed yet another school, firing 2 missiles at it. Well, not completely, but they destroyed a cafeteria and a vegetables warehouse, both are very worthy military targets indeed, obviously they were housing weaponized vegetables, so Russia had no other choice, but to destroy them.

Today’s missile strike happened at 1:30am, and I’m pretty sure there were 4 missiles again, though some of the explosions sounded weirdly long again. I guess some of them might sound weird because they fire 2 of the missiles at the same spot and they hit at roughly the same time. We don’t know what was hit yet, but it was again very close to apartment buildings, people posted videos from there with most windows being blown out, but thankfully there were no casualties.

I really don’t get what is the point in Medvedev’s threats. All this does is make the situation worse for Russia, not for the ones he’s threatening. He’s not even doing veiled threats really, saying “accidents might happen on nuclear power plants in EU and USA” is not veiled at all, and if anything does actually happen everyone knows who is responsible. 

Though his threats are basically empty anyway, he already threatened “doomsday” to us if we ever attacked Crimea, and well, where is it? I guess that airbase just underwent a “special smoking operation” and self-destructed, there was *definitely* no Ukrainian involvement at all, so no doomsday for us I guess.

Also the Ukrainian general staff admits a ""partially successful"" Russian offensive from Horlivka towards Zaitseve, which makes sense as Ukrainian defensive positions there were not prepared for a Russian push from the East and possibly even North after Russia captured Hladosove

Some realistic read from Kyivindepent, the hopium all over western social media is honestly getting out of any reasonable scale, and I believe it harms Ukraine. 

For months there is this virtual reality in western social media where russian army is depicted constantly before colapse while Ukraine is about to start huge counter-offensive any minute, and anyone who points out how ridiculous and out of touch with the reality such picture is, is immediately called a russian troll. I believe this harms Ukraine in the long run, because people think Ukraine is doing well and there is no urgency and pressure to help them more. People are patting each others backs how much is west helping Ukraine, for a week celebrating that Germany is sending 3 gepards, France 6 ceasars, and Italy 9 jeeps, not realizing how utterly miniscule this help actualy is. The west is sending dozens, when at least hundreds, if not thousands, are needed to match Russian advantage.

The truth is that it's much easier to defend than to attack, and Ukraine is barely defending, constantly losing ground, although very slowly. If we take the generaly accepted rule that in order to perform succesful attack against defended positions, you need 3:1 advantage in combat power, then at this moment Russia is much closer to it than Ukraine. Lets say that consdering how slowly Russia is progressing, they have 2:1 combat power advantage. For Ukraine to succesfully counter attack, they need 6 times more combat power than what they have now to achieve 3:1 advantage! There is no way around it, unless the west significantly steps up their military support, any idea of succesful counter attack is simply social media delusion and whishful thinking.",False,1660349380.0,t3_wmbeaq,t3_wmbeaq,,0,-30,0,-30,0,0,

To me though it doesn't appear that we've seen anything close to a methodical counter-offensive since Kharkiv.  Things seems very quiet on the part of Ukraine outside of the claims to retake Kherson soon.  

Before anyone says well they have been in the Kherson direction and it hasn't gained much, I don't believe any of that is much more then localized pushes.

Instead, this is similar to the point of businesses like McDonalds withdrawing from Russia: bring home the reality to the ordinary Russian citizen that their government is engaged in discretionary hostilities that are abhorrent to civilized peoples. 

There is no clearer message to ordinary Russians that the world looks at them as lesser-beings than having to line up at an embassy somewhere to obtain a visa.  

It seems small, but do not underestimate the degree to which ordinary Russians will respond to being forced to acknowledge that they are less privileged than others, a lower class of citizen, because of Putin's war.

Asking Russia people if they're happy with the war is not fruitful, but the rate of mental health issues suggests there is a problem.

I've read reports where some pollsters in Russia would glean Kremlin support based on indirect questions rather than direct, e.g. instead of 'Do you support Putin doing A?', they would ask 'Would you support Putin if he did B instead?' (wherein B could be the opposite of A), and note that many more people approve the second than the first suggesting that many people may not approve of Putin doing A but simply refuses to openly say it.

The same thing lies in regards to how Russia is doing economically/politically. Russia, of course, says it's still doing great. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs recently released [a fantastic article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-new-vassal?utm_source=pocket_mylist) noting how Russia has lost an enormous amount of leverage when dealing with China which will get bigger if India drifts more towards the west (which it very well could if Moscow becomes too intertwined with China...which it looks like it's doing). This will erode Russia's economy and political autonomy.

I'm inclined to think that Russia's opaque method of dealing with reality in their economy hurts them too. Russian politicians are human too. If they get tricked into believing everything really isn't that bad, things might get worse before real action is taken.

""In March 2013, the Russian government approached Seagal, represented by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, to lobby the Russian arms industry. Seagal was to help facilitate previously prohibited exports of Russian arms to the U.S.

In early June 2013, Seagal led a delegation of US Republicans, led by Dana Rohrabacher, on a visit to the site of the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis. Seagal had offered to also accompany the delegates on a visit to President Ramzan Kadyrov in the province of Chechnya, but they declined due to various human rights abuses Kadyrov has been accused of. Seagal's visit to the site of the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis was not a success.

Despite the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and other Western countries in the wake of the Crimean crisis and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Seagal gave a concert in Sevastopol on 9 August 2014, along with a blues band. Previously, Seagal - whose grandparents are from Vladivostok and St. Petersburg, according to him - had agreed to lobby for Russian arms dealers. He met with Kadyrov in August 2016.

We don't know the actual status of the air defense in Kherson. We don't know the actual status of the Ukrainian airforce or their ability to perform sorties in Kherson. We don't know the morale, status, supplies of the Russians military in Kherson.

There are so many unknowns that it is absolutely impossible to draw the conclusion that the Russians are ""close to a total collapse"". It's just wishful thinking on your behalf. The Russians have moved thousands of troops to Kherson and it's likely one of their best manned positions right now. It would be a major setback and embarrassing defeat if they were to lose it, so they have every incentive to throw resources into its defense. 

We also know the Ukrainians have been very cautious with their offensive, likely because they cannot fully execute the combined arms maneuvers necessary for quick offensives due to lack of training, experience and equipment.

There is no efficient railway line going west along the Sea of Azov.

A efficient railway line has two lanes and a useful connection somewhere. There is no such thing.

The northern route could be served by Donetsk, but it is full and regularly the target of attacks.

The railway network in Ukraine can be used by goods trains travelling at 60 km/h.  The non-existent railway line from the Russian border east of Mariupol to Kherson would be a 10-hour journey. The diversions via the north is easily 20 hours. Plenty of time to react and also easy to plan. The Ukrainians know every switch, every signal, every slow speed point and everything is within reach of the 155mm. That's all you need to stop a train with the usual 40 wagons.

The railway connections to Crimea Melitpopol and on to Saparoshie have been attacked several times, including the junction to Kherson. Tokmak is a key junction.

Nothing will come if it can no longer get across the Crimean island.

Road transport can be forgotten altogether. No cars, no drivers, no usable fuel supply and plenty of partisans with good German mines.

There is a vast body of debate about the safety of nuclear power.  Proponents of nuclear power will point out that reactors have a ""SCRAM button"" which can shut down a plant safely and quickly.  When events are happening, operators can also gradually cool down reactors which makes it easier to restart when it is safe to do so. 

The problem at Zaporizhzhia is that some one is trying to run a reactor at full power *during a war*.  This is the wrong choice.  Regardless of who the combatants are, regardless of which combatants are more or less at fault, regardless of which side the plant operators support just the fact that combat is taking place at the facility is grounds to initiate cool down.  Since any reasonable person will believe the current conflict will last more than a day the SCRAM button is a good choice.  

Anyone shooting near spent fuel rod storage facilities are guilty of something horrible too.  So I am not excusing anyone.

So they can design a new tank and maybe make a few prototypes but when it comes to actually needing to order a hundred of them they look at the cost of production and just go back to the trusty old T-72 design. The tooling is all done, the factory is set up, the workers are well practiced so you know what the cost is and that it will always be cheaper than a newer design. Plus if you run into problems with the new design you might now have spent what little money you have on procuring a lemon and then you still need to dump more money you don't have to get something usable.

The basic foundation of the T-72 is old but it's cheap and they know what it's capable of.

Adding hyperbole and conviction to your statements doesn't make them any more true. The Russians aren't ""collapsing"", in fact - in your own comment you are not even making that point. You start of with ""collapse"" and end up with ""momentum shift"". Yeah, there's a momentum shift, fully agree there. 

But just because the Russians aren't going on the offensive as much as they were, doesn't mean they are facing a ""collapse"". It just means the initiative of the war has switched and it's the Ukrainians turn to attack. We don't know how that will go. We do know the Ukrainians will have their fair share of challenges in that area and that it's simply easier to be on the defensive from an operational perspective.

Even if the Ukrainians will be successful in Kherson, and they very well might, that still doesn't mean the Russians will ""collapse"". More likely they will arrange for an orderly retreat towards new defensive lines and the war will continue from there.

To assume anything more than that based on the available information is fanciful and frankly driven by wishful thinking. We've been hearing stories about the imminent collapse of the Russian military since the first month of the war, just as they supposedly would run out of cruise missiles in 10 days and how it would be impossible for them to find new recruits. Meanwhile, they are still on the offensive in the Donbass, they are finding people through various means to put in the military and they are still throwing smart bombs. That doesn't mean it's going great for them, it just means we have to stop with the ridiculous hyperbole and look at the situation realistically.

Well, for one, Ukraine doesn't seem particularly worried about holding those cities with the manpower they currently have in place.  They've held up against basically daily Russian assaults for the last 40 days.  Some of those cities have been holding out against Russian attacks since 2014.  

But in a broader sense, it's probably because Ukraine understands that this war isn't going to be decided in a tug-of-war over a few km of Donbas.  Like, there's no critical strategic turning point in the four cities the Russians are attacking in the east.  Even if they eventually take those 4 cities, all they did was win the right to keep getting bloody in the next 4 cities.  It doesn't change the overall strategic picture of the war.

On the other hand.  If Ukraine can prevent a major Russian breakthrough in the east with a limited force while concentrating their offensive firepower elsewhere -- in Kherson, Kharkiv, Izium, or Zaporizhia -- then that's 100% to their strategic advantage and will allow them to seize the initiative and force the Russians into a defensive posture.

There was a great infographic last week that showed an estimated concentration of Russian forces, which made it very clear why Ukraine isn't just fighting them head on.

Ukraine is actually using a more western methodology of softening targets before offensives (hitting logistics and key targets, taking out AA and radar, etc), while the Russian offensive is very frontloaded (artillery then troops, repeat).

First, history:  you don't need to destroy a convoy that's stuck and can't move.  In fact, it's better to leave it be... because it consumes resources to keep the engines running and the troops warm and fed.  Over time, it just starves itself.  Furthermore, if it isn't going anywhere, it's not really a military force, is it?  Then you pick it off after it is weak and the soldiers *want* to surrender. Much easier.  Until then, you can spend your precious resources fighting other battles against other forces that are an actual threat.

Same is true with cities.  The troops in Kherson Oblast are not going anywhere, and they aren't enough to threaten much else.   They can't really attack with effect.  And they can't get out.  That makes the area north/west of Dnipro a de-facto penal colony, with very well-armed prisoners.

And it's inhabited by very very very pissed off Ukrainians who will kill Russians with their fingernails, if they can catch them unawares.  It's a sleepless terror, for Russians.

The more troops and equipment Russia sends in there, the fewer can be working the Donbas.   Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers need tons of food, fuel, ammunition and supporting equipment that has to trickle its way into the area.  They can't get good sleep by virtue of relentless partisan activity and long-range fires.  It's all 100% within range of Ukraine, which has interior lines of supply and can rotate troops and equipment with impunity.   

It's just a penal colony.

I mean, it could be the Russians are morons and thought this would be a great false flag, its possible, they've proven to be very dumb, but until there's more evidence, imo I don't think there's really a strong enough case to blame either party.

What makes sense to me here is that Ukraine planned strikes with western support, knew there'd be popular outrage, and they, in conjunction with western governments and media, used that to demand more western intervention.
