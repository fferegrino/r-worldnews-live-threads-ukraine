 The head of Ukraine's state-owned gas company Naftogaz says The Hague has ordered Russia to pay $5bn in compensation for its unlawful seizure of assets in occupied Crimea.

Chief executive Oleksiy Chernyshov said in a statement that the move was ""a key victory on the energy front"".

The company said the arbitration court in the Netherlands rejected Moscow's claim that it was not entitled to compensation over the expropriation of its assets.

""Russia must now comply with this decision in accordance with its obligations under international law,"" Mr Chernyshov added.

Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, but Kyiv has vowed it will take the region back.

Former detainees of torture centres discovered in Kherson have spoken of being beaten with sticks, given electric shocks and put in painful stress positions by Russian forces.

Human Rights Watch says it has discovered new evidence that Russian troops unlawfully kept residents in centres set up during their occupation of the southern Ukrainian city for nine months last year.

Victims and their families told the organisation of the torture they suffered at detention centres in the city, as well as makeshift sites created elsewhere - including at a village school.

""Former detainees consistently reported similar forms of abuse, including severe beatings with sticks and rubber batons, electric shocks, threats of death or mutilation, and use of painful stress positions,"" Human Rights Watch said in a new report.

Detainees were not given adequate medical care, it said, as it detailed its findings from interviews with 34 people about the ""abusive"" treatment of civilians between March and November 2022.

Human Rights Watch heard from 12 former detainees and 10 family members who gave descriptions of torture and aggression in the centres.

One former detainee told the group: ""There were five men... they were all beaten up. There was one who had been shot in the leg; another one had a broken rib. We heard screams [of people being beaten] all day and night.""

Russian guards are also alleged to have humiliated detainees by ""forcing them to shout pro-Russian slogans"" and sing the Russian national anthem ""under threat of beatings"".

Russia captured Kherson early on in the war, but it came back under Kyiv's control late last year when Ukrainian troops entered the city.

[*Ukrainska Pravda*](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2022/12/13/7380452/), republished their major piece on that triumph, diligently explaining how it was not western partners who assaisted, as the NYT had written.  They write, in part:

> On April 13, around 4:00 p.m., the operator of the *Neptune* complex—with a well-known but currently classified Ukrainian surname [meaning, probably also is named Zelensky]—received very unexpected data on the radars: his conventional radar showed that there was a large target about 120 kilometers from the coast. There could be only one object of similar size in that sector of the Black Sea—the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, the cruiser *Moskva*.

> But how could an **ordinary radar** show an over-the-horizon target at such a distance? The Ukrainian engineers are convinced—nature itself has ‘sided with the defenders’ that day. Due to there being dense clouds over the sea, the signal from the radar reflected from them to the surface of the water, and from the water back to the clouds. 

*Basically, the weather phenomenon that day, allowed the radar to see past its ordinary distance:*

> > ""At the time of the invasion, **we did not have over-the-horizon radars**, and Russia knew it. But since the clouds were very low and the signal from this **“corridor”—between the water and the clouds**—had nowhere to go, the radar unexpectedly reached the *Moskva*,"" the interlocutor explains to *UP*.

> The Russians were so sure of their own inaccessibility to Ukrainian forces that, our military sources suggest, probably did not even activate their air defense systems. Although, even if *were* on, they would have big problems with the *Neptunes*.

> > “Neptune is a slow-moving missile, running on liquid fuel, that sneaks up to the ship unnoticed until the very last moment. Until it's too late. Conventional anti-aircraft systems almost don't see it, because it flies over the water itself,"" a source from the NSDC explains in a conversation with *UP.*

> And on April 13, the Russian cruiser unexpectedly entered the zone of damage of Ukrainian missiles. **As soon as** it was recorded, at around 4 p.m., two *Neptunes* were launched, which flew one after the other in the direction of the *Moskva*. 

*They had to wait and wait and wait to learn whether it had been successful, for a long time, thought they’d only damaged her:*
 
> But the most interesting phase of the operation began just after the missiles were launched towards the sea. According to rocket scientists' calculations, the flight of the *Neptunes* should have taken a little more than 6 minutes for that distance. But how could they know if the missiles hit? According to *UP* military sources familiar with the course of the operation, the *Bayraktar* operators refused to take off and verify the hit, because they couldnt see from above the clouds, and flying under the clouds is a 100% guarantee of being shot down. 

> > ""That's why no one knew whether it was possible to hit. But then the data came that the *Moskva* hit ‘full forward’. This meant that something *did* happen.  

> > [Then, they could see on radars that the ship moved.] It was clear from [her change of] direction, that the cruiser wanted to hide behind the Boyko towers [oil platforms], so that if a large missile was launched again it will confuse the ship and towers, and would first capture the tower as a target, and the ship behind it will be safe,"" says the interlocutor of the *UP* among the rocketmen, off the record.

> In parallel with that observation, [they further believed they damaged her because] four ships simultaneously rushed to the *Moskva* from different directions. However, an unexpected storm began at sea, and any rescue operations became very difficult.

*They still didn’t know level of damage...*

> **It wasn’t until a tugboat left Crimea** for *Moskva*, that the Ukrainian military realized because it was apparent to them—the situation on the cruiser was *critical*.

> That night, a head of one of the branches of security forces wrote to *UP* journalists: ""The *Moskva* is done for.""

NORTH DIGHTON, Mass. —Around a half-dozen F.B.I. agents on Thursday pushed onto the property of a 21-year-old member of the intelligence wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard who is linked to an online group at the center of a trove of leaked classified U.S. intelligence documents that have upended relations with American allies and exposed weaknesses in the Ukrainian military.

The national guardsman, who was first identified by The New York Times as Jack Teixeira, oversaw an online group named Thug Shaker Central, where about 20 to 30 people, mostly young men and teenagers, came together over a shared love of guns, racist online memes and video games.

On Thursday, an armored vehicle and about a dozen uniformed officers, most wearing tactical gear and holding weapons, were outside the cordoned-off home.

Two U.S. officials confirmed that investigators want to talk to Airman Teixeira about the leak the government documents to the private online group. One official said he might have information relevant to the investigation.

Starting months ago, the authorities say, one of the users of the online group uploaded hundreds of pages of intelligence briefings into the small chat group, lecturing its members, who had bonded during the isolation of the pandemic, on the importance of staying abreast of world events.

The New York Times spoke with four members of the Thug Shaker Central chat group, where Airman Teixeira served as group administrator.

While the gaming friends would not identify the group’s leader by name, a trail of digital evidence compiled by The Times leads to Airman Teixeira.

Here’s what else to know:

The Times has been able to link Airman Teixeira to other members of the Thug Shaker Central group through his online gaming profile and other records. Details of the interior of Airman Teixeira’s childhood home — posted on social media in family photographs — also match details on the margins of some of the photographs of the leaked secret documents.

Members of Thug Shaker Central who spoke to The Times said that the documents they discussed online were meant to be purely informative, and started to get wider attention only after one of the teenage members took a few dozen of them and posted them to a public online forum.  The person who leaked, they said, was no whistle-blower, and the secret documents were never meant to leave their small corner of the internet.

On Thursday, President Biden told reporters that the United States was “getting close” to finding answers about the leak. Senior law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, expect an arrest in the case over the next day or two.

The leaked documents reveal sensitive material — maps of Ukrainian air defenses and a review of South Korea’s secret plans to deliver ammunition to Ukraine — but it is the immediate relevance of the intelligence that most worries White House and Pentagon officials: Some of the documents appear to be barely 40 days old.",False,1681409050.0,t3_12kb6tf,t3_12kb6tf,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

Day 412-414 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The days have been getting somewhat less quiet recently, but surprisingly not because of Russian strikes. The demining operations have become much more frequent in the recent months, we hear explosions all the time now, and not small ones either. There are constant notices of new demining operations happening in different areas and a lot of the time we can hear it from the city. 

Yesterday in the morning we heard a very loud explosion coming from somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, which at first, we thought that it was yet another missile strike, but it was just one of the planned explosions. Even when we know that those are “safe explosions”, they still make people jump every time. And the one from yesterday was almost certainly from something big, like a FAB-500, so it sounded just like a missile strike.

The yet another execution of one of Ukrainian POWs being posted by the Russians is as enraging as always, fucking barbaric bastards. It’s already expected that they will keep posting stuff like this in the future, the people that posted it said as much, but what is the fucking point? What do they want to achieve by doing this? It won’t make us want to ever negotiate with them, it doesn’t scare us, the only thing it generates is hatred that won’t die down for many generations, if ever. 

It’s also just so pointless, if there’s anything that we learned from Russian actions, it’s that trying to break your enemy’s spirit by attacking their civilians doesn’t work. They targeted our civilians for the entirety of this war and they got nothing out of it except hatred. They tried to destroy our energy infrastructure with thousands of missiles and yet we are already restarting our energy exports to EU countries. So, even though we can do the same thing to the Russians, while justified, it would be a pointless waste of our resources. It would definitely feel good (and it already does when some limited strikes happen), but our resources are finite, we can’t just throw them away for no real advantage.

And also, just what the fuck is that new info about the leaker, a 21-year-old who shares his love of racist memes, guns and video games with his teen friends leaked a ton of classified military information that endangers the US and their allies for some clout in a discord group?

* Some Russian cities further away from Ukraine have confirmed they plan to go ahead with Victory Day. The cancelled events have likely primarily been called off because of security concerns near the border, as officials have claimed.  

* However, the different approaches highlight a sensitive communications challenge for the Kremlin. Putin couches the ‘special military operation’ in the spirit of the Soviet experience in World War Two.

Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny is suffering from a mystery illness which could be a ""slow acting poison"", his spokeswoman has said.

Kira Yarmysh said an ambulance was called for Navalny overnight on Friday night due to ""acute stomach pain"" and claimed a prison doctors dismissed his complaints.

She also said the activist had lost 8kg in eight weeks.

""We do not rule out that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,"" Ms Yarmysh said in a tweet.

She reported that Navalny is being held in a ""punishment cell... without medical help"".

The Kremlin said it did not have oversight of Navalny's health and that it was the responsibility of Russia's penitentiary service.

Navalny has long been an outspoken critic against Vladimir Putin.

In March, he was sentenced to nine years in prison after he was found guilty of large-scale fraud and contempt of court.

Newly discovered classified US military documents reveal the depth of infighting inside the Russian government over the war.

Additional documents have surfaced which were not included in the tranche that came to light last week, the New York Times has reported.

They apparently reveal feuds within the Russian government over the number of dead and wounded soldiers in Ukraine.

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the military of obscuring the scale of Russian casualties, the NYT says.

The new documents are said to reveal how US spy agencies have managed to penetrate ""nearly every aspect of the Russian intelligence apparatus and military command structure"".

Moscow has long been accused of attempting to prevent the true scope of its losses being reported.

Earlier today, the UK's Ministry of Defence said Vladimir Putin was waging a ""mismanaged and failing"" war in Ukraine.

The NYT writes: ""FSB officials, the document says, contend that the ministry's toll did not include the dead and wounded among the Russian National Guard, the Wagner mercenary force or fighters fielded by Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of the southern Russian republic of Chechnya"".

The service apparently calculated that Russian casualties are close to 110,000.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine has released accurate casualty figures.

*At a ceremony in the Kremlin, warmonger Putin presented 17 foreign ambassadors with their certificates of appointment. Among them was Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Moscow. The dictator addresses them personally and accuses the Americans of being to blame for the war in Ukraine. Tracy listens to these unbelievable allegations without moving. Her other counterparts show no reaction either.The receipt: At the end of his speech, it gets embarrassing for Putin. He finishes his speech and appears to be waiting for applause or some other response. But nothing happens. There is silence. Nobody moves.*

*Visibly embarrassed, Putin tries to find a new deal. But again: no reaction from the guests. Putin resigns irritated, obviously confused, he even wishes the politicians all the best in the end – in English! It is unclear whether the ambassadors agreed in advance to let the dictator appear in this way.

It seems believable that Ukraine would exaggerate. Propaganda is not limited to Russia. It also seems believable that Ukraine would be counting a lot of WIA as KIA if they were too far away to see bodies.

But 40K seems low based on Oryx vehicle losses, Ukraine's admission that at times they were losing over 100 per day (and the likelihood that Russia would be losing many more due to the advantage defenders have), and the other estimates we've seen from sources like ISW, Centre for Strategic and International Studies, the UK gov, etc.

Frankly I was expecting Ukrainian losses to be closer to 40K, and Russian losses to be closer to 80K, with many more wounded on both sides.

Is the US gov not including separatists and PMCs? That doesn't seem logical since from the west and Ukraine's perspective, Russia + allies/proxies force numbers and casualties are the most useful numbers to know. Is the US gov only counting verified dead? Is this psyops? Is the leak fake? Are the numbers really dated?

Uh... That's putting it very, very lightly. By ""diminished,"" they mean nearly completely out of ammunition for the two systems that comprise more than 90% of their entire air defense network. It presumed, perhaps erroneously, that Russia would keep up the same rate of drone and missile swarms that they were using in February 2023, but even a few more 100+ missile / drone swarms would be very costly for Ukraine's incredibly low stock of air defense missiles.

This is a huge problem because if Ukraine loses all the ammunition for their S-300 and Buk systems, Russia will finally be able to start bombing Ukrainian military forces with closer-range aircraft. These aircraft would not be as close as a close-air-support plane like the Su-25 bomber. They will launch glide-winged, guided JDAM bombs from 50+ kilometers away. If the Russian airforce is able to do this without S-300s shooting them down, they will gain the ability to do something they've never been able to do so far in this war: bomb the crap out of Ukraine's front-line forces, including any kind of armored offensive force.

The other side to this problem is that there is no apparent short-term fix. The documents get into this, how they have been scrounging the globe for available S-300 systems in friendly countries. Besides Greece, there really isn't much S-300 ammo left outside of China, Russia, and India. And the West itself doesn't have a lot of NATO systems that they can give Ukraine even if they wanted to, because our war doctrine has never emphasized the need to build lots of these systems. It's looking like the only real fix to this problem is to give Ukraine lots of airplanes that can launch air-to-air counter-missiles, and we are nowhere on track for providing Ukraine these aircraft quickly, let alone enough of them quickly.

The assessments predict that this problem is likely to deny Ukraine the opportunity to pull off a meaningful counteroffensive this spring or summer. These fancy Western-donated tanks won't mean anything if they don't have functioning air defenses covering that entire force.

I will say one serious thing that probably no one else will discuss, and then two specific tips.

First, the serious one. Post-partum depression does not happen to everyone but if it does, it is totally normal. It manifests in different ways for different people. For me it was a deep sadness that felt like it would never lift, a feeling like my child wasn’t my own, and having random thoughts pop into my head about physically harming my child (the same way I might remember I left my keys on the table).

I was afraid to say anything to anyone I knew in person at the time, and it was in many ways one of the scariest things I’ve dealt with. It lasted about 4 months (around the same amount of time that the sleep deprivation lasts), but some people experience it for years. The things that helped me the most were talking to other people about it online, getting sleep, eating well, asking for help when I needed it, etc.

Specific to the sleep deprivation, if you have the financial means, find a night doula who can come to your home and take care of the infant for you a couple nights a week. It will do wonders for your health and sanity.

With that weirdness out of the way, here are two things that I wish I had known:

1. Newborns MUST eat every few hours. Even if they are sleepy, tired, whatever. My first child just refused to wake up to eat. After we came home from the hospital, we tried to feed her but didn’t want to disturb her when she didn’t respond after a minute or five. When I went back like a fourth time to bring her to my wife to try, she was shivering and feverish. We ran to the hospital worried, and it turned out for us this is a normal response that occurs when they need to eat. Make them eat.

2. You can accidentally train your child to wake you up at night. If the child is 9 months old and crying for you 10 times a night, you’ve trained them to need you. Sleep training is super important and highly recommended. It consists of training YOURSELF to not go to them when every time they cry at night, but to let them cry it out. Sometimes you have to go in - they might have a poopy diaper, or maybe they puked. But if they constantly need to be fed (either by bottle or breast), or held, then instead of learning to calm themselves, you’ve trained them to need you to be able to relax / sleep.

Highly recommend a baby cam (we got the nanit) to help you discern the situation when they are crying. If they won’t stop or it is abnormal, you’ll know something is up though even without a camera.

I’m sure this is waaaay longer and weirder than most people, but I wanted to make sure you got something different / useful that other folks wouldn’t say.

All the best - its a very special ride!",1681426383.0,1681425829.0,t3_12kb6tf,t1_jg47xjn,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Oh, and one little advice: make plans from day to day. When you get a baby you are running on their schedule, not yours.

Also, depending on where you live, baby first aid training might be free. Not to scare you, but we needed it. Better safe than sorry",1681407463.0,1681406134.0,t3_12kb6tf,t1_jg47xjn,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

1) Take *lots* of family pictures. You from 30 years from now will thank you.  
  
2) Kids make mistakes all the time. Use those opportunities to show them how to make the right choices.  
  
3) Kids will come to you for help if they feel confident they will get it without judgments. These are also teaching opportunities!  
  
4) If they watch screens, including looking out of windows, watch it with them and provide commentary. Everything is new to them! Even obvious things aren't obvious!    
  
5) Reading/speaking to them early helps them pick up words. Say the words clearly and properly, they'll catch on and fill in the syntax later (eg, ""apple"" becomes ""want apple"" becomes ""I want an apple"").",False,1681407809.0,t3_12kb6tf,t1_jg47xjn,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

I overheard my dad say to my mum once: ""Let him make his mistakes, it's the only way he's gonna learn.""  And true enough, I didn't listen to a damn bit of the good advice, and often did dumb shit before I learned that yes, the advice was good.  This will likely happen a lot.  Try not to get too frustrated with it.  They'll need you to catch them, too, after they did exactly what you said they shouldn't.

Some immediate advice that comes to mind: get all your ducks in a row long before the due date. Once that baby is born you won't have time to do anything for a very long time. Accept help whenever possible. Get sleep, take naps. Take tons of photos and video, especially ones with your baby with you and your partner. Get a convertible car seat that grows with your baby so you don't have to get multiple. Install the car seat well before the due date (I had to do it in the hospital parking garage and it fucking sucked).

Twice as many Russian soldiers have been killed in action than Ukrainian ones, supposed US intelligence leaks show.

If authentic, 354,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured so far.

The documents cite the US Defence Intelligence Agency as estimating the number of casualties are around 10 times bigger than any public figures published by either Moscow or Kyiv.

Russian wounded: 154,000 to 180,000

Russian deaths: 35,500 to 43,000

Ukrainian wounded: 109,000 to 113,500

Ukrainian deaths: 15,500 to 17,500

They also show that while Russia has numerical superiority in some areas, Ukraine has almost double the number of tanks and 500 more armoured personnel carriers (APCs) on the battlefield.

The number of those lost in theatre were estimated to be:

Russian tank losses: 2,048

Russian APC losses: 3,900

Ukrainian tank losses: 468

Ukrainian APC losses: 1,020

The Russians have also been exhausted as well with their own Terror Tantrum Attacks as they've used up a ton of their own stock. Russia is in pretty poor shape as it is, its not getting any better for them.

There's also another thing that could be a major factor in that the West cannot and won't allow Ukraine to fall, they know that they can ill afford to allow Putin to ""win"" anything here. He HAS to be routed here once and for all as Europe knows full well the perils of letting a psychotic dictator getting his way leads to far worse consequences.

I'd honestly think considering the barbarity of Russia's shitty military, the sheer litany of crimes, the fact that Russia no longer adheres to the basic principles of International Law that if it ever comes to it, NATO will directly engage them and destroy them in Ukraine as a last ditch effort if that what it takes. Not out of choice but out of necessity, there's not a chance Russia can be allowed to win here after all it's done it will only become worse the longer it goes on. 

They've become a perpetually drunk, copium addicted, Vatnik ISIS state now.

This is a hard red line that NATO isn't going to cross. NATO has a credible reputation as a strictly defensive alliance. If NATO were to attack Russia in Ukraine, it wouldn't even trigger Article 5. It would just be a coalition of the US and whatever other states felt like fighting.

I think after this war is said and done the West will have a significantly diminished fear of Russia. We all see now the emperor has no clothes. If they attempted anything on a NATO country like they're doing in Ukraine they'd get absolutely obliterated.

OK, no. This keeps getting said in this thread, and it's wrong because the people saying it are unaware of how the different SAM and MANPAD weapons work.

The manpad device is a shoulder or truck-launched, short-range missile. These missiles can be armed and launched very quickly. However, they can only be used against aircraft that are within the user's line of sight. The range of the most common launcher, the Stinger, is only 4.8 kilometers.

Why has Russia been losing so many planes to these small, short-range MANPADS? Paradoxically, because the only way they can safely use their airforce at all right now, is to get super close up and personal with the target. They have to use low-flying Su-25 CAS bombers (the Soviet version of the A-10, making use of the same doctrine Ukraine has to do as well to survive Russian AA). These bombers get close to the target by skimming the ground, in order to avoid Ukraine's longer-range radar and higher-altitude defenses like the S-300. Skimming the ground means that they have to come close to Ukrainian ground forces hiding in trees and fields who can rapidly deploy shoulder-launched MANPADS as the plane flies nearby.

It would always be much more preferable to Russia if they could fly higher up and use medium altitudes to attack Ukraine's forces, but right now they can't, and they can't because of the S-300. However, once Ukraine is done firing all of its S-300s, they won't have much left to answer medium-altitude bombers that can stay 10+ kilometers out of range of front-line MANPADs. The Russians could just drop guided JDAMs from 50 kilometers back -- literally 10x as far as the maximum range of a Stinger MANPAD.",1681403056.0,1681402649.0,t3_12kb6tf,t1_jg3zf8p,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

If you think one of the strongest intelligence networks in the world doesn’t already know what’s going on in the nations they are supplying weapons to, and a country to which they have been feeding intel to, then I dunno what to tell you lol. There is an interesting politico article interviewing the major insiders on the lead up to the war. If you read it you will find that yes, the US does already have intel and they don’t need countries to tell them anything. It’s the US that diseminates intel to other countries to help shape policy as we saw the US gathering allies in the lead up to the war.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,12kb6tf,jg3uotl,"The problem at this point, according to the leaks, is that Ukraine is dangerously, dangerously low on air defense munitions. The documents detail that about 90% of Ukraine's total air defense assets are the Soviet S-300, a long-range missile system that can intercept most of the fast-moving cruise missiles Russia uses in its bombardments. A big amount of the remaining 10% are made up of the Buk system, which is a shorter-range system used on the front-line to attack drones and enemy aircraft.

According to the leak documents, Ukraine is on track to run completely dry on both the S-300 and the Buk by mid to late May. This does assume that Russia continues its February 2023 rate of missile and drone swarm bombardments, which in fairness do seem to have reduced due to their own supply problems. But still, this is a major problem.

The West does not *have* that many ground-based NATO AA weapons to give Ukraine. We have the Patriot, and we have some shorter-range advanced systems like Iris-T and SAMP-T, but we don't have that many missiles for these systems, and we definitely don't have as many launchers as Ukraine has S-300 launchers. The best candidate for the Patriot to replace the S-300 is the PAC-3 missile, but there are apparently only 2,000 PAC-3 missiles worldwide, and about half of them are in active use, deployed in launcher tubes in Patriot batteries that are operating right now. This only gives us about half a year or less of ammunition for a fleet of Patriots that would replace the S-300 (and to date we've only been able to give 2 and a half Patriot batteries to Ukraine anyway, which is not enough to replace the coverage zones of 60+ S-300s they use now). Meanwhile, Ukraine has nearly completely exhausted all the Iris-T missiles ever produced (which are not many, because the system was only completed last year).

So, out of all these options, what else can we do? Well, frankly, the best option would be to give Ukraine a bunch of aircraft that can shoot their own anti-missile missiles (AM-RAMS acronym type missile). We have an absolute shitload of AMRAMs we can give Ukraine, but they are only useful if we give them airplanes or ground-based launchers that can actually fire that type of missile.

The American NASAM system is basically a mid-range AA launcher that actually uses the AMRAM missile in its launcher. However, it takes time and cost to create a useable launcher system for an AMRAM that can be useful from the ground. So we'll continue making NASAM systems for Ukraine to use, but we probably can't build enough in the next year to come even close to replacing the S-300 coverage needs.

That pretty much leaves NATO-standard aircraft, ideally Generation 3 and 4 aircraft like the F-16, Grippen, or Mirage. There aren't that many Grippens or Mirages that have ever been built, so this limits the logistics supply of spare parts, servicing experts, and training capacity. The F-16 has been built in the thousands. However, America has been quite sanguine about providing these frames to Ukraine. Even at the height of the F-16 hype, in early February, Biden's administration was only talking about giving two ""squadrons"" of F-16s -- that's 24 planes max. Not at lot, at all.

The most interesting part about the leaks, to me, is that these documents were from mid-February. Right before this, Biden said that he was rejecting the F-16 idea entirely. I do wonder if dire assessments like this one and others that have come after it, will finally cause NATO to go into panic mode and get some planes into Ukraine. Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that they probably fucked up and failed to get the ball rolling on airplanes back in fall 2022 when Ukraine's AA statistics were showing signs of severe ammunition exhaustion. It is highly questionable now whether the West can get its shit together and get enough Ukrainian pilots and service crews trained and outfitted in time, which would apparently mean by this summer.",False,1681400601.0,t3_12kb6tf,t1_jg3plr3,,4,11,0,11,0,0,

On the one hand, there's his obviously bogus claim that he had (despite there being no record of such) declassified the documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago last year, which he says made it legal for him to take and store them after he was no longer President.  That argument is, of course complete nonsense.  As you note, declassification is a process, of which there would be a record if it had happened as he claims.

On the other hand, there's his well-documented habit of being overeager to share information with randos while he was President.  The legality of him doing so does not hinge on him having first declassified the documents, because the law regarding classified materials expressly gives the President unilateral authority to authorize anyone he so chooses to receive classified information, so even if he hadn't declassified something and the person he sent it to was not cleared through the usual channels, he could still legally share it with them.

The reason he has such unilateral authority is obvious: it gives the President the flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances in the most appropriate manner, for example by bringing in an expert in an emergency who's not cleared via the normal processes and where doing so would take more time than there actually is before something has to be done, or perhaps intentionally disclosing sensitive information for strategic purposes (e.g. to say ""we know what you're up to, China, don't get any ideas"").  One would of course hope that the President would only do so after taking advice from his duly selected counselors and giving the matter proper consideration, but the law does not actually require him to do so.

>These two qualities are not mutually exclusive. When somebody is working on offensive operations, they could be cunning and professional and be stupid on the defensive side.

>Yes, “Moscow four” is the same thing. Imagine, it’s a deputy chief of the G.R.U., the scariest organization in the world. Would he think that somebody would dare try to social engineer his password? They live in oblivion, thinking that everybody’s too scared to go near them. So of course, he would not take the extra measures to come up with a better password. Instead, it was Moscow1, 2, 3, 4.

Second there was no request because a formal request follows the informal decision to deliver. It doesn’t precede it. And it makes no sense to file a request if you know for a fact that it will not be decided upon positively within a reasonable time frame.

It was a deliberate decision to obstruct the process, because an important faction of the SPD did not want to take this step.

Since Lambrecht had been sacked it kept getting better, because Pistorius follows a different agenda. The leftist ""peace"" faction of the SPD lost this battle. The obstructionist policy could not be upheld, it created too many disturbances with coalition partners and international allies.
