Day 406-407 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past 2 days were pretty quiet yet again, there were no missile or drone strikes and the air raid alerts were quite rare too. Sometimes people also report hearing explosions, which actually end up being the sounds of our military conducting exercises somewhere not so far away from the city. It’s nothing to worry about, but it still startles people because you never really expect it.

Continuing the story of a guy with a grenade from 2 days ago, it looks like he actually ended up killing himself with it. There were conflicting reports at first, but a bit later our police reported that he actually died because the grenade exploded in his hand, though thankfully nobody else was harmed. This is the second time that someone has died from a grenade in our city in just the last month, which is just horrible.

That story about our military’s documents being leaked is honestly pretty weird. The troop death numbers are obviously made up, but also why would they publish the leaks in the first place if it was something important that they can use against us? If they have a spy that obtained highly classified documents for them, then why would they blow his cover by releasing those documents for their enemies to see? That just seems so stupid, but I guess they think a leak like that might delay our counteroffensive.",False,1680826471.0,t3_12d8g9e,t3_12d8g9e,,0,101,0,101,0,0,

Kara-Murza is the protégé of Boris Nemtsov, the politician murdered by Putin in 2015 on that bridge by the Kremlin. Kara-Murza himself survived at least two assassination attempts. 

> Vladimir Kara-Murza has been under arrest since April 2022. Initially, he was arrested for 15 days under the article on disobedience to the police. Then, a case was opened against the politician for spreading fake news about the Russian army. In July a new criminal case had been opened against the politician under an article on the activities of an “undesirable” organization for working with the Open Russia Foundation. In October, Kara-Murza was also charged with high treason.

> The politician's lawyer said earlier that Kara-Murza had polyneuropathy of the lower extremities, which is an obstacle to serving a sentence. This condition, according to Prokhorov, was probably the result of the poisonings of Kara-Murza in 2015 and 2017.

> The reason for the criminal case against Kara-Murza was his March 15, 2022 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives, in which he denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 6 April 2023.  


* As claimed on Russian social media, the Russian MoD has highly likely dismissed Colonel-General Rustam Muradov as commander of the Eastern Group of Forces (EGF) in Ukraine.  

* The EGF under Muradov has suffered exceptionally heavy casualties in recent months as its poorly conceived assaults repeatedly failed to capture the Donetsk Oblast town of Vuhledar.  

* The operations attracted intense public criticism from across the spectrum of Russian commentators - including Muradov’s own troops.  

* Muradov took over the EGF after its disastrous attempt to assault Kyiv from the north-west during the initial full-scale invasion.  

* He is the most senior Russian military dismissal of 2023 so far, but more are likely as Russia continues to fail to achieve its objectives in the Donbas.

Russian forces are falling back from Vuhledar and Marinka. They are also falling back from around Avdiivka. Reports are coming that after 4th of April force recon of ZSU, Russians got orders to fall back even to Donetsk itself. They are falling back by 10 km in Vuhledar area. RU positions in Krasnohorivka are endangered.  That basically nullifies their territorial gains, leaving only Bakhmut and Soledar region with any Russian gains. However not so long. Russian army is preparing to fall back from northern and southern outskirts of  Bakhmut, leaving Prigozhin alone there. That information is partially confirmed by today counterattack and getting a few city blocks of Bakhmut back under Ukrainian control. 

Russian army apparently is falling back to prepare for the defense of Donetsk. 

I can translate a full article if you guys want.

Ok. The full translation (sorry for crudeness and possible errors):

>Sources in the Russian Armed Forces and the AFU: Russian troops retreated from Vuhledar and Marinka, the Ukrainian army removed the threat of encircling Avdiivka.

>Since the evening of April 3, we have been receiving reports from the Ukrainian military about the successful advance of the AFU north, east and south of Avdiivka. On April 4, we learned from Ukrainian officers that the Russian Armed Forces had retreated from Marinka (southwest of Donetsk) and from Vuhledar.
>On the night of April 4-5 and this morning, confirmations also began to arrive from the Russian military.

>The AFU deployed fresh assault units to the Donetsk direction, which first conducted a successful force recon battle at Vodyanyi, pushing the RF Armed Forces by 2-3 km, and then dislodged Russian forces from positions northeast of Avdiika, striking at the base of the Russian outpost at Novoselovka.

>According to reports from both sides, the Russian Armed Forces have withdrawn to Novoselovka, and there is a threat of losing the settlement if the AFU continues to advance. This could lead to an encirclement or a quick retreat of the Russian Armed Forces from their positions near Krasnohorivka. These are the same positions that Russian ""war correspondents"" called ""key positions"" and assured back in the fall that it was from there that the RF Armed Forces could successfully encircle Avdeevka. Fierce fighting for these settlements has been going on since the start of the war. Now all the local successes of the Russian Armed Forces are likely to result in their withdrawal from the blood-soaked positions.

>The Russian Armed Forces also retreated east of Avdiivka, retreating closer to Spartak and Yasynuvata. This is confirmed by sources in both armies.

>Also, according to Ukrainian and Russian officers, the RF Armed Forces retreated about 10 km from their positions near Ugledar. This territory is not yet occupied by the AFU.

>According to sources in the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, the retreat was due to two factors. First, the Russian units were unable to advance further because they had exhausted human and materiel resources. Second, the actions of the AFU assault units near Avdiivka showed that the stretched front could be broken in several places at once, so it was decided to shorten the line of contact in order to create a denser defense around Donetsk, Yasynuvata and Horlivka, as well as strengthen the defense around Volnovakha.

>The situation near Bakhmut is similar. The Russian Armed Forces are preparing to withdraw from positions to the south and north of the city, while the Wagner  have completely lost momentum in Bakhmut itself. According to Ukrainian sources, the AFU began to gradually recapture neighborhoods in the center of the city.

Stop it.

Geopolitics is complicated and nuanced, wars are complicated and nuanced... Don't buy into absolute statements.

There is no cold war, who knows there might be one in future but very unlikely. Trade still flows and is required.

There is no stalemate. A stalemate is where no force can conduct effective offensive work. This is not the case, what we see is Ukraine timing offensive and defensive actions to the conditions.

CCP is not taking Siberia. Sure, it may want it, but there are nukes and a lot of complications including trade and alignment at stake.

Especially regarding drones, I imagine that NATO trainers aren’t very used to combining drones with artillery/tanks, and that UA will actually have a lot to teach NATO forces on their use. [Anybody seen a single drone in all of the plentiful western training footage out there?]

2. Have the Ukrainians attempted to make any purchase orders for equipment NATO has been hesitant to provide? I know this isn’t some magic loophole that they could use to buy f35, etc, but it seems like it would relieve much of the negative pressure from the other countries.

Firstly, and quite unbelievably IMV, many countries' ambassadors don't speak the language of the countries to which they are sent.  The UK still has a policy of ensuring its ambassadors (and many junior diplomats) do speak the local language, but I understand we are a rare exception.  So it's entirely possible that nobody in the room could understand a word he was saying.  They may have been receiving translations into an earpiece, but even if so those are often delayed and hard to follow.

Secondly, he was formally receiving each as their respective nation's ambassador.  In British culture at least, it would be rather odd to applaud him for doing so.  People who were witnessing the occasion might have applauded the ambassadors by way of congratulation for being so received, but it doesn't look like any such witnesses were present.

Finally, to be formally received and then dismissed ""due to sanitary reasons"" is pretty insulting for an ambassador.  Usually such events will involve a catered reception, some mingling, some building of the diplomatic relationships.  They've just seen him do so with Xi.  They know he's currently doing so with Luka.  To be treated like this is really shit.

So, yeah, I'm not particularly surprised there's no applause.  I don't think he was fishing for one either, but rather giving his lame excuses for not being a better host.",1680791059.0,1680779816.0,t3_12d8g9e,t1_jf5u8pe,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

In an episode of StarTalk Irwin Redlener who is a co-founder of a charity helping children in Ukraine is interviewed. It's dated 17 Nov 2022.  

[How The War in Ukraine Will Shape The Future with Irwin Redlener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dchD0D5SM-c).  

For anyone who wishes to learn more about the charity please watch the video and/or see their website here https://www.eifoundation.org/partners/ukraine-childrens-action-project/

Here's the blurb from Youtube:  
>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener.  

And the extended blurb:  
>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children. We discuss the current state of humanitarian aid. Is there more we can be doing to help victims of war beyond satisfying immediate needs? What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict? 

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up. 

>How do we make sure there isn’t an entire generation lost to trauma? Do we have any insights from past wars? Learn about mental health care for war refugees and how teachers are being trained to handle traumatized children. All that, plus, we discuss the importance of continuing to dream.

bade91988212e2593fea14ebb75dc156,12d8g9e,jf92y03,"WASHINGTON — Classified war documents detailing secret American and NATO plans for building up the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned offensive against Russia were posted this week on social media channels, senior Biden administration officials said.

The Pentagon is investigating who may have been behind the leak of the documents, which appeared on Twitter and on Telegram, a platform with more than half a billion users that is widely available in Russia.

Military analysts said the documents appear to have been modified in certain parts from their original format, overstating American estimates of Ukrainian war dead and understating estimates of Russian troops killed.

The modifications could point to an effort of disinformation by Moscow, the analysts said. But the disclosures in the original documents, which appear as photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries, troop and battalion strengths, and other plans, represents a significant breach of American intelligence in the effort to aid Ukraine.
PART ONE

Biden officials were working to get them deleted but had not, as of Thursday evening, succeeded.

“We are aware of the reports of social media posts and the department is reviewing the matter,” said Sabrina Singh, the deputy press secretary at the Pentagon.

The documents do not provide specific battle plans, like how, when, and where Ukraine intends to launch its offensive. And because the documents are five weeks old, they offer a snapshot of time — the American and Ukrainian view, as of March 1, of what Ukrainian troops might need for the campaign.

To the trained eye of a Russian war planner, field general or intelligence analyst, however, the documents no doubt offer many tantalizing clues. The documents mention, for instance, the expenditure rate of HIMARS — American-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System munitions, which can launch attacks against targets like ammunition dumps, infrastructure and concentrations of troops, from a distance. The Pentagon has not said publicly how fast Ukrainian troops are using the HIMARs munitions; the documents do.

It was unclear how the documents ended up on social media. But pro-Russian government channels have been sharing and circulating the briefing slides, military analysts said.

The analysts warned that documents released by Russian sources could be selectively altered to present the Kremlin’s disinformation.

“Whether these documents are authentic or not, people should take care with anything released by Russian sources,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.

One of the slides said 16,000 to 17,500 Russian soldiers had been killed while Ukraine had suffered as many as 71,500 troop deaths. The Pentagon and other analysts have estimated that Russia has suffered far more casualties, and that closer to 200,000 soldiers on each side had been killed or wounded.

Nonetheless, analysts said parts of the documents appeared authentic and would provide Russia with valuable information such as the timetables for the delivery of weapons and troops, Ukrainian troop buildup numbers and other military details.

A document labeled “top secret” offers the “Status of the Conflict as of 1 Mar.” On that day, Ukrainian officials were at an American base in Weisbaden, Germany, for war game sessions, and a day later, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the supreme allied commander for Europe, visited the sessions.

Another document includes columns that list Ukrainian troop units, equipment and training, with schedules for January through April. The document contains a summary of 12 combat brigades that are being assembled, with nine of them apparently being trained and supplied by the United States and other NATO allies. Of those nine brigades, the documents said that six would be ready by March 31 and the rest by April 30. A Ukrainian brigade has about 4,000 to 5,000 soldiers, analysts said.

The document said that equipment delivery times would affect training and readiness to meet the timeline. Total equipment needed for nine brigades, the document said, was more than 250 tanks and more than 350 mechanized vehicles.

The leak is the first Russian intelligence breakthrough that has been made public since the war began. Throughout the war, the United States has provided Ukraine with information on command posts, ammunition depots and other key nodes in the Russian military lines. Such real-time intelligence has allowed the Ukrainians to target Russian forces, kill senior generals and force ammunition supplies to be moved farther from the Russian front lines, though U.S. officials say Ukraine has played the decisive role in planning and execution of those strikes.

But early on during the war, Ukrainian officials were hesitant about sharing their battle plans with the United States, for fear of leaks, American and European officials said. As recently as last summer, American intelligence officials said they often had a better understanding of Russia’s military plans than of Ukraine’s.

The intelligence sharing between Ukraine and the United States loosened up considerably last fall, and the two countries have been working closely on options for a Ukrainian offensive.

The other problem is that none of the minority ethnic groups are particularly large individually. Tatars are the largest at 5 million, but that still isn't that large, and they are spread over a very large geographic area. None of the others break 2 million population, which is really small considering Russia has 140+ million people, and some of them like Ukrainians and Armenians already have an existing country they could hypothetically move to (though of course, Russia should return ancestral lands to those countries where needed). 

But if you look at ethnicities like Buryats or Yakuts, there are fewer than 500,000 of them in all of Russia. There aren't really enough of them to necessarily sustain an independent nation (yes, I know smaller nations exist, but they tend to either be island nations or microstates, these nations would have to be huge geographic nations with almost no people in them), particularly when you consider that a lot of ethnic Russians also tend to live in the areas they live in. For instance, 32% of Yakutia is ethnic Russians.

So sure, places like Chechnya, Bashkortostan, and Tatarstan could potentially break off as small but independent nations, but the vast majority of Russia wouldn't split apart on ethnic lines.

What you're hoping for is what happens at the ""Wargaming"" level. The USA regularly holds wargames (pretend fights), where we basically play Dungeons-and-dragons with soldiers... trying to imagine how the future of war will play out. (Instead of moving little toys around to represent a battlefield, we actually call out real life soldiers to walk in a field. But all the fights are resolved with dice / games)

The Ukrainians have been invited to war games in the past, and I'm sure we'll invite them in the future (hopefully more of them, now that Ukraine has some of the best experience with modern combat).

Its in these wargames where the USA develops our ""future training"", ideas for future weapons, etc. etc. Its all a big process with tons of generals, bureaucrats, and so forth checking off items and whatnot. And a bunch of people imagining future weapons with dice sitting in a basement, with a radio calling out ""Soldiers in the field, pretend X happened"" to act out various scenarios.

Germany doesn't have large stockpiles of weapons and a pretty small (and for three decades underfunded) active military.

It was a deliberate political decision after the end of the Cold War and German reunification, that it shouldn't be a major military power in the middle of Europe together with being the largest economy and population. Many people inside and outside Germany would have been very worried about that for obvious historical reasons.

Because of that Germany got rid of its large Cold War military by scrapping or giving away its weapons. A lot of what currently is stored or in active service all over Europe and with other allies comes originally from Germany. And several of these weapons allready found their way to Ukraine. 

Yes, Germany still has a relatively large defense industry, but building new modern, heavy weapon systems from scratch takes a lot of time. Even more in times of scarce raw materials and components and a shortage of skilled workers.

Expect Germany to deliver large quantities of modern MBTs, IFVs, SPGs, SAMs and all other types of modern weapons to Ukraine and also NATO allies, that are reequiping and strenghten their military, in the next 3-10 years. 

Until then, the small amounts of (often times older) weapons, vehicles and equipment, that Germany has in store or can pull from its active forces, is all that is available.

I would describe Russia as a whole as someone who has narcissistic personality and borderline disorders. A grandiose sense of self and importance, combined with a overwhelming paranoia that others are conspiring against you that cannot be challenged by any facts. Someone with low self esteem, a low sense of worth that goes around bullying others to elevate one’s self. A bully. Everything is deniable, everything is the fault of others.

But in reality, Putin still maintains very strong approval. Those that oppose him certainly exist but are a small minority. And there are many that oppose him, but still support the war, and the annexations. Russian nationalism doesn't only exist in the United Russia party.

Putin may have ordered his troops into Ukraine, but I do not think he personally ordered the rape, looting, murder, and torture. I do not think it bothers him much either, but those actions were likely carried out by individuals and groups of Russians on their own accord.

Not sure the actual plans were leaked. The allies did multiple operations (Fortitude, Mincemeat, Bodyguard, etc.) to get the Germans to move and fix their forces in locations, as well as fatigue them with relying on their intelligence (boy who cried wolf). But all of the leaking involved fake plans to locations they wanted the Germans to look .. usually followed up by fake troop / equipment movement to give credence to intelligence.

Also, side fun fact, the German's initial blitz around the Maginot line through the Ardennes was not the original plan.

They can also help to guarantee weapons transfers are going to their correct locations, and help coordinate on the ground how they should be handled. This likely doesn't take the form of in-country training, but simply just logging information about weapons transfers.

I could definitely see smaller nations breaking off of Russia on ethnic lines if the government collapses, as happened in the fall of the USSR. I could potentially see a warlord here or there setting up an autonomous area of influence in more remote areas.

I'm pretty skeptical that we would see a situation where the populous parts of Russia west of the Urals break apart into warlords, with St. Petersburg fighting Novgorod and Moscow fighting Ryazan.

It feels very fan-fictiony. The vast of majority of people in the populous parts of Russia are Russians who view themselves as Russians and support a unified Russian state. Now, there might be a civil war over who controls that unified Russian state, but a long-term status quo of warlords carving out fiefdoms seems unlikely to me.

If you're asking whether the success of irregular & jury-rigged drone weapons by UKR will give everyone else things to learn? Probably, also yes. They've shown in particular how effectively consumer-grade drones can be weaponized and used, although that is likely something the US is going to be concerned with fighting against than doing itself, because it's a good asymmetrical warfare strategy. The US in general uses a lot of large, relatively expensive and powerful long-range drones with a high capabilities, as well as more advanced role-specific smaller recon drones, as well as a variety of loitering munitions. It's also working on things like drone swarms, drone wingmen for aviators, etc. Whether it works inside our doctrine to use the UKR's style is something I'm not qualified to answer, but obviously the cases are somewhat different.",False,1680813000.0,t3_12d8g9e,t1_jf85jea,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

The opposite. Artillery operators are trained to attack a grid coordinate. 

Ex: Artillery is commanded to attack 4QFJ12345678 (which is on the Artillery commander's map). Artillery fires off a test shot, it lands at 4QFJ12345679. Spotter tells artillery where the shell landed, and then Artillery corrects. Artillery begins fire for effect (keep firing until the spotter says stop).

---------

So you can see, given the USA's way of describing locations / artillery commands, its the drone operator who has to be trained on spotting. The Artillery guy just points the gun in the right direction.

It doesn't matter if the spotter is a drone, a commando, or some grunt in the field. Its all ""please fire on location X"" kind of communications.

-------

So you can see, the only thing you need to train an artillery operator on is how to read a map, and how to point the gun. And... all the math involved in that (how much power to put into the gun, the angle / height, wind correction... yeah...). A lot of that is computerized now though, I'm not 100% sure if the Ukrainians are getting computers or not (GPS + artillery grid location + computer to calculate everything for you is a thing these days.

First: note that Drone operators seem to be appearing in Platoon level (ie: groups of 50). That's really the crazy thing about drones, they're cheap enough to be given to such a small unit on a regular basis. A lot of these other effects going on with drones have been part of war for a long time and aren't really game changers.

Second: Note that artillery is attached at the Brigade level (ie: groups of 5000). These are big guns, and all the ~4000+ other soldiers ""share"" the artillery, if that makes any sense. Note that if a platoon needs indirect-fire support, they'll have a mortar team that does a similar job (mortar is cheaper and attached to the platoon... at least ""light mortar"" teams. Heavier mortar teams can be company or Battalion level: or the ~200 to ~1000 troop levels)

Third: note that artillery spotters have been a thing since WW2 if not earlier. We just augment them today (and in this war) with drones.

Fourth: This is all called ""indirect fire"", which is basically pointing your gun into the air and trying to ""lob"" a bomb at the enemy. You can't see where you're shooting, so you rely upon team-mates to call back and correct you. Platoons (50 people), Companies (200 people), Brigades (1000 people), and Battalions (5000 people) all conduct indirect-fire missions, and all can be aided by drones today. But even before the age of drones, platoons would work as a team to support their mortar teams in WW2. All of this is very old concepts in combat.

--------

When you have a gun that can accurately fire bombs that kill enemies within 100m of those bombs landing, and that gun can fire 20km accurately, those guns support literally thousands of frontline soldiers.

IIRC, they do attach some drone operators to the artillery itself too, but I'd imagine that the bulk of the artillery jobs are coming in as fire-support for the people fighting on the front lines (ie: the platoons / groups of 50 people who suddenly realize they need help from artillery).

I can imagine that with the right training, an elite squad (~4 people) could all be trained in the radio-procedure to call in artillery, even without a drone.",1680816300.0,1680814393.0,t3_12d8g9e,t1_jf8ev0l,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Anyway, good job on quoting. Something tells me your Russian is a bit rusty, since it says ""in American English"". The link at the end leads to an article from a BBC reporter, that explains why the word ""coloured"" is considered offensive in anglophonic countries, most importantly in US.

Here's a paragraph that comes next after yours:

>**В других странах мира и в других диалектах английского этот термин может иметь другое значение** ; например, в ЮАР «цветные» относятся к нескольким мультирасовым этническим группам и иногда применяются к другим группам в Южной Африке, таким как бастеры Намибии

Poland and Romania handles depot level maintenance that Ukrainians cannot do, because they don't have the equipment and techs familiar with the electronics for it and their factories and power facilities are getting bombed.

Tanks to Jets is more than an order of magnitude leap in logistics.

Вот когда придумают другой приемлемый термин в русском языке для описания POC - тогда можно отказаться от «цветных», а пока лишь так. Но что-то мне подсказывает, что не будет такого, так как смысла в этом нет.
