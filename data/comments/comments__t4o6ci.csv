* Russia started an illegal invasion under the bullshit pretexts of ""de-nazifying"" and ""demilitarizing"" a country with a Jewish leader whose family suffered from the Holocaust. (Edit: As the Russians continue to broadcast their ""de-nazification"" propaganda across the world, they seem to be omitting the fact that they've already partially destroyed an Ukranian Holocaust Museum.)
* Russia has been underperforming when it comes to their military objectives - the intelligence community seems to unanimously agree on this.
* Economic sanctions have decimated the Russian currency and economy within days, and it looks like more sanctions are going to appear in the following days all around the world. The Russian stock market has not been allowed to open for multiple days, foreign interests across the world are planning to heavily divest, and the ruple has depreciated by quite a bit.
* More and more Russian oligarchs and citizens are starting to speak out against this invasion, but more and more arrests seem to be happening within Russia by the day.
* China, India, and UAE seem to be the only UN Security Council countries refusing to condemn this invasion, and in some cases these countries have been providing tacit avenues for the Russia to mitigate the effects of these sanctions (e.g. China recently signed some pretty large energy deals with Russia), while in other cases their banks seem to be sanctioning Russian assets in line with Western banks (e.g. Singapore branch of a Chinese bank).
* No-fly zones have been set up in large swaths in EU and NA.
* Negotiations for peace have begun, progress on these negotiations is confidential.
* Despite the sanctions and negotiations, it looks like Putin and Russia are determined to ramp up military operations against Ukraine in the following days, although it seems like the much-talked-about convoy is literally running out of fuel, and Russian logistics overall has been a huge mess. (Edit) In general, the Russian military has been underperforming in confounding ways that seems baffling even to the intelligence community.
* Russian war crimes are constantly being reported and documented on film. International Criminal Court has already started launching an investigation into this issue.
* There's been a lot of vocal and material support for Ukraine among EU and NATO member nations, but there are no guarantees of Ukraine joining either of the two within a short timeframe.
* Majority of sources from US and EU intel seem to believe Putin is bluffing when it comes to the nuclear option, although there have been some opinions that Putin could possibly be losing it when it comes to mental stability.
* Direct military intervention on behalf of Ukraine does not seem likely from any nation thus far, but Ukraine has been receiving substantial amounts of military and humanitarian aid on a daily basis, including lethal weapons like javelins, drones, (edit) and stinger missiles that have wreaked havoc on Russian forces. (Edit) Unfortunately, initial reports of fighter jets being provided to Ukrainians didn't seem to come to fruition.
* Putin and Russia are unlikely to secure any of their main geopolitical goals before the invasion began, so right now it seems to be a matter of stubbornness and face for Putin.
* The heroic resistance of Ukraine's president and people has united the world's liberal alliance to a degree not seen for decades. Just a few years ago Trump - famous Putin supporter elected with the support of Russian cyberattacks and troll farms - was threatening to pull his country out of NATO. Now Biden and his NATO allies have managed to cripple the Russian economy within days without escalating the war through direct military confrontation.
* Russia continues to gaslight and bullshit to unbelievable degrees, and troll farms continue to operate in full force, but at least Western governments and tech companies seem to be aggressively taking them down.

The office of the ICC prosecutor on Monday said it will seek court approval to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine, just days after Russia's invasion of its neighbour.

""We are working with other ICC member states to take this significant action as a result of numerous allegations of the commission of serious international crimes in Ukraine by Russian forces,"" Canada's foreign minister Melanie Joly, said in a statement.

""The ICC has our full support and confidence. We call on Russia to cooperate with the court.""

Japan said Wednesday it would temporarily close its embassy in Kyiv as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine escalates.

I think there is something that many people around the world are missing. There is an implication currently happening with the type of coordination and cooperation the world is experiencing against Russia. While it is awful that we haven't put boots on the ground in Ukraine (for obvious reasons), the actions of NATO, EU, and UN almost as a whole is monumental.

Only 2-3 short years ago the US had a leader who wanted out of NATO and international ties were incredibly fragile. However the actions of one despot brought the world together in a manner not seen since World War 2. Yes it's not perfect and the day is not won. Ukraine is fighting a hard battle and many countries are doing what they can to support them.

But if the best situation happens as a result of this entire horrible conflict not only will we see the potential fall of an Oligarchy, we will see the rise of a new EU/NATO nation (Ukraine), the tightening of ties within the EU and NATO, and the growth of international relations no one has ever seen in their life time. The type of ties and relations our world needs to fight larger looming disasters such as Climate Change.

Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. The US Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.”

The US president detailed economic sanctions, such as the decision to cut off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system and “choking off” Russia’s access to technology that will “sap its economic strength and weaken its military” for years to come.


Biden’s State of the Union speech promised an “unwavering resolve” that “freedom will always triumph over tyranny”.

Read some of the key excerpts below:

Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelenskiy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland ...

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home.

Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did. We prepared extensively and carefully.”

Biden then said the free world will hold the Russian president accountable.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.”

It's in Russia but understandable through auto translate.

some interesting point that seem to not get discussed here.

1. Ukraine soil in late winter and early spring is extremely muddy so it's impossible to drive a tank without road

2.Ukrainian roads do not support the weight of a fuck ton of vehicles, it's also 2-lane so the transportation is extremely slow, now if they hit landmine or out of fuel, the whole line stop, it's disaster

There's also a lot of good point but I'm not a good writer if you are interested please check the thread.

Most factions are based on if you worked together in an organization/city. For example, there is a St. Petersburg faction in Putin's ruling party, who all worked in St. Petersburg together and look out for each other.

Granted, all the factions swear their loyalty to Putin, but like anything with humans, it is hard to believe that 100% stay in line and agree with every idea he has. In fact, there is some proof of this.

Going back to the St. Petersburg group, there is a man named Sergei Ivanov who is in that faction. He was Putin's Chief of Staff until 2016, where he was dismissed and transfered to a nothing role as ""envoy to environment"". The cause of this was supposedly his miscalculation in foreign affairs. 

Another man of the Petersburg group is Sergey Chemezov, who has made donations to the Putin-opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta (which has denounced the war). This could be a state-operated opposition newspaper, but it could be a sign of dissent by Putin's officials.

Whatever is the case, there is bad feelings and power grabs within Putin's political body. And more importantly, there is a heavy experience of espionage and assassination in Putin's most trusted officials.

Putin's officials, or ""strongmen"" as they are usually called, serve Russia first and Putin second. They were serving Russia long before Putin came to power, and will make sure Putin does not go ""unhinged"". 

Some are Putin fanatics, yes, but there are people like Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB (KGB replacement organization to sum up simply). He is reported to be a calculating, logical, and efficient man. He is not glory-seeking typical of a politician, he has remained in the same position for over 14 years and is shy in front of the camera. In fact, he was the man looking openly nervous on television a few days ago.

Do not confuse Russia for a beehive full of mindless bees led by the Queen Putin.

Putin needs to get suicided, as do a lot of people around him, and there's a reason their army has a reputation for being a walking war crime, but so many of them are just kids. More than that, they are brainwashed kids who are being dragged into a war they barely even understand, that will only hurt their people in the long run, knowing the price they'll pay for deserting and the potential danger they are putting their families in.

I'm glad Ukrainians are protecting their soil and putting up the amazing resistance they are, but so much of this is legitimately heartbreaking and so many people deserved better. And while the bulk of my sympathy goes to Ukraine since they're the ones getting invaded, I can't help but have some sympathy for the russian kids who got dragged into this and stand to gain literally nothing from this, all for the sake of one man's ego.

Idk i guess the older I get the more I realize how senseless war is.

There is also no clear timeline for resolution so everything is in Flux for Russian citizens who unfortunately did not wish for this. Will they aim their discontent and despite where it belongs or will they too just become casualties in this war? Will it be enough to overthrow? 

I realize that it's nowhere near apples to apples comparing the two countries as they are so different. The reason I ask, is would we view an economic attack of similar caliber as an act of war if it led to riots and unrest. I would think yes, regardless of who started it.

Their goal seems obvious then: to restore Russian glory and make their impact on history by expansion (invading Ukraine). They want to see the Russia of old that was a world power, not the Russia of now that is weak.

If Ukraine falls, the question is how far will they go. Expand to former USSR territory or even further? Only Putin and his closest advisors know. 

I'm guessing they are using Ukraine as a litmus test for how much NATO will let them get away with. They most certainly were not expecting a drawn out conflict, made obvious by their military strategy of wanting to take Kiev quick and as bloodless as possible.

They were also not expecting such severe economic sanctions. NATO has shown them enough strength that I doubt Russia ever goes beyond Ukraine. 

As much as Russia talks about nukes, Putin and his inner council's fascination and fanaticism towards their country would not let them risk nuclear war and Russia's destruction. Threatening nukes is clearly a strategic move to not have NATO enter the war, Putin is not ""crazy"" or ""diseased"", he is the same Putin who is using a fear mongering strategy against NATO, because he knows Russia cannot defeat the West.

Why are people thinking the man sleeping in a gold canopy double king bed is going to change his mind because the people he has already been starving are going to starve more?

Difficulty banking and the inconvenience of not doing business as usual is not the same as being destitute, having to hide in a bomb shelter or having your child with a heart disease be placed in the basement of the hospital.

I really think Americans are believing that Putin did not prepare his oligarchs for this and thinking at some point he will give a damn about his people.

In 2 days, millions of Ukrainians are going to start starving. Millions of Ukrainians are going to die of lack of access to their daily medications, nevermind Covid still be very real and alive.

What indicator will be the one to convince people the sanctions aren't going to work? Which as long as Putin and his friends are eating, they will not stop him.

I think our best bet is to campaign to the Russian soldiers. Ask the ones who have turned themselves in what might work. Start handing out pamphlets with support messages from around the world..telling them they can stop and don't have to die. Fly a sign telling them to lay their arms down and the **world** will think of you as heroes. Think about your kids, etc. Play videos of the death and murders on every corner of the streets. With messages that they don't have to do this. Promise them calls home and use the surrendered soldiers to recruit the others. Maybe they are doing all these things already.

Totally blitz trying to get the soldiers to defect. Unfortunately, without western military intervention, millions of Ukrainians are about to starve, die from bombs or not having access to necessary medication. They are about to run out of fuel. This war needs to end yesterday and sanctions are not going to do it before the millions start dying.

I think the world should campaign the Russian soldiers. Show them compassion and that it is not their fault and not their fight. We will take care of them. The Ukrainian government is already offering $48k in Rubles and amnesty to surrender, that is amazing.

They have to kill 10s of thousands of people before the invasion army needs to be pulled out. That is going to take some time.

The difference in Russia is that Russia has been non-stop humiliated on the world scene pretty much since Chernobyl. Much of this humiliation was their own doing, and Ukraine is only adding to it. I think the biggest mistake that the West made was not extending an open hand to Russia after the fall of communism. That left a vacuum for somebody like Putin to step right into.

The situation now is obviously untenable. Maybe they win ukraine, and then what? Putin is not going to live forever. The West needs to start planning for when Putin dies, and try to fix the mistakes of the past. Work to draw Russia into the West and make it a force for good in the world.

They may indeed capture most or all of Ukraine.  But at an ***immense*** cost in blood, hardware and resources... all of which they will not be able to replace due to the strangling sanctions.  Next, even if they capture Ukraine, they will never be able to subdue it or to keep it.  I would even wonder whether they'd even be able to maintain the borders and prevent the continual resupply from Europe to the Ukrainian insurgents.

In short, there will be a time in the future (although maybe further than we'd like) that Russia will be chased out of Ukraine.  And, for Russia, there's a lot more they could lose.  The entire country could disintegrate.  Beyond that, their actions are likely to *increase* NATO expansion, not halt or reverse it.

I think some cautious optimism is certainly in order, but it's also important to not lose ourselves in the prospects of russian defeat that we get dejected and give up, should Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and the other major cities of Ukraine fall, and a puppet government get installed.

Since a lot of that wealth is tied to the government and to the armed forces, they reached a new status quo under sanctions.

I don't necessarily disagree that we should have done more initially, but Biden's refusal to intervene militarily is actually pretty reflective of the general US population's attitude towards this issue (as well as most of the west honestly).

I think we should have intervened militarily at the beginning of this whole thing back in late January, but it's a bit too late now imo, if we wanted to intervene militarily we should have done so at the start, not after Putin all but alluded to using nukes if we do. Thing is if we had done so \[intervene before onset of hostilities\], you'd probably see riots in the streets.

My opinion is still a bit hawkish on this to be honest, but I think that this is very much the minority opinion.

Secondly, if you’re a person who has never bothered to post shit about refugees or children being bombed until you could virtue signal on the internet that you’re “woke” and special for caring about it, shut the fuck up.

 >The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an international treaty that prohibits all use, transfer, production, and stockpiling of cluster bombs, a type of explosive weapon which scatters submunitions (""bomblets"") over an area. Additionally, the Convention establishes a framework to support victim assistance, clearance of contaminated sites, risk reduction education, and stockpile destruction. The convention was adopted on 30 May 2008 in Dublin, and was opened for signature on 3 December 2008 in Oslo. It entered into force on 1 August 2010, six months after it was ratified by 30 states.

 >National missile defense (NMD) is a generic term for a type of missile defense intended to shield an entire country against incoming missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) or other ballistic missiles. This is also used to refer to the American nationwide antimissile program the United States has had in development since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities. This article focuses mainly on this system and a brief history of earlier systems which led to it.

So you can miss me with all that virtue signaling BS.

There are 4 nuclear plants across Ukraine. The Russian Air force aimed and missed hitting the damm of the Denieper River, which would have resulted in a million Ukrainians dying. Luckily, this time the Ukrainian air force intercepted. But what happens when they aren't able to? And what about Ukraine's nuclear plants? The West is terrified of the remote idea of Putin intentionally using nuclear weapons, meanwhile Ukrainians are terrified one of the Russian missiles might accidentally hit a nuclear plant.

Y'all just don't get it. And it seems you won't until it is **VERY** **SUPER** **DUPER** bad.

Welp, the Executive Director of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre said today that in 2 days, millions of Ukrainians are going to start starving.

If the West deploys a nuke however, then its game over. The only people who can stop this relentless slaughter are Russian soldiers and people. They need to stop making statements and just take up weapons. Ukraine did in 2014, they can do it now. The first thing would be to take government buildings (Putin isn't there so the most elite of the elite defense that would be willing to kill civilians with no remorse isn't there) like the Kremlin that are of high cultural value that Putin wouldn't feel comfortable simply blowing up. The next would be to take radio/broadcast stations to spread the message internally, physical control of information infrastructure is important.

If there's anything to be learned from what happened in Canada with the truckers is that peaceful protest (note I didn't say lawful) is literally pointless unless the government happens to agree with the minority view already being held. They will just wait, not acknowledge, and disperse/destroy.

Putin will just straight up wipe lesser known villages off of the face of the Earth in this war, and major cities will be turned into rubble.
