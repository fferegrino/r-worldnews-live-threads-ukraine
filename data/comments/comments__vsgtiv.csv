A long-delayed gas pipeline between Greece and Bulgaria aimed at helping Sofia cut its reliance on Russian gas has been completed and can start commercial operations this month, according to Greece’s energy minister.

The Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB), which has hit several administrative hurdles in recent years, is important for the energy security of Bulgaria, which has been cut off Russian gas for refusing to pay in roubles following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The 220 million euros ($226m) pipeline will carry gas from the northern Greek city of Komotini to Stara Zagora in Bulgaria and be linked to another pipeline carrying Azeri gas.

“If customers do not store [gas] then the capacity must be handed over to others. It is critical infrastructure. We need it now in such a crisis. That is exactly what is happening now in the case of Gazprom and its storage at Haidach,” Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler told a news conference, adding that gas regulator e-Control had started the process of ejecting Gazprom.

Day 133 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they didn’t forget their missiles either; they launched them at about 1:10am this time. But this time something pretty hysterical happened, in total there were 6 missiles, two of them made it through and landed in Kharkiv, three were most likely intercepted, as no explosions were reported anywhere.

The best part is what happened to the last missile. People from Belgorod were filming their Iskanders flying towards Kharkiv, as they always do, but this time something didn’t go as planned for them. One of the missiles launched, flew a bit into the air, then it spiraled in place and fell down back at them. People reported that it fell in the Novaya Nelidovka, which is about 15km away from downtown Belgorod.

People also reported that multiple fires started, with photos as well, this is so fucking funny. Russians really know how to make us laugh. They were always talking about how we are bombing ourselves, with no proof whatsoever, and now they are literally bombing Belgorod themselves, with video proof, recorded by the people living in Belgorod, fucking lmao. Now we can officially say that Russia is bombing itself.

This really lifted up our spirits, but there is also some bad news from yesterday’s missile strike.

👉 In the north near Kharkiv no substantive action was reported. 

👉 In the east,  no substantive changes was reported.

👉 In the south, no substantive changes were reported.

👉 Of course all those ""no substantive changes"" include Ukraine taking some small town composed of three shacks and a barn, and russia doing the same, or someone attacking something and getting nowhere.  But the fact of the matter is that with Ukraine setting up its defenses after the retreat, and russia busy looting washing machines in its new captured territory, nobody was very active today.  The rest of the news was similarly sparse.

👉 The UK's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is having some political problems at the moment and so has donated 10 units of self-propelled artillery to Ukraine.  

👉 Ukraine continued its goal of eliminating [all the russian ammo dumps](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1544495879884886017.html).  Short analysis thread for those wondering about the impact of it all.

👉 DefMon, an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) source I follow, [mused that the Ukraine](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1544365692056657922) attacks around Kherson aren't meant to liberate Kherson but to draw ~~Ukraine~~ russia away from the real objective in Zaporizhzhia, the area north of Mariupol.  This is something to put a pin in and see if it pans out.

👉 Yesterday, in my conclusion I posted Ukraine was favored to recover its 2014 borders, many took this to mean Crimea and Donbas.  I should have stated pre-invasion 2022 borders since those are the borders that have been commented on and this change has been made.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has no clear war objectives and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: a draw that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line (many who have been trained overseas, Britain is currently taking on 1,000 Ukraine draftees a day into basic western training).",False,1657080127.0,t3_vsgtiv,t3_vsgtiv,,0,104,0,104,2,0,

To me, Michelle’s tweets always seemed strange, kind of “off,” if you will. As if someone is just LARPing in order to grift. 

When I expressed skepticism early on in the war, I kindly told her it’d be nice if someone reputable on Twitter could vouch for her. She did not respond. A couple of randos replied that someone did verify she is legit but the randos provided no evidence to substantiate that. 

Anyway, here’s a very watered-down synopsis of her Twitter account (though I suggest browsing her profile if you have time; she doesn’t have a ton of tweets): 

Early on, Michelle talked about how harrowing it was helping people around Mariupol despite the risks, accepting her fate should the worst happen. Eventually she says her and some others are about to be captured by Russian forces. Not long after, a “friend” named Emma takes over her account to give updates, stating Michelle was indeed captured. 

A prisoner swap eventually occurs and Michelle is recovering in a hospital. Michelle says while in captivity she was shot, starved, denied water for days on end, interrogated for hours, and given only two hours of sleep a night. She Tweets she’s going to write a book about her experiences. 

*Weeks* later, she already self-publishes a 34-page “book” and sells it on Amazon for $19.40, throwing out a tweet with links for people to buy a copy. 

Anyone on Twitter who questions her about verifying her identity and about the price and length of the book gets blocked. She also recently took down the one selfie I’ve ever seen her post but I saw it before she deleted the tweet. It was low quality and oddly cropped. 

I want her story to be legit but it strongly comes across as a bizarre long-term LARP that’s turning into grift. She only has 3800 followers but it’s the principle of the matter.

>US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the upcoming G20 foreign ministers meeting in Bali is not a time for business as usual with Russia due to the Ukraine war.  

>Before the Russian invasion, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would historically meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of major events, but the top US diplomat is not planning to have a one-on-one meeting with his Russian counterpart in Bali. 

>“The time is not right for the Secretary to engage with Foreign Minister Lavrov. You should not expect a bilateral engagement with Foreign Minister Lavrov on this visit,” Price said on a call with reporters Tuesday.

>“We would like to see the Russians be serious about diplomacy. We have not seen that yet.

>""The only thing we have seen emanate from Moscow is more brutality and aggression against the people and country of Ukraine.""

>A US official familiar with the matter said Blinken plans to avoid appearing in any official group photos with Lavrov during the meeting.

Currently, President Biden has ~13 billion to dole out and that has a to last until around October -- possibly November.   He is supplanting his supply donations by using his presidential drawdown authority so you'll see something like 700 Million plus another 300 Million in drawdown authority.

These funds are from the $40 billion in aid passed by the congress.  Not all of that aid is military.  Some of it goes to just keeping Ukraine's economy running.  Here's a [good graphic of where it all goes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXAkOnvXgAYtIpg?format=jpg&name=large)...",False,1657141208.0,t3_vsgtiv,t1_if4bde3,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

So you will only see items from the program delivered when there are orders made and companies have had a chance to actually produce it. So it's hard to say how long that takes of course because that depends on what it is and how fast they can spool up production.

The other people responding don't seem to get that the difference between lend/lease and previous aid is that ""draw downs"" from existing US stockpiles have a limit set that the president can not go over without further approval from Congress and the Senate. That limit was increased greatly as part of the overall $40 billion in aid that has been approved but lend/lease is aid that can be given on top of that and only needs presidential approval, it has *no limit.* Sure it'll take longer because it has to be manufactured but it is still likely that a large amount of aid will be given over time. It might take weeks, months or even years to get there but it will be incredibly valuable in supporting Ukraine long term as they can be supplied with any newly manufactured item and pay for it later.

And we might never even be told about contracts that are issued just like the DoD has repeatedly said they do not list all aid given to Ukraine. For instance rockets for HIMARS are currently being given from existing US stockpiles but if the manufacturer can increase production and start delivering say 4,000 a month from November onwards there is probably no reason to let Russia know that so it never gets announced. Now that example might not be possible but everyone is looking at how many of certain things can be produced now and assuming none of it can be increased. Yes some things might have production bottle necks but other areas might be able to vastly increase production. There is no way we can know where those opportunities in the industry will be and they probably won't tell us about a lot of it.

Despite how it is such an absolutely minor place (not even a real fort like Fort Ross;  it's just an open place with a rock wall) Russian officials have been lobbying to reject the name change.

This is an insanely dangerous line of thinking. I get maintenance in the Russian army is obviously poor due to corruption, training and supply issues but Russia has a very successful space program, ballistic missiles are essentially the same thing. And despite the obvious maintenance problems of the Russian army most of their shells still go boom and most of their vehicles still go vroom. Their planes fly, their rockets are still going to space. You can not base your strategy on hoping that the other sides nukes and missiles won't work, doubly so when they have [the worlds largest nuclear arsenal which Russia does.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nuclear-weapons-by-country)

While I am sure the number of active warheads is inflated how many have to work? When they have sent several successful payloads into orbit during this war how many of their ballistic missiles will function just fine as well? Remember you don't need that many missiles launched at a NATO country to provoke a nuclear response from them, even one might do it. If the US for instance see missiles incoming they will want to launch to ensure a response from their ground based assets. Even countries that only have submarine based nuclear deterrents like the UK will want to launch as soon as possible to try and prevent further Russian launches.

You can not base your strategy on hoping that the other sides nukes and missiles won't work when even a handful of them working could lead easily lead to tens of millions of dead people, not to mention injuries to survivors on an unimaginable scale.

I want Ukraine to win and I think they can but at no point will any of the countries giving them military aid take any actions based on the premise that Russia's nuclear deterrent will not function at all, to do so would be an insane risk that you simply can not take and based on premise that is probably not true.",False,1657154060.0,t3_vsgtiv,t1_if52b7i,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

2017: President Trump may have been involved with a change to the Republican Party campaign platform last year that watered down support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine, according to new information from someone who was involved.

Diana Denman, a Republican delegate who supported arming U.S. allies in Ukraine, has told people that Trump aide J.D. Gordon said at the Republican Convention in 2016 that Trump directed him to support weakening that position in the official platform.

Ultimately, the softer position was adopted.


https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568310790/2016-rnc-delegate-trump-directed-change-to-party-platform-on-ukraine-support


In 2016, as Trump claimed the Republican nomination for president, the GOP originally wrote a platform that was to call for providing Ukraine with weapons in addition to the substantial nonlethal aid the U.S. already provides, news outlets reported at the time. After Trump surrogates reportedly intervened, the final passage supported ""providing appropriate assistance"" to Ukraine, but didn't mention providing arms to the government in Kiev, the Los Angeles Times reported. PolitiFact found there was evidence that Trump’s campaign was involved in making the change.

In 2022, Trump praised Putin, at least tactically, for his invasion of Ukraine. He said:

""I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper.… That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace, all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.""

While demand nationwide, on the whole, may be way down, this is disproportionately seen in smaller cities and suburbs. Most of those schools couldn't even afford to hire native speakers anyway, or if they did it was folk from English-speaking African countries like Kenya or Nigeria. Those suffered a lot even after 2014 but Covid was the death of them. 

I was always based at schools in the very centre of Petersburg though, and with other schools closing we've been picking up students from them. I'd say demand for classes has dropped but not worryingly so yet. The main thing we are losing now is corporate clients as they are all fleeing overseas. 

Given that Petersburg is a relatively wealthy city and the sanctions aren't biting us all that much yet, and given the prevailing attitude (in my experience) which is a naive hope that all this will just be over soon, it's mostly business as usual. 

As for teachers coming over, yes there are some wack jobs and one of my schools recently fired an American teacher who was drawing Z symbols on his whiteboard every lesson. So there is that. The couple of new guys I've met so far seem pretty normal though. One of them (a British guy) is just a diehard fan of Russian literature and has a dream to read the classics in their native language. Another is a Hungarian-Anerican who has a Russian wife and lives here on residency. 

All in all, of course, the bosses of the schools are concerned and business is not as healthy as it used to be. And the reality is that it will not get better. As prices keep going up, demand will inevitably go down. I'm glad our schools are actually giving us pay rises to match inflation and doing their best to keep us here, but there's a reason the teachers in my circle are all talking about trying to find their way out. It's sad. This city has really been a home to me for ten years. Having moved around a lot as a kid and finding my home country too difficult and expensive to live in, Saint Petersburg has given me everything I ever wanted in life and for a low price.

I think it was an open question how durable Zelensky's coalition actually was. He was walking a political tightrope as an alternative to the divisive regional and cultural politics of Yanukovych and Poroshenko.

What look like very impressive gains of two cities and flanking maneuvers from the north through Izyum and from the south through Popasna are in reality taking a very small bit of Ukraine. And that's with Russia massing most of its forces in that one small area. Meanwhile in the last two months they've lost more ground than that around Kharkiv and Kherson. Sure the ground Ukraine has gained is composed of smaller towns and villages than Severdonetsk and Lysychansk but during the war Russia has mostly only taken smaller towns and villages.

Severdonetsk and Lysychansk are the 3rd and 4th largest cities they've managed to take in Ukraine. That's right in a country of 44 million people after 4 months of bloody fighting they have managed to take a grand total of 3 cities with a prewar population of over 100,000, those being Kherson, Mariupol and Severdonetsk. Lysychansk's prewar population is even less than those three. Izyum is smaller still which I think is the 5th largest city they've taken. They didn't even come close to taking Kyiv and they look just as unlikely to seriously threaten Kharkiv with anything but terror attacks.

And although obviously unfortunate Ukraine was doing alright economically before the most recent invasion after having lost far bigger cities to the Russians in 2014. It's a blow but even if they lost the rest of Donbass, which is by no means a certainty, they will still have access to the sea and would still be ok in terms of rebuilding an economy after the war.

The Russians have some momentum by piling most of the resources in one area and giving up ground in others and even after this is nowhere close to taking the rest of the Donbass let alone making gains anywhere else. Yes they've taken the rest of Luhansk oblast at great cost, both in men and in losing ground elsewhere. It took the Russians 3 months to completely take Mariupol. It just took them two months to take Severdonetsk and Lysychansk.

How long will it take them to take Kramatorsk and Slovyansk? Do they even still have the combat capability to do so without stopping to rest their forces? How much more ground do they lose elsewhere in Ukraine to do so? The Russian land bridge to Crimea, ostensibly one of the major strategic goals of the invasion, is now increasingly under threat because the Russians can not push in the east and maintain their southern and northern fronts at the same time, they don't have the manpower. Sure taking what they've taken in the east is some momentum I guess but they seem to be trading it for losses elsewhere. Plus Ukraine withdrew from those cities to prevent encirclement and being cut off, the Russians do not have Kramatorsk and Slovyansk surrounded and the Ukrainian's have fortified both cities.

I never claimed this. I said a lot has changed *since 2014*, which is objectively true.

If what you're saying is true, western powers would not be giving Ukraine lethal weapons, just like in 2014 when western powers refused to give Ukraine weapons since the government was too corrupt.

>Do you think Germany is gonna accept Ukraine in NATO?

It's possible after the end of the conflict depending on how this conflict ends. To say nothing will change is naive.

>They still value their aliance with Russia more than Ukraine's safety

They are still buying gas, this is true. But they ended Nordstream 2 and are looking for ways off of Russian gas. I don't think it's correct at all to say Germany values Russia more than Ukraine. Germany values Germany, full stop. Unfortunately for Ukraine, Germany needs LNG, and they are looking for different suppliers. If they didn't value Ukraine, they would not be looking for other suppliers.

>NATO don't reject Ukraine for being corrupt

NATO members explicitly stated that Ukraine was not eligible to join because they were too corrupt.

>it was because they didn't wanted annoy Russia.

I don't buy this at all. NATO did not give a shit about annoying Russia when the Baltic states joined, they didn't give a shit when Poland, Hungary, and Czechia joined, hell they didn't even give a shit when Germany joined, and Russia even protested that!

>How many time before another ukrainian government try to make ammends with Russia again?

Well considering that both Ukraine and Russia are no longer negotiating an end to the war, I'd say a pretty long time.

>There's still a lot of ties between the countries.

Right...just like there are a lot of ties between Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia...

I mean those countries didn't even get into a major conflict with Russia and they completely cut ties with Russia.

I don't think people realize the level of political violence in the country from groups ultra-nationalist groups like Svoboda. 

He was in a very difficult situation. The Ukrainian economy was in shambles and heavily dependent on Russia. I think he genuinely had an interest in integrating more closely with Europe but Russia turned up the economic pressure and the EU and IMF had little interest in softening the blow. Ukraine was on the brink of bankruptcy and would have lost something like 150 billion in trade over 3 years with Russia and the EU wasn't willing to step in with loans. So he made the decision to scrap integration and cut a deal with Moscow. The rest is history as they say. 

Calling Yanukovych a Russian puppet is revisionist history I think. Ukrainian was in a tug of war between Russia and the EU.
