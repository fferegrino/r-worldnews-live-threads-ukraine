Day 181 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was a lot of shelling, much more than usual, and every time they used MLRS to shell us. First shelling was at 1pm. Then it happened again at 8:40pm, then at 10pm, and again at 10:30pm. Half of the time they were targeting my district, so it was very loud here. I don’t know where it was landing exactly, but one time before we thought that the shelling was happening far away from us, just to realize that there is now a crater about 70m away, so sometimes it’s pretty hard to judge the distance by the sound alone.

The missile strike was pretty weird today, apparently it happened twice, but we weren’t aware about one of them. At 11:10pm there was a loud explosion, which a bit later turned out to be a missile that was intercepted by our AA right over Kharkiv, and interceptions are very rare here, so it was a nice surprise. We don’t know where the intercepted missile fell, but a fire started on that location right after. 

Very soon after it was intercepted people started finding fragments of the missile on the streets, though after photos started appearing authorities said to leave them lying where they are. And also to notify the police in the morning about their location, because those fragments are needed to document Russian war crimes, which is why people shouldn’t keep them as trophies. There was also a second missile strike at 12:25am, with just 2 missiles this time. We don’t know what was hit yet either.

They are also a bit more active this night, as they also did missile strikes in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, which is something that hasn’t happened in some time. Not sure if this is all they will do, so far they are not firing too many missiles at us, but there is still the entire day ahead, so they probably will launch some more missiles today.

>Unverifiable sources reported that axis commanders in Ukraine are reporting directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, bypassing both the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov in the chain of command. Independent Russian outlet Vazhnye Istorii or iStories quoted unnamed sources within the Russian General Staff stating that Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has lost Putin’s trust after the initial phase of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that failed despite Shoigu’s assurances of a swift victory.[15] The sources claimed that Putin now bypasses Shoigu and interacts directly with Commander of Central Military District Alexander Lapin who oversees the “central” group of forces in Ukraine, and the Commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces Sergey Surovikin who commands the “southern” group of forces. ISW cannot independently verify the validity of this report, but if the report is true, it indicates that Putin is also bypassing Gerasimov.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 23 August 2022
 

- Over the weekend, Russia probably started moving barges into position to construct a substantial floating bridge over the Dnipro river, immediately beside the damaged Antonivsky road bridge. The crossing is the key link between Russian-occupied Kherson and the east.

- For several weeks, Russian forces and local civilians have relied on a ferry crossing of the waterway. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared to the ferry.

- A floating bridge would likely still be vulnerable to Ukrainian offensive action.

>
>It’s hard to know the truth in a case as bizarre as this one. But there is one reliable rule to go by: Don’t believe whatever the Kremlin says. A few things to keep in mind as we try to sort out what happened:
>
>First, Dugin is far less important than some people are suggesting. He’s not “Putin’s brain.” There is no evidence that Dugin has ever met Putin in person, much less offered him regular advice, and I am yet to be convinced that the Russian president spends his leisure time poring over turgid political tracts. Putin didn’t have to read Dugin’s writings to come up with plans to annex Crimea or undermine Ukrainian statehood — both of those ideas have long been widespread among certain members of the Russian elite. Putin has his own brain.
>
>Second, killing Dugin will likely have zero direct effect on Russia’s war against Ukraine. Staging such an attack in Putin’s backyard might boost Ukrainian morale a bit. But that seems like a lot of risk for the sake of eliminating someone who plays no actual role in the conduct of the war. Dugin, it is worth noting, has no government position; his only function is as a propagandist — and Russia is oversupplied with those. (Both Dugin and his daughter have indulged in genocidal rhetoric against Ukrainians — which, sadly, places them solidly in the mainstream of Russian public discourse today.)
>
>And that brings us to the most important point — that we shouldn’t take Kremlin statements at face value. Russia is a paranoid dictatorship prosecuting one of the most brazen acts of international aggression in decades. In 2014, Putin wholeheartedly denied that his troops were seizing control of Crimea until the operation was finished; today, six months after the start of the invasion, it remains a crime to state the truth that Russia is waging “war” in Ukraine. Dictatorships, by their nature, do not deal in truths. Any information released by the Russian authorities should be treated less as a description of reality than as a political tool.
>
>Note that within hours of Daria Dugina’s killing, the Russian security service, the FSB, claimed that it had already identified the culprit: a Ukrainian woman who somehow managed to get away to Estonia (some 500 miles away) after planting the bomb. The agency didn’t explain why the suspect, identified as Natalya Vovk, chose to carry out the operation in the company of her 12-year-old daughter — highly unusual tradecraft, to say the least. (The FSB also claims to have acquired an ID card showing Vovk’s membership in a Ukrainian nationalist organization.)
>
>The Russian state — under Putin and before him — has a long history of manufacturing or manipulating events to suit its agenda. In 1999, then-Prime Minister Putin notoriously seized upon a series of bloody terrorist bombings in Moscow and the heartland to launch a new war against the rebellious Chechens, whom he blamed for the attacks; his hard-line response boosted his own power and his subsequent revival of the police state. To this day, however, the FSB has failed to provide an adequate explanation for a bomb that was discovered to have been planted by its own operatives. (The security service dismissed the incident as part of a “training exercise.”) We may never know the full truth.
>
>Could Russians have carried out the attack on Dugin? A mob hit of some kind, perhaps? There is another possibility: Fearing a public backlash, Putin has so far notably hesitated to declare a general mobilization that might give Russia an even greater advantage in Ukraine. A gruesome attack on a prominent “patriot” right in the suburbs of the capital could be just the thing to whip up flagging public enthusiasm for a bloody conflict that has already dragged on for much longer than anyone in Russia anticipated.
>
>We may learn more in the days to come. But remember: The Kremlin’s explanations can’t be trusted.

Ukraine prepared excellent for invasion since 2014 and subsequent reforms, and withstood it with distinction. But are they yet an offensive force? Maybe.

If Putin is able to sleep at night, for the horrors his ambition has brought him, he still may be Gaddafi'ed, but the legacy he leaves is a hole where prosperous Russia could have been. There is nothing smart about his ""4-D chess"", not in my definition of smart. The man's a moron inspiring, unsurprisingly, other morons like Slutsky, and these morons each wreak havoc and destruction of scale corresponding to how high they have climbed and how many others they can inspire. They seem unable or unwilling to acknowledge they are repeating classical, historical mistakes, thinking instead of the goal where they can improve on the formula, succeed with the dictatorship alchemy.

The United State's could dump 300 soon to be retired f16s into Ukrainian hands and have the billions of dollars lent to Ukraine go right back into American logistical supply pockets. 

Buttttttt. It's a pickle to just end the war with American air superiority, even if that is with Ukrainian pilot's.

Some countries don't reveal what they're giving at all.

The US has apparently sent hundreds of M113's but didn't talk about it. A few weeks ago they mentioned giving 50 for medical evacuation but in reality they've given far more before that. This is a video from *3 months ago* showing the [Indiana national guard inspecting and testing M113's for shipment to Ukraine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txd8Nmwg5Sc) Around this time there were rumors from US ports of loading hundreds of M113's on to ships for transport to Europe. In addition the Netherlands and Australia has mentioned they sent M113 variants as well. I would bet many more countries have supplied them and just didn't mention it. There are widespread rumors of columns of them moving about Ukraine as well but few videos which seems like the product of decent operational security.

M113's are old sure but provide about the same level of protection as the various BMP and BMD series Russian armored vehicles Ukraine had before the war. Some of the upgraded variants they've received are even better protected. Most M113's only mount a .50 caliber machine gun but there is enough of them in storage to give Ukraine a substantial amount of them and loads of spare parts floating around, they produced over 80,000 of them. That means there are also a hell of lot of ex M113 maintainers from armies around the world that might accept a juicy contact to fix M113's in Poland while training Ukrainian's how to do it as well. They're already doing that with M777 howitzers, expect the same for a lot of the heavy equipment that has been donated. And although the variants do differ at least there is some commonality to make it a little easier on Ukrainian mechanics as they learn to maintain them.

As for tanks Ukraine has been sucking out every last T-72 they can beg, borrow or steal from other Eastern European countries as there were a decent number of them left in their inventories and at least they're a known quantity they know how to fix and operate. As those run out I am sure that Ukraine's main supporters are already looking ahead to what type of tank might make sense for Ukraine however there doesn't seem to be as much of clear choice like there was for an armored personal carrier. Inventory of tanks like Leo 2's, Challengers, LeClercs aren't big enough that anyone can give Ukraine hundreds of them. Spare parts and expertise for all of those are not that common. The US has a ton of Abrams in storage but it's turbine engine eats a ton of fuel and is also a turbine meaning it's a totally different animal for a mechanic used to servicing an internal combustion engine that is in most tanks. It's a great tank but it might not be right for Ukraine.

3. Yes. She was assassinated. These things aren’t spontaneous. Your point?

4. Because Dugin decided to change cars and this likely took planning. Taking out his daughter is preferable to doing nothing and still hurts Dugin.

5. There was no plan, they just missed their target.

I am not sure why you say they will probably be aiming at the frontlines. Big dumb long range missiles are basically made to fire past the frontlines at comparatively more vulnerable command posts, ammo dumps, and logistics stations. That seems like a much more effective way to use expensive equipment like long range missiles.

My guess is that civilians in Kharkiv, Odessa, and Kryvyi Rih are going to have a bad week. My rationale for picking those towns:

* Kharkiv: The retreat from Kharkiv was humiliating for the Russians, so they've been striking it for months in retaliation (and to ""fix"" some UAF troops). A ramping up of strikes there would be somewhat easy for Russia because of the city's proximity to Belgorod.

* Odessa: Something something ""nazi terrorists"", ""blyat the grain deal"", ""for Crimea"".

* Kryvyi Rih: A symbolic choice. Troops and equipment heading towards Kherson seem to pass through here, so the Russians may see it as retribution for the rear strikes they've been dealing with. It is also the hometown of Zelenskyy. Kryvyi Rih has been struck several times, but seems to have been luckier than many other major cities in Central / Eastern Ukraine so far.

I am obviously expecting missiles to strike Kyiv and other cities, but I think they'll probably focus on a handful of more vulnerable targets. Focusing too much on Kyiv would just emphasize their prior failure there.",1661280365.0,1661279925.0,t3_wven5n,t1_ilhidkc,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Now that's either plain idiocy or deliberate scaremongering.

1. The factors driving up electricity prices right now include temporary problems like insufficient water for nuclear power plants that have had to be taken offline.  As the rain comes, that pressure will immediately reverse.

2.  The *rate of increase* is clearly not something that will be sustained.  Increases already have taken into account many of the structural problems (eg curtailment of Russian gas supplies) and while further rises aren't impossible, there is absolutely no reason to think that they will be at the same *rate* as we've witnessed this year.

3.  Say what you will against capitalism, but one benefit it definitely provides is the ability to rapidly adapt to economic shocks.  Sure, high electricity prices may sadly force some businesses that are teetering on the edge of profitability to fall over; but that enables more profitable business models to take their place (eg more energy efficient ones, or ones that source their energy from renewables unaffected by natural gas shortages).

4.  When truly faced with systemic risks such as arose during the credit crunch and COVID, governments have shown that they will step in and meet the costs (basically by pushing it onto future generations; however since all major trading partners are essentially having to do the same, to a large extent it all nets off—consider for example the debts that were incurred to fund WW2: I don't think many could argue that the following generations suffered economically).",False,1661274318.0,t3_wven5n,t1_ilh0mo1,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Either A) they are unusually short on tanks for some other reason or B) they're holding them at least somewhat in reserve.  The latter makes more sense.

For *operational* reasons it's actually *not* a bad idea, turbine concerns be damned--Ukraine operates successfully **captured** turbine T-80s in an entire dedicated unit now.  Turbines are usually IIRC lower maintenance, and **diesel Abrams tanks do exist.**  Furthermore, Ukraine produced, at least before the war, engines with comparable power output in similar volume and weight--the 6TD series has some seriously high-output motors.

2. Kremlin usually don't want people riled up over their assassinations. Here, the violent death of a pretty young lady has a great propaganda value. They have the incentive.
3. Point is that when the parking lot's security cams have been disabled for weeks, it increases the chance of FSB being involved.

6. Dugin being photogenic is not meant as conclusive evidence, but as supporting. It's not impossible but unlikely you get this good footage unless planned.

US has a lot to gain from selling oil and gas to Europe, and aid for Ukraine has bipartisan support.

>My prediction is that by the end of the year, Russia will still hold Krim/Donbas and a few other cities and that referenda will have been passed showing ""citizens want to be Russian.""

Crimea and Donbass maybe, the rest depends only in Ukraines ability to interdict russian supplies and their willingnes to take casualties in direct attacks instead of waiting and letting attrition take its course.

Russia will just ""freeze"" the frontline? Have they told that to Ukraine? What exactly would stop them from HIMARS-ing the russian every night? Some sort of Minsk agreement? Like the previous ones that showed the whole world they only give Russia time to do worse?

That worked in 2015 when Ukraine had its pants down, not today.
Russia lacks the resources and support to maintain this official ""at war but not really"" for ever. 
""No war no peace"" did not work for Trotsky and there is no basis to assume it would work for Putin.

If you think Russia is the only one who thought long and hard and through with this, you must be naive.

Your points in favor of Dugin being involved are pretty weak, for the reasons the guy just above stated.

Like, #4 is at best a guess at a motive. How many trials get a guilty verdict just with motive, even if you proved the motive existed which you haven't in any way? #5 is just silly; all the possible motives on the FSB's side for killing Dugin would just as easily apply to his daughter to a lesser extent, so why not still do it? That could have even been decided ahead of time: if for some reason Dugin isn't in the car go ahead and kill her anyway. It's a pure assumption on your part that taking out half the target if the other half leaves would not be part of the plan, and a silly idea that assassinations are all planned by people with OCD who will definitely call the whole thing off if things don't go perfectly rather than make the decision on the spot to kill half the target if they can.

Your argument that if Dugina was the sole target, Dugin must be in on it or else they'd risk him not switching cars and having to call the whole thing off, makes some sense (though still relies on the assumption that they wouldn't be fine with him dying as well, as one of the potential outcomes.) But, of course, is entirely predicated on the fact that Dugina was the sole target, and your only evidence for that is one quote from Dugin and some weird certainty about how assassins definitely always act.

Edit: just tryna put myself in the shoes of a group of government assassins, if I wanted to kill both of them, and Dugin left the car, I would definitely still blow the vehicle, then have a chat with Dugin at the hospital showing him that the best thing for Russia is for him to go along with it (agreeing with that doesn't require him to be any more of a whackjob than would be required for him to be in on it) and if he disagrees, well then ""the heart attack killed him"" and the end result is the same.

The obvious lack of equipment support from outside of Ukraine, which will significantly decrease over winter when we Europeans are shivering and rolling blackouts. Currently, this is speculation as we haven't had any blackouts yet, but the probability is high that we will. Europe will NOT have the energy to manufacture and provide support and the American governmental will begin to wane with the Mid-term results.

The greatest external support was always predicted to be pre-first-Winter, then countries will become, necessarily, I might add, more inward-facing to deal with 20% inflation and lack of energy.

Don't get me wrong, I hate it, but this is the greatest level of external support we will see and the elevated energy prices to non-EU-countries will continue to bankroll Russia and it's going to be a very cold winter in Europe.

The other factor not being discussed, is that some on Donbas remains populated with UKR-leaning supported but these people will be forced to leave over the winter as district heating systems are now perfect Russian targets. Those areas will be resettled in the Spring with Russian-leaning settlers.

Maybe it's better to ask what I think of those bombings in regards to the current situation, instead of assuming I'm a dumbass? Because if you had, I would have gladly answered that Putin's relationship with power is quite clearly much different now than it was back then. 

Putin's grip on power in those days was far more fragile than it is now. He was basically a nobody that didn't instil all that much confidence in people given the shit sandwich everyone had been eating in the 90s. The bombings make perfect sense in that context because his subsequent war in Chechnya and bromance with Kadyrov coincidentally happened at the same time that oil prices were rising and the economy was strengthening and stabilizing considerably compared to the 90s. The bombings make sense in that context because it helped him gain the trust of the people when everything stabilised afterwards.

If the bombings had continued, or the Chechnya war never ended, or if the oil prices just happened to stay low, Putin would not have lasted much longer. His success and rise to power was as much a lucky alignment of the stars as it was his clever opportunism and playing the KGB games. 

Today is not the same. He has had 20 years in power and his support is largely based in ongoing stability, both politically and economically. Even many of his supporters are willing to admit that he may not be the kindest or most ideal leader, but they appreciate this perception that he keeps nasty things at bay, that he holds Russia together despite the many forces trying to tear it apart, as ridiculous as that sounds. What on earth makes you think bombing apartments now would benefit Putin? 

You think he's going to take the one thing his supporters have left cheering him on for, and destroy it - and for what? He doesn't need to suppress the population or scare them. They're already terrified and the risk of uprising is zero. He can't start killing off his supporters. The only reason I could believe Putin would kill Dugin is if Dugin was making a move to oust him, and that's way more outlandish than a lot of other theories going around. It still doesn't explain a lot of other factors surrounding the hit either.

In the end, there's a lot of stuff going on in the Kremlin we don't know anything about.

With regards to Dugin's involvement we first have to consider the chances of him just ditching his own car to let the daughter drive instead. This does not make him guilty, but it increases the probability.

Next, you got the agents still deciding to go through with killing his daughter instead instead even though it introduces a billion new variables they haven't had time to consider. This is despite the fact that the bomb is in *his* car which he'll be sure to return to. Probability increase again.

Then, they'll have to assume that the man whose daughter they just murdered will do as he's told. Further increased probability of involvement.

While not massive, the photogenic scene is also that. An increase in probability.

Finally, him specifically calling for the sacrifice of daughters to gain the Gods favor in geopolitical glory would be hammered relentlessly as a motive in a trial. Using her death as a chess piece to put blame on Ukraine doesn't make things better.

I will grant that none of these points are irrefutable evidence against him and my ""seems certain"" needs more humility. However, they all add up.

They can invest in the market there, but the bubble burst on that and it's seen as risky. The other big option is real estate. Buying one or more properties to rent or sell later. So that's what people started doing. And construction companies started taking out massive government loans to build   entire cities of investment properties. But the market has become oversaturated and the apartments are sitting empty. But as long as people aren't selling, they still feel like they're investing and the government says they haven't lost value. The problem is the government is giving less loans for new construction.
