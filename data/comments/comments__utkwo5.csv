Day 86 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling continued, but it was a bit quieter overall. It is definitely quieter right now, during the night, than it was yesterday, but we still hear some sounds resembling shelling. While it was pretty quiet in the city for some time, I don’t think shelling of nearby towns/villages ever stopped; they still shell Derhachi, Tsyrkuni and other settlements almost every day. 

People are definitely returning, there’s much more people right now, streets are almost back to their pre-war levels and there’s much more windows lit up in almost every building in the evening. After that shelling on April 23rd a lot of people fled, and most buildings were completely dark with basically no windows lit up, but now they look pretty lively. 

Russians might have retaken Ternova and Rubizhne, but there’s no official confirmation yet. Good news is that our forces crossing the Donets river (most likely somewhere between Staryi and Verkhnii Saltiv) is most likely true, it was even mentioned by Arestovich (though without explicitly stating it), and he said that they were actually surprised by it themselves after witnessing Russian’s failed crossing at Bilohorivka.",False,1653095259.0,t3_utkwo5,t3_utkwo5,,0,120,0,120,1,0,

From CNN's Nadine Schmidt in Berlin

Germany and Qatar on Friday agreed on an energy partnership, which may see Doha start supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Berlin in 2024.

Qatar will become key to Germany's future energy strategy to diversify away from Russian gas, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, addressing a joint press conference with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Berlin.

""The energy security issue plays an important role for us. Germany will develop its infrastructure to be in a position to import liquefied gas by ship,"" Scholz said. 

""It's a big step, and Qatar plays an important role in our strategy,'' the German leader added.

The Qatari emir told journalists at the news conference that he hopes his country will commence to supply liquefied natural gas to Germany in 2024.

Some background: Germany has been under pressure from Ukraine and other nations in Europe to make progress in weaning itself off Russian energy supplies since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, Germany started construction works for its first floating LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven, a city and port located in Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany.

When asked by CNN's Jim Sciutto whether ""Germany fundamentally misread Vladimir Putin"" in past years, here's how Haber responded:

""It is true that for many decades our strategy rested on the fundamental assumption ... that interdependence would produce stability, predictability, and to some extent of a time, even alignment. It was, if you will, our experience with regard to the GDR [the former East Germany] and with reunification and even with regard with the implosion of the Soviet Empire. We now do see that interdependence can actually also produce vulnerability. So this assumption, in effect, has been pulverized.""

Haber also reiterated that the West needs to be united in its messaging against Russian President Vladimir Putin, because ""we know, in effect, probably very little about the inner dynamics of his circle.""

Haber also discussed Germany reducing dependence on Russian energy, saying that the country is working at ""breakneck speed"" and the result will be ""irreversible.""

""We have to reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels as quickly as we possibly can. ... We are now discussing an oil embargo. And Germany is actually pressing for it. There are other options on the table as well, but all of them designed to make sure we are getting out of that dependence. Gas is a more complicated story, because, other than the oil market, it's not a global market. But we are diversifying — Germany is — at breakneck speed. We are ordering big contracts of LNG, we are building LNG facility storage ... And our intention is to get out of Russian gas, let alone oil and coal, as quickly as we possibly can. We need to end that dependence, and it will be irreversible,"" she said.

Germany and Qatar on Friday agreed on an energy partnership that may see Doha start supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Berlin in 2024. Earlier this month, Germany started construction works for its first floating LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven, a city and port located in Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany.

The move is part of a larger effort to flag false information during crises, including wars, plagues and natural disasters. Twitter said it is aiming to amplify credible reports from reliable sources while downplaying and isolating misinformation.

“Around the world, people use Twitter to find reliable information in real time. During periods of crisis — such as situations of armed conflict, public health emergencies, and large-scale natural disasters — access to credible, authoritative information and resources is all the more critical,” Yoel Rother, the company’s head of safety and integrity, said in a news release.

Twitter will hide an offending tweet from search results and its main timeline “as soon as we have evidence that a claim may be misleading,” according to the release. The platform will disable functions that would spread the tweet, including like, retweet and share features. Twitter users can still see the tweet but will be required to click through the warning notice to view the post, the release said.

Twitter will “prioritize” pinning warning notices on “highly visible” tweets and those from “high profile” accounts, including ones run by state-affiliated media outlets and governments, the release said.

The platform said it worked with global experts and human rights organizations to create the policy, which will cover “situations in which there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health, or basic subsistence.” Twitter’s first version of its crisis policy deals with armed conflict in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the platform will update and expand that policy to fit other crises, the release said.

Dear Professor Chomsky,

We are a group of Ukrainian academic economists who were grieved by a series of your recent interviews and commentaries on the Russian war on Ukraine. We believe that your public opinion on this matter is counter-productive to bringing an end to the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine and all the deaths and suffering it has brought into our home country.

Having familiarized ourselves with the body of your interviews on this matter, we noticed several recurring fallacies in your line of argument. In what follows, we wish to point out these patterns to you, alongside with our brief response:

***Pattern #1: Denying Ukraine’s sovereign integrity***

In your interview to Jeremy Scahill at The Intercept from April 14, 2022 you claimed: “The fact of the matter is Crimea is off the table. We may not like it. Crimeans apparently do like it.” We wish to bring to your attention several historical facts:

First, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 has violated the Budapest memorandum (in which it promised to respect and protect Ukrainian borders, including Crimea), the Treaty on Friendship, Partnership and Cooperation (which it signed with Ukraine in 1997 with the same promises), and, according to the order of the UN International Court of Justice, it violated the international law.

Second, “Crimeans” is not an ethnicity or a cohesive group of people – but Crimean Tatars are. These are the indigenous people of Crimea, who were deported by Stalin in 1944 (and were able to come back home only after the USSR fell apart), and were forced to flee again in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea. Of those who stayed, dozens have been persecuted, jailed on false charges and missing, probably dead.

Third, if by ‘liking’ you refer to the outcome of the Crimean “referendum” on March 16, 2014, please note that this “referendum” was held at gunpoint and declared invalid by the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the same time, the majority of voters in Crimea supported Ukraine’s independence in 1991.

***Pattern #2: Treating Ukraine as an American pawn on a geo-political chessboard***

Whether willingly or unwillingly, your interviews insinuate that Ukrainians are fighting with Russians because the U.S. instigated them to do so, that Euromaidan happened because the U.S. tried to detach Ukraine from the Russian sphere of influence, etc. Such an attitude denies the agency of Ukraine and is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians who are risking their lives for the desire to live in a free country. Simply put, have you considered the possibility that Ukrainians would like to detach from the Russian sphere of influence due to a history of genocide, cultural oppression, and constant denial of the right to self-determination?

***Pattern #3. Suggesting that Russia was threatened by NATO***

In your interviews, you are eager to bring up the alleged promise by [US Secretary of State] James Baker and President George H.W. Bush to Gorbachev that, if he agreed to allow a unified Germany to rejoin NATO, the U.S. would ensure that NATO would move ‘not one inch eastward.’ First, please note that the historicity of this promise is highly contested among scholars, although Russia has been active in promoting it. The premise is that NATO’s eastward expansion left Putin with no other choice but to attack. But the reality is different. Eastern European states joined, and Ukraine and Georgia aspired to join NATO, in order to defend themselves from Russian imperialism. They were right in their aspirations, given that Russia did attack Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. Moreover, current requests by Finland and Sweden to join NATO came in direct response to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, consistent with NATO expansion being a consequence of Russian imperialism, and not vice versa.

In addition, we disagree with the notion that sovereign nations shouldn’t be making alliances based on the will of their people because of disputed verbal promises made by James Baker and George H.W. Bush to Gorbachev.

***Pattern #4. Stating that the U.S. isn’t any better than Russia***

While you admittedly call the Russian invasion of Ukraine a “war crime,” it appears to us that you cannot do so without naming in the same breath all of the past atrocities committed by the U.S. abroad (e.g., in Iraq or Afghanistan) and, ultimately, spending most of your time discussing the latter. As economists, we are not in a position to correct your historical metaphors and, needless to say, we condemn the unjustified killings of civilians by any power in the past. However, not bringing Putin up on war crime charges at the International Criminal Court in the Hague just because some past leader did not receive similar treatment would be the wrong conclusion to draw from any historical analogy. In contrast, we argue that prosecuting Putin for the war crimes that are being deliberately committed in Ukraine would set an international precedent for the world leaders attempting to do the same in the future.

***Pattern #5. Whitewashing Putin’s goals for invading Ukraine***

In your interviews, you go to great lengths to rationalize Putin’s goals of “demilitarization” and “neutralization” of Ukraine. Please note that, in his TV address from February 24, 2022, marking the beginning of the war, the verbatim goal declared by Putin for this “military operation” is to “denazify” Ukraine. This concept builds on his long pseudo-historical article from July 2021, denying Ukraine’s existence and claiming that Ukrainians were not a nation. As elaborated in the ‘denazification manual’ published by the Russian official press agency RIA Novosti, a “Nazi” is simply a human being who self-identifies as Ukrainian, the establishment of a Ukrainian state thirty years ago was the “Nazification of Ukraine,” and any attempt to build such a state has to be a “Nazi” act. According to this genocide handbook, denazification implies a military defeat, purging, and population-level “re-education”. ‘Demilitarization’ and ‘neutralization’ imply the same goal – without weapons Ukraine will not be able to defend itself, and Russia will reach its long-term goal of destroying Ukraine.

***Pattern #6. Assuming that Putin is interested in a diplomatic solution***

All of us very much hoped for a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement, which could have saved many human lives. Yet, we find it preposterous how you repeatedly assign the blame for not reaching this settlement to Ukraine (for not offering Putin some “escape hatch”) or the U.S. (for supposedly insisting on the military rather than diplomatic solution) instead of the actual aggressor, who has repeatedly and intentionally bombed civilians, maternity wards, hospitals, and humanitarian corridors during those very “negotiations”. Given the escalatory rhetoric (cited above) of the Russian state media, Russia’s goal is erasure and subjugation of Ukraine, not a “diplomatic solution.”

***Pattern #7. Advocating that yielding to Russian demands is the way to avert the nuclear war***

Since the Russian invasion, Ukraine lives in a constant nuclear threat, not just due to being a prime target for Russian nuclear missiles but also due to the Russian occupation of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.

But what are the alternatives to fighting for freedom? Unconditional surrender and then elimination of Ukrainians off the face of the Earth (see above)? Have you ever wondered why President Zelenskyy, with the overwhelming support of the Ukrainian people, is pleading with Western leaders to provide heavy weapons despite the potential threat of nuclear escalation? The answer to this question is not “Because of Uncle Sam”, but rather due to the fact that Russian war crimes in Bucha and many other Ukrainian cities and villages have shown that living under Russian occupation is a tangible “hell on earth” happening right now, requiring immediate action.

Arguably, any concessions to Russia will not reduce the probability of a nuclear war but lead to escalation. If Ukraine falls, Russia may attack other countries (Moldova, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Finland or Sweden) and can also use its nuclear blackmail to push the rest of Europe into submission. And Russia is not the only nuclear power in the world. Other countries, such as China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are watching. Just imagine what will happen if they learn that nuclear powers can get whatever they want using nuclear blackmail.

Professor Chomsky, we hope you will consider the facts and re-evaluate your conclusions. If you truly value Ukrainian lives as you claim to, we would like to kindly ask you to refrain from adding further fuel to the Russian war machine by spreading views very much akin to Russian propaganda.

Should you wish to engage further on any of the above-mentioned points, we are always open to discussion.

IT management, energy monitoring & control of SCADA via central controllers,
data management, surveillance too? Don't worry we got you covered. You can get more sleep now that you won't have anything to monitor. Hopefully it's not too hot in the Central Bank of Russia.

All of vour systems have been compromised and encrypted with ransomware. We've exfiltrated 380GB worth of your sensitive data and we will be leaking all of it if you do not pay us within 24 hours.

Clearly you think this a game. Turning a blind eye, providing services to the corrupt federation while Ukrainian women & children are being senselessly raped and killed in war that you lied about ""not supporting.”

The war crimes trial of a 21-year-old Russian soldier in Ukraine has been adjourned until Monday.

Vadim Shishimarin appeared before a Kyiv court on Friday for a third day of hearings in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded the country back in February.

I'm sorry and sincerely repent. I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said during Friday's hearing.

A defense lawyer defended Shishimarin's actions saying the soldier ""was not aware of what is going on in Ukraine.""

Shishimarin and other Russian soldiers ""were not aware that actions that will follow will result in mass deaths not only of servicemen, but civilians too,"" the lawyer said.

""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" the lawyer continued.

Some background: The soldier pleaded guilty Wednesday to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in Ukraine’s Sumy region on the fourth day of the war and is facing a life sentence.

Shishimarin told the man's widow on Thursday that he is sorry for killing her husband.

How long has it been since they took Izyum and were definitely going to push from there? Now it's just another exposed thrust, stalled. 

The ""encirclement"" has been scaled down since then to potentially surrounding a single metropolitan area, dramatically smaller than their original goals. Even if they close the entire gap, something that doesn't seem to be happening in the north, they don't automatically destroy the pocket and the remaining Ukrainian defensive line can still adjust to it without collapsing. 

It's something to keep an eye on but given Russia is putting its entire spare force into this aggressive push and paying for it dearly....I'm not nearly as concerned about these limited advances until they show an actual ability to close the gap, and to hold that line for days in a way that meaningfully destroys the Ukrainian defensive forces and that will allow further advances. That doesn't seem to be an immediate danger yet. In fact what we've seen is that Russia degrades its forces so badly in the pushes that they cannot meaningfully hold the ground they take. With continued weapon supplies and mobilization in Ukraine continuing through the summer, any ground Russia takes can still be taken back like with it has been around Kyiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv.

So here's an analysis about the importance of that area:

> With the talk of a Russian breakthrough at Soledar and the T1302 in danger of being cut off it's important to look at the topography of the Bakhmut - Lysychansk are and why these developments are important. 
> 
> Just looking at a plain map it's hard to grasp the importance of Popasna and the hills around it. However, with Russian troops at Volodymirvka and Vasylivka, we can see how the recent advances at Popasna threaten the whole Bakhmutka river valley 
> 
> Even if the cut-off at Soledar is the one being talked about right now, the Russian advance to Vasylivka might be actually be more dangerous for the overall picture right now, as consolidation here would put the highest point in the area, Hill 311, in Russian hands
> 
> From this hill, and the surrounding heights at Popasna, the Russians would be able to observe all movement between Bakhmut, Siversk and Lysychansk/Severodonetsk. No matter on the success of the Soledar cut, the road T1302 would be compromised by constant artillery fire
> 
> However, should Soledar fall, the Russians would be close to cutting the T0153 from Bakhmut to Siversk too, essentially cutting off the Severodonetsk cauldron from the rest of Ukraine. This would be the most significant Russian success since the war moved east.
> 
> If Russians manage to consolidate their hold on the Popasna heights and Hill 311, it's going to be hard for the Ukrainians to dislodge them. The terrain is open and Russians can use the heights to spot, and artillery to hit Ukr. force concentrations

- Pro-Ua: Russia's equivalent to the Ardennes offensive, their last hurrah which will fail just as completely

that's one of the reasons the Italian proposal is rubbish, at this stage it can be only one outcome, Russia clearly losing the war and going home without nothing, anything else is us failing, concessions to end this conflict because we feel inconvenienced by the economy or energy prices aren't good enough may end resulting in another worse conflict in ten years with a better prepared russia and may sent the wrong message

Putin want to blame the West?

It's not about whether you have ""quantity"" of gas.   That is supply and demand economics.   It's about whether you can exert influence as a result.  That is about power economics.  You can have one without the other (Venezuela).  National security interests also include ""self sufficiency"" of critical supply chains.  In any protracted conflict, whoever runs out of supplies first is at a disadvantage.  In WWII, Germany lost, largely in part due to being unable to put fuel its panzer divisions and Luftwaffe.   

Turning to Russia, it wields great power because it is essentially *the* primary supplier of gas to Europe.  Look at what is happening when it threatens to cut off supply.    

Imagine a future in which Ukraine joins EU with its gas reserves intact?  And with its vast flat fertile plains?   This is a greening future, and such a future goes a very long way to creating the energy and food self-sufficiency of the EU.  That is amazing for EU.

It also sucks for Russia.  Not because Russia will lose its export revenues - it's still likely the least-cost supplier, but because Russia will lose its power to exert control by threatening to withhold its resources.  

Ukraine joining EU with the oil and gas reserves would leave Russia without a lot of negotiating power, and a much less diminished stature as a nation.   

That's why there are so many ""Nazis"" living coincidentally in Donbas and Luhansk and Crimea, but not so much in Kharkiv.  Think this is silly?  Overlay a map of Russia's territorial ambition and a map of petro resources.  It's not a coincidence.

That being said, there's a real concern over the tactical / strategic state of Severodonetsk. If Ukrainian forces can hold that small city, then Ukraine will not need to perform a river-crossing to re-enter the Luhansk Oblast. Holding onto Severodonetsk is not only highly-defendable urban ground, but also a staging point for the entire Luhansk Oblast counter-attack come June/July.

The Russians are throwing everything they have at Severodonetsk (including making a large, round-about attack to the rear through Popasna). 

--------

It would be my preference if Ukraine could hold onto the city. But if is forced to retreat, it's not that bad of a situation honestly. There's always the risk of a surprise encirclement if the Popasna salient gets worse though (but Russia's Popasna salient could also be counter-encircled).

Hard to say what will happen, but its clearly an important battleground today and for the near future.

There's a **reason** Russia threw 2 or 3 BTGs to their death in a terrible, high-risk river-crossing. Severodonetsk is very important to the Russians.

Edit: guess I wasn't being exact enough in my link caption for some people, updated with more precise language.

Also:

The primary difference between this video an a jav warhead is mostly liner composition, as covered by the video (solid vs powder copper liners).

In the Javelin the first small shape charge has a two layered molybdenum liner as a penetrator jet- used to pop Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA), not intended to penetrate main armor and would be destroyed by the ERA.  The second larger shape charge uses a copper penetrator jet- used to pop the tank, you would likely see molten copper remnants as described in the video after a hit from this one.

Then they immediately turn around and apply it to Ukraine:

It's a classic use of a whataboutism to deflect from the issue at hand, Russia's atrocities:

* False premise: the Left (american left) ignores the plight of the Palestinians, ergo they should ignore the plight of Ukrainians.
* Logical conclusion: the Right (american right) are the only ones that care about these conflicts.

For example, NATO keeps track of all of it's members military capabilities and readiness status, and all of their equipment, what they're using, what they're not, and who has what that is compatible with what other people have. It includes countries that are not in the EU but who have lots of military equipment, like the USA (!), UK and Turkey. If you want to coordinate transfers or swaps of military equipment, that's where you go.

The EU exists to coordinate the bureaucracies, civil services and policies of Europe, and keeps track of how much money everyone has, but also is a good central place to go to figure out how many refugees can go where, what can be supplied from whom for humanitarian or financial support and for coordinating European sanctions, things NATO either is not as good at or cannot do. 

The G7 has the smallest dedicated bureaucracy, but is still very important. They are a conference of the largest economies in the democratic world, and often invite similar minded countries to sit in (for example, the EU as an institution is normally a participant now). They are where you go if you want to coordinate high-level macroeconomic policies and actions from the large first world economies, not just of its members who account for a large chunk of the world economy (USA, UK, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada - over 50% of global wealth and anywhere from 1/3 to almost half of the world GDP) but can usually persuade other first world economies to join them or at least engage with them. Things like massive amounts of financial aid and macroeconomic changes to brace for global food shortages can be brought to them.

There are other organizations involved, too: 

The G20 (which includes BRIC and other developing economies) will need to figure out what to do about the global food shortage Russia has engineered, while the UN and Red Cross are coordinating humanitarian aid, diplomatic efforts and even POW monitoring to the extent that is possible. The IMF acts as a central coordinating institution for some types of loans countries are extending to help Ukraine (often with ultra low interest and other generous payment allowances).

It's more each org is set to do certain things in a very specialized way.

NATO is the premier group for coordinating military activity - NATO command and control infrastructure for coordinating logistical movements already exists, and is a well drilled and practiced machine. Basically if you need to send military equipment through Europe - NATO has all the agreements in place, and knows who to call to get it done. The fact that 'NATO' is agreeing gives more resources than if it was just the 'EU'.


G7 and EU - G7 include the US, Canada and Japan, whereas the EU is really just Europe - so some overlap; G7 makes it easy for US to interact with key European players and the EU then takes over once things are in Europe.

Russia was (supposed to) have more equipment, at least on paper. But in terms of manpower, they were about the same at the start of the war.

Then Russia sacrificed huge amounts of soldiers for the battle of Kyiv, while Ukraine fully mobilized their country. The exact figures are not known, but it is very possible that Ukraine actually has more soldiers than Russia now.

---------

Russia has far more equipment though, especially tanks, IFVs, and other armored vehicles that are necessary to conduct offensive operations. USA / NATO's shipments are smaller missiles that can be carried by hand, but it seems obvious to me that Ukraine's vehicle / cavalry situation is lacking.

Its not a big deal given the current situation. Russia is clearly attacking Ukrainian positions as furiously as they can, meaning Ukrainian infantry are fine (good at defense, but very difficult to walk to the offensive positions). I'm hoping that with these aid-bills passed, USA can start supplying the humvees and APCs necessary to conduct large-scale offensive operations.

To answer your question, first of all if Ukraine uses $40bn to degrade Russia’s military then the US would consider that money well spent, since an enormous portion of our military funding goes directly to countering the threat that Russia poses.

Secondly, Ukraine will undoubtedly forge all sorts of economic ties with the US after the war has ended that will strengthen both the US and Ukrainian economies. So there are plenty of benefits to the US that will come out of this arrangement. 

It’s very unlikely that the US will demand raw materials in return for military aid though.  I imagine that would be pretty widely condemned internationally and would do nothing to help Ukraine’s economy recover.

As Russian forces continue to take significant battlefield losses in Ukraine, the Kremlin is struggling to plug the gap as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains reluctant to call for a full-scale military mobilization

British military intelligence estimates that Russia has lost one-third of the ground combat forces it had gathered ahead of its invasion as Moscow’s forces have been bedeviled by both their own operational shortcomings and a fierce Ukrainian resistance, backed by sophisticated Western weapons. The U.S. Defense Department has not seen evidence of a mass Russian mobilization so far, officials said. But as Russia is trying to throw more forces into the fight, it is sometimes bringing in combat groups at less than full strength, including units that took losses in their failed effort to capture the capital, Kyiv.

In lieu of a mass mobilization campaign, which is likely to prove unpopular, Russia has cobbled together reinforcements by redeploying troops from occupied territories in Georgia, bringing in mercenaries from Syria, recruiting civilians in occupied regions in the Donbas, and coercing soldiers to stay on the battlefield by dangling financial incentives at new recruits. Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have also noticed Russia taking less experienced troops from more far-flung areas, such as the easternmost Russian port city of Vladivostok, instead of using elite units that suffered severe casualties in the beginning of the war. And the Pentagon believes that the paramilitary Wagner Group is active in the Donbas region. 

“They’ve been really scraping every barrel’s bottom that they can possibly find,” said Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute. 

Draft legislation posted to the website of the Russian parliament on Friday indicated that Russian lawmakers are set to weigh measures that would scrap the upper age limit at which Russians can sign up for military service. The amendment, introduced by the head of the parliament’s defense committee, Andrey Kartapolov, argued that it was necessary to recruit specialists with years of experience under their belts. The current cap stands at 40 years old for Russians and 30 years old for foreign citizens. 

For the first several weeks of the Donbas campaign, after Moscow’s disastrous effort to storm Kyiv ended in failure, Russia tried to overwhelm Ukrainian forces with strength in numbers on its flatter terrain by saturating targets with heavy rocket and artillery fire before sending in waves of ground units. But progress is falling far behind Putin’s expectations in the contested region, and Russian units are getting pushed away from Ukrainian border cities like Kharkiv. That’s leading to yet another change in Russian tactics. On Wednesday, a senior Pentagon official speaking on background under ground rules set by the Defense Department said Russia is beginning to scale back the size of its attacks using smaller units in the northern Donbas, likely in response to the heavy attrition sustained in the war so far. 

“The wheels are sort of coming off the Russian army,” Kagan said.

On Friday, British defense intelligence assessed that Russian commanders are under increased pressure to achieve their objectives, forcing them to redeploy forces exhausted by battle without sufficient time to replenish, risking further losses. British officials believe that in some areas of the Donbas, despite outnumbering Ukrainian forces by more than three to one, Russia’s poor integration of artillery and ground units has hindered progress, though Ukrainian officials believe that Russian fire has been effective in inflicting far more casualties than during its failed effort to take Kyiv. 

“They still having a problem delivering the effect they want, partly because of that integration challenge, partly because, if in doubt, go back to Soviet tactics of massive bombardments and barrages with fairly inaccurate artillery followed up by push yourself, turn [down] one road, and get whacked,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told reporters last week during a visit to Washington. “That’s what’s happening every day. They are not really progressing in many areas, … and their solution is just cannon fodder.”

Moscow’s increasingly mauled and ad hoc forces are likely to translate into further difficulties on the battlefield. “Even if he announced mobilization tomorrow, the attack currently underway will almost certainly culminate within the next couple of weeks,” Kagan said. “There just isn’t a wave of trained personnel that they can bring in that can really rejuvenate it in any short period of time.”

The senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Thursday that Russia had about 106 battalion tactical groups (BTG) fighting in Ukraine, the same number as earlier in the week. “They did push some units back into the Donbas that were not at 100 percent,” the official said. “We just had indications that not every BTG they put in was at the same level of readiness as before the war. Some BTGs were so depleted that they simply disbanded them and combined them into others.” Wallace, the British defense minister, said Russia had also tried to stem losses in units that ranged up to 35 percent—close to rates that would render most military units inoperable—by augmenting them with unprepared troops.

Western officials believe that Russia has already put nearly two-thirds of its front-line ground combat units into the fight in Ukraine. But the senior U.S. defense official said Russia has still struggled to move large masses of troops because of failures in logistics and sustainment efforts. And some of Russia’s military failures in the conflict, including the sinking of the cruiser Moskva in April and the failure to seize Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has prompted Putin to suspend two top commanders. 

There are also rumblings of discontent within Russia. Russian military recruitment offices across the country have been targeted with Molotov cocktails, likely to protest Russia’s backdoor efforts to mobilize troops, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War reported on Thursday. Russia’s usually patriotic military bloggers have also come to question Moscow’s execution of the war, the institute noted last week, after almost 500 troops and 80 pieces of military equipment were lost in a disastrous attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River. 

“The Molotov cocktails are a canary in the coal mine,” Kagan said. “The military bloggers are a very loud canary in the coal mine. And this can become a problem to the stability of Putin’s regime.”",False,1653081554.0,t3_utkwo5,t1_i9dkwkg,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

At the speed missiles travel, air behaves like we experience water.

The missile has a highly aerodynamic shape, so that air drag is minimized and propulsion pushes it inside a channel of air.  The same channel of air rams oxygen into the engines.  If this shape is disrupted, or if the missile turns abruptly across the flow of air, then the channel can get disrupted and the air slams into leading edges with the force of a sledgehammer (belly flop time!).  

If power is still applied but off-axis to the direction of motion, this sledgehammer is exerting force opposite to motion, while the engine is exerting force across the motion... which results in torque, and a tumbling force.  So now the object is moving forwards, being pushed backwards, and tumbling.  The engine stalls because it is not being properly fed oxygen (it expects air under pressure from forward motion).  And now you have an object moving forwards at very high speed but no power, and tumbling around its middle.

The force of air will react against the object's forward motion, and slow down its tumbling motion.  But the force is proportional to the square of the speed:  2x faster = 4x force.  And the object is moving WAY faster forward than it is tumbling.   At least initially, and for an object which has an aerodynamic shape, there is always a plane where there is least drag, so that plane of tumbling is slowed the least.   So it slams to a stop, and the tumble turns into a spin [e: on an axis]  perpendicular to its most aerodynamic [e: ~~axis~~ plane].  And spins.  Meanwhile, gravity brings it to the ground.

Yes, I agree that Ukraine serves as a strategic military buffer between the west, but I would argue that Ukraine's resources are more than just a *bonus*. It's the reason why Putin is in power. If he can't keep his populace complacent and enrich the Oligarch with oil money, he will be replaced.

From Wikipedia;

In the winter of 1916–1917, a ""new"" illness suddenly appeared in Vienna and other cities, and rapidly spread world-wide over the next three years. Earlier reports appeared throughout Europe as early as the winter of 1915–1916, but communication about the disease was slow and chaotic, given the varied manifestation of symptoms and difficulties disseminating information in wartime. Until Constantin von Economo identified a unique pattern of damage among the brains of deceased patients and introduced the unifying name encephalitis lethargica, reports of the protean disease came in under a range of names: botulism, toxic ophthalmoplegia, epidemic stupor, epidemic lethargic encephalitis, acute polioencephalitis, Heine-Medin disease, bulbar paralysis, hystero-epilepsy, acute dementia, and sometimes just ""an obscure disease with cerebral symptoms."" Just 10 days before von Economo's breakthrough in Vienna, Jean-René Cruchet described 40 cases of ""subacute encephalomyelitis"" in France.

The number of people infected during the ten years of the pandemic is unknown, but it is estimated that more than 1 million people contracted the disease, which directly caused more than 500,000 deaths. Encephalitis lethargica assumed its most virulent form between October 1918 and January 1919. The pandemic disappeared in 1927, as abruptly and mysteriously as it first appeared. The great encephalitis pandemic coincided with the 1918 influenza pandemic, and it is likely that the influenza virus potentiated the effects of the causative agent of the encephalitis or lowered resistance to it in a catastrophic way.",False,1653071587.0,t3_utkwo5,t1_i9cz5jv,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

The closest they get is acknowledging how much western support they have. 

Take the following quote. 

>At the start of the operation the RF AF actually demonstrated highly manoeuvrable actions, deep strategic breakthroughs for tens and even hundreds of kilometers. 

Ukraines strategy for the first stage was to mostly retreat to defensible positions (i.e. cities) but leave units in the country side, allow the russians to quickly take territory and then the ""left behind"" units would attack their strained supply lines because, due to flat geography of ukraine, it would have been increadibly hard to defend the open countryside. 

Russia didnt have deep strategic breakthroughs, they  were baited and suffered the consequences.

They detonated 50 pounds of three different types of explosives above the water: gasoline, ammonium nitrate, and dynamite.

At some point the blame must be shifted to the people living there and letting their leadership do these things.

Second, in WW2 you could get away with throwing thousands, even millions of men at the enemy and loosing them, as long as you had plenty of able bodied men to take their place(which the soviets did have). This is because learning to operate a WW2 era tank, artillery or any kind of weapon took very little time. Hell, even fighter pilots were considered replaceable back then. Modern military equipment is far more sophisticated, and takes a lot longer to get even decent at it. You can't just grab some villager and put them in a T72 and expect them to take Kyiv. That's the big difference.

Here's an analysis of the Russian former defense mininster for Crimea and Donbas and war crinimal Igor Girkin.

>As a general conclusion: our successes are still exclusively tactical in nature. The enemy is trying to keep ALL large settlements important in military and informational-propagandist sense. And - apparently - has enough strength and reserves to hope for success in this. If not complete success, then at least partial. The ""attrition battle"" (as I have repeatedly noted - as a military decision, I rate it no higher than ""idiotic"") in the Donbas continues and the ""strategic impasse"" (for the RF Armed Forces, but not for the UAF, who are gaining time) is getting deeper.

He basically thinks Ukraine will outlast them as Ukraine is mobilizing hard while Russia isn't and that once Russia is spent and Ukraine is ready with fresh troops Russia won't be able to hold on. Currently Russia is on the offensive while Ukraine gets the benefit of defense and this will shift. Russia wanted to cut and encircle the Ukrainian army so they could get a massive strategic victory crippling the army and preventing Ukraine's mobilization from ramping up but right now that looks like an impossibility for Russia as all they've managed is slow attrition (and Kherson + landbridge which isn't to be scoffed at)

But I would agree with you that it's not like Ukraine is on the road to some clear decisive victory but I wouldn't view it as Russia is ""winning"" either.

Here's a few bits: every first world country has about Japan's birthrate, the difference is that Japan cuts off immigration. The better a family's standard of living, the less likely they are to have more children. Immigrants who go to first world countries have lower birthrates than they would in their native countries if they're not from a first world country.

Also, Japan's not really a great place to look at for standard of living anyway, as that hasn't been getting better and you have some of the most overworked people on earth there.

Overall world birth rates have slowed, not increased, as economic growth has increased, world population growth is going to hit a plateau in the next decades with current habits by most projections, not increase exponentially.

I had the fortune to meet a couple of old rural Latvian guys and have a few drinks with them, and I can totally understand the views that people there have. 

It sucks that you cant just straight up deport Russians who act like that back to Russia, especially as I understand probably a chunk of them don't even have Russian citizenship. Dunno what you do with losers like that. This is why, when my wife and I were looking at options for moving, we understood it wouldn't really be appropriate to choose the Baltics. We don't want to add to the problem, and probably it wouldn't be easy for her either. We'll go back to NZ for a while and probably get her citizenship there so we can both try to move back to Europe as two kiwis. 

Personally, having lived here for so long, I don't even think revolution can save the country. They'll just recreate the 1917 revolution and install someone as bad or worse. That's why even the Russians here who hate the government see such actions as pointless - the brainless horde will vote in another Putin even if they topple him. Honestly I think the best case scenario is the utter collapse of society, and probably a serious Balkanization. It will be a nightmare regarding the nukes, but at this point I'm not sure it's worse than dealing with the nuke-threatening fascists in the Kremlin anyway. 

In Petersburg my friends and circle often sadly joke about hopes of restoring the old Novgorod Republic free from Moscow.

There were lots of incidents where Americans shot up Iraqi cars, blew up farms, homes and schools, etc, for fun in the opening weeks of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. You have to be careful when you extrapolate those incidents to an overall attempt by the leadership to liquidate civilians. Even though these incidents occurred, they were not condoned or encouraged by the invasion's coalition leadership.

I think that this is more or less how Russia tried to approach their invasion of Ukraine in the opening weeks. They hoped to swiftly decapitate the Ukrainian government and occupy a country lacking the motivation to continue fighting, and they knew that the best way to do that was to reduce civilian death and destruction. Were there isolated incidents of cruise missiles hitting apartments, schools and hospitals? Yes. Were there enlisted personnel and junior officers like lieutenants who captains who shot and fragged civilians for fun? Yes, absolutely. On the whole though, Russia's military did seem to show restraint. I honestly don't know whether it was more restraint or less restraint than the American military showed in Iraq in 2003, because there were a lot of incidents of intentional murder by enlisted soldiers and junior officers in both invasions.

**Over time, though, it's clear that Russia has transitioned to a terror campaign.** Putin no longer feels it is possible to quell the civilian population amicably or quickly. He is now aiming to cow them and kill them. He hopes to crush all opposition in occupied regions, including by liquidating all fighting-age males by enslaving them and sending them straight to the front, and he is hoping to strike fear into the rest of Ukraine and make them exhausted from the civilian death. I would say that within less than a month, Russian leadership had decided that it no longer cared about mass shelling of civilian targets, and they clearly made no attempt to enforce any discipline among their rank and file with village-level roundups and shootings. Worse, within the month, they appear to have started actively encouraging the behavior.",1653058016.0,1653056096.0,t3_utkwo5,t1_i9bpu8d,,4,-3,0,-3,0,0,

I think you describe the evolution of civilian targeting just right. I find it hard to see much moral difference, though, between exposing civilians to incidental violence and purposely targeting them. There's no such thing as kinder gentler war. In this case the Kremlin put civilians lives in the hands of enemy 20-year-old men and their discretion, after teaching those men that the civilians are evil, hostile, and worth less.

Even when the Germans were outside of Moscow, having taken over almost all of western Russia, the USSR was already winning. Why? Because America started lend leasing. Which meant the Germans were on the clock, but they reached the end of their abilities. They could no longer ensure that they took over all the major population centers, so the whole thing devolved into a war of attrition, where the USSR had a very big advantage: the American war industry. 

This is basically the same thing that's happening in Ukraine as well, only on a much smaller scale(both in space and time). The Russians have lost, because the war devolved into a war of attrition, which naturally favours the defender, but overwhelmingly favours the defender, if they have the backing of the US military industrial complex. 

In the same way the Germans lost WW2 when they failed to take Moscow in the initial surprise shock, the Russians lost the war in Ukraine when they failed to end it in their initial surprise shock. Don't get me wrong, the war isn't over. Germany managed to push all the way to Stalingrad, and dragged the war on for another 3 years after they ""lost"", but they were fighting a loosing battle, with each push depleting more of their own force, and they couldn't back down either, because that would have allowed the USSR to mass a force that could break them faster.

These situations were documented by journalists and field reports hundreds of times in the opening weeks of the war, when the situation on the ground was at its most chaotic. Virtually none of the people responsible for gross negligence or even intentional murder or mistreatment of POWs were disciplined for their behavior in these opening weeks. Enforcing their conduct was almost impossible because the American military leadership couldn't afford to slow down and conduct investigations; their priority was on encircling the main bases of resistance and toppling the Iraqi military.

I've already explained this several times. In my very first comment to you and many others. It's the basic fundamentals of supply and demand. Working in oil and natural gas doesn't mean you know anything about economics. If Russia has the largest supplies of Natural gas, they can just pump up a ton of it, flood the market so Ukraine can't compete, and run them out of business. 

This is how Russia has historically competed against its natural gas competitors in Europe. You for some reason think history doesn't matter here when it gives us context as to what could happen next.
