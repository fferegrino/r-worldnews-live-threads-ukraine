Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 21 June 2022
 
- On 17 June 2022, Ukrainian forces claimed their first successful use of Western-donated Harpoon anti-ship missiles to engage Russian maritime forces. The target of the attack was almost certainly the Russian naval tug Spasatel Vasily Bekh, which was delivering weapons and personnel to Snake Island in the north-western Black Sea.



- The destruction of the Russian vessel on a resupply mission demonstrates the difficulty Russia faces when attempting to support their forces occupying Snake Island. This is the latest in a series of Russian vessels, including the cruiser Moskva, to be damaged or destroyed by Ukraine during the conflict.



- Ukrainian coastal defence capability has largely neutralised Russia's ability to establish sea control and project maritime force in the north-western Black Sea. This has undermined the viability of Russia's original operational design for the invasion, which involved holding the Odesa region at risk from the sea.

Analysis from CNN's Tim Lister

It's been nearly two months since Russian forces began their assault on the city of Severodonetsk. But despite overwhelming firepower, they still can't dislodge determined Ukrainian resistance — nor cut the supply lines that provide the city's remaining defenders with a drip-feed of weapons and ammunition.

The fierce Ukrainian defense of Severodonetsk, despite heavy losses, has forced the Russians to concentrate firepower on a relatively small area and held up their efforts to seize the 10% of Luhansk region they still do not control.

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the seizure of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as one of the objectives of Moscow's special military operation that began in February. For now, that operation is largely stalled; a large part of Donetsk remains beyond the Russians' reach.

Russian forces are making modest gains — the Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that the town of Metelkino just southeast of Severodonetsk had been taken. But the Russians' goal of encircling the Ukrainian troops defending the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk still appears some way off.

In a campaign lacking agility and imagination, the Russians have resorted to one principal tactic: overwhelming indirect fire against any and all Ukrainian positions, regardless of the collateral destruction.

The aim is to leave nothing standing that can be defended. The use of troops on the ground to take and hold urban areas has been less frequent and less successful.

In a video of Ukrainian special forces in the area released at the weekend, one unidentified Ukrainian soldier says: ""They are throwing everything they have, all the munitions they have. It doesn't matter for them if it's our positions or civilian areas, they wipe everything from the face of earth and then they use artillery and then they start moving forward little by little.",False,1655803323.0,t3_vh48po,t3_vh48po,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

From CNN's Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood

Russia will ""absolutely not"" go back to the pre-war status quo, a senior State Department official told reporters Tuesday.

This official did not speak explicitly to the future of diplomatic relations with Russia, noting they were already strained prior to the war starting in February. They said US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan speaks less frequently with the Russian foreign ministry than before, but there is still contact on the issues of the US Embassy's ""staffing woes"" and the detained Americans.

""That's a frequent topic multiple times a week, on behalf of various detainees and not just the most high-profile ones, which are obviously Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, but there are other Americans who are detained there who deserve the same level of treatment as any American citizen does, who's detained in a foreign country,"" the official said.

The official also explained how challenging it is to work with the Russians on the issue of detained Americans, because the Russians put convoluted processes in place that prevent any quick contact with the detainees.

“Oh, well, we moved detainee X last week. He's on the other side of Moscow and you're gonna need a different form, in triplicate, but that but the office that issues it is closed until next Thursday. But if you come after five on Friday, then maybe we'll take care of you, but only bring blue pens,” the official said, describing the kinds of hoops that the Russians make US officials jump through.

Sullivan has not ""engaged on Ukraine policy with the Russian government since mid-February,” the official explained.

The official spoke of the commercial impact the war has had in Russia, noting that there were more than 1,000 US companies that did business in Russia last year and ""it's a fraction of that now.""

The official said the US ambassador had previously dealt a great deal with helping US businesses in Russia that had gotten in trouble over regulatory or potential criminal matters. They said Sullivan had ""a lot of interaction"" with the minister of Trade and Industry and they ""developed a pretty good relationship."" The official said the outcomes weren't often positive but ""the issues were treated seriously and sometimes we got good outcomes, more often than not we didn't, but that's all stopped.""",False,1655835531.0,t3_vh48po,t3_vh48po,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Luhansk governor: Russian troops enter industrial part of Sievierodonetsk 

Russian troops have entered the industrial part of Sievierodonetsk, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai.

Haidai acknowledged on Tuesday that there have been difficulties in fighting in its east as Russian forces regrouped after stepping up pressure and making advances on two cities.

The governor of the Luhansk region said Russian forces had launched a massive attack and gained some territory on Monday though it was still relatively quiet overnight. But this overnight lull was nothing more than a little respite, according to Gaidai.

""It's a calm before the storm,"" he said.

The Azot chemical plant is the only part of Sievierodonetsk that remains under Ukrainian control.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that there are around 300 civilians sheltering in the plant.

Yesterday, Kyiv conceded that it had lost control of Sievierodonetsk suburb Metiolkine.

Knowing how much some of these countries hate russia, and knowing that NATO has their backs, Im surprised it hasn't happened already. Having said that Im sure there are protocols in place in the NATO agreement where you just can't go and piss on the bullies boots and then trigger article 5. 

The US/England want to see Russia run out of shit in a pyhric victory in Ukraine. Then sanction the hell out of them until they are basically Cuba. They'll save the best ones for last. In the meantime, Im sure there are weapons/toys being sent that we don't even know exist. Good opsec. Smart play by Zelensky to keep calling for more weapons, gives the invaders a false sense of confidence. Im sure he is being coached by the greatest minds in the world on this stuff. I bet there are more drones in Ukraine/on their way than anywhere else in the world.

Russia won't leave until they declare ""victory"" but what that means seems to change by the week. They tried for the entire country, failed, and now are just trying for the east. If they take the east, declare ""victory"", they will just try again in a few years for the rest. I think everyone knows that, and everyone is sick of Putin's 20th ""wah I want the USSR back"" BS. 

So as much as I hate to say it, this grinding war of attrition slash meat grinder is the best for long term stability in the region. Ukraine will get so much foreign money to rebuild, and be forever seen as hero's in the world's eyes.

Russia will be a third world hell hole for years after this, if it continues to play out this way.

But you're right they are not losing, they already lost, hard. They basically wanted the reunification of the soviet Union and got a soviet civil war. They wanted the resources of both nations and are instead destroying the resources of both. Every Ukrainian they kill is one they can't subjugate and exploit in the future.

Kazakhstan won't even pay lip service to the DNR. So much for the CSTO.

Ah so only most of the industrialized world including most of the worlds largest economies, yep hardly any support there....

And yes there will be consequences for trying to isolate Russia but what are the consequences for Europe if they allow Russian aggression to go unanswered? What would the Russians do after they took Ukraine? What did they do after the west barely responded when they invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Ukraine in 2014? Oh that's right they launched an even larger war, I think many in Europe now realize playing nice with Russia was a massive mistake. To not support Ukraine is just ensuring Russia attacks someone else later and that war could be even worse than this one.

Sure maybe the support of some nations falters but it looks like the US, UK, the Nordic countries and most of eastern Europe are committed long term, once again a pretty impressive amount of help for Ukraine. Many European countries are reactivating coal plants and making long term plans to use less Russian fossil fuels, I doubt imports will ever return to previous levels, this has damaged Russia's earning potential permanently.

Now of course no one knows how the war will turn out, I hope Ukraine wins, but to suggest that because the entire world doesn't care Ukraine will lose is silly. To tie that into the idea that already wealthy countries with strong infrastructure will be lured into the already faltering Chinese belt and road is farcical

He didn't necessarily say South Ossetia won't attempt to join Russia at some point. Officially, his domestic response was that there won't be a referendum until consultations have been made with Russia on the matter.

Even Peskov, the Kremlin Press Secretary, stated on May 24th that, in regards to the referendum, “No steps are being taken or planned by the Russian side connected with this.” So it was likely a domestic thing in South Ossetia, probably a talking point in the elections.

Ukraine selling would make Russian threats to turn off the spigot or to attempt to use arbitrary pricing power much less effective.

This probably doesn't work out for Russia, but this was Russia's last chance as an authoritarian regime to make a substantive play for hegemony.

I think I just want to point out, that the German heavy weapons are so scarce not because Germany doesn't want to supply them. This has nothing to do with 'Germany wants to support russia' or only wants to earn money. There are some more historic reasons. 

At the moment heavy weapons are simply not there in any significant quantity (at least not operational. Example: only about 40 Pzh2000 out of 108). So there's not much to give away. Older equipment in storage (see Gepard) has to be refurbished before delivery, crews have to be trained but by who? Gepards haven't been in service for a decade, spare parts and technology is obsolete and unavailable. This takes time and so far Germany adhered to these delivery times against all odds.

This small pool of available heavy weapons stems from Germany's history. The 2+4 contract for the reunification of West and East Germany 30years ago strongly limited German Armed Forces. On the civilian side there was (still is to some degree)  huge disapproval of anything militaristic due to collective guilt for the 3rd Reich. The switch from 'all military sucks' to 'maybe a bit of military is okay' just happened during the Afghanistan war and even more so with the ongoing Russian aggression.

The German Armed Forces have undergone the 3rd or 4th redesign after the reunification, since there's no clear picture of what it should be (territorial defense, anti-terror, NATO, part of European army, ...?). In addition there has been only a relatively small budget (a big portion of it goes to pensions and retirement fonds) for GAF. Sure, there are some nice pieces of technology (Pzh2000, Leo2a7, IRIS, U212, ...) but ever only in small quantities for GAF due to financial limitations.

You might remember the 'Zeitenwende', Scholz' speech and announcement right after Putin's invasion in February. He announced 100 billion € 'Sondervermögen' (special budget) for procurement and modernization of the German Armed Forces, as well as an adaption to the Grundgesetz (German constitution) to fix the 2% GDP in defense spending. For the international audience this is often overlooked as something like 'about time, no biggy', but for German politics this is a gigantic shift of nearly 80 years of foreign policy \_within days\_. This has been coupled with a complete switch away from russian fossil fuels within only a few months. Of course we aren't there yet, but a lot of contracts are being signed and developments take place right now for this to be real in 1-2 years.

Moscow imposed an economic blockade and then sent in security forces to reestablish control, which was resisted by the vast majority of Lithuanians. The resulting civilian deaths stained the record of Mikhail Gorbachev, though he denied responsibility for ordering the troops to use deadly force. In September 1991, Moscow yielded, recognizing the independence of Lithuania, which was quickly admitted to the United Nations. Recognition of Lithuania’s independence became the prelude for the USSR’s collapse little more than three months later. In 1993, Russia — the Soviet Union by then was long gone — removed its last army units from Lithuania. European Union and NATO membership followed eleven years later.”

Nice cherry-pick, but yes, straight up glassing is absolutely an option (I believe I mentioned it first). We don't have a first-strike doctrine so chances are an isolated tac-nuke wouldn't immediately cause a nuke response, but a second one probably would. I said it was an option, not that it should be used.

>Many of your suggestions are basically an escalation of force.

Yep, that's how responding to an escalation works. We don't respond to a tactical nuke by sending in Macron to ask Putin how we can help him save face.

>It’s the west which is generally softer that won’t have a determined response as it gets harder. 

That changes with offensive nukes; offensive nukes are an existential threat to literally everyone in the world (as you said, there are enough nukes to end the world many times over). After 1945, nukes are a defensive weapon only; if that changes everything changes.

>Look and France and Germany. 

Look at Poland, Lithuania, the US, the UK, etc. And consider how China will respond to an unprovoked nuke. France and Germany (and Italy) are not the best metrics to assess western resolve: Italy bailed in WW2, France surrendered (although pulled together a solid resistance), and Germany was on the opposite side.

>And those in charge are not giving all the things Ukraine wants. Some of it is logistical and training related but some of it is people smarter than you or I don’t think it is a good idea.

I agree, avoiding escalating things to the point a nuke is used is absolutely preferable. But if a nuke is used, all bets are off the table. Is this a discussion on what happens if a nuke is used, or how to avoid nukes being used? The two have very different answers.

Russia isn't suicidal. Right now they can't even muster a response to Lithuania blockading their sanctioned goods, something that I believe is far more likely than nukes being used. Russia is doing everything it can to avoid triggering a NATO response, so I don't see nukes on the table at any point before Ukraine pushes back to the border, and even then, mobilisation will mostly likely happen before a nuke (once the war becomes defensive for Russia). For the record, this is the point where I believe Russia gets dangerous, and I don't support a campaign into Russian territory.

If you want more insight to how Russia is fighting the war (outside of the war itself), look into Foundations of Geopolitics. It's taught in Russia and Putin is operating almost straight out of that playbook.

Nukes just aren't an option in this war and everybody involved knows it. If Russia wants to escalate to that level, they will absolutely lose; nobody will tolerate an aggressive nuclear power (who uses nukes offensively) operating unchecked in this day and age. We barely even tolerate an aggressive nuclear power who isn't using nukes offensively.

While it may sound like I am promoting a policy of chamberlain style appeasement I am not. But whose gonna launch it and how is this non Ukraine country gonna say it wasn’t an act of war? In theory it is just a war between to Ukraine and Russia. 

Lol, if you think the west will tolerate one tactical then at that point the west will realize how out of control this has gotten. The west will realize that escalations will be met with escalations. And Russia’s only thing it can escalate with is a nuke.

The two are tied together. How to prevent a nuke and how to respond to one. 

I believe that’s why the west is slow rolling support. It doesn’t want to put Putin into a position to feel desperate enough to use a tactical. That’s why Ukraine isn’t going to get everything it claims it needs. All the planners and strategists can speculate at what will happen post tactical but none of them want to find out or work through that problem. But people daily bitch about Ukraine not getting enough support because the war is still going on. Because in the age of social media they need instant gratification. It hasn’t even reached 4 months yet. The west is gonna let Ukrainians die and give just enough to keep both sides from making progress.  It can’t afford to let it get one sided. Especially, if it is the Russian military  getting pushed back into Russia. 

That’s why this will drag out until 2023 when I see pressure to end it regardless of how Ukraine is doing or wants. I’m working on a phone here so I sort of forgot how this whole convo started. 

I appreciate your efforts and comments. I do. It’s just that no one has any good answer on how to deal with a tactical nuke dropped in Ukraine. So working backwards from there the goal is to not have russia feel that this would be a good idea. Which means what would cause russia to want to drop one. Losing badly. What causes Russia to lose badly? If Ukraine has superior numbers and weaponry.  Or it has sudden massive wins. So to avoid that Ukraine shouldn’t be oversupplied. You want to give Ukraine just enough to keep it frozen. That’s what people keep missing. Frozen is good for the world. Yes, I get it grain is stuck in Ukraine. Famine will cause instability and refugees to flood Europe etc. but uncontrolled nuclear exchange isn’t a good idea either. So for me, I’m gonna pick avoid nukes as my top priority.
