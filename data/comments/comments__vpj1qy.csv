Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told CNN that the Kremlin faces ""rising partisan activity in southern Ukraine"" which could present a growing challenge.

Day 129 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Those fuckers changed their schedule, now they don’t launch their missiles at 11pm. Today they launched them at 3am, and yesterday at 4am. They fired just 2 today and both got intercepted almost simultaneously, it was caught on video. 

That’s new, usually every single one of their missiles hit their target in Kharkiv, but in the past 2 days most of them were intercepted. It looks like we got new AA here. Actually according to the new information 3 more missiles were intercepted, that’s great news.

But there’s even better news, just as we shot down their missiles, we fired one of our own back at Belgorod, well, just one, most likely Tochka-U. It landed somewhere in Belgorod and people living there caught it on video, the explosion was spectacular, and seeing Russians panic from something we go through every single day is very refreshing. 

And while wishing harm on others is wrong, it’s pretty hard not to in our situation, we are just jaded from living in this hell every day, it’s impossible not to want them to also feel what we are feeling. They thought that they can barrage us with missiles daily, celebrate our deaths, and not get anything in return, but now they are finally getting the taste of their own medicine.

Fierce struggles continue for control of the city of Lysychansk in the Luhansk region.

The city is Ukraine's last bastion in the eastern province.

Andrei Marochko, an officer of the pro-Russian Luhansk People's Militia, was quoted by Russia's TASS news agency as saying that the militia's red hammer-and-sickle flag was now flying over the administrative building in Lysychansk.

However Ukraine's military has rejected claims that the city was encircled. 

Russian media showed videos of Luhansk militia parading in the streets of Lysychansk waving flags and cheering, but Ukraine National Guard spokesman Ruslan Muzychuk told Ukrainian national television the city remained in Ukrainian hands.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 July 2022
 

- Russian forces continue to achieve minor advances around Lysychansk, with air and artillery strikes continuing in the district. Ukrainian forces probably continue to block Russian forces in the south-eastern outskirts of Lysychansk.


- Russia continues to employ air-launched anti-ship missiles in a secondary land attack role, likely because of dwindling stockpiles of more accurate modern weapons. Analysis of CCTV footage shows the missile that impacted the Kremenchuk shopping centre on 27 June 2022 was highly likely a Kh-32. This is an upgraded version of the Soviet era Kh-22 KITCHEN.


- Although the Kh-32 has several performance improvements over the Kh-22, it is still not optimised to accurately strike ground targets, especially in an urban environment. This greatly increases the likelihood of collateral damage when targeting built up areas.


- Further strikes on 30 June 2022 in Odesa Oblast likely involved Kh-22 KITCHEN missiles. These weapons are even less accurate and unsuitable for precision strikes and have almost certainly repeatedly caused civilian casualties in recent weeks.

2.	I have acquired a solar system for my unit to have it’s energy needs met as my last unit had systemic issues in which energy was poorly supplied and utilized. This will eliminate some major problems.

3.	I have resupplied myself and others.

4.	I met with Ukrainian upper echelon whom have given me exclusive permission to create, disseminate propaganda on behalf of the nation.

An adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has conceded that Lysychansk - Ukraine's last big bastion in the strategic eastern province of Luhansk - could fall.

Fighting has intensified in Lysychansk.

Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow self-styled Luhansk People's Republic, told Russian television ""Lysychansk has been brought under control,"" but added: ""Unfortunately, it is not yet liberated.""

Russian media showed video of Luhansk militia parading in Lysychansk streets waving flags and cheering - but Ukraine National Guard spokesman Ruslan Muzychuk told Ukrainian TV the city remained in Ukrainian hands.

""Now there are fierce battles near Lysychansk, however, fortunately, the city is not surrounded and is under the control of the Ukrainian army,"" Mr Muzychuk said.

Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian forces had finally crossed the Siverskyy Donets river and were approaching the city from the north.

""This is indeed a threat. We shall see. I do not rule out any one of a number of outcomes here. Things will become much more clear within a day or two,"" he said.

""If Lysychansk is taken, strategically it becomes more difficult for the Russians to continue their offensive. The front lines will be flatter and there will be a frontal attack rather than from the flanks.""

Putin launched a three-prong nation-wide assault, raining down cruise missiles, surrounding the capital and taking small villages and towns. But very quickly, Ukrainian forces held their defense lines and forced the Russians, who had come unprepared for a long fight, to pull back. Now, the war is a battle of positions, with the Ukrainian forces on the defensive in the Donbas region, trying to slow the Russian advance down. VICE News travels to the Kharkiv and Donbas regions of Eastern Ukraine to gain a clearer understanding of an ever-changing and volatile frontline in one of the world’s most brutal ongoing conflicts.

[Russian forces are pounding the city of Lysychansk and its surroundings in an attempt to seize the last stronghold of resistance in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, the governor said today.](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-zelenskyy-kremenchuk-putin-12541713?postid=4106800#liveblog-body)



Ukrainian fighters have spent weeks trying to defend the city and to keep it from falling to Russia, as neighbouring Severodonetsk did a week ago.

The Russian defence ministry said its forces took control of an oil refinery on Lysychansk's edge in recent days, but Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said on Friday that fighting for the facility continued.

""Over the last day, the occupiers opened fire from all available kinds of weapons,"" Mr Haidai said on Telegram.

Meanwhile, the British defence ministry said Russia is continuing to make ""minor advances"" around the city.

Luhansk and Donetsk make up the Donbas region, where Russia has focused its offensive since pulling back from the northern Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv, in the spring.

Pro-Russia separatists have held portions of both provinces since 2014, and Moscow recognises all of Luhansk and Donetsk as sovereign republics.",False,1656756268.0,t3_vpj1qy,t3_vpj1qy,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

I don’t think a screenwriter just thought up this shit which means what we are seeing in the field today is a very poor cousin of what the military really has.

Just my armchair general side trying to think unconventional ways to upset the conventional slow artillery heavy ways the rusdians fight

id love if it was possible that they could deploy groups of fast moving small teams falling down on the Russians while or immediatelly right after heavy shelling on them, several fast teams moving from different directions at once while the Russians are stil figuring what's going on so as they see the Ukrainians they have to surrender because they don't have time to react or assess how big is the attack how many are taking part....

but maybe my arm chair general plan isn't feasible though:), they need to have people on the ready very close to the russians for it to work and perhaps even resistance on the ready behind enemy lines? nevermind the risk of friendly fire during the shelling.....

also using unconventional tools and tricks?, i.e. someone is donating electrc bikes which are silent to help move around, but what about light cheap easily portable electric scooters for infantry?, i mean if they can move faster silend and less tired that should be an advantage? less say if they can get 20% increased mobility efficiency and less effort that should be noticiable?

i guess i may not make it to general, thats it unless i decide to join the russian army as i heard they desperate looking for generals

I get that Russia think they can take the Donbas and “freeze” the war there.

I see this, like the attempt to take Kyiv as another example of an invasion designed by politicians and not military generals.

Russia’s main failures come from the fact it believes its own propaganda.

The Russian strategy is clear. Grind away at the Donbas and the south and then stop once you’ve got what they want, and the tired and wounded Ukraine will be thankful it’s all stopped.

That’s why Russia is bombing the cities, to try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible so it will be thankful when Russia decides to stop and will jump at a peace, even if it involves a loss of land.

Russia is employing a similar strategy with the interference in gas, oil and food supplies around the world. They are hoping that if they stress everyone enough, the world will just …give up.

Russia’s problem is its having the opposite effect. It’s made it clear that Russia is a rogue player and can’t be trusted.

To put it simply, the prevailing has become that if Russia wins this war, they will just do this again, and again, and again.

Neither Ukraine or the 1st world will allow this to happen. Ukraine has no interest in being in a position where it is wondering when Russia will invade again.

Russia won’t be allowed to freeze this war. Ukraine will be supplied with heavy weapons that will continue to bomb the Russian military for as long as it takes for them to leave.

A recent example is Snake island. Russia was never a chance of holding it. But because leaders like Shigu and Putin are politicians and don’t understand military strategy they were far too optimistic about what the Russian military can actually do.

After 3 episodes of the equipment there being blown to hell, they gave up.

This is will be the ultimate end of this war in the Donbas. Russian people of Crimea and the Donbas, and the Russian military will die en-mass when Russias try’s to stop this war, until it goes home.

It will probably take about a year from now.

To put it simply, Russia does not have the military power to do what it is aiming to. This, coupled with a leadership that is deluded by its own propaganda, is going to lead to a disaster for Russia.",1656808614.0,1656808287.0,t3_vpj1qy,t1_ien07wk,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

> To put it simply, Russia does not have the military power to do what it is aiming to. This, coupled with a leadership that is deluded by its own propaganda, is going to lead to a disaster for Russia.

These two statements are contradictory and absent of motive. Putin or who ever replaces him will not have the political capital or special circumstances to try something like this again for decades and they will be rebuilding their war inventories for just as long. It took them decades to build up what has been lost, much of that under better economic circumstances. Keep in mind Putin can't survive a major loss nor can anyone who follows due to the ""interesting"" nature of Russian politics. Ukraine as a whole just doesn't offer much economically or politically to a Russian leader but being a naturally paranoid society they also can't survive the whole of Ukraine joining Nato as it is the best route to invade Russia. They did not expect to take Kyiv by force, 40,000 troops can not take a city of 5,000,000 street by street. Outside of CNN commentators no one believes that.  Putin was sold on a quick negotiation of negotiated peace, maybe get lucky and kill Zelinsky, for independence or annexation of the the ethnically and linguistically Russian majority territories and they got wrecked on that optimism but the goals haven't changed. The media has done a poor job on this and social media has made it worse by portraying Putin and the Russians as cartoon caricatures of bad guys stripping away any intellectual thought in the process. The internet is not good at nuance or holding complex opinions.   

>A recent example is Snake island. Russia was never a chance of holding it. But because leaders like Shigu and Putin are politicians and don’t understand military strategy they were far too optimistic about what the Russian military can actually do.

It's a strategic point, if you remember Ukraine also kept troops there. Bad tactical decisions are rule not the exception in military history. People looking at a map make a lot of decisions and the people on the ground do their best with that. Look at the US Keating FOB in Afghanistan. There is a really good documentary on it and also a not so good movie about an out post that never should have been. 12 friendlies dead in the final battle for it and after abandoning it they used a B-52 to obliterate it.  

We will probably have to agree to disagree but I will leave you with this 2020 excerpt from the US congressional research service and a link to the full document it is a good reflection of what RAND, many other western think tanks and former high level military officials have repeatedly said about Russia and stands in stark contrast to what CNN, US and British politicians say. Over and over the experts who don't now work for Raytheon or Boeing/Lockheed Martin see Russia by their development as very aware of their limitations to wage war offensively and defensively based off of their experience and careful examination of decades of US conflicts. They don't think their capabilities are exceptional, everything is decided in the context of favorable outcomes over domination. Taking entire countries is rare history. 190,000 troops is not enough to take and hold an entire country the size and geography of Ukraine, they knew that just like they knew they couldn't legit take Kyiv but instead hoped for negotiations with favourable concessions. No one can explain the position of why Russia would treat Ukraine differently than it did Georgia after it tried to join Nato. Russia lost less than 100 people and could have steam rolled the whole tiny country.

Russian has over extended itself already. It does not  have the strength to hold what it has. If it had air superiority, yes. If it had accurate long range systems to prevent it being bombarded, yes.

Have a look at what is already happening around Kherson.

Russia is not able to “freeze” this war.

Your assertion the attack on Kyiv was not a serious attack is exactly the example am talking about. I agree that it was not designed to hold Kyiv.

They were wrong. Why? Because they both underestimated Ukraine, and overestimated themselves. Why? Ahem, it’s called believing your own propaganda.

Russia, honestly thought Kyiv would just lay down and give up. Much like it is again believing now.

The action toward Kyiv was an unmitigated disaster. They lost at least 30% of the VDV and their spetsnaz.

If it was anything else but a critical part of Russia’s strategy, those irreplaceable troops would not have been there.

Russia has showed its had. I agree with you about Russia’s military doctrine. Russias fatal flaw here is it has no other cards to play.

There will be no settlement offered that Russia will find acceptable. 

This is because it has become obvious Russia’s military is not strong enough to create the leverage Russia needs to force Ukraine to the negotiating table.
