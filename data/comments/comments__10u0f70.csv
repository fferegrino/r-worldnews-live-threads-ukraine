Before launching the Vuhledar offensive, occupational forces unconcernedly decided to set up an assembly area in the central part of Kyrylivka, not far from Vuhledar. Let's see how did that work out for them almost a week ago.

2/4 Kyrylivka is located approximately 14 kilometers southeast of Vuhledar. The central part of the town - educational and administrative buildings was turned into an assembly area where enemy forces gathered before dispatching to the frontline.

3/4 Such audacious behavior did not go unnoticed.
In this photo, you can see the consequences of the strike which happened almost a week ago and result in some serious casualties. Buildings sustained serious structural damage.

4/4 The estimate varies between 30 and 200 killed. 

While russians pretend that nothing happened and even didn't bother to mention it, make sure to retweet this, so we can help them to find out what happened.

f983ac860fd925be63028327fa3694d2,10u0f70,j7a2qnt,"Just wanted to post a comment about stuff that has been inking me about these livethreads - it's the circlejerk about how ineffective and pathetic Russian army is. There are people proclaiming inability of Russian troops to adapt, who literally believe that Russia is using 1914 tactics. 

&nbsp;

Statements like these are only partially true and are actually insanely disrespectful to Ukrianian heroes, some of whom were accomplished athletes , academics or successful businessmen in their pre-invasion lives, and others who were fighting Russian aggression since 2014. They die in the line of duty to what redditors assume are starved orangutans wearing adult diapers and wielding Mosin nagant rifles and medkits full of tampons and moonshine.

&nbsp;

Lately, human wave zerg rushes are all the rage with orkins. They take massive casualties, but the tactics are more insidious than what some of you assume. Russians still have a lot of counter-artillery radars, Orlan drones and various EW/jamming equipment. While their squads get obliterated on the ground by Ukrainian artillery, they answer this with counter-artillery fire and Lancet suicide drones, also heavily targeting Ukrainian drone operators. Unfortunately, there is footage of these little drones disabling modern SPGs that Ukraine uses like Caesars and PZH-2000, as well as M777 howitzers.

&nbsp;

In rare cases (getting more common) when Russians organize and sync up their units, results can be devastating. Ukrainian troops rely heavily on commercial drones to monitor the battlefield. DJI Mavic drone isn't exactly a platform with powerful multi-channel coms. If Russians sucessfully set up their jamming stations close to frontline, they blind Ukrainian forces and can proceed to get other nasty stuff, including infamous TOS-2 flame throwers in range. These things obliterate whole blocks, which is followed by pitch up helicopter and SU-25 rocket bombings and incessant Grad barrages. And after that, there is a tide of zombie-like human waves that crawl and dig in closer and closer, and eventually take over defensive positions built by Ukrainian infantry. 

&nbsp;

This is apparently how they managed to gain control of Soledar and while paying heavily for it, it's still a success in their eyes as they mostly expended human resource. Russians have a plan on how to replenish their losses in long term. They will conduct other ""special operations"" against post-Soviet countries, already severely degraded by corruption and dependant on Russian credits and resources. Georgia/Armenia/Kazakhstan are all in Kremlin's crosshairs and they will  continue using salami tactics to bite off chunks of foreign land, subduing local population to be used as future cannon fodder.

&nbsp;

Russian menace is not a joke. They will likely not get kicked out of Ukraine for years to come, unless west steps up military aid big time and stops worrying about nuclear threats and other redline bullshit. Tanks and jets should have been given months ago. God forbid Russia manages to secure ceasefire with control of annexed territories, there would probably be no stopping of some form of renegade USSR re-emerging from its grave. While it won't be the same superpower, the suffering they will cause on neighboring countries will be immense.  

&nbsp;

Massive financial support of far right/far left in Europe will put EU's unity in jeopardy, especially with humanitarian crises that Russian PMCs and Kremlin sponsored dictators will work towards to, so Europe is flooded with even more refugees from war-torn African and Middle Eastern countries, and cultural tensions/ethnocentrism rises to the top of political agenda.

&nbsp;

We need to take rose-tinted goggles off and stop celebrating victory prematurely. I could care less if you think I am pushing Russian propaganda, which there surely will be commenters accusing me of. It took me over an hour to write this comment, so yeah, definitely a bot hitting mandatory comment quota.

&nbsp;

 Right now, global stability hinges on a gigantic pair of Ukrainian balls. And to stop Russian aggression, step one is to stop underestimating Z-army's capabilities. Gerasimov is someone whom Ukrainian commander in chief Zaluzhny gives a lot of respect to and ranks highly. Why do redditors, who get 90% of their information from this same very thread, think he is an incompetent stooge is beyond me. It's the same energy that ""I heard from this dude on youtube"" Joe Rogan fans give off. 

&nbsp;

Hopefully, if you agree, you will do something substantial. Donations to, and political pressure outside of Ukraine is still crucial to keep UA army running at 7000 rpm.

Even before the war, protesting against Putin could easily result in the police brutally beating the hell out of you. Then the ""justice"" system cripples you with debt which is hard to pay back, especially when you have a criminal record.  

Don't forget that the only way people can attain real power and money in Russia is if Putin wishes it to happen.  

If you step out of line even at the lower levels job opportunities vanish.  

A Russian man who worked in the TV news found that out. He started to realise what he was saying was a lie. When Julia Ioffe interviewed in early on in this war he was in Ukraine with friends. He was debunking the Kremlin propaganda online.  

That man said his mother, back in Russia, publicly called him a traitor to Putin and to Russia!  

He said his mother wanted Putin to restore the Soviet Union because her standard of living has deteriorated since the fall of the Soviet Union. She's a member of a nationalistic pro-Putin group online who sound kind of like the QAnon types but focused on Putin and Russia.  

Having his own mother publicly denounce him like that must really hurt. How do you even begin to connect or talk with your mum in that situation? How do you try to reach them through all the propaganda?",False,1675649103.0,t3_10u0f70,t1_j7cja2k,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Yes they made idiotic mistakes at the start of the war and yes they are using obsolete weapons and throwing away mobik lives.  I have no doubt that NATO would steamroll them.

But they're not fighting NATO, they're fighting Ukraine, which is also forced to use 50+ year old weapon systems and solders who were very recently civilians.  Ukraine has taken heavy casualties too this past year and lost significant amounts of equipment. We just don't see those numbers here.  

Russia is learning from their mistakes and adapting, same as they did in Finland 1939 and against Germany in 1941.  They've stopped trying to do clever mobile warfare and are trying to win this war by grinding down the Ukrainian army with artillery.

Gerasimov; both OSINT and Z-milbloggers agree that he is inept and his return was political infighting. 

Reconnaissance by force is Ru MO since forever (and Ukraine's too!). And this inability to adapt is proven by how RuAF wasted through meat reserves; LDNR, convicts and now mobiks. Meanwhile Ukraine, pressured by NATO, is adapting and employing less of this tactic. 

As for Russian massive defeat, there is no need. Both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union fell in part because of military defeats, but never outright existential defeat. Which was preceded by declining quality of life (Tsarist Russia: famine, Soviet Russia: long supermarket queues). Right now we are seeing an almost exact redux of the past two Russian collapses in the making all the worse elements mixed and matched in one. (Not that a new regime will be any better, but full balkinazation of Russia is entirely possible very soon).

But yes, the war and suffering is not over, never underestimate your enemy. And most of all:

And all the thing people say about a collapsing russian economy are double true for the ukrainian. Over the time of the war, russia is also able to reactivate their war economy. They might be fighting with WW2 equipment soon, but back then, they could supply an army of 12m with a much smaller economy. Supplying half a million now with basic ammo and weapon shouldn't be a problem even with a collapsing eco and the changed frontlines help with their logistical ""challenges"".

Russia appearently ""won"" the race from kherson and the shorter front helps them regain the Initiative. Their plan seems grind down the ukrainians in bakhamut, which is luckily not a good plan (von Falkenhayn would be proud). This plan seems to be driven by political competition inside the russian forces, so there is a decent chance that the rifts in Putins regime deepen the longer Ukraine holds out.

So, its basically comming down to weather the russian morale breaks before the Western support lessens (see: American elections Fall 2024). Russia would loose half a million man until then at the current rate. Are they able to stomach that? Nobody really knows.

The other option of course is a decisive ukrainian win on the battlefield. At the moment, that looks difficult.

Russia can't just 'throw bodies' into the war and someone win from weight of human material. That is only somewhat possible in close urban areas like the Bakhmut axis, beyond that they need well trained armoured divisions that can conduct effective offensives.

Frankly if they couldn't do it when they were at their strongest and Ukraine at its weakest they wont be able to do it now. Ukraine has systems they didn't have at the start of the war and Russia's premier divisions are degraded significantly.

Often times, people look at tank technology from the 60s, and conflate it with the tech race in the air. Tech is notoriously important for aircraft compared to flight tactics and skill, with fifth- (like the F-35) and late fourth- (like the Rafale) generation fighter jets able to obliterate third-generation jets from the sky. Unfortunately, Russia has the advantage here, which is why most Russian losses in the air have come from SEAD rather than air to air duels.

However, this is not the case for armour. A T-64 is still capable of blasting holes in unprotected troop formations nearly as effectively as an Armata. Even a 60 year old Soviet clunker can destroy a T-84, a T-90, or even an Abrams if it detects its target first and hits the right spot of the tank. Yes, ERA exists, and active defense systems like Trophy might change this, but ERA is not 100% reliable and ADS is still quite expensive.

Therefore, unlike with air, tactics and training are extremely important for armour even with a technological advantage. It is important that Ukraine plans accordingly, especially when they get their hands on Western tanks.

But there absolutely were plans in 1939 and even into 1940 where the British, French and Americans thought they could get the USSR into a war with Germany as a way to defeat both of them. Even after Germany invaded Poland, and remaining up until Spring 1940, Churchill earnestly believed that the USSR was a more dangerous threat than Nazi Germany. The Allies even considered declaring war on the USSR in 1940 when the Soviets invaded Finland.

One of the very reasons the West appeased Hitler for so long was that they were more afraid of the USSR and wanted to leverage Hitler's unpredictable warmongering and industry to defend against communism. A weakened Germany was seen as a threat to the West because that would mean a power vacuum vulnerable to Soviet influence or invasion.

And of course, once the Allies realized that Germany was done for in 1945, preparations immediately began for all the different ways that the Allies could quickly end up at war with the USSR the moment the Germans surrendered.

The problem is, Russia has a vastly larger potential manpower pool than Ukraine.

If Zelensky really means it when he says that Bakhmut will not fall, and Russia keeps throwing men at Bakhmut, there will come a time that eventually troops from other sectors will be needed to reinforce Bakhmut. 

This would also mean that in the case Bakhmut would fall, the figurative dam holding back the water would be broken.

>One of the very reasons the West appeased Hitler for so long was that they were more afraid of the USSR and wanted to leverage Hitler's unpredictable warmongering and industry to defend against communism.

Cite please?? Appeasement was because Chamberlain wanted to specifically avoid war due to the horrors of WWI, not to encourage it.

The man who helped Putin seize power said that when Putin dies Russia will fall and then a Putin v.2.0 will rise and take his place. When Putin v.2.0 dies yet another Putin clone will take his place.  

Putin has built the entire system around himself. It cannot function without him. You cannot attain power and wealth without Putin wishing it to be. He's indispensable and loyalty runs very deep. Only a tyrannical dictator can survive as leader there. Anyone else would be eaten alive by such a system. Besides, he's murdered, imprisoned and exiled anyone who may be a threat, and usually in that order.  

Such a system is hardly likely to produce a benevolent leader.  

I know there are Russian people, such as some in exile, who still hope and dream for a better and more free Russia but I just cannot see it happening.  

What is of concern is the general public's views.  

Some of them fear Putin dying. They are afraid that Russia will collapse again and it'll be just like the Soviet Union where money was worthless and they and their families starved.  

Julia Ioffe interviewed a Russian man staying in Ukraine. He said his mother back in Russia wanted Putin to *restore* the Soviet Union. He said his mother didn't like how her standard of living has deteriorated since the fall of the Soviet Union.  

From the Russian peoples perspective things can always get worse. Many men will not live long enough to collect their pension. Many men drink their lives away, just like in the Soviet Union.  

Have you seen the BBC documentary by Adam Curtis titled [Russia 1985–1999: TraumaZone - What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_1985%E2%80%931999:_TraumaZone)? It's a 7 part documentary made of archival video footage from that time period.  

Near the beginning of the first part, someone asks a Russian woman what her dreams are. She said she doesn't have any dreams. She used to but not any more. That was back in the 1980s before the fall of the Soviet Union, before Putin. Now imagine asking her, if she's still alive, what her dreams are now.",False,1675647748.0,t3_10u0f70,t1_j7dodie,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

Nobody in this thread has put Perun on that kind of pedestal. You're trying to make it seem like we are doing that in order to make us sound less reasonable, as if we wouldn't accept any kind of criticism of him. That's not an honest way to discuss these issues.

>Numbers can be pulled out of one's butt and some people will always be impressed. The only reliable figure we have is the ratio of troop vs equipment losses.

Perun makes it painstakingly clear time and time again that he questions the reliability of numbers, and he shows the work he does to adjust, when possible, to those issues.

You don't. You just said it yourself -- you uncritically accept the published enemy loss figures by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. You have never seen the Ministry of Defense show its work on these losses. You have no idea how accurate they are. You're just hoping they are accurate and leaving it at that. The fact that the MoD loss estimates heavily conflict with estimates from other Western military organizations like the United States (coincidentally, the Ukrainian MoD estimates are *always* higher than the US estimates, every single time, without fail) is apparently irrelevant and meaningless to you.

>Nice cheerleading for the dude anyhow.

I'm not cheerleading Perun. I am cheering doing work, though -- which, you don't do. You just cite MoD stats and blindly insist they are reliable without evidence to show that they are. Then you wholesale dismiss all the other variables in a very complicated equation on the hypocritical grounds that no other figures are reliable.
