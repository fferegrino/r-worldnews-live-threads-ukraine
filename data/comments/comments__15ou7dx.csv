The military counter-intelligence of the Security Service of Ukraine worked hard on the tent city of the occupiers, parking lots of automobiles and gas stations. The exact extent of the damage is currently being determined. But according to preliminary data, we are talking about dozens of killed and wounded occupiers and a lot of damaged equipment.

>
>*Troops advanced 10 to 12 miles along two main lines of attack in Kyiv’s drive to reach the southern coast and sever Russian supply lines, while explosions echoed at the vital Kerch Strait Bridge.*
>
>After months of inching through minefields, villages and open steppes in grueling combat, Ukrainian forces are making somewhat bigger advances along two major lines of attack, according to analysts, Ukrainian officials and Russian military bloggers.
>
>The amount of territory seized, 10 to 12 miles on both vectors of attack, while relatively small, is important in that it is compelling Moscow to divert forces from other parts of the front line, military analysts say. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, called the advances “tactically significant,” saying Moscow’s redeployment would most “likely further weaken Russian defensive lines in aggregate,” creating “opportunities for any Ukrainian breakthrough to be potentially decisive.”
>
>The Ukrainian military launched the counteroffensive this summer amid high hopes of duplicating its stunning sweep through the Kharkiv region in September. But those hopes were dashed amid heavy losses, causing commanders to change strategy from head-on assaults to a war of attrition, content to make steady, little gains while conserving resources and degrading those of the Russians.
>
>And even as Ukrainian soldiers battle in trenches and on the field, the campaign to sever Russian supply lines continues, with Ukrainian missiles and drones targeting sites far from the front lines.
>
>Explosions again echoed on Saturday as the Russian military said it had shot down two Ukrainian missiles targeting the Kerch Strait Bridge, a vital Russian link to the occupied Crimean Peninsula that Kyiv has vowed to keep attacking until it is unusable.
>
>Video broadcast on Russian and Ukrainian state news media showed smoke billowing over the span, though the Russians said that was just a smoke screen intended to protect the bridge.
>
>The Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Ukrainian forces attacked the bridge with two S-200 surface-to-air missiles. Sergei Aksyonov, the top Russian-installed official in Crimea, said the bridge was not damaged. The Russian accounts could not be independently verified, and Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment.
>
>In the ground war, the Ukrainians are advancing south along two principal lines of attack: through the eastern village of Staromaiorske toward the Russian-occupied city of Berdiansk, a port on the Sea of Azov; and farther west toward the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, a vital transportation hub near the coast.
>
>Ukrainian forces have progressed about 10 to 12 miles along both lines from their starting places at the onset of the counteroffensive in early June. Kyiv’s goal is to reach the Sea of Azov and drive a wedge into the so-called land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which is vital to the Russian military’s supply routes to the west.
>
>Military analysts caution that the Ukrainian forces still face a long, slow and bloody slog ahead against Russian troops positioned behind well-designed and fortified defenses. They cite a host of factors, like supplies of ammunition and other matériel as well as troop morale, that will determine how the fighting plays out over the coming months. But it is hard to analyze those elements, they say, given the disinformation and limited real information issued by both armies.
>
>Even if Ukraine’s forces manage to break through Russia’s first line of defense, analysts note, Moscow has had many months to prepare the most formidable fortified defensive positions since World War II — a series of trenches, tank traps, vast minefields, machine-gun nests, attack helicopters and other air support. Ukraine has struggled, even with Western weapons, to overcome those obstacles, particularly the minefields.
>
>Still, Britain’s military intelligence agency said on Saturday that Russia’s forces had faced “particularly intense attrition and heavy combat on the front line.”
>
>At the same time, Russian forces are mounting their own offensive operations in northeastern Ukraine around the city of Kupiansk. By forcing Ukraine to defend there, military analysts say, Russia is most likely trying to draw Ukrainian forces from other areas where they are on the offensive.
>
>In one of the two main lines of attack, the one aimed at the coastal port of Berdiansk, Ukraine has consolidated gains around the ruined village of Staromaiorske, which it recaptured in late July, and appears to be pushing toward the Russian stronghold of Urozhaine, according to the Ukrainian military and military analysts.
>
>Ukraine has devoted thousands of soldiers, including some of its most experienced and battle-hardened marines, and armor to the campaign drive south down the Mokri Yaly River Valley.
>
>If they can manage to push through or around Urozhaine, that will put them within 50 miles of the two major port cities of Berdiansk and Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. And with each mile they advance, the Ukrainian forces put more pressure on the Russian supply lines.
>
>Hanna Malyar, a Ukrainian deputy defense minister, said on Friday that her country’s forces had achieved “partial successes” in the direction of Urozhaine and south and southeast of Staromaiorske.
>
>The Russian Vostok Battalion, a military outfit fighting in the area, reported on Friday that “artillery from both sides plowed up the neighborhood of Urozhaine so much that some positions were abandoned by us, but the enemy did not dare to claim them either.”
>
>More fighting was reported on Saturday morning by Russian military bloggers as the city remained fiercely contested.
>
>Along the line of attack in the direction of Melitopol, Ukrainian forces reported hard-fought battles but steady progress around the village of Robotyne.
>
>The I.S.W. said of that fight: “The Ukrainian forces’ ability to advance to the outskirts of Robotyne — which Russian forces have dedicated significant effort, time and resources to defend — remains significant even if Ukrainian gains are limited at this time.”
>
>While Ukraine is making gains, he said the advance was being slowed because of the dense minefields and large number of obstacles.
>
>Russian aircraft, he said, are constantly strafing Ukrainian lines, hitting them more than a dozen times in a single day this past week.

I am sure that most people dont choose to keep being citizens of a country, they just are. And Ukraine closed the borders for men, and only men, to leave. So it isnt like ceasing ti be a citizen is an option. Also if we go by social contracts, I think it would be reasonable for non vital rulers and people that actually live well off through the system (lawmakers, governors, etc) to be expected that duty of then. Yet they never are those that get fucked up, it is always the common folk, in particular those in the lower social ladders.

>is that in times of existential crisis they may expect to be called to defend the country that whose benefits they have enjoyed.

Again, who have enjoyed those benefits the most? Certainly not the common folk, much less the poor. It would be the political class in cushy jobs and very wealthy citizens. Yet those are almost never who are sent, quite the opposite.

>That is not immoral, or something that I think anyone has any right to try to dodge.

No one has the right to ask your literal life from you. And if you are asked you have every right to preserve it. Forcing people to die in such a fucked up situation is at the very least an amoral thing. I support Ukraine, the war sucks, Russia in the aggressor and maybe Ukraine has no other choice. But I am still going to call a spade a spade and I am not going to pretend forcing innocent people to become killers and risk being killers is a good thing to do. Specially when it is also based on sex discrimination where being born the wrong sex bans you from leaving a war torn country and opens you into being forced to kill and die. While being born the right one allows you to escape and live a better life in first world safe democracies.

>If they have a conscience objection, then fine; there are plenty of ways their country kind find for them to serve without having to kill someone.

Do you seriously think they would be allowed off combat duty for this? They are being outright discriminated for being the wrong sex, I doubt an objection will get them anywhere but laughed at if not punished.

>But I will not accept that we should just ""allow"" people to shirk their responsibility

Your responsibility should never be to literally die, for the government. That is incredibly fucked up and I wouldnt shame them for doing whatever they can to, survive.

>nor just ""accept"" people whose duty is to induct citizens to be soldier instead choosing to profit off of cravenness.

Don't think for a second the US wouldnt reinstate the draft in a heartbeat if push came to shove and it was needed. A state supplies you with everything needed for you to live a free and happy life. From birth until death. From the hospitals where you are born to the roads you drive on every day, to the infrastructure to let you sit and discuss this on Reddit, to security measures along rivers so floods have less chance at flooding over and killing you. From the stock exchange that lets companies operate so you can have a job to the CDC that helps stop yearly epidemics of measles, smallpox and the black plague. You couldnt *live* without that state in anywhere near the life you want to live. They supply the police and court system that upholds law so you arent murdered the next day.

&nbsp;

In return, sometimes that state has to call on its citizens to risk everything to defend that life and that freedom. And that is a heavy thing to ask, but without it, that state would not exist today and would absolutely fall, 100% certain.

&nbsp;

In the times where the state can solve that security with professional voluntary soldiery, thats great. Its the best solution. But that alone will **not** always be enough. And when it isnt, the state has to have the right to tell you that you must fight in its defence in return for all it gives you. And that is not too much to ask. You not wanting to die, is not good enough reason for you to not have to fight. In a situation where draft is necessary its because the other side is so large, or is itself forcing its citizens to invade you, that a professional army just will not have the manpower and be strong enough to defend. And in that situation, there is *no one* among all your fellow citizens that *want* to die. But if you don't fight, *they* may *all* die.

&nbsp;

Your statement that ""Ukraine just fights because the west is giving it weapons is plain wrong. Oh so wrong. Ukraine started defending with very few western weapons having reached them, and the support to continue that fight is overwhelming domestically there. Every serious military analyst saw years, perhaps decades of insurgency happening even if the regular army fell. 

The argument that ""none of this would have happened if there wasnt a revolution in 2014"" completely misses WHY there was a revolution. Yanukowich was elected on a promise to get closer to Europe and the EU, and then betrayed his promises and was about to bring Ukraine into the same kind of alliance with Russia that Belarus now sees happening; a gradual erosion of the country itself and finally being absorbed by Russia, with all the horrors that entails. Ukraine knew what that meant, *because they have been there before*. Which is **why** they fought in 2014 and are fighting now. And for the people who didn't support it; there's a wide range of very democraticly held surveys that shows most of those that were against in 2014, now are vehemently opposed to Russia. And those that still are not; they'll do what every democratic population does; they'll respect the majority, and yes fight for it.
