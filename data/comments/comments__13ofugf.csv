Numerous postings linked on this thread to twitter accounts, seems to indicate the town is partly occupied by these separatist currently, as well as photos from the border station of Russian Passports IDs presumably captured by the invading separatist.

It shatters Russian propaganda about the country being unified.

I think if you wanted payback against Russia, while staying within US-defined boundaries, while not playing into Russian BS about ""existential threats to the Russian state"", a force of Russian renegades just happening to surface on the wrong side of the Russian border and commence blowing stuff up and causing chaos, is one of the better ways of doing this.

.
.
.
.
.

Russian forces now have to react on their own territory, hold Belarus, fight in the Donbass, defend Bakhmut, defend Crimea, guard against a crossing of the Deniper, guard every single Russian border, prep another wave of mobilisation, and chase militants all over the place, at the same time, while watching Ukraine prepare endlessly for a counter offensive using Western weapons.

.
.
.
.
.

This creates a Clusterfuck, involving an already degraded Russian army, while maintaining support from the west because again Ukraine had nothing to do with the mounting chaos in Belgorod.

.
.
.
.


It also puts Russian supply lines into Luhansk in danger, as well as creates mistrust in the Russian public and military, who will likely now have to be screened for loyalty amongst crackdowns on militants and traitors.

I'm in favour of this on a pragmatic level, because it will create a messy situation in the short term, with potential to spiral out of control if Moscow screws up their response, and those involved can stoke unrest in the Russian military.

A little history of the Belgorod Oblast for anyone worried about strikes in Belgorod being a so-called ""escalation"".

>From 1708 to 1727, the territory of the modern Belgorod Oblast was part of the Kiev and Azov governorates. In 1727, Belgorod Governorate was established from parts of Kiev Governorate. The governorate lasted until 1779. This territory was much greater than that of today, and the governorate incorporated territories modern Kursk, Oryol, and parts of Bryansk and Kharkiv oblasts. The coat of arms of the then-Governorate is still used by the modern Belgorod Oblast.  
>  
>In 1775–1779, the territory of Belgorod Governorate was abolished and divided between the newly formed governorates and vice-royalties. The city of Belgorod and the area around it became a part of Kursk Vice-Royalty, while the southeastern uyezds became a part of Voronezh Governorate.  
>  
>During the 19th century and up until 1928 the territory of modern Belgorod Oblast remained part of the Kursk and Voronezh governorates. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in April 1918, in January 1919 the territory was incorporated into the Ukrainian State under hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi.

TLDR Belgorod was Ukrainian. Seems fair game for Ukraine if they want to restore their historic borders...

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-22-23/index.html

""The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed that an area close to the border with Ukraine was shelled by the Ukrainian armed forces this morning. 

Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that the Graivoronsky urban district had been shelled since 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), but added that no one had been injured.

The villages of Antonovka, Kozinka and Gora-Podol had been hit by shells or debris, Gladkov said.

Border strikes increase: Strikes on the Belgorod region appear to have intensified in recent weeks, according to claims by Russian officials.

Earlier this month, Gladkov claimed two drones had detonated and fell over a residential area in the region.  He added that no casualties were reported, but two residential buildings and a car were damaged.

Another drone was shot down by Russian air defense systems over the region, Gladkov said. The governor said there were no casualties and that response teams are assessing the aftermath on the ground.""",False,1684754449.0,t3_13ofugf,t3_13ofugf,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

This is the start of the real counterattack.  Here is my reasoning... I'd like to hear others thoughts.

EDIT: thanks u/barney-panofsky \- Mark Hertling's post on twitter [https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1660640657218629639?s=20](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1660640657218629639?s=20)

First, the lines were too static and because of that defending against a counter attack would be easier.  I'm not saying it wouldn't work, but it would be difficult.  For months everyone has been talking about where the Ukrainian's would start.

Second, the Russian's have deployed in a way to rapidly reenforce the gaps as they happen.  Again, I'm not saying the Ukrainian's couldn't win, just another percentage against them.

Now, imagine Ukraine and the West have hooked up with this rogue element of Russian freedom fighters.  Since in #2 we have that the Russian's have deployed all their reserves to defend against a counterattack, there will be places that Russia thinks its safe.  Zelensky himself said that Ukraine wouldn't attack Russian soil!

The turn - Well as in politics and war, technically correct is the best kind of correct.  Ukraine didn't attack Russian soil... Russian's did! they are using the old ""Stop hitting yourself"" technique.  This is huge as it will force Russia to redeploy troops to secure their own borders, all the while Ukraine can say ""We didn't do this, these are you own people"".

So now there is chaos, and I mean MAJOR chaos, at the idea that Russian land is contested and Russia needs to take troops off the line to get its land back and faces a major humiliation to the Russian MOD and Putin himself.

Thoughts?

Ninja Edit: I want to be clear, Ukraine is not going to use their equipment or troops in this.  However, this Russian partisan attack was coordinated with Ukraine to have the most effect.  True patriots!

One more Edit: I didn't make it clear, but I inferred... The real Ukrainian counterattack will commence once Russia starts moving troops to get its land back.  There will be an operation, but i believe they will watch to see where to strike based on the troop movement.",1684763455.0,1684762148.0,t3_13ofugf,t3_13ofugf,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

This *is* a shaping maneovure, one of many, drawing forces away from the front-line, and reserves, to enable Ukrainian forces to make greater advances elsewhere.

But right now these anti-Putin Russians will be taking up position and waiting for (frankly) the retribution of pro-Putin forces who will outnumber, outflank and out-equip them. This rising could last days or weeks, but (without significant replenishment) certainly not months.

So although these anti-Putin Russian forces will not know the details, the fact that they received a green light from the UAF may suggest that the counter-offensive is due to begin soon.

Certainly, if I'm an anti-Putin Russian, I don't want to capture and hold part of Belgorod and die in a blaze of glory 7 days later without consequence. What I'd want to do is make Putin bleed, and seemingly only the UAF can do that.

______________________________________________________


ECHO FROM STUDENT YEARS - part three



The first time I saw  Georgi Dimitrov was during the elections for the Grand National Assembly. On that sunny Sunday day he arrived at the polling station in the old building of the Knyazhevo community centre. I saw him, squaring his shoulders, energetically going inside, accompanied by several people. Then, after about ten minutes, he came out in an incredible manner, surrounded by his companions, who were trying to calm him down, while he, burning with anger, was shouting words like ""Bastards! Enemies of the people! Fascists!"" etc. He waved his arms and swore at someone who had remained inside. What had happened? Many elderly Knyazheviks remember and recount this scene. Dimitrov, who had entered, was greeted with a rising to his feet and the attention of the entire election bureau.

""Who here is the advocate of the opposition?"" he asked excitedly.

""I, Mr. Dimitrov,"" called Vasil, the advocate, who also stood up straight out of respect. Vasil was a student of architecture, which he was not allowed to finish, a war hero, one of the most honest and courageous people Knyazhevo knew.

""Are you!"" cried Dimitrov, staggering slightly, ""you know you are a traitor! Do you know whom you serve, and do you know where you will answer!""-suddenly the throat of the ""leader and teacher"" was unloosed, and he screamed an incoherent string of the most insulting and unrestrained words. He was obviously very drunk. And here Vasil suddenly raised his voice and sternly said to him:

""Mr. Dimitrov, on this day when the fate of Bulgaria is being decided, when the voters are not allowed to drink, how dare you, the candidate for deputy, come in here drunk! Leave!""

Having completely lost control of himself, Georgi Dimitrov rushed to hit him, but the tough Knyazhevo villagers had intervened and he had to leave. Subsequently, this confrontation nearly cost Vasil his life. What followed were long years of concentration camps and prisons that erased his youth.





But we, the Polytechnic students, had to study the biography of this guest from Moscow along with our sciences, to repeat his empty phrases and wonder what he had to do with us, with our life, with our Bulgaria. He, the pseudo-hero, the product of purposeful propaganda, could not endure meeting a real, ordinary Bulgarian hero. And that is why he reacted like a vindictive little man who had served someone all his life. Never for a moment did I experience any positive feeling towards this Soviet citizen, from whom the tragedy of our country actually began. One would have to be infinitely blind or infinitely venal not to see that it was Dimitrov who introduced the Soviet style of government in this country, where power is opposed to the common man, it was he who introduced the degrading ritualism of worshipping leaders, of supreme condescension, which even Napoleon did not allow himself. It was he who brought in the black limousines and brought down the heavy curtains between himself and the common people, and it was he who allowed his country to be irreparably plundered and ruined by those who had sent him to colonize it. He introduced methods and customs of which many generations of Bulgarians, even after ten centuries, will read with that sense of shame with which we read today of the intriguing reign of Boril.",False,1684786306.0,t3_13ofugf,t3_13ofugf,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

>MIRGOROD AIR BASE, Ukraine (AFNS) --  More than 140 members of the Air National Guard landed aircraft in Ukraine, preparing for a U.S. European Command-sponsored aerial military-to-military exchange event titled SAFE SKIES 2011.

>A rainbow unit of Air National Guard Airmen comprising members from Alabama, California, Iowa, Washington and Massachusetts flew into a base that until July 16 only had seen use by Mig-29s and Su-27s. Following the advance teams of maintenance and support personnel, seven F-16C Fighting Falcons from Alabama and Iowa cut through the calm, blue Ukrainian sky. The F-16Cs were among the first American fighter jets to touch down in this former Soviet-bloc country.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/22/tech/twitter-fake-image-pentagon-explosion/index.html

>Verified Twitter accounts share fake image of ‘explosion’ near Pentagon, causing confusion

>A fake image purporting to show an explosion near the Pentagon was shared by multiple verified Twitter accounts on Monday, causing confusion and leading to a brief dip in the stock market. Local officials later confirmed no such incident had occurred.

>The image, which bears all the hallmarks of being generated by artificial intelligence, was shared by numerous verified accounts with blue check marks, including one that falsely claimed it was associated with Bloomberg News.

>“Large explosion near the Pentagon complex in Washington DC. – initial report,” the account posted, along with an image purporting to show black smoke rising near a large building.

>The account has since been suspended by Twitter. It was unclear who was behind the account or where the image originated.

>The false reports of the explosion also made their way to air on a major Indian television network. Republic TV reported that an explosion had taken place, showing the fake image on its air and citing reports from the Russian news outlet RT. It later retracted the report when it became clear the incident had not taken place.

>In the moments after the image began circulating on Twitter, the US stock market took a noticeable dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 80 points between 10:06 a.m. and 10:10 a.m., fully recovering by 10:13 a.m. Similarly, the broader S&P 500 went from up 0.02% at 10:06 a.m. to down 0.15% at 10:09 a.m..

I actually don't want to make predictions, because we're now dealing with Russia's nuclear deterrent being raided by hooligans riding on tanks and assorted vehicles.

If somebody can just raid Russia's nuke storage, is Russia's deterrence policy a load of bullshit?

And do we have a massive problem on our hands concerning the safe storage of nuclear weapons?

Even if these guys just overrun the base, keep moving, and leave the nukes alone, where do we go from here if Russia can't even protect this properly?




This has not happened before, this doesn't happen, it is madness, and I'm going to sit and watch whatever commentary I can find on this.

There have been almost zero conceivable scenarios in which a country would ever want to use its nuclear weapons on itself.

If you are target shooter at the highest level of competition you make your own ammunition.  By carefully measuring everything to the highest accuracy ensure the ammunition you use in competition is consistent and thus will make your shots more accurate. Factory ammunition has enough variance that this will make the difference between winning and losing. 

There are also hunters who make their own ammunition, they save money (though probably not if they count their time). 

Of course we are talking about war here. The type of person doing the above will use/make as much ammunition in a year as a solder in battle would use in 5 minutes.  They are also saving their empties and bring them back home to refill (until they fail inspection and are recycled), while a solder will leave the empties on the ground as it is not safe to pick them up.

Need to throw so much bullcrap into the information space that it contributes to the atmosphere of paranoia, mistrust, and mayhem.

In Zelenskyy's place I would be directing the PR team towards memes about Belgorod People's Republic, People's Republic of Belgorod, internal strife, everything I can think of.

A Firehose Of Lies needs to be employed to add to the fuckery, and to take as little responsibility as possible.

Moscow is never going to believe that a bunch of Good Little Russians decided to screw them over in the middle of a war, but ideally they won't know what to think, and will be able to prove even less.

My ideal is that Moscow wastes weeks flailing around and pissing off its own people.

And on the American level, the United States will want to maintain the streak of no invasions of a nuclear power, will want to maintain the current Washington Kyiv relationship as is,

 will definitely not want indirect responsibility for an invasion of Russia, and Biden cannot be seen to endorse an offensive into Russia 18 months before an election against a pro-Russia candidate, because he will either get Wartime President polling, or will be seen to have lost control of a major European conflict.

Basically they need something to take to CNN, ABC, Fox, and C-Span, that's not an armoured counter-invasion of the Russian Federation, and need to cover their asses, which means that they didn't just help  pay for Ukraine to invade Russia.

On an official level, The BPR wanted no part in a genocidal war against a sister country, and decided to preempt the next mobilisation by defying direct orders from Moscow, ending her involvement in the war, and flinging open the border to anyone who wants a shot at freedom or to fight for their family.

They also felt that based on the existence of the LPR, and DPR, Moscow could be expected to recognise a democratically elected independent breakaway state in the region, with currency, flags, and a 70 per cent approval of statehood when put to a vote.

Containment procedure: Personnel are to regularly post accurate information about the state of the Russian invasion to /r/noncredibldefense .  Personnel should also consult the attached list of memes found in /r/noncredibldefense  and update it regularly. If an event occurring matching one of the memes occurs, personnel are to alert Team 42A, which will then produce media containing making the events described by the meme sound plausible. 

Description: SCP #9340 is an anomalous reality-altering phenomenon where extreme memes posted to the noncredibldefense subreddit alter reality surrounding the ongoing Russian was with Ukraine to cause them to actually happen. The more implausible content in the subreddit, the stronger observed effect. Thus, having SCP personnel regularly post reasonable analysis and actual facts about military equipment in the comment threads reduces the rate of occurrence. 

Comment by Dr. Terstein, project manager for SCP #9340 regarding proposals to downgrade this anomaly to Euclid: ""There has been some question about the Keter designation for this SCP. Please keep in mind that the anomaly's overall ability to alter reality is unclear. We have seen memes in the subreddit involving Gundamn, so-called ""Angels"" from the anime ""Evangelion"", and Vladimir Zelensky becoming dictator of Earth while Putin is revealed to be an incompetent alien puppet. Our reality being altered to have any of these become accurate would at minimum constitute a Class III reality-altering event, and would also potentially endanger both the existence of life on Earth, and the existence of the Foundation. As amusing as this anomaly is, it must be treated with the utmost seriousness. The Keter designation stands.""",1684775175.0,1684774944.0,t3_13ofugf,t1_jl6bude,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

The thought that Ukraine could actually draw Russia to a stale mate, much less outright win the war has only been a recently widespread idea. Until Ukraine successfully kicked Russia out of Kyiv last year the idea of a quick victory was nigh impossible. 

Now with the slow drip of increasing capability by Ukraine has trapped Russia in a sort of frog in slowly boiling water scenario, where if during the onset things where to rapidly deteriorate for Russia the chance of a drastic and paradigm shifting escalation (i.e. going nuclear) was a very real concern.

Drawing Russian blood over time has forced Russia to commit and lose more than it otherwise would have potentially allowed.

Because Oryx isn't god. He knows more than we do, but he doesn't know everything. As the unanswered reply to the tweet in question says: ""Why does Oryx data correlate with the Ukrainian data? Are you making it up?""

I don't think the Ukrainian data is 100% accurate, that would be stupid. But their numbers have correlated strongly with Oryx's open source 100% confirmed destroyed vehicles, at a consistent 2:1 ratio.
