- You are on the territory of a foreign country and take part in the war crimes of the russian leadership.

- Every day you are thrown to the slaughter.

- For your command, you are expendable.

- Nobody counts losses.

- Ask yourself the question: “Who are you fighting for?”

- For the fear of your leaders to lose power?

- For their lifestyle, stolen from you and your families?

- For their stupidity and incompetence?

- Ukraine has never threatened the russian federation.

- Today you are not at war with NATO, no matter how much kremlin propagandists tell you about it.

- You are fighting against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine are protecting their people and their country from your aggression.

- We are ready to protect our homes, families, children and future to the last.

- Think about your families too!

- Your loved ones need living, healthy fathers, husbands and sons, they need you at home.

- Life is not given to carry out the criminal orders of the putin regime.

- Save your life and future — refuse to participate in putin’s bloody war!

- Lay down your arms for your safe and peaceful future!

- The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine offers you to surrender and return home.

- All those who have surrendered are guaranteed control over the observance of their rights by the International Organization of the Red Cross.

- All those who surrendered are registered as captured in combat. This allows you to avoid persecution by the russian special services and guarantees that all the due payments will be saved for you.

- Those russian servicemen who fear persecution by the russian authorities and do not wish to return to the russian federation on exchange will receive protection and asylum on the territory of Ukraine.

- In addition, we offer a decent monetary reward for the voluntary surrender of weapons, military equipment and ammunition to the Ukrainian army.

- This is not a betrayal, this is the normal reaction of normal people to a criminal war.

- In order to surrender by prior arrangement, you need to contact representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by **calling the round-the-clock hotline:  +38 066 580 34 98, +38 093 119 29 84 or use the chat bot “I want to live” in the Telegram messenger**.

- If you cannot contact us yourself, do it through your family and friends.

- In the event of a complete lack of communication,  you can communicate your willingness to surrender by fulfilling the following conditions: having gone to the area of the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, loudly declare your desire to surrender;  defuse the weapon, disconnect the magazine; indicate your desire to surrender with a white material (flag, visible bandage in a weapon); follow all the instructions of the Ukrainian military personnel.

- Save your life!

- Save your honor and dignity!

- Return to your families and live a peaceful life!

- This is better than being a dead occupier in a foreign land.

- Make the right choice.

He and his men were behind enemy lines, got hit/concussed/unconscious, they were captured as POWs.  

He has a trident tat on his neck, and because he’s (or believed he’s) SSO, brutalized him—including metal bat on back, cracking multiple vertebrae.  [photos included] The men had been stripped, even the boots stolen, tied up—and kept outside, in March.  

The Russians debated what to do with their captives.  At first, they wanted to dump them in an open field, then shoot at them “like rabbits” while try to run. Then decided to put *Viking* on a tank with a white flag, send him to where other Ukrainian reconnaissance were hiding, so they’d see that a commander was surrendering, they’d come out, then Russians would kill them all. 

After more brutalizing—which *Viking* said he refused to show pain, bc of some tough guy mentality—the Russians decided to show off their captured men to the commanders, so got in a convoy of various military vehicles . . . [sorta confusing here] but the Russian convoy ended up being attacked *by its own.* 

He explains that there were various groups—Belarusian mercenaries, Buryats and other Tuvans, and Syrians [although he might mean Syrian vets?] and they were very uncoordinated.  A tank in convoy went ahead, then turned and shot at the convoy, so they started going back, then there was a land mine.  The Ukrainian POWs are in a transport truck, had been told if any has ties loosened, they’d all be shot.  But the Russians in the tank opened the hatch, asked for help from the POWs—referred to them as ‘brothers’ but the endearing/diminuative form!—the Russians were concussed and dazed.  He says instead, shut hatch, all ran off.

They had to run, evading pursuit, 12 hours, unclothed and barefoot, to get back.

They saw the men again, later in the war.  At Severdonetsk, trying to cross on pontoons.

In mid-October Putin handed special powers to regional authorities across Russia and created an influential new government body that is charged with coordinating supplies to the military. The responsibility for unpopular new measures will be delegated to regional officials.

In Putin’s new setup, Shoigu has been informally demoted. When the Crimean Bridge was attacked, he lost his position as a battlefield leader. Instead, Putin placed General Sergei Surovikin in charge of Russia’s forces in Ukraine. Now, even military logistics have been taken away from the Defense Ministry, leaving Shoigu as a rank-and-file member of Mishustin’s Coordination Council. Shoigu is only entrusted with menial tasks, such as calling his foreign counterparts to frighten them with tall tales of a Ukrainian “dirty bomb” plot.

>Prisoners recruited to a notorious Russian paramilitary are being tortured and executed by their commanders, according to a Russian anti-torture NGO.  
Convicts serving in the Wagner Group had fingers cut off for offences such as using their phones and arguing with superiors, reported the Gulagu.net project, citing correspondence with prisoners at the frontline.  
Prisoners were allegedly threatened not to try to escape or they would be shot, and shown a video of a prisoner being skinned alive as a warning. “If you run, we will catch you… you will die for a very long time,” a prisoner was told, according to research published by independent Russian media outlet, The Insider.  
Paramilitary officers have executed prisoners in their units, the NGO alleged. “In a training camp near Luhansk, Wagner overseers shot three convicts from a Volgograd Region’s penal colony for allegedly failing to comply with requirements and violating orders. The men did not train ‘as they should,’” Gulagu.net reported.  
The group estimates that around 100 prisoners serving in Wagner units have been executed to date, and claims that bodies are routinely burned to hide the evidence of torture.

The mayor of Melitopol did not flee when the Russians attacked on February 24.  It became occupied shortly thereafter.  The citizens resisted, blocking the movement of tanks with protests.  He wrote, “My entire team worked in the city under one condition: That the Ukrainian flag remains in the main square of the city.”  This continued until he was taken prisoner on March 11th, then he was released on March 16th in exchange for some Russian soldiers.  After his release, he went to the city of Zaporizhzhya.  He stays in contact (remotely online) with people from the [temporarily] occupied city.  He estimates 65% of its citizens left as refugees; he’s in contact with some of them.  He knows of 700 citizens of Melitopol who have been kidnapped.

Why would they write this about Melitopol?

Melitopol has—since day 1—been THE city of resistance.  No other place has had such an active, almost daily, resistance—I’m not talking about letters.  I’m talking about killing the collaborators.  They have lines to get supplies from recon of UA military, can get a few weapons and chemicals in, and have never ceased their blatant resistance. 

Plus, Melitopol is a place that’s 75/25 Russian language to Ukrainian.


That movement was BORN in Mariupol—which is more like 95/5—it’s because all the partisans have been killed, the only resistance that can be done is a simple letter.  No access to anything that can be used to sabotage.  In Mariupol, where Ukrainian has always been rare, that simple letter was a quiet demonstration of resistance.

I see two likely scenarios here, one favoring each side. One, this is Russia withdrawing its soldiers and hollowing out behind the front line so that those on the front can easily retreat and there will be less of a mad scramble to get across the river. Or two, Russia has reinforced their front lines enough that they no longer think Kherson is in any danger of falling and can reduce the military presence there.

I don't know what to believe right now, but I think a key town to watch is Snihurivka, the last significant town controlled by Russia in Mykolaiv and controls a major highway to Kherson.

Ukraine has about 43 million people and is about the size of Texas.  Why did Russia think they could pull this off using only mobilizing a little over 0.1 percent of their population?  If only 1 percent of Ukraine mobilizes to fight back, they'd be outnumbered three to one.  And I suspect the actual situation right now is probably worse than that for Russia.

Compare this to the Red Army in World War II:

>During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army conscripted 29,574,900 men in addition to the 4,826,907 in service at the beginning of the war. Of this total of 34,401,807 it lost 6,329,600 killed in action (KIA), 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 missing in action (MIA) (most captured). Of these 11,444,000, however, 939,700 rejoined the ranks in the subsequently liberated Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity. Thus the grand total of losses amounted to 8,668,400.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red\_Army#Second\_World\_War\_(%22The\_Great\_Patriotic\_War%22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army#Second_World_War_(%22The_Great_Patriotic_War%22))

It's hard to even imagine a war effort on that scale.  But Russia doesn't have the motivation to mobilize that many people or the manufacturing base to supply that kind of army.  Eventually they're just going to run out of missiles and artillery and helicopters and jets, and probably ammunition, food, and guns.

Except I disagree with the notion that coup won’t happen bc some of the power players lack fellow elite contacts and swarms of loyal armed men.  For one, that’s just inaccurate, as Patrushev has commandeered huge swaths of Naryshkin’s men, commands great respect in the media, and his own son’s name is tossed around as a possible successor—he lacks an enforcement mechanism, though; Bortnikov has an enormous department (true, they’re motivated by corruption, but if this can be guaranteed—for example that FSB assumed all intel and enforcement—they’d back a coup); several governors revolting would cause a domino effect, yes; the article overlooks a Kremlin-insider coup (Volodin, Matviyenko, Mishustin, etc) and sometimes, the quiet/likable/competent one has indeed secured/stole the alliance/allegiance from right under your nose (ahem, Mishustin).  

But the article also overlooks a factor necessary—Zolotov—yes, on paper he runs the guard.  In reality, he runs the guard, FSO, and SBP.  
Andrei Soldatov says you can’t turn the FSO and SBP against Zolotov, or Zolotov against Putin.  That they’ve been whipped into full allegiance for 20 years, known nothing else.  So Putin can’t be coup’d.   (He also says this about FSB, but for a different reason.) so the security forces scattering I don’t think is feasible. 

Andrei Kozyrev says that personal pressure could oust—as in several powerful people walk in, announce he’s retired.  (This is where the author was going with the connections bit—yes, these top of echelons are very fractured.)  the thing is, there’s so few men who’d have access unannounced (he doesn’t live in Moscow)—can’t just appear there. And there’s less than 10 he meets with one-on-one.

It says that in the months before the invasion, the Ukrainian military trained people in resistance activities in anticipation of potential occupation: using car bombs, sabotage, explosives, stashing weapon caches, performing targeted killings with pistols with silencers.    

The article also says there is a branch of the underground called Blue Ribbon that does nonviolent activities such as posting leaflets and graffiti.  Teachers who are Russian collaborators have been targets of humiliating leaflets.  I haven't read any specific examples of spelling substitutions in Melitopol, but a family in [temporarily] occupied Mariupol noted that the Russians substituted their letter in the [city's entrance sign](https://twitter.com/alexgiamby/status/1535512700192702464).

 >The Charge of the Light Brigade was a failed military action involving the British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan had intended to send the Light Brigade to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from overrun Turkish positions, a task for which the light cavalry were well-suited. However, there was miscommunication in the chain of command and the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire.

For comparison, over nearly 16 years in Iraq, the US performed 189,167 emergency surgical procedures (best source I could find). Or about 32 per day across the entire theater, covering major to minor surgeries for soldiers, civilians, and adversaries. 

Russia likely needs to be operating at about 750-1100 per day, which they will be expected to do with less skill, poor and missing equipment, no logistics, longer evac times, no international support, and an overloaded system that has no fallback. Imagine how long a single combat related surgery takes, and multiply by 1000 each day.

Losing a soldier to injury or death every 30 seconds is definitely unsustainable for making war.

Providing lifetime care for over 200,000 wounded in action (so far) is going to slow the economy and overburden the health system for decades. 

Many of those wounded in action will suffer for life (or have a very short life) due to the slow and inadequate trauma care they get today.

I think Putin would draft million if not several million. Just to occupy the proclaimed annexed territories. Drag this war out a few years.

It is true that sending clothes to poor countries doesn't help them economically. This is not us trying to help Ukraine economically. This is us trying to provide clothing for Ukrainians who will need extra ones when heat is off this winter. 

You are applying studies from a totally different case to this one. When donating to poor countries, the issue is that donations replace what would develop as domestic industries to meet the demand, thus throttling growth. This is not the case in Ukraine. 

In Ukraine, there is an acute shortage of supplies, a shortage that will not exist after the war ends. The supply crisis exists because war creates a very specific set of conditions where you need more clothing, socks, boots, etc. this is because people spend more time outside, heating cuts, electricity cuts, etc. This demand will not exist after the war. 

That means that there is no industry being throttled, because the donations are a response to a short term issue. It's very much like how Florida doesn't need to build a water bottle factory and that donating water somehow is going to throttle their water industry after a hurricane. These are abnormal conditions. 

Shipping costs are also relatively easy given the high amount of trade between Europe and America. 

TLDR: your studies are talking about donations replacing domestic industry growth, but in Ukraine, the problems are short term and Ukraine does not need a post war industry in these   materials unlike the countries in the study, because the excess demand exists because of the war and will end after the war, unlike the chronic problems that donations cannot fix.

>🔻In the past months, the production facilities in the Tesla building have become the main center for electronics and control units for missiles and rockets.

The stalemate over the river appears to be ideal for Ukraine for the moment as it would mean Mykolaiv Oblast is finally cleared and retaking the only administrative center lost in Kherson city would be massive. Defending those areas would become much easier then.

This is exactly the wrong way to look at this.  Mykolaiv and southwest Ukraine have not been under serious threat since the first month of the war.  

Yeah, you free up a few Ukrainian brigades to go east, but you also free up Russia to concentrate *all of their southern forces* along the Zaporizhia front, and you liberate Russia from their most difficult logistical challenge.  A geographically compact front line benefits Russia *far* more than Ukraine.

I also couldnt care less about your irrational fear that ""they'd nuke Ukraine just because they feel like they could get away with it"". First of all it s not a fear that you or I need to deal with, its for *Ukraine* to process. And they have made it very clear that they have calculated with that risk and it is a risk they are willing to take, and that it would not stop them fighting. And that makes sense militarily, because trying to change the battlefield in Ukraine in any significant way using nukes, except very locally, is not possible. This is not a day and age where 1600 tanks are amassed on a line opposite each other. Using a single nuke would propell Russia into an abyss of universal condemnation, and even China, India and the few other supporter states they have would cut them off immediatly. No one wants nukes in play, anywhere. So as long as Ukraine accepts that risk, the *least* we can do is support them.

It's a bloodbath there with really heavy fighting going on and loses on both sides. It is insane. I hope when this will end someone will be able to describe it in details - those battles will be studied for years. 

Russians sometimes are showing videos of their success - imagine this. A few battalions, dozens of armored vehicles, 4 days of artillery preparations. 1.5km to the objective (small town defended by Ukrainians). Only two platoons of special forces were able to reach and hold a small estate on the southern part of the town. The remaining RU forces had to turn back under pressure of Ukrainian fire. This was a successful attack in the Russian books (happened a few days ago). Ukrainians reported that on that day defending that town from this single attack they destroyed 12-16 armored vehicles and killed over a hundred soldiers (source: Twitter, Ukrainian MoD). 

In general it's very hard to get any information what's going on in that area, but from time to time you can gather enough information to paint a picture like  above. Russians are desperately trying to put enough pressure near Donetsk to force Ukraine to break an attack on Svatove (where there is really not many experienced troops and mostly the defending forces consist of freshly mobilized soldiers in fortified positions). If Ukraine will hold and will be able to get to Svatove and then continue south - it will create very difficult situation for forces in Donetsk.

The war has roughly stalemated already and Ukraine has never launched an offensive towards Melitopol. In order to prevent fatigue from Ukraine's allies, showing progress is vital. The Kharkiv offensive was a huge boon to solidify more support and the Kherson offensive added to that. Another one that retakes the city and entire right bank of the river would be huge.

Ah, so being able to attack key supply lines is completely unimportant now. Gotcha. Right now, they can barely stop what gets to Kherson and can only attack it as it arrives. Taking Kherson means they can drastically narrow the routes from Crimea to Melitopol. It means forcing Russian aircraft back to Crimea.

The nature of every war necessitates front lines constricting. That's just how it works. Using your logic, retaking most of Kharkiv Oblast was a strategic failure because it constricted the front line. Now, from Yampil to the north, it's about 80 miles. Before the offensive, it was closer to 200 miles, if not more. So I disagree with you that this was a failure. It was still a moral and tactical victory even by compressing the front.

One, that was all regained before the mobilization. Mobilized troops may not be worth a whole lot in battle, but they can still plug holes that existed prior to it and makes moving forward much slower.

>The nature of every war necessitates front lines constricting. 

Completely ahistorical.  Battles between modern armies are often won by flanking a line or conducting a long siege.  The goal is to reduce your enemy's fighting capability -- the usual reason why a front constricts is because one side no longer has the manpower or the resources to maintain a broad front.  Shrinking the front is an **effect** of earlier defeats, rather than a cause of impending defeat.  ""Compressing the front"" without capturing or eliminating the Russian units in Kherson is zero benefit to the war effort against Russia.  Negative benefit really, as previously stated.

""Compressing the front"" without capturing or eliminating the Russian units in Kherson is zero benefit to the war effort against Russia. Negative benefit really, as previously stated.

I never once said flanking or a siege wasn't an option. Hell, I specifically have said the Ukrainians would siege Kherson to force out Russians instead of assaulting the city. I also said the reasons for success in Kharkiv were due to flanking maneuvers around key towns. But what you're ignoring is that these actions are what led to shrinking lines. As Ukraine retakes territory, we see Russia pull back and reestablish lines. At some point, those gaps the Ukrainians exploited will no longer exist, which we are seeing now.

But flanking maneuvers work precisely because one side doesn't shorten their lines to address weaknesses, and to call it ahistorical is just a lie. [Operation Alberich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Alberich) of WWI is just one example of that.

> Literally Grant's Virginia campaign in the Civil War was the exact opposite of what you're talking about. His whole plan was to force the Confederates to stretch over a wider and wider front until their position became completely untenable.

""Modern armies win by flanking, as proof, here's a campaign from the Civil War."" That's just hilarious, I'm sorry. And you may also recall that the Virginia campaign was, at best, a stalemate.

> If you don't understand the difference between Russia maintaining a front in Izium and Russia maintaining a front in Kherson, you're wasting my time.

One was a front far from the Russian's key supply hubs and the other is a front far from the Russian's key supply hubs. I get it, totally different! But seriously, Russia retreated from Izyum when it become to difficult to defend. Ukraine didn't decisively defeat them, they retreated and shortened their lines.

> The point is that ""showing progress"" is just fluffy nonsense and before or after mobilization is more fluffy nonsense. If the fate of the war supply actually relied on a major territory liberation news story every 2 months then you might as well surrender now. Fortunately, that's not reality. 

Hand-waving away progress as ""fluffy nonsense"" is exactly how you get into stalemates. Your naive belief that there are zero limits for Western support to Ukraine isn't based in reality. We saw what happened in Syria once the Western-backed militias proved unable to overthrow Assad, we just kind of walked away. Same will happen in Ukraine. The spotlight will shift, progress will halt, the desire or need to supply more weapons to a stalemate will slowly start to bubble up more and more. Luckily, Ukraine doesn't listen to people like you and understands that the perception of the conflict outside of Ukraine is vitally important to keeping the supplies flowing. They're not idiots.

> You are literally making my point for me. It becomes exponentially more difficult to launch an offensive in this area after Russia reinforces it with units and supplies from Kherson.

You're acting like Russia is completely clueless to all these factors, and that's why your take is so detached from reality. Russia isn't a car stuck in drive, they can throw it in reverse if they need to. If they think Kherson is untenable for them to hold and it will benefit them, they may choose to retreat across the river to shorten their own lines and strengthen other areas. This isn't just a decision Ukraine can make and they're not going to fight to make sure Russia stays on the right bank of the river.

Right, but as previously stated this is about more than just ""shorter lines"".  Russia's new lines in Izium actually complicated their supply situation in the north, as opposed to abandoning Kherson which will simplify their supply situation in the south.

The scale is just not remotely comparable to the benefit Russia receives from not trying to defend ground west of the Dniper.

Russia is still going to occupy most of Kherson Oblast and need to defend the line. They are still going to need to supply them and there will be ample targets to weaken those supply depots. Targeting those areas will make it easier for Ukrainian forces to push into Kherson Oblast from Zaporizhzhia if they launch an offensive from there. They'll have entire fire control over the region and could hit targets from relative safety from the other side of the river. You are just extremely short-sighted here.

> Again. I said ""ahistorical"" to your absolutist assertion that ""The nature of every war necessitates front lines constricting."" That is fundamentally ahistorical. It's not the nature of ""every war"", as I demonstrated.

As the Russians pushed back the Germans in WWII, the Germans constricted their lines. As the Allies pushed the Germans back in France, they constricted their lines. As the South was being defeated in Louisiana and Tennessee, the lines constricted. The Finnish abandoned much of their territory to constrict their lines in the Winter War. In other cases, as I've shown, an army will make the decision to constrict their own lines. The fact that you're arguing that lines don't get shorter as an attacker pushes forward is baffling. You seem to think there is one line in a war and if you break it, then the war's over. That's not how it works.

> It was a stalemate until Grant took command. If you're going to comment on the history, you should learn it. 

Grant's strategy was a war of attrition. It was ""throw soldiers at Lee because I can replace them and they can't"" because this was nearing the end of the war after Grant had already ravaged the Deep South. Sure, it worked, but those battles were fought face-to-face, nothing like today's battles.

> Right, but as previously stated this is about more than just ""shorter lines"". Russia's new lines in Izium actually complicated their supply situation in the north, as opposed to abandoning Kherson which will simplify their supply situation in the south.

Untrue, and evidence of lack of knowledge on the front. Izyum was the major forward operating area for the Russians in that area Kharkiv. It also was vital to keeping areas closer to Kharkiv city supplied, like Balakliya. The only rail line to that area ran through Izyum and it's no coincidence that the Russian front line stopped there and ran northwest/southeast of Izyum. Izyum only became untenable because Ukraine was at Kupyansk, effectively cutting it

> The scale is just not remotely comparable to the benefit Russia receives from not trying to defend ground west of the Dniper.

Never compared the scale, but the situation facing Russia is relatively similar. Supply lines threatened/cut and threat of encirclement.

> Comparing this to Syria is a fucking joke. You don't think maybe the infighting, the extremism, the ISIS maybe played some role in the supply decisions there?

If you want to talk about jokes, you compared this to the US Civil War! But with stalemates come fractionalization and that opens the door for extremism. Good to know you think that can only happen in the Middle East and would never happen in Europe!

Of course it's relevant. Just because you naively believed that there was going to be an assault on Kherson doesn't change that that there never was going to be one. Zelenskyy even said as much a few weeks or month ago. The discussion is whether or not Ukraine should retake Kherson. You say let Russia keep it based on the idea that this will lead to magical offensives elsewhere, whereas the rest of us say Ukraine should retake it as both a morale boost and to better disperse their limited weaponry to other important areas that don't have a natural defensive line.

Except that has nothing to do with why we were discussing Izium in this context.  You made the absurd comparison that the strategic results of the Russian withdrawal from Izium and consolidation on the Svatove front are comparable to the strategic results that will come from Russia's withdrawal from Kherson and consolidation along the southern front.  Leaving Izium was a damage to Russia's logistics while gaining only slight consolidation of forces.  Leaving Kherson actually eases Russia's supply problem while gaining a significant consolidation of forces along more defensible terrain.

You think they won’t utilize them just because you think they’re afraid of pissing off defense companies? If the choice is “piss of defense companies” and “blackmail material that ruins my career gets released”, which do you think they’ll choose?

And “political difficulties”

The whole fucking point is that they’ll be charge. They won’t have to worry about those. The republicans aren’t playing by the same rules they historically have. Their goal is complete lasting control of our government. If they have to piss off a defense company, so what? If Republicans control the purse strings, the defense companies won’t say shit. 

And you’re whole argument is essentially “It hasn’t happened before so it won’t happen in the future” as if a bunch of unprecedented shit hasn’t happened recently. We’ve never had a non-peaceful transfer of power. We’ve never had American’s invade the capitol looking to kill elected leaders.  A lot of shit has happened that never happened previously.

Here I’ll do it in grown up terms to help make you feel better. Now, understand, the numbers I’m using are purely for demonstrative purposes. They aren’t accurate. 

We give the military industrial complex $100,000,000. Of that $100,000,000, only $10,000,000 goes to Ukraine. The republicans take office and they pass a bill giving $10,000,000 in funding to X (again, this could be anything). That means the military industrial complex is getting $110,000,000. Then, they cut funding to Ukraine, this removes $10,000,000 which brings it back down to $100,000,000. 

Now, the military industrial complex is still get the same amount they initially were ($100,000,000) but now it’s going to something the Republicans like instead of Ukraine.

Also, please read what I wrote. In that scenario, no one redirected anything. They simply passed funding for a cause they agree with then later stopped funding to Ukraine. 

Completely separate as far as funding goes. 

They could pass a bill providing $10,000,000 of funding to Haiti. Meanwhile, they can also use all the tricks in their book to holdup aid to Ukraine.

Oh my god, it was a fucking example. Not the actual fucking thing they would do. All it would take to please them is to ensure those companies get the same amount of money regardless.

First of all, that’s purely hypothetical and doesn’t negate what I’ve said. Second, have you never worked in the defense industry? 

That type of shit happens all the time. Projects get cut half-way through, deployments are halted, and requirements change. I’ve personally seen numerous programs end prematurely because needs change. 

Hell, my entire childhood was spent moving because my parents worked for various defense companies as contractors and the programs they were working on would lose funding or the contracts would be cancelled. 

I’ve personally been furloughed while working for General Dynamics because funding and needs changed. 

That isn’t new or unheard of or even fucking rare.
