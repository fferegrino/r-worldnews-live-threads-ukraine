Meanwhile, the Ukrainians would raid the Russian lines in small groups night after night, wearing them down.”  Jed’s observation echoed a conversation I’d had the day before with Andriy Zagorodnyuk. After Russia’s invasion of the Donbas in 2014, Zagorodnyuk oversaw a number of reforms to the Ukrainian military that are now bearing fruit, chief among them changes in Ukraine’s military doctrine; then, from 2019 to 2020, he served as minister of defense.

*Each participating State has an equal right to security. We reaffirm the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve. Each State also has the right to neutrality. Each participating State will respect the rights of all others in these regards. They will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other States. Within the OSCE no State, group of States or organization can have any pre-eminent responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the OSCE area or can consider any part of the OSCE area as its sphere of influence.*

Obviously Russia's word means nothing and they will do and/or say whatever they want. 

However, it just pisses me off when some academics (Chomsky, Mearsheimer are the 2 that come to mind) try to blame the West/NATO. 

Firstly, each sovereign country has the right to determine its own alliances, treaties, etc. (I believe this is an inherent right, but nonetheless its explicitly stated in a documents signed by both Ukraine and Russia). Any talk of ""Ukraine should be a neutral/buffer state"" completely violates the sovereignty of Ukraine. I understand Ukraine may agree to or even want this if it ends the war, and I don't begrudge them that (after all, as a sovereign nation they are free to choose their own alliances or lack thereof), but honestly for any academic to suggest this is completely insulting to Ukraine's sovereignty.  

Secondly, another big talking point of these types is  ""but NATO promised to not expand eastward."" I have never seen any formal document that states this. At best it was a reference to german reunification/east germany NATO status that was discussed during negotiations at the time, but it is ridiculous (and by that I mean false) to say that NATO violated some agreement when they admitted former Soviet states

Seeing a few opinions floating around that says “Russia have said this - clearly they’re not ready to negotiate or retreat” or along those lines.

Historically, with military blunders such as this one, the de-escalation comes as quite a sudden, unexpected surprise. Could come from anywhere - sudden change in policy, or a rapid breakdown of supply lines/troop morale, mass route of RU forces, desertion… 

Basically, IF this conflict comes to an end in the near-future, it won’t be something we see from afar as it gradually draws near. More likely is that we will continue seeing escalation, more fighting talk, until it goes “poof” and everything comes to a grinding halt in a matter of hours/days.

#Biden Calls for Russia to Be Removed From G-20

Thursday, March 24, 2022 05:49 PM By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --Germany and Italy were among countries which said any effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to charge in rubles for gas would be a violation of their contracts. President Joe Biden called for removing Russia from the G-20.

Group of Seven leaders warned Putin against deploying biological, chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Earlier Thursday, NATO agreed to double the number of battle groups protecting its eastern border and prepare for Russia to potentially use such weapons in Ukraine.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance is sending more aid to Ukraine and equipment to help the country prepare for possible biological or nuclear incidents by Russia. He spoke in Brussels.

The heightened military readiness underscores the intense pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders gathered in Brussels for meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and the Group of Seven leading economies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scolded NATO leaders for not responding to his plea for a no-fly zone over Ukraine and asked for more weapons for his military to fight off Russia’s invasion. He also called on G-7 leaders to tighten sanctions on Russia.",False,1648145252.0,t3_tms6l5,t3_tms6l5,,0,83,0,83,0,0,

Day 29 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

A month of war has gone by and it still remains just as unimaginable as it was at the start. A war with no real goal, it only continues to inflict more suffering to regular people, and for what reason? If Putin is serious about everything going according to his plan then the only explanation is that he must be the western spy that has a goal of destroying Russia and uniting the west.

Just after I wrote about everything being quiet yesterday our downtown was hit by Kalibrs from a Russian warship, and today 6 people were killed by shelling while standing in queue trying to get humanitarian aid. Locations where humanitarian aid can be obtained are public information, so this must have been done intentionally to kill civilians.

Answering the question from u/Mazon_Del about currently occupied territories and what people think should be done is a wide topic and most people will have different stances on it, so I will give some of my opinions.

Starting with Donetsk and Luhansk, at this point we are not even sure who lives on the territories occupied by LDPR, I had classmates from Donetsk who ran away when the war started and I have a current groupmate from university who is also a refugee from there. 

None of them were ever persecuted for being from those territories. They ran to “Nazis” who apparently kill everyone that talks in Russian (complete bullshit) but the “Nazis” (who actually mostly talk in Russian as well) here helped them instead. 

The people that are left in LDPR chose the ABSOLUTE WORST course of action in 2014. You don’t fight for your rights by taking the territory you live on and fucking off to Russia. You need to stay and represent your position in the country you actually live in by electing politicians that will represent your interests. At this point there’s a divide between LDPR and the rest of Ukraine, and I don’t know if it can be mended, this is something that only the time can tell.

Now Crimea is a completely different beast from LDPR and is a really difficult question to answer. I will just talk about my experience here. I was in Sevastopol on vacation with my parents in 2011, 2012 and 2013 so just up to it being annexed. 

It felt different from the rest of Ukraine instead of Ukrainian flags there were Russian flags everywhere, even a lot of drivers in public transport had Russian flags by the driver’s seat. And of course the Russian navy was also stationed there before occupation so they had their military force here to begin with. People there also mostly called themselves Russian. 

After they occupied it people there also got Russian passports instead of Ukrainian. Some people we knew who also lived in Crimea said that their life got better after occupation but we don’t exactly know a lot of people from there. In the end I don’t know if we can take Crimea back, if we try to take it back by force Putin will absolutely say that this is a threat to Russia’s existence and launch nukes. You know what happens next, it would be better to avoid it. Before we even think about Crimea we need to win the war on every other front.

However, apparently, the Armenians vouched for him, saying they’d recently spoken.  This claim is may be specious: 
> Shoigu discussed the current situation in the region and in the areas where Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh are performing their tasks. Armenian Defense Ministry reported that they affected the situation in the Askeran district and the situation on the line of contact. But note that some Russian media reported an aggravation of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, and that the Azerbaijani armed forces went on the offensive in Karabakh, taking advantage of the sending of Russian soldiers to Ukraine.

1. Every city or region that has been captured can be recaptured. This isn't like a video game where if you finish one level you go on to the next and you can't lose the progress made on the previous level. Around Kyiv dozens of villages have been recaptured by Ukr forces. Hostomel has changed hands about 5 times until now. No reason to be demoralized about one city or region in particular.
2. Mariupol is right next to the Russian lines and the Russians have wasted thousands of people just trying to capture it while bombing it to the ground for ONE MONTH. This was a city with a high Russian speaking population that was quite favourable to Russia before the war. It's a morale victory at best if they ""capture"" it and it's very difficult claim any capture since the city is razed to the ground already.
3. Ukrainians have already began to recapture territory in almost al parts of Ukraine with heavy loses for the Russian side.
4. Russia doesn't have unlimited personnel and will eventually run out of people they can send to the meat grinder. Yeah they can take one city with thousands of troop loses but they can't do this to every city and village. And it's gonna be a big problem for them long term.

I am writing this because you might be seeing some disinformation campaign in the next couple of days ala ""Mariupol has fallen UKR better surrender"". No UKR should not do any of that. They should do what they have done with great success so far: defend and recapture territory from the Russian imperialistic zerg swarm.",False,1648161299.0,t3_tms6l5,t3_tms6l5,,0,99,0,99,0,0,

> If the costly main battle tank is the archetypal platform of an army (as is the case for Russia and NATO), then the archetypal platform of a navy (particularly America’s Navy) is the ultra-costly capital ship, such as an aircraft carrier. Just as modern anti-tank weapons have turned the tide for the outnumbered Ukrainian army, the latest generation of **anti-ship missiles** (both shore- and sea-based) could in the future—say, in a place like the South China Sea or the Strait of Hormuz—turn the tide for a seemingly outmatched navy. Since February 24, the Ukrainian military has convincingly displayed the superiority of an anti-platform–centric method of warfare.

> 
> BY HANS VON DER BURCHARD
> March 24, 2022 6:13 pm
> 
> German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday dismissed Russia's demand that the EU and U.S. pay for Russian gas in rubles, arguing that most existing gas purchase agreements require payment in euros or U.S. dollars.
> 
> Russian President Vladimir Putin took the step on Wednesday, challenging Western efforts to punish Moscow for its Ukraine invasion by announcing that so-called ""unfriendly"" countries — a list including EU countries and the United States — will have to buy Russian gas imports in rubles. The move was seen as an attempt to prop up Russia's tumbling currency and potentially evade Western penalties.
> 
> Yet speaking at a press conference following a summit of the G7 advanced economies in Brussels, Scholz rebuffed Putin's request.
> 
> ""We've looked at this to try to get an overview. What we have learned so far is that there are fixed contracts everywhere, which include the currency in which payments are made,"" Scholz told reporters. ""And most of the time it says euro or dollar ... and that's what counts then.""
> 
> Germany has attracted particular criticism for rejecting calls to impose an immediate embargo on Russian gas, oil and coal imports, arguing the ban would have a more severe effect on the German and EU economies than on Russia's leadership.
> 
> Scholz also said the G7 — a club comprised of the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. that is currently led by Germany under a rotating presidency system — reiterated in a joint statement its call for Russia to immediately halt all hostilities. The group also agreed to impose further sanctions if necessary but declined to offer any new measures on Thursday.
> 
> ""We agree to keep sanctions in place for as long as necessary and to monitor their effectiveness,"" Scholz said. ""We will react with further sanctions should this become necessary,"" he added, without specifying what could be the trigger for additional penalties.

His country is literally being invaded by a foreign aggressor who is using weapons banned by the Geneva Convention. As leader it's his job to stand up for his country and protect their interests. Russia is the wrong here and nothing a troll farm says will change this.

> 
> I. RUSSIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE
> 
> **Paragraph 1:** Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians. Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects, including hospitals, medical facilities, schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately. Those responsible, and their accomplices, will be held to account in accordance with international law. The siege of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities.
> 
> **Paragraph 4:** The European Union stands by Ukraine and its people and the European Council reaffirms the Versailles Declaration, acknowledging the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine, as stated in the Association Agreement. The European Council reiterates its invitation to the Commission to submit its opinion in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. The European Union will continue to provide coordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support. The European Union has so far adopted significant sanctions that are having a massive impact on Russia and Belarus, and remains ready to close loopholes and target actual and possible circumvention as well as to move quickly with further coordinated robust sanctions on Russia and Belarus to effectively thwart Russian abilities to continue the aggression. The European Council calls on all countries to align with those sanctions. Any attempts to circumvent sanctions or to aid Russia by other means must be stopped.
> 
> **Paragraph 8:** Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia’s military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian Government for its immediate needs and, **once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine**. To that end, the European Council agrees to develop a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and invites its international partners to participate, and calls for preparations to start without delay. It calls on the Commission to continue to provide technical assistance in order to help Ukraine implement necessary reforms.

He knew he'd be arrested. And they'll be extorting confession. He can deny everything, but they can torture him to death. That's suboptimal

He acted smarter. During the night he went to a store, broke a window. Got inside, filled his bag with valuable stuff and waited for police to come. They came, arrested him. He got 5 years of jail for robbing a store \*as a regular criminal\*. That's how he survived the Great Purge

If he lived his regular life, he'd be arrested as a political criminal. That's the end. They'd investigate him for more political crimes, adding more charges. But now he chose a different track. Regular criminal track was so much better than a track of a spy/counterrevolutionary

Again that doesn't make sense from a human perspective. If he did a robbery, why can't he also be a spy? But procedurally speaking, it makes total sense. Normal criminals are investigated by regular police. Politicals - by state security. These two different tracks don't mix""

NATO is now the dominant conventional power; Russia is the weaker power. Short 🧵

During the Cold War, NATO had little hope of holding off a Soviet conventional offensive. So we adopted a policy of ""flexible response,"" in which we preserved all options - including nuclear escalation. The \*Soviets\* wanted to keep it all conventional if possible, of course.

This might seem nuts, but we basically told the Soviets that nuclear use became more probable with Soviet victories, since we would run out of options and we'd intentionally escalate. If you want to understand Putin's threats, it's basically something like that now.

The huge difference, of course, is that NATO assumed it would be invaded and fighting a \*defensive\* war that made escalation credible. Russia makes these threats basically as a way of getting themselves out of a jam created by their own aggression and stupidity.

But in any case, the problem is that the threat to escalate isn't some insane doomsday rant, it's a threat to induce a lot of chaos and unpredictability and instability, to the point where no one would want to be in that situation and peace would be preferable.

Putin's Russia is now the weaker conventional power. (And how \*much\* weaker, we didn't know until now.) So Putin may make such threats in order to deter us from clobbering his miserable army. Not because he wants Armageddon, but because he's up shit creek and he knows it.

His best option, obvs, is to make peace and extract concessions from Ukraine. But if we enter the war and what's left of his military gets sent to the hell it deserves, he might see value in trying to scramble the deck with escalatory threats (as he's already doing now).

Nuclear threats, however, could literally blow up in his face. What seems like a good gamble to back everyone down could get out of control when NATO decides to stand firm. With both sides at higher alert, an accident or a panicky misperception could lead to disaster.

This is why it's not ""he will or won't."" There's a lot of room in between ""he's a coward"" and ""he's a maniac."" He could also just be delusional and surrounded by weak men - and nothing suggests this more than the complete Russian pooch-screw we're watching now in Ukraine.

I wrote a book on nukes in 2015. This is the excerpt on the logic of flexible response. Again, think of it now as the Russians, through their own malevolence and stupidity, today being where NATO was 40 years ago. And think hard before hand-waving at escalatory concerns.

As Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he thinks it’s unlikely there will be a full-fledged war between Russia and the alliance.

Stoltenberg, speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, credited the NATO countries’ display of unity for lowering the likelihood of a full-scale war.

However, he said the on the ground in Ukraine is “extremely unpredictable,” and that NATO is faced with a new reality and must be prepared for the long haul.

When asked about reports that Russia is not picking up the deconfliction line, Stoltenberg replied that is correct, and that the “Russians have not been ready, as I say, to use those lines, but we assume that if there is a need, they will be able to communicate with us.”

The secretary general, who was meant to become Norway’s Central Bank chief later this year, is now set to stay on as the head of NATO given the situation in Ukraine. “I feel privileged for the third time, actually, to extend my term.” 

When asked if the job at NATO was more important than the job at Norway’s Central Bank, Stoltenberg replied “I feel it is more important,” adding that if there is anything he can do to stop this conflict from escalating into a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO, then “I feel that is an extremely meaningful task to do.”

Keep in mind the following things.

1. Every city or region that has been captured can be recaptured. This isn't like a video game where if you finish one level you go on to the next and you can't lose the progress made on the previous level. Around Kyiv dozens of villages have been recaptured by Ukr forces. Hostomel has changed hands about 5 times until now. No reason to be demoralized about one city or region in particular.
2. Mariupol is right next to the Russian lines and the Russians have wasted thousands of people just trying to capture it while bombing it to the ground for ONE MONTH. This was a city with a high Russian speaking population that was quite favourable to Russia before the war. It's a morale victory at best if they ""capture"" it and it's very difficult claim any capture since the city is razed to the ground already.
3. Ukrainians have already began to recapture territory in almost al parts of Ukraine with heavy loses for the Russian side.
4. Russia doesn't have unlimited personnel and will eventually run out of people they can send to the meat grinder. Yeah they can take one city with thousands of troop loses but they can't do this to every city and village. And it's gonna be a big problem for them long term.
5. Russia didn't invade ukraine and sacrifice 16000 soldiers just to get some coastal cities. The big targets are still untouched. Mariopol is the scene of a genocide not a strategic victory.

I am writing this because you will be seeing a massive disinformation campaign in the next couple of days ala ""Mariupol has fallen UKR better surrender"". No UKR should not do any of that.

I think it will be remembered as the greatest turning point battle against fascism since El Alamein. It looks like the Ukrainians attacked the Russians on the west side of Kyiv from every direction. On both sides of the Russian formations the Ukrainians took ground, seizing two vital highways. I think they also attacked at night across the flooded plain, because there was an attack I did not know there were Ukrainians.

I learned today that the night is as clear as the day looking through their lancer thermal sensors, and they use the lancers when they need to, but they're always using the thermal sensors that come with them. Every lancer comes view scope that are the most advanced kind of night vision, seeing everything out even beyond the range of the lancer missile. I imagine the Russians know the Ukrainians come at night now. And now the Ukrainians have taken the main four lane highways down both sides that serve the suburbs there like Irpin. The Battle of Hostomel Pocket began yesterday, and now the Ukrainians control the road network supplying 6-8 battalion tactical groups of different types. From my layman perspective, this looks like the picture, and events in Irpin and the announcements from the local municipalities confirm, so now 5000 Russian troops are burning under their own thermobaric rocketry captured and turned back on them, eighteen and nineteen year old sons of Russian mothers, Putin's cannon-meat. You can see the fires on the satellite photos.

Here is the best map. There is a journalist video where you can see this (Engel? forgive me I can't shout out to any journalist sticking it out there) but this is the map they are using in the civilian Kyiv command center:

The blue areas represent Ukranian advances. You can see on the East side, the other half, with its own battle name, which I wouldn't know to suggest (Battle of Hostomel Pocket I saw on twitter), Anyway, they have driven the Russians twenty miles on the East side, and trucks without gas can't advance, and they also can't retreat, so I imagine on the East and West side there are Russians begging for quarter.

Near Irpin there is one BTG the 37 or 39 motorized where a tank driver has driven over the colonel and broke both his legs after they had suffered 50% casualties, and this was 12 hours ago that I saw that anecdote which was picked up in the radio chatter.

**USA: The Tiger Team - preparing for chemical/biological/nuclear weapons:**  
  
*The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — frustrated by his lack of progress in Ukraine or determined to warn Western nations against intervening in the war — unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.*  
  
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/biden-russia-nuclear-weapons.html  
  
Paywall; here are excerpts:  
  
The Tiger Team, as the group is known, is also examining responses if Mr. Putin reaches into NATO territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. Meeting three times a week, in classified sessions, the team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighboring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades.  
Those contingencies are expected to be central to an extraordinary session here in Brussels on Thursday, when President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other NATO nations, who will be meeting for the first time — behind closed doors, their cellphones and aides banished — since Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.  
Just a month ago, such scenarios seemed more theoretical. But today, from the White House to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, a recognition has set in that Russia may turn to the most powerful weapons in its arsenal to bail itself out of a military stalemate.  
NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, underscored the urgency of the preparation effort on Wednesday, telling reporters for the first time that even if the Russians employ weapons of mass destruction only inside Ukraine, they may have “dire consequences” for people in NATO nations. He appeared to be discussing the fear that chemical or radioactive clouds could drift over the border. One issue under examination is whether such collateral damage would be considered an “attack” on NATO under its charter, which might require a joint military response.  
The current team was established in a memo signed by Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, on Feb. 28, four days after the invasion began, according to the officials involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning. A previous iteration had worked for months, behind the scenes, to prepare the U.S. government for the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
(...)  
Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday that if Mr. Putin used a weapon of mass destruction — chemical, biological or nuclear — “there would be consequences” even if the weapon’s use was confined to Ukraine. Mr. Reed said radiation from a nuclear weapon, for instance, could waft into a neighboring NATO country and be considered an attack on a NATO member.  
“It’s going to be a very difficult call, but it’s a call that not just the president but the entire NATO Council will have to make,” Mr. Reed told reporters, referring to the governing body of the Western alliance.  
“The bottom line is this is a NATO decision,” Mr. Reed said. “It won’t be the president’s decision alone. I don’t think he’d want to take action unilaterally.”  
(...)  
A senior administration official said any use of a “small” tactical nuclear bomb by Russia — even inside Ukraine and not directed at a NATO member — would mean that “all bets are off” on the United States and NATO staying out of the war. But when pushed, the official declined to lay out the responses under discussion.  
The official said American and NATO intelligence communities had not seen any activity by Russian military officials that suggested preparations to use a nuclear weapon. But he said that during internal discussions, administration officials were urging caution, because there was more at stake than just Ukraine.  
(...)  
“He will get Article 5,” Mr. Pabriks said, in a reference to the NATO pledge that an attack on one alliance member is an attack on all.  
“If he gets that, basically that would also make us involved in Ukraine,” Mr. Pabriks said, adding: “He has no way out of that. So I don’t think he should be so stupid.”

There's already an unacceptably high chance that Putin uses nukes due to the deteriorating military situation in Ukraine.  Russia right now may be tempted to try to salvage the strategic objective in Ukraine by using a few nukes or nerve gas.  **NATO has basically said that if fallout lands on a NATO member, it's article 5 time.**  This is a deterrent threat.

* NATO involvement if Putin uses a nuke is almost unavoidable due to fallout  
* Putin is currently likely to use nukes to try to force Ukraine to surrender

This is a horrible combination.

**If you would have to escalate if something happens, the only way to avoid it is deterrence.**  Saying and doing nothing, appearing passive, would in fact make Putin more likely to _perceive_ low risk of intervention for doing so, the opposite of deterrence.  The increased aggressive posture, including threats of intervention, by Europe and NATO members is modifying the risk & reward ratios to try to avert this.

Forcing Russia to recognize that it can't win in Ukraine lowers the risk (which already exists and is unacceptably high) of chemical or nuclear weapons being used.  By denying Russia ways to salvage the strategic objective in Ukraine, we're forcing Russia to refocus on salvaging the political outcome in Russia.  Anything that drives Russia to confront their own inevitable political reckoning is _lowering_ the chance of nukes or chemical weapons being used at all.

### Backwards Nuclear Doomerisms

Doomers are showing up saying that NATO would never intervene.  As argued above, if NATO won't credibly intervene, Russia is almost assured to use nuclear or chemical weapons against Ukraine.  It's their last way to try to force Ukraine to surrender.  NATO _must_ and did in fact state pretty clearly that they will be forced to intervene if nukes land in Ukraine, the opposite of what doomers keep saying.

Doomers are also saying that shipping certain arms or making an aggressive intervention raises the risk of provoking Russia to escalate.  Again, Russia is already way too likely to escalate.  Being willing to provide arms and posture aggressively in favor of intervention **increases the credibility that NATO also wants to intervene if nuclear or chemical weapons are used.**  Aggression both increases the deterrent credibility and clarifies the outcome in Ukraine at the same time.  Clarity of outcome means Russia is less likely to attempt a desperate salvage operation of their strategic objective.

Honestly I think nuclear doomers are confusing the situation we see now as proof that intervention is wrong and then back-filling their analysis based on the conclusion.

The first one is about a Russian MP, who seemingly was appointed deputy chairman of Putin’s party United Russia, saying that Russians and Ukrainians have the same ethnicity. Think it highlights how ethnicity is seen as important and used to justify things.

”Andrey Isaev, member of the State Duma, claimed on state TV that according to Putin, Russians and Ukrainians have the same ethnicity, and therefore there is no such thing as the Ukrainian nationality, which is ""merely an organization"" of Russians who don't want to be Russian.”

The second one is about Russians destroying Ukrainian books. Reminds me a bit about the Chinese cultural revolution. Also a bit about recent attempts by republicans to ban books about ”critical race theory” and LGBT topics, as well as attempts by democrats to ban books with ”bad words” or ”stereotyping”.

”#Russia continues to target Ukraine’s cultural heritage – occupants are raiding libraries, destroying Ukrainian history #books, especially those that mention the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Russia’s war in Donbas, and Soviet repressions.”

Speaking to a coalition of women's groups, the pope said the conflict in Ukraine was a product of ""the old logic of power that still dominates so-called geopolitics"".

The real response was not more weapons and more sanctions, he said.

""I was embarrassed when I read that a group of states have committed to spending two percent...of GDP in acquiring weapons as a response to what is happening now. Madness,"" Francis said.

Putin will continue to push the envelop until someone stops him by Force because he knows that from history, there is no consequence to use illegal weapons or start a senseless war.

Put yourself in Putin's shoes & you will know exactly what he would do.  Isolated & cornered by his own dream of Ukrainians waving Russian flags as he enters Kyiv.  Haunted by his old age & glory passed him by, desperate to win a war!! Any war!! Grab more land to take to his grave.  He is losing (in his head) as soon as he had to turn on civilians & destroy cities, buying more time to force Ukrainians to surrender so that he can proclaim some sort of victory.

Victory is NOT given by words or someone admits defeat or begs for mercy.  There were victorious heroes who lost in battles & timid little Kings who hid in castles, demanding to be the hero who won battles.

If Putin uses more severe weaponary on civilians, it just confirms to Ukrainians that they need to fight Russia until their last man & woman.  One cannot eat up others homeland & be hero. Well, in this case, there is no winning for Putin.  Europe will definitely draw into long battle (weaponary race, economy & refugee crisis, cyber attacks) even though the war is not on their soil.
Is this not WW3 ?  The model of WW is very different to how it used to be defined in WW1&2.
When nukes was used as threats, many people far away from Ukraine can be casualty.

Putin's 3-day war had changed - he cares shit about the land & the people including Russia & his people. He just wants to destroy & destroy, people fear him & beg for mercy, gets to his goal which I don't think he actually knows what his true goal is anymore.

Take for example, the breakaway state of Kosovo which has enjoyed a lot of support. It has a majority support in the EU(22 out of 27 states), but then there are countries like Greece and Spain which are opposed due to their own domestic issues. 

Spain is concerned about further encouragement for the Catalonian separatist movement, and Greece has its concerns about Cyprus. 


Now this is why some high profile commentators are making the point that the Ukrainian crisis is not for anyone else to decide. Zelenskyy wants to negotiate. He wants peace.

**Russia is broke, out of supplies, and their army is disintegrating with 40000 losses in one shape or another. They have 2 weeks left of combat provisions (2 weeks ago).**

Not so sure about that. I mean maybe, and hopefully, but Russia has generally made a mess of things, looked incompetent for long periods, and had economic trouble. It has not stopped them before and there are no signs to a cessation of saving face ceasefire treaty. There will be no peace, Putin does not want peace. Also, Biden said that sanctions dont stop people, maintenance of sanctions. The financial salvo lobbed at Russia is hitting, but will it be enough? Their creative use of their energy capital in getting contracts in Rupees and demanding roubles is pretty smart I hate to say it. The fact is Russia is no stranger to sanctions, and their energy income is liquid. Not to mention that while the whole EU denounces them, they have no choice but to take said gas/oil or freeze. 

**Russia only planned for a 2 week operation and will collapse soon**

Who does that? What major military goes into an operation on a hard two week turn time or else collapse. Nope, they are all in on this. They calculated the sanctions, maybe not how bad, but knew they would come, and have made countermeasures. It is yet to be seen whether they will be enough to hold off economic devastation long term.

**NFZ or any intervention means NUKES**

Any direct military action against Russia by anyone does not guarantee the use of nukes. Yes, the risks go up astronomically. In this scenario, it is likely things would escalate quickly. Lines would be drawn and crossed. We would find out rather quickly, if Russia intends to make good on their nuclear threat. But if they do, they know that whatever they do, they will get right back. So are they truly suicidal? As long as everyone loses we are happy? Putins gold toilet paper roll holder says he is not fatalistic or suicidal. We cant quite make it out how serious he is about full scale nuclear conflict resulting in world dystopia.

The fact is things would get unpredictable quickly. Also it could be limited nuclear exchange, stopped by cooler heads or intervention by other countries, ala the book 2034. 

**CHINA is behind this.**

Maybe, maybe not, but you better hope not, because it means things are about to get much more interesting, and that nothing in this is what it seems. This would mean Ukraine is just a pawn and the west is the real target. This is entirely possible and a convincing case can be made by examining past statements and interactions between China and Russia as well as the Chinese doublespeak currently. They are either playing it cool and trying to play both sides, or playing their part, but if shit hits the fan, aint no question on which side they are on. Also, if China had a chance to claim the top spot, in any way, they would, even if it meant a steep learning curve learning how to play the role. 

I commonly hear it said that there is no way they could pull it off. Maybe, maybe not, but everything they do is devoted to getting their sooner than later. 

If there is some dastardly plot behind all this regarding China and Russia, I would have to say that its very complicated and layered. They are wise enough to know that there would be no way to carefully choreograph all of their moves, meaning they would operate on a loose outline and script. Any miscalculations or under/over estimations could prove fatal. For this reason, I do not think there is some bigger plot, but I dont discount the possibility either.",False,1648152416.0,t3_tms6l5,t3_tms6l5,,0,-24,0,-24,0,0,

The contradictory double motion that Western nations have pursued vis a vis Ukraine - pulling it into the Western sphere while denying it NATO/EU membership or guaranteeing it protections - is what Chomsky has been warning us of since 2008, and like he predicted, it led directly to active Russian invasion and the rape of Ukraine.

The highest ranks of the US intelligence apparatus (see: http://www.defenddemocracy.press/bidens-cia-director-doesnt-believe-bidens-story-about-ukraine/, https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html) were themselves echoing Chomsky, and warning that pulling Ukraine westward would lead to this.

Chomsky ""blames the West"" insofar as it ""courted Ukraine"" without guaranteeing it proper protections.

The best way forward is for Ukraine to become a strong liberal Democracy on Russia's doorstep that Russia cannot invade. That way, Russia has no choice but to leave Ukraine alone. It'll probably result in Russia becoming a North Korea, but there isn't much Ukraine can do about the political situation in Russia. The people of Russia seem to have stubbornly bought into the Russian system and it's unlikely to change any time soon. Even with empty bellies.

This [interview with a Russian-specializing Finnish ex-intelligence agent](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?) has specific information on this subject (re Finland, NATO, the process of joining thereof).

The entire video is worth watching, but [this link (closed captioning available)](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?t=1257s) discusses the status of Finland vis-a-vis NATO.

Paraphrasing:

* In [public discourse (the 'tactical truth')](http://world-information.org/trd/68) Russia considers Finland as officially neutral^[a]
* In private discourse (operational plans), Russia **already** considers Finland as part of NATO.

* In public discourse, Finland considers Finland as independent of NATO and Finland as opposed in principle to Russia since joining the EU in 1995.
* In private discourse, Finland considers itself part of NATO and probably (*wink*) has a **'special relationship' with NATO**^[b] with some security guarantees already in place.

Right after the linked time, he goes on to tell a story about he was indoctrinated in school to reinforce the idea that Finland always stay neutral and he could not publicly state his preference to join NATO but since his retirement he professes this fact.

He also says that in its current state because Russia **already views Finland as a NATO member operationally**, Finland has already assumed nearly **all** the disadvantages of being a NATO member without any of the benefits. So he argues that they should finish (no pun intended) joining the alliance.

[This video (a 1 hour lecture with slides, but worth every bit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw) was my first introduction to this guy Martii Kari which delves into the core cultural differences which are important in understanding the Russian perspective and their system of operating. (closed captioning available)

I also just noticed [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBopkxqR3p8) published today from the same guy.

**tl;dr** Finland is basically already 90% of the way to joining NATO through a secret process to avoid exactly the situation Ukraine and Georgia find themselves in: wanting to join but being attacked, in part, to prevent it.

'mountainous Karabakh'; Armenian: Լեռնային Ղարաբաղ, romanized: Leṙnayin Ġarabaġ, listen ; Azerbaijani: Dağlıq Qarabağ, listen  or Yuxarı Qarabağ, listen ) is a landlocked region in the South Caucasus, within the mountainous range of Karabakh, lying between Lower Karabakh and Syunik, and covering the southeastern range of the Lesser Caucasus mountains.

 >The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The main combatants were Azerbaijan, with support from Turkey and foreign mercenary groups on one side; and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh and Armenia, on the other. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region, which was annexed to Azerbaijan during the Soviet era and internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but partially governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority.

 >The Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) was a conflict wherein insurgent groups known collectively as the Mujahideen, as well as smaller Marxist–Leninist–Maoist groups, fought a nine-year guerrilla war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) and the Soviet Army throughout the 1980s, mostly in the Afghan countryside. The Mujahideen were variously backed primarily by the United States, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and the United Kingdom; the conflict was a Cold War-era proxy war. Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 Afghans were killed and millions more fled the country as refugees, mostly to Pakistan and Iran. Between 6.

Oryx - while fantastic - is only able to count photographed vehicles. 

Ukraine is boosting morale by sharing photos of destroyed Russian equipment, but we know *very little* about Ukrainian force losses. In fact, remember day 2 when we were asked *not* to share photos/videos so they couldn't be targeted by Russian artillery? So we get a much bigger window into Russian losses than Ukrainian losses.

Why does this matter? Because the war isn't won. Shit like this can change the info environment, and reduce public urgency to send more weapons, etc, to Ukraine. They need everything we can send. And stories like this might hurt that cause.

Small 🧵This is an observation I will disagree with slightly in that the Russians have no choice but to keep putting Helicopters at Kherson.  
They need helicopter air cover for truck resupply convoys so the Russian ground offensive can reach Odessa & supply the Mariupol attack

Ukraine is doing to the Russian helicopters at Kherson what the IJN cruisers & battleships did to the USMC planes at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal in WW2.

This is why I keep repeating:  
""Seldom are there things in war that have not happened before.""  
Failing logistics look the same war after war.

P.S.  
The Ukrainians need to drop some psywar ops leaflets at Kherson with a picture of destroyed Russian helicopters and the phrase in Russian:   
""Please send more""

FWIW, air warfare didn't lead to the end of battleships right away. America kept battleships well into the 1990s, as there was and is no comparable naval bombardment alternative. Big gun capital ships continued to play a role in other navies, too, into the 1980's. They didn't disappear, but their role in navies evolved. Likewise, its likely that the tank doctrine will evolve in the context of formidable missile technology. 

Tanks have never been intended to be successfully used alone - they are supposed to be used in highly coordinated, sophisticated joint arms operations. This has been true since their debut at Cambrai, where failure to follow up with sufficient infantry led to a stalled allied offensive after initial breakthroughs. In Ukraine, tanks, infantry, air support, and artillery are not being properly supplied and are uncoordinated, meaning they are not as effective as they should be.

It's also worth remembering that while the Russian invasion has not been as successful as they hoped, they are still occupying considerable ground and have not been significantly pushed back, despite marshalling only 190,000 troops against a country that, with reserves, had more than twice that.

They should have infantry ahead clearing buildings and making sure no one with missile is near. That's why urban warfare is so difficult cause it's hard to make sure no one is hiding.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.

Ukraine is not Chechnya. It’s not even in the same class.

I think that, after the invasion started, Biden has done a *great* job, relatively speaking. And of course, there was a lot of groundwork being laid politics-wise prior to this so that action started being taken internationally quickly. For this, I give him a great deal of credit. 

Most of my gripes with this administration's handling is with stuff that has already happened and can no longer rly be fixed; shutting the proverbial barn door after the horse has bolted and all that.

The part I'm not quite satisfied with honestly (and obviously, this is just my layman's take, etc.) is the pre-invasion stuff, and some of the messaging even as the invasion has been ongoing. Even if the intention is to never have American boots on the ground, explicitly saying that publicly is rly ehhh to me, since it's basically just explicity declaring to Russia that they won't have to deal with the US military for sure. That's a whole lot of deterrence force gone/ruled out of Russia's decision making when deciding whether to go through with the invasion. I suspect that those statements were so that he doesn't get lambasted by the domestic audience tbh so it's a bit of a hard situation. 

Other thing (and this one is probably more controversial within Reddit) is pulling US troops out in jan-feb. I actually strongly disagree with this (and of course, I recognize this is easy for me to say in hindsight). I do think that Russia is very VERY averse to getting into a shooting war with the US/NATO - and that was a huge deterrent gone as well. 

And before people say NATO is defensive alliance, we have no responsibility to act in deterrence for external nations, etc. - I agree; as a general rule. That being said, Ukraine (and Georgia for that matter) are a bit of a special case in my mind because we essentially promised them eventual membership, which definitely contributed to the situation they are in today. Yes, NATO is just an excuse for Putin, but it is one he is using effectively domestically (and one that China is using to hand-wave and give Russia a lifeline). Arguably, the ridiculous amounts of military aid we are providing makes up for that, but that's.... pretty cold comfort tbh.

But yeah, both of these things are too late to fix now - and obviously NFZs, etc. that would get us into actual shooting is not a good idea. As I said, generally speaking, I've been fairly impressed with how this whole thing has been handled, but yeah, those two specific things rankle somewhat.",False,1648168189.0,t3_tms6l5,t1_i2006ta,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The issue exists when not all participants in this forum are genuinely committed to the purpose the body serves, and unable or unwilling to broker the topics, or blatantly disregard the body itself in favor of blazing their own ideology upon another State. These bodies lack the ability and authority to enforce the will and vote of the body upon a rogue state.

For regional conflicts, typically one of the self-proclaimed Super Powers, or in other cases, a Militarily stronger nation that has vested interest in one of the parties or the region, will step in and attempt to de-escalate, broker peace, and/or provide peace keeping services. When one of the nations involved ""is"" one of those Powers (or believes that they are), we find ourselves in a situation such as this.

Ukraine is not hiring mercenaries, that we know of, because they are probably not optimal for Ukraine's strategic situation.  The money is better spent on equipping their vast territorial army, training and outfitting new regulars and keeping their existing forces going.  

As a rule, mercenaries are limited in their effectiveness and can be a security liability, as their loyalty is to money, not a cause.

1. Now there is a shit ton of AA weaponry to prevent a full air assault. Not sure what the fuck they were doing with their airforce day one- either saving it should another conflict start up or it’s a full paper tiger where like other things, it’s not as well off in the functioning and maintenance department and things they’ve showed off in the past were more so for show opposed to them having a functioning ready fleet.
2. Ukraine has been doing counter offensives but I highly doubt they’ll bring it to Russian land- they are trying to appeal to the Russian people, not embolden them. A lot of territories have spent time to dig in and prep for insurgency, and now that Russian morale and supplies are low, they are able to reclaim some areas.
3. They react to keep up the facade of being in charge and scary- they puff their chests to try and intimidate. Russians always play themselves as self victimizing. They do these things in defense of others doing horrible things to them they claim, and have complained throughout history. Self victimization turned weapon.

Russia bum rushed their ground forces in to try to Blitz Kyiv, bet muddy conditions along with super poor maintained on their logistics vehicles caused tire failures on transport trucks. Ukraine caught back harder instead of rolling over. Russian front-line forces couldn’t get re-supplied because their logistics vehicles were stuck. Additionally lots of allegations of Russian soldiers selling excess gas believing they were only on a training mission and it wouldn’t be missed. Ukrainian Mobile SAMs have been highly effective and their own air force is still pretty operational making air superiority difficult for Russia to establish, additionally Russian mobile SAM batteries affected by same shitty maintainance and logistics as the rest. Basically it’s all tied together. Failure of one area to meet operational objectives has a cascading effect

>2. 
Maybe, but to what end? Ukraine has a massive advantage on home turf because re-supply and maneuvering is much easier.

2) They are defending how they should be. I don't know what you mean by ""full blown counter attack"". If you mean having the entire army push back in a singular location, no that would be a stupid move. They have to defend how they are defending, or one battle loss ends their entire capability to defend at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. russia lacks the ability and experience to do large coordinated attacks, it's just nothing they have ever had to do. They don't even really work with their few allies like NATO does. So their war games are just them conquering themselves with no one else. Also, their military doctrines are based around a centralized command rather than empowering their officers to make decisions on the fly. This means that russia's air force could take out predicted obstacles but struggles with anything unsuspected. Basically, if russian soldiers went up against something they didn't expect their air support was rarely able to assist due to being committed to a lot of pre-planned strikes. Then there's also the suspicion that they may not have the air capabilities they boasted about having for so long or can't afford the operational costs of keeping too many jets in the air that often. 
2. Ukrainian doctrine is to use the limited resources they tend to use what they have more strategically. They can't match russian firepower overall but if they pick their battles prudently, they can be peer-level more often than not, handheld AT weapons helps level the playing field enormously.  For instance,  Ukraine can use their better optics, both nightvision and thermal, (Javelins have thermal cameras that can be used even after firing the munition) to hit at night in smaller groups. So, they can counter-attack but they aren't exactly built for it. Luckily, they've acquired some new equipment from the russians that can help with their counter-offensives. 
3. Get used to it, North Korea does the same thing we've just all learned to tune it out. The North Koreans learned that from the Soviets. If you take offense to everything all the time then you can keep up the facade that you're the victim. The threats are just the only way they can project power anymore. They are basically impotent save for their nukes.

Best realistic case scenario for Ukraine is if they don't even need to ensure they won't join NATO and the loses will limit to just Donbass and Ukraine.

Best of the best case scenario, like really pushing it and requiring stuff like entire Russian divisions being encircled or the Russian people overthrowing Putin, would be Ukraine just recognizing Crimea, remember, even Nalvany sort of supported a Russian Crimea. Like a really long shot scenario.

The main reason is that Crimea is apparently legitimately pro-Russia, Russia is having such a hard problem because it is facing a hostile population. The situation would be reversed here, Ukraine just doesn't have the military capacity of taking back pro-Russian territories where the population would be hostile to them. Even if Russia can't afford the war anymore, holding territories that are pro-Russian would require a minimun effort and is affordable. In pro-Russian territories that are already occupied by the russian army, the military difference between Russia and Ukraine would come to bear fully.

It is like, not absolutely impossible for Ukraine to regain Crimea, but this would require something like the fall of the USSR style thing with Russia or a full blown shooting civil war in Russia, like the entirety of the russian army dissolving. Only then would a scenario of Ukraine regaining Crimea would be possible. This is borderline fiction.

All of these ships are armed with defenses that can shoot down incoming missiles. The only exception at the moment are hypersonic missiles, but their accuracy over great distances against a moving target remains to be proven.

For now, there aren't many hypersonic missiles, and in the medium to long-term, defensive measures against such threats will be coming online. Lasers, better long range detection to allow more time for more conventional means of interception to be successful, rail-guns, etc...

What Russia is demonstrably unable to do is carry out maneuver warfare and/or combined arms strategies. So WW2 level tactics are still effective against them, despite all of the technological sophistications of their arsenal.

On the other hand, the US and NATO train a lot to maximize the effectiveness of combined arms strategies. Combined arms strategies is what allows tanks to move around protected against anti-tank measures. Infantry, airforce, navy, mechanized divisions, etc... all coordinate to cover eachothers' weaknesses so that each of their strengths can be utilized fully. Even within each of these groupings there are different subgroups each with their own objective. For instance, the airforce alone has air superiority fighters, SEAD (anti-aircraft suppression planes), DEAD (anti-aircraft destruction planes), bombers, multi-role fighters, electronic warfare planes, AWACs, etc... The US can deploy all of them together, involving dozens or even over a hundred planes at the same time, while coordinating with the ground and navy to better target their offensive objectives and better protect themselves from anti-aircraft measures.

From what we can see in Ukraine, Russia just tosses 1 or 2 plane patrols into Ukraine on random uncoordinated bombing runs with the occasional dog fight. They are using just their long range radar stations and SAM defenses based out of Russia to back up those fighters. As a result, plenty of anti-aircraft measures on the ground can be deployed against them with relative impunity against counterattack.",1648165803.0,1648165207.0,t3_tms6l5,t1_i1zwuzr,,2,6,0,6,0,0,
41173a5ffe4b7dcd410272e4c8f95afc,tms6l5,i1zxjvq,"> Everything that is happening to Russian tanks can ATGM can happen to a US aircraft carrier vs anti ship missiles.

ATGM need to see the tank before it blows up. They have maybe a range of 2-miles or so (at shoulder-height, the horizon is only 3-miles away).

A US Aircraft Carrier has a thing called an E2 Hawkeye / AWACS radar that sees everything 300-miles out flying above it. (Note: the Aircraft carrier can only be seen 30-miles away, because the horizon literally blocks out the location of the aircraft carrier). The E2 Hawkeye sees ""further beyond the horizon"" because its 20,000 feet high, and no, its not flying directly above the aircraft carrier. Knowing where the E2 Hawkeye is doesn't give you any idea of where the Carrier is located yet (probably within 300-miles of the E2 Hawkeye so that the Aircraft Carrier can be in radio-contact with the eyes-in-the-sky, but that's a search area roughly the size of Ukraine. A = Pi * R^2 == 250,000 sq-mile search area. Good luck finding the aircraft carrier).

So how do you shoot a missile at a target you can't see? Especially since the Aircraft Carrier has eyes in the sky (F35 and E2-Hawkeyes) who can see out 300-miles?

-------

The _FIRST_ think you (or they) will see is the E2-Hawkeye. The E2 Hawkeye radios down to the Aircraft carrier, who then dispatches F35 jets. You still don't know where the F35 jets came from, they flew too low to the ocean and were hidden behind the horizon (before rising up to an appropriate height for their operations). Then the F35 jets launch a missile at you, and return home.

The missiles used by the F35 have a range of 1500 miles, so you might never even see the F35, it was too far away, let alone its stealth attributes. The E2 Hawkeye's eyes were all that were needed.

That's the ferociousness of an aircraft carrier. They're a ""beyond the horizon"" machine. The only thing you see are the E2 Hawkeye and the F35 jets dispatched (and that's a maybe, because F35 is mildly stealth aircraft and loaded with 1500 mile range missiles)",1648165343.0,1648164772.0,t3_tms6l5,t1_i1zwuzr,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Retake key strategic areas and hubs before they too dig in. After that it will be a matter of hitting the weak spots and supply lines while not wasting munitions and manpower on large sweeping attacks but rather denying and grinding down the Russians who will undoubtedly attempt to bring in more troops that are even less motivated and trained. 

Another reason I think this strategy is valuable is that a lot of the Ukrainian personell with little to no training currently unengaged or guarding the west/training can be put in key defensive positions with some hardened troops. This will give the combat experience but under less horrible circumstances than urban fighting or large scale combat. Such strategies also allows for troop rotation to prevent combat fatigue setting in even more than it will.

* He got out ahead of Russia's propaganda war and told everyone ahead of time what Russia was going to do. In hindsight everyone's kicking themselves for not listening to him.

He said it today

>“At the moment, Russia does not want to sit down and conduct any negotiations, because now it seeks to occupy the territory, surround the coast and go to the Moldovan border, isolating Ukraine from the sea,” Borrell explained in an interview with 1 o. clock from Brussels.

>And the fact that Vladimir Putin seeks to sit down at the negotiating table “in a position of greater strength” than now, the high representative of the EU added. “It is not easy to negotiate a ceasefire when one side wants to continue the war,” he admitted.

>However, Borrell assured that after a month of invasion, “Russia is not achieving its goals.” “Ukraine’s resistance is of an extraordinary nature, the Russian army has lost many servicemen,” he added.

>Thus, the high representative of the EU for foreign policy believes that *“the next 15 days will be decisive”* for the future of the war.

>This NPR/Ipsos survey was conducted March 18-21, 2022 by Ipsos using our KnowledgePanel®. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample of 1,006 general population adults aged 18 or older.

>The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, the largest and most well-established online probability-based panel that is representative of the adult US population. Our recruitment process employs a scientifically developed addressed-based sampling methodology using the latest Delivery Sequence File of the USPS – a database with full coverage of all delivery points in the US. Households invited to join the panel are randomly selected from all available households in the U.S. Persons in the sampled households are invited to join and participate in the panel. Those selected who do not already have internet access are provided a tablet and internet connection at no cost to the panel member. Those who join the panel and who are selected to participate in a survey are sent a unique password-protected log-in used to complete surveys online. As a result of our recruitment and sampling methodologies, samples from KnowledgePanel cover all households regardless of their phone or internet status and findings can be reported with a margin of sampling error and projected to the general population.

>The study was conducted in both English and Spanish. The data were weighted to adjust for gender by age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, Census region, metropolitan status, and party identification.

We let Russia go in and slapped weak sanctions, before following suit of other EU countries by slapping more serious ones on. There was even bipartisan sanctions moving through the senate a month or so before the invasion that ended up fillibustered. 

And the lack of preparation by Biden(and other EU countries) is where we failed Ukraine the most.

So, as polls drip in that have people dissapproving of how Ukraine has been handled, its not hard to figure out why. Had we prepared better, we could of at best prevented the invasion.

 >The Azov Special Operations Detachment (Ukrainian: Окремий загін спеціального призначення «Азов», romanized: Okremyi zahin spetsialnoho pryznachennia ""Azov""), also known as Azov Regiment (Ukrainian: Полк Азов, romanized: Polk Azov), Azov Battalion (until September 2014), is a neo-Nazi former paramilitary group that is now a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, based in Mariupol, in the Azov Sea coastal region. Azov formed as a volunteer militia in May 2014, and has since been fighting Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War. It saw its first combat experience recapturing Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists in June 2014.
 
**[Siege of Mariupol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mariupol)** 
 
 >The Siege of Mariupol is an ongoing military engagement between Russia and Ukraine which began on 24 February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as part of the Eastern Ukraine offensive. The city of Mariupol is located in the Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine, and is claimed by the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk People's Republic. The Red Cross described the situation as ""apocalyptic"", and Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city, with city officials reporting that over 2,000 civilians have been killed, as of March 2022.

First off, they SAY they have some 1500 left over from the USSR.  But they need constant maintenance - both warheads and delivery systems.  Russia's defense budget is about 1/10th the US's.  It's estimated that of that, Russia is spending $8B in maintenance on their nuclear forces.

Britain spends roughly the same amount.  Britain can only maintain 120 active warheads as a result.  Britain is also a very well managed military, which isn't being extorted by street thugs and mostly not being pillaged by government higher ups.

So that leaves us with likely 120, *maybe* 150 warheads.  But as we've seen with the rest of the military, maintenance really isn't their thing, and they thought nothing of swapping parts for cheap Chinese knockoffs to put more rubles in their pockets.  The rockets need constant attention, the warheads have to contend with very exotic parts that need replacement every decade or so (e.g. tritium, which has a 12 year half life and is necessary for the boom in a hydrogen weapon).

So, 40% is still a lot when we're talking nukes.  Except we don't know what they prioritized.  Nukes run from kiloton or smaller battlefield tactical weapons - cheaper to maintain - to city busting ICBM launched big boys.  

40% of 120 is 48, round up say 50.  50 cities or sites gone max, millions displaced or dead.  If the spread is similar to other nations, 10-30% are the city killers, the remainder are tactical.  So really 5-15 cities.

Actually there's a very logical reason for this.

SAM sites have the weakness that they must radiate from their radars to see their targets and feed tracking information to their missiles before/during launch. These emissions can be picked up and counter-radar missiles fired. Or if you detect it from far enough away, you just lob a cruise missile at it.

But Ukraine's situation is special.

It's an open secret that the NATO is feeding AWACS tracking data to Ukraine as fast as it can be sanitized. Which means that Ukraine only has to turn on the radars when it ALREADY knows there's a target to shoot. A few seconds of radiating to establish the track, fire the missile, then shut it down and immediately move everything to avoid counter-fire.

This is actually a big selling point for NATO hardware. If they had gear that was Link-16 compatible, then they'd actually NEVER have to turn on their radars, they can use the AWACS tracks directly.",False,1648166449.0,t3_tms6l5,t1_i1zu0np,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

However, here's the real problem. Let's say NONE of Russia's nuclear warheads work. That's one spin that some like to suggest - since so much of their other equipment has has problems and nuclear weapons need regular maintenance, PROBABLY little to none work...a hell of a bet, but let's say they're correct.

So Russia decides to hell with it, we're launching everything. Or a few. Or whatever. They launch X missiles. If it's at a NATO country, then there's a defined response, right? Does NATO wait until those missiles get to their target to see if they are indeed non-functional? Of course they don't. So even if none of Russia's missiles work, a launch means there's a response. That's still bad, even if it's ""only"" Russia that gets hit, because borders are manmade figments of imagination and have no effect on any result of nuclear impacts.

Now, if Russia launches one or more missiles at say Ukraine for whatever reason (border control or something), I don't know if NATO holds its breath and hopes for the best, or what.

In this conflict, the PRC shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands along the east coast of mainland China (in the Taiwan Strait) to ""liberate"" Taiwan from the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT); and to probe the extent of the United States defense of Taiwan's territory. A naval battle also took place around Dongding Island when the ROC Navy repelled an attempted amphibious landing by the PRC Navy.

> Your own Awacs

A Chinese AWACS can survive against the E2 + F35 team? Since the AWACs is flying at 20,000+ feet high, they'll be detected at 600-miles out (still not close enough to see the Aircraft Carrier yet). Think about the physics of the horizon.

Like, the AWACS needs its own support fighters, if it hopes to stay flying as it approaches E2 + F35 team. What Aircraft carrier are these Chinese AWACS + fighters going to launch from?

The enemy AWACS needs to survive the 600mile to 300-mile radius before having a chance to see the aircraft carrier. Assuming the Chinese AWACS flies at 500-miles-per-hour, that's 30+ minutes of closing the distance. Do you really think that the enemy AWACS can survive 30+ minutes against a US Carrier Strike team?

> super sonic,

Ah yes, Mach 2. 1500+ miles per hour.

The Aircraft Carrier is 3000-miles away. (F35 missiles are 1500 miles, and the F35 has a range of 1500 miles itself). So it take 2-hours for those ""supersonic missiles"" to reach the Aircraft carrier.

Aircraft Carriers move at 35 miles per hour. They're 70-miles away off target by the time those supersonic missiles reach their location. They're not even in the horizon anymore, just gone.

The ocean is fucking big man. That's why these carrier-strike groups have E2 Hawkeyes and F35 fighters with tight radios, to help guide their missiles to the enemy (F35 also have a degree of stealth, so they can penetrate into the enemy's Radar / sensors, but only to a mild degree)

----------

EDIT: The issue with the Taiwan situation, is that the US Aircraft Carriers may be forced to stay close to Taiwan to properly support the island. China has a chance of deploying enough ground-radars and ground-defense systems that it might be able to pick up and track the Aircraft Carriers in that region.

Once the Aircraft Carrier is found and tracked, its over. But its a non-trivial problem to find the thing.",1648167676.0,1648165551.0,t3_tms6l5,t1_i1zyktf,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

This would have been legal under the war powers act without any need to go through the gridlock of congress.

And it is the only kind of strength that Putin understands and respects. Instead, he withdrew US troops and left the Ukrainians on their own, without any direct support. And to make matters worse, he's explicitly ruled out any direct American assistance to the Ukrainians to fight Russia, ensuring that Russia has freedom to operate in Ukraine without fear of consequences.

Not at all, but Russia isn't going to target every major city, they're going to lob as many missiles as they think necessary to knock out DC, similar to how we planned to launch 200 at Moscow in the 80s.  Their stockpile is only 5k now, then with the aforementioned missile failure-rate, they're probably going to aim the major portion of their warheads at DC to get guaranteed strike.

>Targeting and navigation and countermeasure systems on MIRVs have come a long way

Sure, but the entire argument is that Russian material is actually crap and unmaintained and won't actually work.

It also depends on Moscow's 'nuclear-war' strategy - is their plan to die or to 'win'.  If they plan on dying then, we might be in trouble, but if they plan on 'winning', then a lot of their targets are going to be missile installations in the Midwest, which combined with failure-rates, gives us a shot of coming out ahead in an exchange.

That is correct. Canada and Mexico are allowed to exist as sovereign nations because America tries to play by the rules of international affairs and because they're generally no bother to us. Do not mistake kindness for weakness. If the US said to Justin Trudeau, ""we want your country. you have 24 hours to sign this treaty giving us control of Canada forever or your country will be reduced to radioactive ash"", what precisely could Trudeau do to stop it? Would he kill his own people over it? The US Air Force and Navy are strong enough that they could even do this to countries on other continents with little trouble.

Russia can only do the same thing to countries that border them, because their air force and navy aren't as strong as the US's. Ukraine just so happens to be one and it isn't covered by America's nuclear umbrella, so really who's going to stop them?

It's monstrously unfair, but there is no greater government restraining countries from simply imposing their will on others. Even the strongest, best armed man in the world is still subject to the jurisdiction of some state and can be validly killed or imprisoned by the state because of the monopoly on the legitimate use of force.

Didn't work out that way so the consolation prize is that now Russia will be dependent on China and this is the second half of the win win situation for China.

Now the best case scenario for China is Russia and the west volley a few nukes and ruin their countries and then China is the new world leader who swoops in and brings its new world order to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. Fear around the world seeing this happen over night would make for an easy transition. The whole fallout aftermath would be it's own issue but I assure you China would have a plan to stabilize the world. 

All of this a possible few months away because Xi let Putins ego start a war. And you can trust Xi gave the go ahead, Putin didn't start this without his blessing. Now Xi sits back to see how it plays out, how much he benefits.

And I will point out the problem with drilling in the US is not ""Biden's leases"" (there are more than enough leases), instead it is bank lenders requiring positive cash flow.  I get really irritated when I hear the bullshit blaming Biden. Because it is bullshit; banks now won't lend without positive cash flow, after the last two oil demand collapses.  Why would they underwrite junk bonds by drillers who just leverage up and then go bankrupt when oil prices collapse? 

I get tired of posting this, but this recent article makes the point. If you look at investment in small/midcap US drillers in shale areas, this has been obvious for two years; a lot went bankrupt or had to shutin wells in the COVID collapse, for the second time in 5 years.  Banks got their pee-pees hammered by oil junk bonds for the second time in 5 years and finally saw the light.

Besides having a very representative panel of real people who have agreed to participate in these kinds of IPSOS surveys, they dial out any bias by weighting the above demographics.

So when they say stuff like ""53% of Americans agree"", they literally mean the perfectly non-gendered average American.

If you purchase their survey you'll get all sorts of breakouts by age, gender, party affiliation, etc.

I'm very familiar with this particular panel and it's one of the gold standards. This isn't some random ""dial 100 people on the phone and see who you get"" kind of survey.

The Soviets wouldn't have bothered, because they relied on bombing targets instead of clearing locations with infantry.

There is a reason why they used cruise missiles in the beginning of the war (on the first day, they lobbed less than 100 Kalibre missile) and tried to land in paratroopers. The Soviets didn't bother with that sort of thing, they literally would send in special forces to secure areas, as well as heavily bombard enemy positions for DAYS before attempting to send in any sort of invasion force. The current Russian military didn't do that.

The Soviet philosophy was basically, never send a soldier where artillery round can do the job.

I'm just mostly saying that its not as easy as ""Lol Mach 20 Homing Nuclear Missiles"", which for some reason keeps getting brought up in this debate (so I was already quite prepared for that braindead argument).

I think the USA has something to worry about in select regions. China's network of sensors in-and-around Taiwan continues to grow. And it will always be a mystery exactly how good China's radar network is. The key therefore, is the radar-network of China.

And now you know why China is building stealth-destroyers (!!!). That's where Naval Combat seems to be moving. Reducing the radar-signatures of giant ships seems ridiculous, but it really is the future. China really is a savvy opponent and are a step ahead. The Hypersonic Ship-killing cruise missiles are one strategy, but the more conventional Naval Battle (ie: moving the Destroyers close enough to the enemy ships to detect and lock-on) is going to be the key IMO to the hypothetical Taiwan situation.
