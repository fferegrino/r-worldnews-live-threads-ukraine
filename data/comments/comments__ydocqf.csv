Day 245 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had a few big air raid alerts active in every city, but in Kharkiv it was quiet the entire time, we had no missile strikes, and no drones were sent in our direction. I’m pretty sure only used Shahed drones on us once or twice and then never again, but they continue to send tons of them at other cities.

Good thing is that, we are definitely much better at dealing with them now than before. Barely any of them have been able to make it through our air defense. Just in the past couple of days they sent about 10-20 drones to Kyiv, and not even one managed to get past our AA. Pretty much same story with the ones that they have been launching from Crimea, about 80% of drones get shot down, but there was a couple that did manage to get through our AA.

And apparently NASAMS has already arrived as well, which is amazing, it’s exactly what we need more of right now. It will be interesting to see where those will be placed, probably somewhere in the south, because currently it’s still getting hit with drones and missiles basically every day. Hopefully it will boost our air defense considerably, Iris-T is doing great job protecting Kyiv, so 2 NASAMS will probably be able to protect 2 more cities.

Wow. This is Anatoly Sobchak's daughter. For those who don't know, Anatoly Sobchak is the former mayor of St. Petersburg that was Putin's mentor when Putin was one of his deputies. Sobchak died of a mysterious sudden heart attack.

His widow, Lyudmila Narusova, is a member of State Duma, and has criticized Putin and spoke out against the war in Ukraine. She seems to have no fear of Putin, herself.

She is quoted in a 2015 article as saying:

>""It's definitely true, in the sense that Putin is a person who believes he's been given a special mission, that he's a statesman,"" says Narusova, 63, speaking at the Museum of Democratic Development she founded in her late husband’s name. ""He really thinks that he understands the interests of the state and implements them accordingly.""

Can send her a -40c or colder sleeping bag. A liner might add more insulation +5 or 10c? The mummy style ones with the hoods work good. 

She should be aware of pipes/toilets/water heaters bursting and freezing. Some foods like uncooked potatoes turn to horrible mush when frozen. Can or jars burst?

They have electricity during the day? If so can store the charge and use light heating stuff like battery powered heat packs during the night under the blankets. Hot water bottle and thermos might work. When the water bottle gets cold refill it with the thermos water.

Probably wouldn't want to use open containers due to steam and water damage and freezing water vapour. Then drain the cold water in the morning?

DO NOT use propane or kerosene indoors. If she starts feeling cold, get up and move around, don't do strenuous activity but stretching, and things like walking around the room will help increase body temperature.

Sleeping is a bit on the tougher side. Too many layers and you'll start to sweat and get cold. You want to layer up to the point where you're warm but not hot at night. If they have extra blankets, make a blanket fort - do not keep the candle in the blanket fort. Getting chilly will wake you up, which you can fix. Sweating and getting your bedding damp is much more difficult to deal with. If they're using candles as a heating method, do not fall asleep with them lit.

I saw a documentary on YouTube about the logistics and why Russian weapon systems suck.

Another company bids on the project saying they can do it for 11k. Undercutting the first company. Then out of that 11k everyone starts taking their cut of the corruption pie.

After it gets to the bottom of the chain and delivered to the soldier it is barely operable or maybe even a ruse. Hell, maybe they are just given old soviet uniforms. 

The Russian military doctrine might have also evolved to include the capabilities of this armor into their plans and how the execute. 

Yet the US/NATO had one of their agents contact an employee or engineer in the first company who set the cost at 20,000 and did all the research into the new body armor. They offer this employee/engineer a very nice sum of money for the specs on this new body armor. 

The US then goes about creating a new bullet/caliber to defeat this body armor. Develop tactics to counter the Russians new tactics. They deploy strikes at the logistical networks required to keep that body armor up and running.

Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”*

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,ydocqf,ittr0cm,"Medvedev is absolutely not a threat. He is an alcoholic with verbal diarrhea and a complete lack of any original thought. He has no mind of his own and politically has less clout than a wet paper bag. The Russian people widely (and I mean across the board, regardless of political leanings) consider him to be the court jester, and he really is. Medvedev is in his position exactly because of these qualities, exactly because he is not a threat to Putin at all. 

Kadyrov and Prigozhin may be more problematic for Putin but there is still one major thing that these two lack: loyalty of the FSB and the army. Chechens are also widely disliked or outright despised by the rest of Russia. Any attempt by Kadyrov to take over would be the easiest cases belli for literally anyone to start Chechen war number 3. Between the FSB and the military, Kadyrov would never get close to taking the Kremlin. 

Prigozhin at least could appeal to hardline Russian ethnofascists, but he is still not FSB, and he won't be able to touch Putin while FSB bigwigs like Patrushev and Bortnikov support him. Those two guys, among others, are a pretty impenetrable vanguard around Putin, and if we add Zolotov (head of Rosgvardia), you have a force of 350,000 loyal and brainless goons to defend your power, and that's not including the police and OMON special forces who number over a million. The numbers I can find for Prigozhin's Wagner group number 8,000 at most. So in reality, the only way he could begin to threaten Putin is if he managed to turn one of those entities against him, but that is incredibly unlikely. Putin still has the power to quite easily ""make him an offer he can't refuse"". Prigozhin simply doesn't.

The only guys I would be looking to, as far as people who have the ability to move against Putin go, is the intelligence siloviki (aka Patrushev, Bortnikov). My personal prediction is that they will eventually, but since moving against a mafia kingpin like Putin is incredibly risky and requires extensive planning (without getting caught), they are content right now to let Putin dirty his own image and reputation to the point that replacing him will be seen as nothing less than an act of grace. 

That said, if they do move against Putin, they wouldn't have their names on it. FSB work behind the scenes. They would remove Putin, but on the surface it would look like a ""standard"" procedure, and likely Mishustin (prime minister) would step into the acting president's role, which is his job anyway if Putin is not there. Mishustin is a classic rubber stamp with a face - he will do exactly what he is told. What happens after that is anyone's guess. Patrushev is a crazier fascist than Putin, so he might try to succeed where Putin failed. He is also a very smart man, and likely not as blinded as Putin was by his position, so he may accept that the war against Ukraine is futile and choose conciliation as the only way to protect the silovik club that he belongs to.

He’ll play things up for the cameras to solidify his stranglehold at home, but he’d rather collect cheques from Moscow than rule it. Even if he did entertain some fanciful notions, there is no way in hell the Russian elite or public would go for a Chechen muslim ruler.

Medvedev is a failed experiment of Putin’s. His public approval peaked in 2010 or so and he’s been a falling star ever since. Admittedly that isn’t as important in Russia as it would be in a democracy, but his increasingly drunk/unhinged behaviour can’t be inspiring confidence from within the elite either. 

Prigozhin has more or less staked his success on Wagner being successful, and Wagner isn’t delivering. He slags off the military so he’s not too popular with them. His private army is both too small and too weakened from fighting to challenge the interior security apparatus of the FSB+Rosgvardia. Not sure what his path to power would even look like. 

FWIW I think we’re more likely to see some combo of Patrushev the elder and whoever his friends are.

Second. They just had an exodus of working age, and probably high tech workers just a few weeks ago. That is very damaging to their economy both in manpower and expertise. But that doesn't bite hard on day one, the effects of this will start accumulating over the next 6 months. 

Basically two bombs have gone off in their economy. sanctions first, then the exodus of workers. Combined you should see maximal effect in about 6 months which is around summer.

 >Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: ""Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no"". It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist who wrote about it in 2009, although the principle is much older. It is based on the assumption that if the publishers were confident that the answer was yes, they would have presented it as an assertion; by presenting it as a question, they are not accountable for whether it is correct or not. The adage does not apply to questions that are more open-ended than strict yes–no questions.

Let's say you're Russia. You don't want to use a nuclear bomb (because it doesn't accomplish any strategic objectives, but it will provoke a NATO response, alienate your few remaining allies, and increase the danger of WWIII) but you do want the west to *think* you might use a nuclear bomb, because you hope the FUD will make them stop weapon deliveries to Ukraine.

You've threatened the west that if your ""annexed"" territories are challenged you'll use nukes, but no one believes you because it's an obvious lie, and you lie constantly, so why would anyone believe you about anything.

So how do you convince the west that you're actually gonna nuke Ukraine? Well, by doing what you normally do when you're actually gonna commit a war crime: accuse the other side of doing it. Everyone's noticed that when you're trying to deflect, you accuse the other side of doing what you're doing, so use that. Start accusing the Ukrainians of using nukes, so that western intelligence will start taking seriously the notion that you intend to use one.

But they can't directly accuse Ukraine of planning to nuke themselves, because Ukraine doesn't have nuclear bombs. But this specific dirty bomb threat makes it seem like you're trying to prepare the information space for themselves to use a nuke and blame it on a ukrainian false flag.

b445c6c9854d5869e411331d31ab4605,ydocqf,itwje1m,"> The ionization of particles is what creates radiation

The actual radiation is neutrons, alpha and beta particles, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation like x-rays and UV light, and so on from the initial reaction when the bomb explodes, as well as from the decay of short-lived radioisotopes produced in the nuclear reaction of the bomb.

Radioactive fallout is mostly parts of the fission core and the fissile tamper (if using one) that didn't undergo fission, the fission products that are unstable isotopes (and their decay products) resulting from the fission reaction, and any radioactive substances produced by neutron activation of nearby materials.  You can also salt the bomb with substances like cobalt to enhance the amount of radioactive fallout produced.

Radioactive fallout is dangerous because it releases radiation, and some of it, like the fission product Iodine-131, can be ingested and even absorbed into the body, where the damage it can cause is much greater.  Things like the plutonium metal from the bomb aren't so bad, because it has a very long half-life, but some of the fission products, and the decay products in the decay chains for them, have very short half-lives, meaning they release radiation much faster for a given number of atoms.

All nuclear bombs start off as fission bombs, so they all have the same fallout issues.  Hydrogen (also thermonuclear or fusion) bombs have a second stage that undergoes fusion of light elements that produces mostly alpha particles (helium nuclei with no electrons), positrons, and neutrinos, so the fusion part doesn't really produce fallout directly.  Fusion bombs can also include a fissionable tamper to utilize the neutrons produced by the fusion stage to produce a huge amount of additional energy, in addition to helping hold the bomb together so the nuclear reactions can continue longer before the heat blows it all apart.  This will add to the potential fallout, similar to the primary fission stage.

Airbursts will have less radioactive fallout due to not picking up and irradiating a bunch of material from the ground.  I don't know if you have to worry about neutron activation of atmospheric gasses, but there is a whole lot less material in the air to potentially irradiate, compared to the ground.

Airbursts are preferred, since the blast waves can travel down towards the ground, hitting a larger area, as well as constructively interfering with reflections of the blast wave bouncing off the atmosphere.  A ground burst will cause a huge amount of damage to the point where it hits, but much of the energy is wasted going up.",1666817130.0,1666816797.0,t3_ydocqf,t1_itw5yx6,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

As you say, we will only find out in five years, however tactically Ukraine  played a huge game of hide and seek with Russia for the first 4 - 5  months of the war.  They didn't make glorious stands, they didn't try to go head to head in tank warfare.  They defended in depth and constantly allowed them on and then hit them when they were weakest and surrounded, the amount of logisitics trucks they destroyed was just insane.  They had superb intelligence and were up against forces who had to communicate often on open channels, they used that well to their advantage and destroyed or cut off many of the best Russian troops early as a result. 

The counteroffensive in Kherson has almost certainly led to a lot of losses especially in August.  That was hard fought for every inch and every river crossing but the original counter in Kharkiv was just too quick and effective to have had anywhere near as many, that was a rout.  You lose some troops in that situation but not many. The lines around Svatove it's too early to tell, but it doesn't seem like it's too attractional yet.  The landscape favours Ukraine there who have used natural topography to superb effect. 

Bakhmut is a hell hole by all accounts and losses there will be high but far far higher for the Russian offensive troops who are being pushed forward in human waves. Severodonetsk saw a shockingly high toll on Russian forces in a similar vein and some of the river crossings of the Sivertski Donestk were just unbelievable in terms of Russian losses. 

3 - 1 IMO seems a good estimate in that light putting Ukrainian losses in the 20k's It also stacks up well with confirmed equipment losses from independent info aggregators. for example Oryx, showing almost 4 - 1 equipment losses

Reddit might ostensibly in many ways be a global forum with a natural US bias on account of the demographic composition of its user base, but on here at least all discussion is always and exclusively viewed through the lens of what is best for Ukraine. 

Not saying that this is necessarily proof of nefarious intervention on here by Ukraine, it could also just be that the major of people have genuinely bought into the belief that this is the only possible ‘moral’ worldview, but nukes are the one topic where Ukrainian interests and the interests of the rest of the Western World might at one point - and perhaps much sooner than later - diverge in an irreconcilable manner: Ukraine is fully back-against-the-wall in this conflict, and would if push came to shove of course prefer to have the fate of the entire world be entwined as closely as possible with their own, whereas the Western World might conceivably come to the point where they’d have to either have to risk their own total destruction or back off from their support for Ukraine if Russia were prepared to fully go through with their threats.

One of the greatest dangers for Ukraine is hence that the Western World could decide to withdraw or limit support for Ukraine to ensure their own survival, and as this forum (whatever the reason for this might be, I won’t speculate on that here) views everything entirely and exclusively through the lens of what’s best for Ukraine, it’s not surprising that any discussion of these matters will immediately be silenced as quickly as possible and never allowed to take place in any shape or form.

It’s quite plain to see once you look out for it - it’s obvious that any complex multi-party conflict will have various interests on different sides that at times could diverge, and any rational forum would at least acknowledge this and have some degree of discussion on it; watch closely how this simple fact will never be acknowledged - or even be allowed to be mentioned - on here at all, and any comments that could conceivably lead into that direction will be deleted, downvoted and disparaged with a barrage of ad hominem attacks under the guise of “you’re playing into Russian propaganda, that’s dangerous!’ as if what people say on Reddit had any real meaning whatsoever in the real world and everyone on here was actually either a high-ranking military official or a secret agent.",False,1666840404.0,t3_ydocqf,t1_itxsxha,,7,3,0,3,0,0,
