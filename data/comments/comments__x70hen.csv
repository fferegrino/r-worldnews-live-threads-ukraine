Day 195 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, but instead they did 3 missile strikes, one in the morning and two during night. The first missile strike happened at 9:20am. They hit an apartment building, destroying the 3 top floors. Bastards are trying to kill as many civilians as they can, thankfully they didn’t manage to kill any this time, three people were rescued from under the rubble.

Then they did another missiles strike at 12:30am, firing as many as 7-8 missiles, at least 3 of which landed in Kharkiv, one malfunctioned in Belgorod, and others we don’t know about. After that they did yet another missile strike just recently, at 5:40am. They fired about 3 missiles, all three landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, the explosions were pretty distant sounding.

Russians are extremely mad about losing Balakliia, and it’s definitely the reason for their missile strikes aimed at civilians, it’s their way of trying to “take revenge”. On the topic of if we can sleep here, there’s not really much choice; you just have to sleep through missiles. Sometimes the air raid alert manages to wake up you up, other times it doesn’t, so you just sleep while missiles hit your city.
 
That message that Russians were all posting almost at the same time when fighting for Balakliia was very funny, “there’s no panic, there were mostly mobilized troops, the reinforcements are coming. The situation is +/- the same as with Nazi counteroffensive in south”. So it’s *that* bad? It’s like they are admitting that everything is going bad, but they can’t say it outright.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 6 September 2022


- Ukraine's offensive operations in the Kherson region continued over the weekend. On 05 September 2022, the Odesa Journal reported 27 sorties by Russian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the west bank of the Dnipro, compared to an average of 50 a day throughout August. On 21 August 2022, Ukrainian forces reported shooting down three Russian Orlan-10 tactical UAVs in a single day.


- In recent years, Russian doctrine has given an increasingly prominent role for UAVs, particularly to spot targets for its artillery to strike. UAVs can be vulnerable to both kinetic effects - where they are directly shot down - and to electronic jamming.


- In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain stocks of UAVs, exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders' tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.",False,1662443240.0,t3_x70hen,t3_x70hen,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

It didn’t take long for it to become apparent to everybody that Soviet style governments weren’t sustainable, not having a mechanism to throw the bums out peacefully was a ticking time-bomb in every Soviet-Bloc country. Lech Wałęsa and the movement that he was a part of managed to make the transition to democracy relatively peacefully, which was seen as a minor miracle at the time. Democracy had almost never arisen peacefully before. 


But people fretted about the Soviet Union proper being able to pull off that same trick. Mikhail Gorbachev worried about the Soviet Union being able to pull off that same trick. Everybody’s worst fear was a chaotic implosion of a country with thousands of nuclear weapons and the extreme uncertainty associated with that. But it didn’t happen. Not then.



But the threat remained. After the fall of the USSR, it became geopolitical strategists worst fear that now Russia would implode in chaos. A belligerent adversary nation was a known entity, one that people knew how to deal with. A Balkanized Russia with warlords taking control of nukes wasn’t. Russia being stable was considered more important than them being friendly.



A lot of decisions got made with that thinking in mind. Giving Russia the Soviet UN Security Council seat. Germany deliberately creating economic entanglements. Reacting timidly to the invasion of Crimea. Etc. Whatever happens, don’t let Russia collapse. That would be really bad.


That fear persists, but Russia engaging in the type of behavior that everybody worried a failed Russia might engage in changes that calculation significantly. We have the daily nuclear-war threats. We have the all-out wars of aggression. We have the populations of radicalized and violent extremists. Russia didn’t collapse in to a dozen or more rogue-states with nukes, they just became one big rogue-state with nukes.



Now that it looks almost certain that the Ukraine invasion will fail people are starting to look forward to what will come after. Russia doesn’t appear to have a Lech Wałęsa type character for people to rally around. Putin has been very thorough in his brainwashing of his people and in disappearing any charismatic potential replacements. It seems unlikely that anything will change over there as long as he’s alive.



Is the world better off with a belligerent Putin-led Russia? Or with whatever emerges after their collapse? I can guess what a Ukrainian might say.



The fear of the un-known, the fear of uncertainty, is a very normal and natural human emotion that can lead to some bad decision-making sometimes. The known bad thing gets chosen over the thing that might lead to a good thing, or might not. The world is effectively in an abusive relationship with Putin, and he knows it. 



But after Ukraine finishes kicking Russia out of their country it’s going to be time to weigh those pros and cons one more time. If Russia doesn’t accept their defeat? If Russia continues to bomb and lob missiles at Ukraine even after they have been expelled from Ukrainian territory?

a994b5c0bbf89f7931139b78d9ad3f0b,x70hen,inby1e8,"**100 days to victory; or, will the Ukrainian offensive ever culminate?**

If the only tool you have is a hammer, then everything will look like a nail, as the old saying goes. As an amateur World War One historian, I’ve previously mused on this subreddit that the Russian offensive from April through to June was playing out in some ways like the German Spring Offensive of World War One: making some worrying gains on paper and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, but also eroding some of the attackers’ manpower and getting their best troops killed off.

Now that the Ukrainians are on the offensive, I’m starting to see parallels with the Allied “100 Days Offensive” of the First World War - lots of offensives up and down the line, attacks behind enemy lines, heavy casualties on both sides, and no obvious culmination point where offensive operations have to cease. I think many of us were expecting the Kherson offensive, when it came, to be a short sharp shock and awe attack - throwing large amounts of resources into a small area of the line with the goal of capturing one specific city. But with the recent attacks at Kharkiv and in the Donbas, and the relatively steady pace of the offensive in Kherson, I’m wondering if the goal is to create a new unrelenting offensive up and down the line.

This would have many goals, most notably keeping the Russians continually on the backfoot. However, if Ukraine is confident in its logistics and supplies, then it might allow them to achieve a kind of “offensive escape velocity”, a positive feedback loop where they maintain the initiative, pick their battles, and inflict steady casualties, gradually tipping the war more and more in their favour. This in turn could prevent Russia from regaining the initiative and concentrating new troops for an assault and allow the offensive to gradually sap their resolve and manpower.

Here are some of the indicators that we would expect to see if Ukraine had this strategy in mind and were pursuing it successfully -

-	Non-culmination. There won’t come a distinct day or week where the offensive culminates. Instead, the offensive will be maintained continually, but with increasing emphasis given to one theatre after another.

-	Taking of prisoners. One distinctive feature of the 100 Days Offensive was that the Allies began to capture increasing numbers of German prisoners. This in turn reflected plunging morale among German troops. If we see the same thing here, it would provide evidence that the war might be coming to a close.

-	Undoing enemy progress. One painful feature of the 100 Days Offensive for the Germans was that almost all of the gains of the Spring Offensive were undone in fairly rapid order. This in turn further depressed their morale. If Ukraine were to launch successful attacks on  Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, this could have a similar effect.

-	Striking seemingly impregnable strongpoints. Another key feature of the 100 Days Offensive was its successful breaching of the Hindenberg Line like the battle of St Quentin Canal. It’s not clear what the equivalent would be in this war - perhaps some successful attacks on the northern tip of Crimea proper.

I'll further will explain why this is relevant on the world stage and Ukraine:

- Giuliani (Trump's lawyer) gave an interview at start of conflict, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO (more on this).

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow (On July 4th) and met with their government officials in a closed-door meeting.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

What most likely bit the Russians harder than anything was the lack of communications between intelligence, ground, and naval forces, the lack of munitions and the targeting electronics, and a rigidly inflexible top-down system of assigning targets for strikes.

With the first point, I'm not entirely sure that the Russians had a significant capacity for troops and intelligence units to communicate with planes that were providing air support.   Basically, troops and or intelligence would have to phone their headquarters, the headquarters would have to relay that request to the air force, and then the AF HQ would have to tell the pilots.  Besides creating a whole host of bottlenecks and points of failure, by the time a pilot receives information or a request, it may be far too late to be useful.

Second point - it's rather clear that the amount of precision weaponry and guidance systems were woefully insufficient.  Not only were there not enough PGMs, but most of the planes did not have the capability to drop the weapons, or to add pods/equipment to allow them to do so.   Whether this was an intentional oversight ('artillery is king' approach, etc.), or a matter of graft, who knows?   On top of that, if you don't have the equipment, you can't train and practice on it - so it's dumb bombs or bust at that point.

Finally, I suspect there's a very top-down orientation to how the pilots execute their strike missions.   They're most likely receiving the plans from higher-ups, who may or may not understand the reality of the situation.   Unlike the West, whom emphasize the pilot understanding their overall and tactical tasks in operations for every mission, as well as getting practice in that training, the Russians don't have a lot of initiative allowed them, and they get smacked for not following orders.  They might be dropping bombs on a target that is long gone, or no longer a priority.  They might be doing the motions, but they're not contributing to the fight on the ground.",1662472821.0,1662472214.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inb0zmv,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

I mean, by definition, a video like this is not representative unless we know it's happening to a sizeable amount of people. I always advise people to *not* take videos of the war as representative of broader outcomes because it's virtually inevitable that there will be a video like this published of some Ukrainian forces under attack, and then the same people that took this video as proof that Russia is losing, will see the other video and panic and think it's proof that Ukraine is losing.

In reality, combat encounters like this one have happened thousands of times all over the front by both sides. Literally tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been killed like this. It happens to the winning side even while they are crushing the losing side. And one side will be crushing their opponent in one pocket along the line in one region of the front, while their side gets crushed in a different pocket along the line of a different region of the front.

The exact human reasoning fallacy actually happened a week ago when almost all of the combat footage being released showed dead Ukrainians and Ukrainian prisoners. Russia released a lot of isolated footage in order to try to convince people that there was this large, overwhelming trend of Ukrainian losses in a failed counter-offensive. The reality was much more complex, but it *seemed* one-sided because of the lack of Ukrainian footage of Russian losses and prisoners.

This stuff is *always* going on, constantly, in different areas of the front. By itself it doesn't prove any kind of general trend. It's unclear to what extent this unit was cut off or just getting sniped at by a lone Ukrainian unit. They could have well been the attacking force, enjoying numerical superiority. They might even have captured the objective they were ordered to attack and given the enemy more losses. We don't know when it happened or what the ultimate outcome was.

So either these are movements of opportunity taken by Ukrainian units in those sectors, whom were able to identify weaknesses in the Russian lines, or the Ukrainians were able to seriously improve their opsec game. I'm still betting on the first of these two options to be honest.

Edit: it has been pointed out to me that the Ukrainians just a little over one month ago moved two armored brigades to that sector of the Frontline. When I made my comment I was not aware of this development.

I'd also challenge this idea that the ""best Russian troops are isolated in Kherson"". It is true that the best defensive action around Kherson is being done by experienced Russian units, like their airborne divisions and special forces brigade, but I'd argue that Russia's best units are in the Donbas. The Wagner mercenaries continue to be the tip of the spear for Russian offensives. When you look at how the Russians were able to secure the Luhansk Oblast, it was mostly because of the exploits of the Wagner mercenary units who captured Popasna and then were able to break through Ukrainian lines to threaten the encirclement of the Severodonetsk and Lysychansk salient.  Likewise at this very moment, the biggest threat for the new Ukrainain defensive lines in the Donbas are coming from the Wagner mercenary units that are attempting to take Bakhmut. 

I think the best Russian units in this war, are those mercenaries, they seem to be better equipped, better trained, and have better leadership than most Russian units.",1662498236.0,1662491111.0,t3_x70hen,t1_incfhf1,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

""The Hundred Days Offensive (8 August to 11 November 1918) was a series of massive Allied offensives which ended the First World War. Beginning with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August) on the Western Front, the Allies pushed the Central Powers back, undoing their gains from the German spring offensive. The Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line, but the Allies broke through the line with a series of victories, starting with the Battle of St Quentin Canal on 29 September. The offensive, together with a revolution breaking out in Germany, led to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 which ended the war with an Allied victory. The term ""Hundred Days Offensive"" does not refer to a battle or strategy, but rather the rapid series of Allied victories against which the German Army had no reply.""

M: Trump is massively in debt, including debts held by China and Russia. He is highly motivated by greed, and a perception of power / success.

I: ..likely not relevant as Trump appears to lack any real ideology outside of what he panders to drum up support. Being morally bankrupt was likely the first bankruptcy in a chain of many.

C: Trump's history of bad deals and perpensity for illegal / shady (business, moral, and criminal) practices coupled with his well documented ties to people like Jeffrey Epstein, as well as his own stated actions (""locker room talk"", prostitutes, infidelity) makes him a prime target for compromat.

E: This is self explanatory, his inflated (yet fragile) ego tied to his malignant narcissism will cause him to choose to commit a treasonous act over gracefully accepting a loss.

About the creation of the oligarchs, and this is just a piece of the puzzle:

Workers at factory X all were given shares of the state-owned company they used to work for.Most of them very quickly spent their savings and didn't have enough income to buy food and other necessities. While they wanted to start selling their shares to pay for their basic needs, the shares massively plummeted and were selling for pennies. A few key people had money (USD $ mainly), and managed to buy complete industries for a few hundreds of thousands of dollars.

My opinion - these are likely best estimates in the face of fluid situations and imperfect information gathering.  One way to try to put some guardrails on it is by looking at OSINT confirmed losses like Oryx does, and on estimates of total RU troops and equipment in theater.  While there could be some perceived incentive to inflate the numbers to look good, there's also plenty of incentive to tell the truth as reasonably as possible.

For example, is anyone really swayed if 150 vs. 250 RU troops were killed in any given day? Or 10 auxiliary vehicles vs. 20?

I don't think Ukraine directly flat out lies like Russia but I think they are engaged in best case scenario reporting. Ukraine doesn't exactly publish in detail how they reach those numbers but here are some examples I've picked up along the way when they went into detail:

- When a Russian APC gets hit by artillery fire which causes a complete destruction they'll count the Russian dead by how many people that vehicle can carry. There is no way to confirm exactly how many Russians were in vehicle but they'll just add the capacity of the vehicle. Needless to say that is an optimistic estimation that isn't always true.

- Intercepting phone calls where emotional Russian soldiers are reporting losses. If you can picture yourself in this situation you know humans have a tendency to exaggerate in these scenarios.

I'm struggling to imagine how Russia can turn the tide.  Every time they retreat, equipment is lost (to enemy fire or abandonment).  There is no (or very limited) resupply.  Once defensive lines that have taken months to prepare are overcome, there is insufficient time to entrench new positions (instead they can only really rely on secondary lines or preprepared positions).  Moreover, morale (already pitiful) will be through the floor.

By contrast, for Ukraine, on almost every count the story is the opposite: they may seize abandoned equipment; they have constant resupply; they can make use of Russian-built fortifications if they wish.  Every advance will further boost their morale.

On top of all this, Russia continue to face a hostile local population who are either directly attacking them or feeding intelligence to Ukraine.  Ukraine have accurate ranged weapons with which they continue to hit key Russian targets (ammo dumps, command posts, etc) well behind the front line.

I think the outcome is a foregone conclusion.  The only question is how long it takes and how much damage is inflicted.",False,1662458869.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inal8cb,,2,54,0,54,0,0,

They were tactical victories but strategic defeats for Russia, costing way more Russian troops and time than Russia could afford to spend. Ukraine’s sacrifices there bought the time they needed to transition from their original troops and arms to all the new ones gathered after the invasion started. 

Russia was counting on their old attrition strategy that had worked repeatedly in the past. It was always a successful strategy but relied on the people they were attacking being without sufficient resources and allies to help them resupply and rearm before Russia was out of supplies and soldiers. Unfortunately for Russia, Ukraine was able to endure their lowest supply and manpower moments and come back swinging. Russia lost their momentum in July and August.

Cyrillic letter Yi
-----
Edit: my reply to you because of locked thread 

They look the same 

I think alt+ plus sign 0407 maybe but it didn't work for my windows machine so maybe not. 

They do look the same but are different according to the Unicode standard and software may not treat them as equivalent for search/spell check/find in page etc. Whether they're different in the real world is a tougher philosophical questions.

Cyrillic Аа and Latin Aa are also different. But since both Russian and Ukranian have Aa it's the same Unicode letter for both languages.

There is at least Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic based alphabets (Greek is its own thing) so even if the letters look the same in Latin/Cyrillic/Greek they're counted as seperate. So if you go to the Cyrillic Yi wiki page Ctrl+f and search  ï it will match all the Latin I without the double dots but not the Cyrillic ї",1662524026.0,1662514177.0,t3_x70hen,t1_indnwt9,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

It is close to Izyum - which Russians spent months trying to take - and if Izyum gets liberated it would be a giant failure for RU. But we're far away from that - Izyum is likely getting resupplied from direction of Borova and Horokhovatka and there are a lot of little towns and villages that have to fall before Ukrainians can threaten that supply line.,False,1662476683.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inbkg8e,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

Cutting off or capturing Izyum would relieve a lot of pressure on those cities, and allow troops to support other targets eastward like Bakhmut and Siversk.

Izyum is situated west of the Oskill river from other Russian-controlled territory, and there are only a few bridge crossings (which makes them targets, some of which Ukraine has already rendered inoperable early in the war). So instead, Izyum's ground lines of communication come from the North across the border. There is basically a route from Belgorod (major Russian city and staging point) that splits in two after it enters Ukraine in a town called Kupiansk, 40 miles north of Izyum. The western trunk splits southwest and goes more or less straight to Izyum, while the eastern chunk meanders over the river, so it's less useful.

Balakliya sits less than 15 km (within easy striking distance of artillery) from the western (superior) highway outside of Izyum. Plus as a city of 25000, it's easier to house and defend troops in abandoned buildings than it is in the treeline or exposed farmland, so they can sustain operations there for quite some time. By that token, Russia may not be able to successfully defend the other crossroads on the route, which are mostly small villages. 

As a result, their preferred supply route will be unusable, and their secondary route threatened. If they want to hold Izyum, they will have to start taking chances on river crossings (we can see how well that has gone for them so far elsewhere), or they would need to take a *southern* supply route.

Well that's already the narrative. The inception of this war is Moscow's claim that the west conjured up the 2014 Maidan revolution in a cynical attempt to cleave Ukraine away from Russia's sphere of influence - and that they sided with Nazis to do it. Russia using its army to respond to western political meddling was meant to read as a show of strength to the Russian people - i.e. that they're going to decisively stand up to western intelligence operations while also taking a measured/""special"" approach to avoid a wider escalation.

If the claim shifts to ""we are directly fighting NATO troops"", then Putin has two problems;

The first is that it means he failed to deliver the special operation meant to deter the west, and instead dove into conflict with them in an unprepared way. He could never have sold this conflict as a war of choice against NATO. Not to the Russian people, the army, the oligarchy, or state institutions (though maybe the FSB would be on board). His control over those bases of power will erode.

The second is that it means he will face calls to escalate that he cannot answer. If the Kremlin line is that NATO is deploying troops to Ukraine, then Russians will (increasingly) demand a military response - e.g. strikes in Poland to disrupt western supply lines, and opening a front in the Baltics, a challenging area for NATO to defend. Russia already seems to have made the strategic calculation that it cannot strike western depots and staging areas in Poland, and that is unlikely to change. So if the line is that NATO is hitting them directly, and Putin does not respond, well, that will erode his grip too.",False,1662479118.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inb7hbz,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

 >The Hundred Days Offensive (8 August to 11 November 1918) was a series of massive Allied offensives which ended the First World War. Beginning with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August) on the Western Front, the Allies pushed the Central Powers back, undoing their gains from the German spring offensive. The Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line, but the Allies broke through the line with a series of victories, starting with the Battle of St Quentin Canal on 29 September. The offensive, together with a revolution breaking out in Germany, led to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 which ended the war with an Allied victory.

*citation needed*

On the other hand Occams Razor , would have us believe that since Ukraine is not in the position to simply replace entire units and scrap the tanks they already got, adding a secondary logistics train, would be a burden.

Tanks are high maintenance and new tanks, be them Abrams or Leopards or whatever, would mean, that beside training for both crews and mechanics, you have to ship every single spare part from spark plugs to cannon ammo, IN ADDITION to what they already have to lug around for their existing tanks.

While undoubtedly Ukrainian logistics are superior to russian ones, they are not gods. 

The whole ""russia captuiring NATO equipment"", while valid, I doubt is the main reason. The upgraded Polish tanks are upgraded with western components, British CVRT and German PzH2000 are also full of such equipment. Any of those could be captured. 

The Spanish offer for old Leo2A4 fell because they were unusable. The same with old Leo1s that were rumored.

The point is that any new tanks, would need to be delivered in large numbers to offset the problems that they would create by needing an entirely separate logistic arrangement, not because of some shady conspiracy.",False,1662497251.0,t3_x70hen,t1_incvhki,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Generally, *most* of the time, they have visual recon or sigint intercepts or such, so they can know the exact or near-exact numbers.  Think of the drone bombings--guy who gets blown in half, that's 1 (one) casualty.  Tank turret goes skyward while moving in action, that's 2 dead, no question.  But the estimates tend to be *very* conservative, actually.  APCs are assumed to be just a driver & gunner, trucks are assumed to be empty of people unless bodies physically seen, etc.  It's easy to blow up a covered truck/APC and not see people because the explosion was particularly violent, or not know if a tank is on a skeleton crew or not--and from what I can tell, and what I've read (and I'm kicking myself I don't have sources immediately available, feel free to take it as bullshit), the Ukrainians are rounding *down* in these situations.

For example, there was an airbase strike, one of the first long-range ones, where the Ukrainian Army reported iirc like 7-8 aircraft destroyed.  Sat photos showed that plainly obvious, 1-2 plane-shaped scorches, and probably 1-2 that were peppered by fragments.

I have a hunch that Russia's losses are *even greater,* albeit by a small margin.

This obviously not great for them. Also in the full video, guy asked them to take their helmets and armor vest, and they said they have none.

Definitely, this could just be more part and parcel of the bare-minimum equipped units they've been throwing into the meat grinder in the Donbass. We've known for a long time now that these units are stripped out of other units and thrown head-long into the main offensive fighting. They are used in crazy, borderline kamikaze probing attacks at the focal point of action. They move forward until they encounter resistance. If they appear to be outnumbered, they will retreat and call in artillery.

>Overall considering their gear, age , training, I don't think russian guys have good chances in close-range fighting against Ukrainian troops that had professional training in the west, who have an idea of what they are doing.

I think a lot of people take press releases Ukraine and their allies put out way too much at face value. Just last week the US army was talking about how during war games they talked Ukraine out of a wide ranging offensive because of the risk involved and their lack of experience, we see now the offensive is much wider than just a few pushes near Kherson. We're now seeing the major push might not even be at Kherson and that was more of a ploy to draw Russian troops away from other areas.

Ukraine and their allies are playing the information war just like the Russians and although they don't make crazy shit up they very much like to play their cards close to their chest and aren't above being deceptive when it gets them an advantage in some way. Plus who is going to be angry that they might have tricked the Russians and pretended they weren't going to attack where they did and/or with as many forces?

Many Americans actually preferred Germany to continue Nordstream 2, mainly because if the USA starts exporting gas, then our prices would go up instead of being dirt cheap here (ample supply, not much export capability). 

Also, here in the USA the 2014 Crimean occupation didn't get much news coverage - I felt like I heard more about annexation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia more so than Crimea, not sure why, maybe there was just more events in the news cycle at that time or something.",False,1662473979.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inaujg9,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The Ukrainians were largely local, territorial defense units, so they were literally defending their homes and families, so even as things went badly, supplies dwindled and casualties mounted they kept fighting, because any other option was unthinkable.  That forced the Russians to pound away at the city mercilessly to take out the defenders and secure it.  


Little of that holds for Kherson.  The Russian's are far from home, the locals hate them and are working against them.  The Russian's are fighting for nothing more than Putin's pride, and that's not much of a motivator against incoming attacks.  There's also the factor that Ukraine will not indiscriminately level the city to take it, nor do they need to.  The weapons they have are far more precise, and they'll probably go out of their way to avoid civilian casualties.  


I suspect that Ukraine will take a softer siege approach to Kherson, slowly, and carefully degrading the Russian position, so as not to harm the locals more than necessary.  That does mean the fight will probably go on for longer, unless the Russians surrender, but I think it may not be terribly hard to get a good number of Russians to do just that once it becomes clear there is no hope of escape and no point in keeping fighting.",False,1662460419.0,t3_x70hen,t1_inaorx8,,5,15,0,15,0,0,

> Europe, however, obtains 30 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas supplies from Russia. For Germany, the proportions are similarly high. As long as this is the case, Europe will remain hostage to Putin's foreign policy. This dependency is also evident in the way it deals with Nawalny. Germany was willing to take him in and treat him after the Russian poison attack, and that was a good thing. But when Navalny decided to put his life on the line for freedom in Russia and thus for peace in Europe, people in this country shook their heads at him as they did at Volodymyr Zelensky, who is regularly presented in our media as an ""ex-comedian,"" but never as Europe's only Jewish head of state, because that would contradict the Kremlin's fairy tale that Ukrainian patriotism is synonymous with anti-Semitism.

> No sooner had Navalny been sent to a notorious prison camp, where the failed assassination attempt is to be made up by other means, than Saxony's Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer traveled with a delegation to Moscow, where he bought Russian Corona vaccine, among other things. Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus Söder also concluded a preliminary contract for Sputnik V - an ingratiation at an inopportune time, which alone would have been enough to disqualify him as a candidate for chancellor. Admittedly, Armin Laschet is hardly any better. The CDU/CSU candidate, who is also the prime minister of a country with large energy companies, has repeatedly warned against ""marketable anti-Putin populism"" and the ""demonization of Putin"" - as if, of all people, Nawalny and his comrades-in-arms, whose fight for democracy has now been declared illegal by the Kremlin, were populists, ""marketable"" ones at that.
