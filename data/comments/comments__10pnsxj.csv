Former director of the CIA, commander of the American group in Iraq, General David Petraeus, in an interview with The Washington Post, spoke about a possible scenario of the return of Crimea by Ukraine.

""If Ukraine can completely isolate Crimea and if it has high-precision munitions, it will be able to start shelling the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, various air bases, various seaports and everything else, and then at some point enter the territory of Crimea,"" Petraeus shared the forecast.

>WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The United States is readying more than $2 billion worth of military aid for Ukraine that is expected to include longer-range rockets for the first time and other munitions and weapons, two U.S. officials briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

>The weapons aid is expected to be announced as soon as later this week, the officials said. It is also expected to include support equipment for Patriot air defense systems, precision guided munitions and Javelin anti-tank weapons, they added.

Day 341-342 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a mostly quiet day, there were no other missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv after that hit on an apartment building. Thankfully there were no more casualties other than the 4 people that we knew about almost immediately after the strike, it was a small apartment building and not many people were inside at the time of the strike. 

It’s not even close to the first time that S-300 missiles hit an apartment building in Kharkiv, but usually they hit bigger ones, and those usually have an attic, which, as it turns out, is actually a very good shield against S-300 missiles (and anything smaller). When there were hits on buildings with an attic before usually there were no, or minimal, casualties, because the warhead of an S-300 is only capable of destroying about a floor and a half, so attic took the vast majority of damage in most cases. Sadly, the building they hit 2 days ago had no attic from what I can see, so it managed to destroy the flat on the top floor and damaged the one below it.

Today was a bit less quiet day, we had a lot of air raid alerts throughout the day, most of which were triggered by Russian aircraft flying around in Belarus, but there were also some alerts that were caused by actual threats. There were at least a couple of missile launches from Belgorod, which were aimed at Kupiansk as usual, but this time our forces had some counter hits on Russian targets in both Belgorod’s and Kursk’s oblasts, so that’s good.

The news about GLSDBs most likely being announced very soon are amazing to see, finally there is some action to get us longer range weapons which we really need. When we get those the only safe place for Russians inside of Ukraine will be deep inside Crimea, which is still one safe place too many, but that will change once our forces start liberating Zaporizhzhia’s and Kherson’s oblasts. The only question is how long it will take for us to get those bombs, they are brand new weapons, but they are made out of already existing ones, so hopefully it won’t take too long to manufacture.

A military coup is becoming a possibility in Russia as the war in Ukraine continues, President Vladimir Putin’s former speechwriter said Monday.

Speaking to CNN’s Erin Burnett, speechwriter turned political analyst Abbas Gallyamov said that as Russian losses mount in Ukraine and the country experiences hardship brought by Western sanctions, Russians will look for someone to blame.

""The Russian economy is deteriorating. The war is lost. There are more and more dead bodies returning to Russia, so Russians will be coming across more difficulties and they'll be trying to find explanation why this is happening, looking around to the political process and they'll be answering themselves: 'Well, this is because our country is governed by an old tyrant, an old dictator,'"" Gallyamov said, referring to Putin.


That moment may come in the next 12 months, he said.

“So in one year when the political situation changes and there's a really hated unpopular president at the head of the country and the war is really unpopular, and they need to shed blood for this, at this moment, a coup becomes a real possibility,” he added.

Gallyamov also said he believes Putin may cancel presidential elections scheduled to be held in March 2024.

“Judging by his actions, when he is escalating on something without necessity, he might really cancel the elections. Without victory over Ukraine, he'll face difficulty with the Russians. Russians don't need him if he's not strong. He might really declare the martial law and cancel the elections,” Gallyamov said.

This isn't the Napoleonic era where men just load cannons, ride horses and shoot muskets at each other, while kings host elaborate dinner parties while their starving subjects grow turnips, right? This is modern warfare.

According to wikipedia, only ~17% of their population are men aged 18-44.  Sure that's 25M, but those guys are maintaining society.  In a year of fighting, estimates have 125K+ (some have it at 180K) killed/wounded.  That's 0.5% of all the available men they have, conservatively.

With another massive offensive with largely untrained men, with 1980s equipment against a growing arsenal of modern tanks, GPS guided munitions, drones, missile systems, i.e. better defense than a year ago, with entrenched positions, I mean, spread out over all those hundreds of miles... can they afford the Napoleonic approach?

> Over the last several months, the Ukrainians have been visibly slowing down. The reason why Ukrainian momentum has been slowing down is twofold.
> 
> First of all, the Ukrainians have a very limited number of equipment, especially artillery, and tanks, which are indispensable for offensive operations. That is why the Ukrainian offensive operation in the Kharkiv region has been slowing down, and the Ukrainians went from taking vast areas in a matter of days to taking cities, to taking villages, to now fighting for individual positions.
> 
> Being short on the equipment also means that the Ukrainians are betting a substantial proportion of their mechanized army on every offensive operation. So, one failed operation can lead to the loss of almost all heavy equipment and to virtually full demilitarization – one mistake can cost everything. 
> 
> The Ukrainian command is continuously faced with incredibly difficult choices. They need to stop offensive actions at the optimal time, they need to build up reserves during the defensive period, and they need to prepare and commit these reserves to the next offensive operation as soon as possible with no margin for error.
> 
> The second reason why the Ukrainian momentum has been slowing down is that the Russians finally deployed their mobilized troops that were undergoing training in Belarus, and they also delivered another batch of conscripts for Wagner Group Private Military Company. That is how the Russians managed to flood the Soledar front line with troops and breach the Ukrainian defense.
> 
> And they overcommitted their troops despite high losses deliberately. They know that the Ukrainians are preparing for the next offensive operation, and they know that the tanks will soon arrive, so what they are trying to do is to force the Ukrainians to burn these precious reserves in an attempt to stabilize the situation. But the Ukrainian command knows the price, and that is why sometimes certain territories are deliberately not saved, and certain counterattacks are deliberately not conducted. However important Soledar was, ensuring the success of the next massive counteroffensive operation is much more important. 
> 
> And when it comes to the next Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Ukrainians have three options. First of all, when the tanks and artillery arrive, the Ukrainians can conduct a small-scale offensive operation and take Kreminna and Svatove. The second option is to conduct a large-scale offensive operation in the Zaporizhzhia region. The third option is to conduct both operations, but as you understand, it will largely depend on how many pieces of equipment they receive and how quickly.

Somewhere in the middle of the video they started to claim that Russia is the upholder of European culture and values .... like, WTF? 

ChatGPT: European culture is a term that encompasses the culture of people living in Europe, which is rooted in the culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. It is also influenced by the cultures of the various populations that have inhabited the region throughout its history, including the Celts, Germanic peoples, Slavs, Romans, and Greeks. European culture also encompasses the culture of its former colonies, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. European culture is characterized by its focus on the individual, its emphasis on rationality, its appreciation of the fine arts, and its appreciation for the value of life. It also includes a strong emphasis on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

Let's go point by point.

Russia is not upholding the rule of law, they just invaded an internationally recognized autonomous country. Even their buddies Iran and China do not recognize their annexed regions as Russian. On top of that, Russia is beyond corrupt. Also, try opposing Putin and you might find yourself suddenly being pushed out of a window from the third floor.

Human rights in Russia? You demonstrate, and you land in prison, and what happens in those prisons? Free press is gone as well. In February 2017, with the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, Russia decriminalized domestic violence. And so on.

Value for life? Not Ukrainian life, and not a day goes by of Russian talking heads threatening the west with nuclear obliteration. I mean WTF? Is that not a little contradictory to the supposed notion that Russia would value life? The Russians do not even value life of their own. Go to a sub like combatfootage and see the waves of Russian men being obliterated by Ukrainian artillery. They just send those Russian guys across open fields, fully aware of what will happen to most of them. I have also seen, plenty of times, that they leave their injured behind or do not bother to recover their dead. They just leave them to rot in the open. If Russia valued life, then it would not have started this insanity. They are more invested in fighting imperial wars and grabbing resources than protecting life.

I also do not see a focus on the individual. I see a lot of sacrificing for mother Russia.

Now, nearly a month later, pro-government military telegram channels began discussing the resignation of Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky, the Commander of the VDV (Russia's Airborne Forces).

> According to rumors, Teplinsky told Gerasimov to ""go to hell"" because Gerasimov demanded to immediately throw the paratroopers on the offensive. “He believes that neither officers, nor privates, nor non-commissioned officers can be used as “cannon fodder,” wrote military blogger Yuri Kotenok.

This was when Gerasimov had a public catfight with Prigozhin over who gets credit for Soledar, and Wagner units were rotated out and VDV moved in. Before that Wagner would attack the central fortified areas and VDV took the less-defended outlying areas. 

We also know of the less terrible VDV units being rushed in to counter the Ukrainian advance on Kreminna.

All of that and more has been happily given to Ukraine with more assuredly heading it's way. At the same time, a countries only true guarantor of it's security and well-being is itself. No other countries are obligated to give anything to Ukraine at their own expense and risk.

If things do escalate in other parts of the world, such as Iran, the Korea's, and between Taiwan and China; many Western countries will want as many jets as possible to hedge their bets in the favor of their own countries interests.

What has happened to Ukraine is a tragedy, and we have and should continue to support them in everyway possible. Both as governments and individuals. But there are limits of what every country is willing to do for others, many times those limits change. They may or may not on jets for Ukraine.

Trying another offensive on Kyiv anytime soon is too risky for Russia. I said Russia would lose in Jan 2022 if they tried to take Kyiv without realizing Putin had bought his own propaganda. He has probably learned the lesson by now, but anything is possible. 
If Putin did invade from Belarus, and the Belarusian military was also ordered to invade, this war could quickly go very bad for Putin. Even without Belarusian support, another failure at trying to take Kyiv would look very bad for Russian propaganda.

Despite that, I don't see an assault on Kyiv anytime soon. I think Russia will try to finish their objectives in the south east before anything else. They could open a new front, but I don't think they can sustain two major offensives at a time. One could be used just to draw UA forces away and spread them a little thinner.

I am concerned though. Russias manpower shortage appears to be fading for now, until UA liquidates another 50K or so. They also have adjusted (as well as they can) to the presence of HIMARS and appear to have learned some lessons as time has gone on. Developments aren't positive around Bakhmut and even though Russia takes heavy losses, the losses Ukraine takes are not insignificant, especially when comparing troop quality.

The western countries beyond Poland pretty much declining fighter jets is a reminder that NATO is still leery of escalating the conflict. Maybe they come around like they have for other weapons systems, but every delay gives Russia more time to adjust and advance. I was disappointed that F 16s were declined, but I understand why. It concerns me, though, because what if we reach a breaking point where it becomes clear that unless Ukraine gets XYZ, they could lose?

I'm not saying that will happen. The brave Ukrainians continue to amaze. However, the Kharkiv and Kherson counter offensives are in the rear view. Winter has alot to do with that but it's noteworthy that ISW mentions western indecision and reluctance to provide ""material"" as a factor why advances have slowed since late last year. I'd like to see NATO be less reactionary and more proactive with arms shipments. The tanks are great, but they needed them weeks ago to train and prepare for their own offensive by spring. 

I'm happy they are getting good volume of these weapons too but Ukraine is telling the world what they need to win, if the world chooses not to give them what they need, how can they expect them to win once and for all? The risk of escalation is there, but if Ukraine is to win at all, there's going to be escalation regardless.

As time marches on, the tide turns in Russia's favour. They don't give a shit about the number of people they kill.

The sanctions are hurting their economy, but it's mostly affecting the disenfranchised and is more of an inconvenience to the rest (save for some oligarchs who have had international assets seized).  They've made limited and expensive progress, but progress nonetheless, since the liberation of Kherson.

> I want none of anyone's blood

https://www.aerosociety.com/news/ukraine-time-to-fast-track-front-line-fighter-pilot-training/

>Q: **How long is a western fighter pilots' training? And how short/abridged do you think a conversion course for Ukrainian pilots could be?**

>A: **Conversion to a front line combat aircraft for a new pilot would usually take about six months to become limited combat ready. However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks.** If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-

>Q: What would be the best type to send them? MiG-29s from Poland/Slovakia would require minimal training, but give them parity, whereas surplus F-16s/18/F-15s could give them the edge? Could the UK's Tranche 1 Typhoons even be donated to give them overmatch - given they are set to be disposed of in a couple of years anyway? Or even surplus A-10s to take on Russian tanks?



>A: The more familiar the type the easier the conversion. However, Western types are fairly user-friendly (especially the F- series) and relatively simple to grasp the basics. The stick, throttle and handling basics are simple transferable skills. Using the radar, avionics, weapons and defensive aids is the area of focus and teaching the basics of employment of those shouldn't take too long to achieve a level capable of matching or even overmatching the apparent poor Russian proficiency.",False,1675186169.0,t3_10pnsxj,t1_j6nbue7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

That said, if Russia was winning the battleline, they wouldn't be targeting civilians with all those missiles; they would be going after military targets. Since they aren't, clearly they are expending considerable valuable military might on non-military objectives because they don't have any confidence in a military victory.
 
Manpower-wise, Russia is in a no-win bind; either put people to work sustaining the war effort, and sustaining the basic economic needs of their citizens, or gut their industrial workforce and put them to war.
 
Strong indications that they are conscripting huge numbers directly into the armed forces, giving them little to no training, and expending them rather quickly. Again, that says they have no faith in their ability to take the time to train soldiers professionally while not losing immediately, so it doesn't sound like even they have any confidence in a long term war, and are throwing all they can at the current battle lines as quickly as they can.

Conversely, the Ukrainians had more volunteers and draftees than they could handle, and even though they are fighting for their existence as a country (not to mention their lives), they have taken the time to train the soldiers for 3 months or more before putting them into the field. There is no question about turning the economy into a wartime mode, because if they lose, they lose everything anyhow.
 
The sheer acts of desperation on one side, ironically the side of the aggressor, while the studied and rational approach of the defenders tells me that both the Ukrainians and the Russians assess that the Ukrainians have the advantage. If this is a correct assessment, then a logical projection is that Russia must do whatever they can do quickly, as the longer they go on, the more long-term damage they do to themselves.

Heroism can win battles, but logistics win wars. But Russia has only itself and a dwindling economy with which to build or buy weapons. Yes, they can drain their next 50 years dry while fighting off collapse, but collapse they will, even if they were to somehow take Kyiv (which would not stop the resistance to Moskow rule). Ukraine on the other hand, is in a both enviable and unenviable position of having to depend on the manufacturing base that's mostly outside of their country, and outside of their control. Enviable, because Russian soldiers, sailors, aircraft, and missiles cannot reach all of the factories in all of Europe, UK, and the Americas. Unenviable because they have to ask for support, and cannot by any means buy or produce all the military supplies they need.

Countries act in their best self interest, and the resources that Ukraine has and the ""debt"" they owe to Nato/West means once this settles Lithium/Rare minerals/Oil will come out of Ukraine to western countries in abundance and free them from having to rely on China.

Russia is doing a great job at giving the media items to use to rally global support (bombing children etc) and every time interest seems to wane there is a new media showing the horrors of russia.

There is also ""Sunk Cost fallacy"".  The more advanced systems that go into Ukraine means that the west is more invested in Ukraine succeeding because it would mean  Russia gaining advanced equipment.

Here is the callous ""truth""  as best I see it.  NATO is slow rolling out Russia's destruction because  what would have happened if Nato stomped Russia's face on day 3 of this conflict?

The Gripen is a much better option - it was designed exactly for that scenario. However, there are not many of those available.

You use whatever you can to get the job done. A RPG or IED doesn't help much when line of sight might be blocked by something.

>That was always my understanding of the term, but i'm no expert.

Ukraine is not sinking cargo ships carrying Russian grain in the Black Sea.  Ukraine is not trying to ignite a firestorm in Belgorod.  Ukraine is not diverting chlorine from water treatment to make chlorine gas bombs.  Ukraine is not harvesting nuclear waste from spent fuel storage to make dirty bombs.  The weird pox and plague that Russians claim Ukraine made has not been used yet. 

I am not suggesting any of these are a ""good idea"".  But I think clearly Ukraine is fighting a classic ""tactical war"".  Ukraine is trying to capture a specific territory.  Ukraine is conducting the war using only conventional weapons.  An attempt to destroy Russia would make it ""strategic warfare"".

I'm reading Mistborn right now which is a fantasy series and the books follow 3 police officers.  Over the course of the story they start to feel like they can do more good by trying to change the conditions in the world they live in rather than stopping individual people, at no point do they say they shouldn't stop those people, just that they feel they could prevent as many of those people existing by making the world better.
