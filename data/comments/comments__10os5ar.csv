>KYIV, Ukraine — The 25 Russians convicted so far of war crimes in Ukrainian courts include a soldier who forced two Ukrainians at gunpoint to hand over laptops and money, four who beat and tortured Ukrainian soldiers, and two who admitted shelling residential buildings in the first weeks of the war.  
>  
>Over 66,000 additional alleged war crimes have been reported to Ukrainian authorities since the Russian invasion began in February, according to Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General. The number is growing by hundreds every day as investigators fan out into areas retaken from the Russians and Ukrainians step up to lodge complaints, ranging from the theft of property to torture, murder, rape, the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and the relentless missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure.  
>  
>It’s a staggering number of cases, one that would overwhelm any judicial system anywhere, legal experts say. But Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, has vowed to investigate all of them and to bring to trial all those in which enough evidence can be gathered. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made justice for the victims of war crimes one of his conditions for eventual peace with Russia. The issue is as important for Ukraine as defeating the Russians militarily if Russia is to be deterred forever from attacking Ukraine, Kostin said.  
>  
>“We have to win in both battles — in the fight for our territory and in the fight for justice,” he said in an interview.  
>  
>The battle for justice could prove just as challenging as the fight for land.  
>  
>The war in Ukraine offers an unparalleled opportunity to test the still-evolving international justice system that began to take shape after World War II. The United Nations has found clear evidence that “an array” of war crimes and other violations of human rights and international law have been committed, according to an initial report by the Independent International Commission of Enquiry on Ukraine set up under the auspices of the United Nations earlier this year.  
>  
>Not only is there an overwhelming number of cases, but also abundant evidence, noted a European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. Technology has brought new means of documenting crimes, from the videos posted on social media by Russian and Ukrainian soldiers to satellite footage that reveals patterns of deliberate attacks on civilian targets.  
>  
>The liberation of territory by Ukrainian troops has enabled investigators to obtain firsthand accounts and forensic evidence within days or weeks of the crimes being committed — rather than years, as has been the case with most previous attempts to put war criminals on trial. If Ukraine succeeds in retaking more territory, the number of cases could easily double, Ukrainian officials say.  
>  
>There is extraordinary international interest in the effort to hold the perpetrators to account, surpassed only by the Nazi war crimes trials that followed World War II. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has deployed its biggest team yet to Ukraine. Human rights lawyers and advocacy groups have flooded into the country. The United Nations and European governments have opened investigations. The diplomat said he had counted at least 11 different investigations underway in Ukraine.

So a Russian, a Ukrainian and a Swiss are all riding together in a railroad compartment. The two adversaries are sitting across from each other, the neutral sitting aside one or the other, it doesn't matter which. They are not talking, but occasionally eyeing each other suspiciously. 

At one point the Russian takes out some bread and a tin of expensive caviar. Spreading a spoonful on some bread, he eats it and throws the rest of the tin out of the open window. 

The others are obviously puzzled and taken aback by this. The Swiss breaks the ice: ""Why did you waste that good caviar?"" he asks. 

""Don't worry! In Russia we have plenty of caviar!"" The Russian replies. 

The trio continue in silence for a moment, until the Swiss appears to get an idea. He reaches into his bag an produces a large bar of chocolate. Opening it, he breaks off a piece and eats it, savoring the bite. Then he throws the rest out the window. 

This too takes the others by surprise. Now the Russian pops up: ""The chocolate looked delicious! Why did you do that?"" 

""Oh, don't worry. In Switzerland, you see, we have plenty of chocolate!""

The other two nod and silence returns. 

Soon the train goes into a long tunnel, throwing the compartment temporarily into darkness. When they emerge out of the other side, there are only two men in the compartment, and the Russian is gone. 

""That's odd"" said the Swiss, ""I wonder where he suddenly got off to?"" 

""Don't worry, in Ukraine we have plenty of Russians!""

>Russian soldiers — pushed into retreat by a counteroffensive late last year — control the east bank of the mighty Dnieper River. Ukrainians control the west.  
>  
>As Ukraine awaits new tanks from the United States and Europe, and fighting rages over strategic towns in the east, a war of attrition is underway in this southern battleground. The river limits territorial advances, permitting — for now at least — only destruction from a distance.  
>  
>On the route traveling east and north from villages on the Gulf of the Dnieper to the battered but never-occupied city of Nikopol, the width of the river ranges from several miles to fewer than 1,000 feet, putting the Russians close enough to strike with mortars and shells or sniper fire. They hit some villages dozens of times a day. Ukrainian forces are firing back.  
>  
>Before the war, the journey would have amounted to about 150 miles — and taken a few hours to drive. But with damaged roads and bridges over the river’s inlets, the journey through former Russian occupied territory has become difficult. Roads are still littered with abandoned Russian checkpoints and military equipment. Russian trenches and firing positions are dug into farmers’ fields. Signs warn of mines. At village entrances, Ukrainian troops warn the chances of being shelled are high.  
>  
>Washington Post journalists spent several days traveling along the Ukrainian-controlled main and back roads that connect these towns and villages to see how civilians are surviving winter, frequently without gas or electricity. Often only the elderly are left, surviving without heat on food handouts. Residents fear they could be killed at any moment, and still whisper of collaborators living among them.  
>  
>Many of the villages here withstood months of Russian occupation, and are in territory President Vladimir Putin claims, illegally, to have annexed. The Kremlin now insists they must be “liberated” — signaling Moscow’s resolve to return, possibly in new offensives this spring.  
>  
>*Oleksandrivka*

>The damaged road into this recently liberated village is a harbinger for what lies beyond. Burned-out cars and carcasses of a cow and dog are scattered on the side of the road. Soldiers shouted frantically to stay on hard ground — the marsh below still hasn’t been demined.  
>  
>Before the war, 2,123 people lived in this peaceful enclave on the Gulf of the Dnieper. But fighting grew so fierce here that by last spring, only 16 residents remained. Russian forces controlling the town evacuated most others to villages deeper inside Russian-occupied territory.  
>  
>Once Ukraine retook the village late last year, civilians started to return and assess the damage. But most found there’s little left. More than two months after liberation, only 150 people now live in the wreckage.  
>  
>“If there was a hell, it was here,” said village leader Natalya Kamenetska, 36. Some residents were executed. Four are still missing. Exhumations are still underway, but the village remains so heavily mined that the process is slow.

Ukraine is so good at defending and Russia is such wet shit at attacking, it's no wonder so many people have sky-high expectations. But Ukraine is still small and scrappy, and they're achieving the results that they do because they use their forces intelligently.

For both Russia and Ukraine, the primary IFV is the BMP-2, with the BMP-1 as the 2nd most common. Russia also fields significant numbers of BMP-3s. The BMP-1 was the first IFV to be mass-produced and fundamentally changed the role of infantry. It was a true game changer. It was also introduced in 1966 and, like most first of their kind products, had some significant problems. 

The BMP-2 was introduced in 1980 to address some of the issues of the BMP-1 and produce a more modern design. However, it's still very, very similar to the BMP-1. The armament is significantly better, the armor is slightly better, but much else remained similar. 

There have been modernization efforts in both countries. For example, the BMP-2M introduced in 2008 gives night optics to both gunner and commander. However, Russia was estimated to have less than 100 of these before the war. How many remain in service is unclear. How many Ukraine had or has is also unknown.

The Bradley was introduced in 1981 as a counter to the BMPs. It has better, but comparable, weapons and armor. The version going to Ukraine is the M2A2-ODS. A mid-90s upgrade to the Bradley drawing on lessons learned from fighting BMPs and T-72s during the 1991 gulf war. It features range-finders, thermal optics, gps navigation systems, command information systems and more. 

In short, Russia and Ukraine primarily use IFVs that are under-armored by modern standards, no night capabilities, and limited communications and navigation equipment. Day-time assaults with clear and limited objectives they can do. Coordinating with artillery during fluid night-time operations in urban areas they cannot. The Bradley can. 

The Bradley will enable Ukrainian infantry to operate at night, spot Russian troops before they themselves are seen, and either engage first or call in support. This is especially relevant in the small-scale positional fighting we are seeing. Where fights are street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood. Where weeks are spent to capture single villages. In fights like this, knowing where you are, being able to communicate clearly, and getting the first shot off really matter. It doesn't matter how big your gun is, if you are in the wrong spot and don't know what you're shooting at. 

A hundred of them will be useful to Ukraine, but numbers really matter. A few elite units is nice, but having your IFVs consistently shoot first across the entire front shifts the whole war.",1675119026.0,1675114120.0,t3_10os5ar,t1_j6jg6u4,,1,30,0,30,2,0,

None. UA already has mechanized infantry. Even then, a Toyota truck with a 50-cal machine gun + Dude with a Javelin in the back on the back does almost the same thing as a Bradley.

> Are they that much better than what the UA and ruZZkies already have or is it the number of them?

Capability wise, its basically a bigger gun than a 50-cal. Better optics than night-vision goggles / thermal vision sensors. Thicker armor, and multi-shot rocket launcher (instead of a single-shot Javelin), bigger 25mm autocannon instead of 14.7mm machinegun.

But ""capability"" wise, its very similar to a Toyota Truck + Machine Gun + Javelin. You can hold a number of people in your bed, you can have a machine gun mounted there to move-and-attack, and you can have one guy with a Javelin firing it when you're scared of enemy tanks.

M2 Bradley just does the job better. M2 Bradley killed more T72 tanks during Desert Storm (1991 Iraq war) than M1 Abrams, because M2 Bradley's optics are so good and the Rockets are ""good enough"".

-----------

This ""job"", of infantry moving _and_ shooting, even over muddy terrain, with big weapons (cars can carry bigger weapons too heavy for humans to carry), with more ammo (cars can carry more ammo. 900 shots of 25mm Autocannon, 2x rockets + 8x rockets in storage IIRC, etc. etc.), and other such features allows an M2 to do ""this job better"".

The main thing a M2 Bradley can do that a Technical (aka: Toyota Truck + Machinegun ) cannot do, is amphibious assaults. M2 Bradley can swim across rivers if in the proper configuration. Its slow and vulnerable while doing so, but it means that any M2 Bradley can make unopposed river crossings (while a Toyota Truck would get stuck).",1675109331.0,1675109034.0,t3_10os5ar,t1_j6jg6u4,,1,-15,0,-15,0,0,

For now, however, unless Russia does something even more stupid like chemical weapons, or something else, we should refrain from sending troops. 

If they crossed that step, I would expect the gloves to come off. 

But keep in mind that for troops to move in, we would have to essentially destroy targets in Russia to obtain air superiority, which is a requirement to be able to send them back to their homeland with limited casualties on our side. 

And aside from the risk of escalation, it would have a significant economic impact, which we are probably unwilling to take in a globalised world at this stage.

So, send them what they need, not what they ask for or deserve (in my opinion, they deserve everything we have!), but what they need to succeed. I'm pretty sure western intelligence has a good grasp on the capabilities and limitations of the Russian military at this stage and has several scenarios for success.

Additionally, this will sound awful. But from all the help being sent and its sequential nature, it feels like they don't want them to win too quickly, either. They want them to achieve incremental gains, to make it long-term painful for Russia to hopefully force some regime calibration in Russia, again lowering the risk of escalation.

there is a current group called Vysegrad 4, based on the idea that 4 countries can achieve more when they coordinate their moves. but since PL and HU are currently governed by populist/nationalist/corruption cliques, they abuse this platform so much that every presidential meeeting cast a shadow on CZ and SK.

I am afraid that any new coalition will look similar. countries trying to abuse their voting rights and blocking common EU initiatives. SK and CZ does not have any agenda where they want to block DE and FR from something, the only thing is of course get as many subsidies as possible but that's another story.

In fact, I am nearly convinced they consider it a badge of honour they'd be proud of the prospect of taking Ukraine ""with one hand tied behind their back"", as in, brute-forcing their way across all land throwing bodies of their own for the proverbial red carpet for their leadership to walk into Ukraine on. But what Russia doesn't seem to realize is that Ukrainians are just as fierce about not letting it happen (whatever Russians may genuinely pride themselves on, Ukrainians have got in spades too; they're two branches of the same tree, not taking into account the fact that one branch has been rotting), that they by necessity but also for all kinds of good reasons wage _smart_ warfare  and last but not the least are backed by U.S. and European military complex. Regardless of how much flak we give Europe and Germany in particular, my money is on Raytheon, Lockheed, and two dozen other Western manufacturers with Rheinmetall being notable mention -- rather than relatively dysfunctional Uralvagonzavod and a network of weapon smugglers and backhand dealers.

If Russia overextends themselves thinking they're the Soviet Union, they're running the risk if having their punch arm broken and getting also punched in the ribs. No powers that be will consider handing Ukraine to Russia at this point -- investments have been made and heels dug in -- unless Russia wants to go down the rabbit hole of pain and the kind of calamity the world hasn't wanted since before 1945, they should throw in the towel. There's no way Russia wins, their only chance -- and by no means guarantee of victory either -- is if U.S. pulls out for some reason. Which won't happen because it seems there's little that else U.S. wants to throw their toys at rather than a conflict where they supply the machines and Ukraine supplies the will to fight literally personified.

In a way, Russia had already overextended itself when their ""special military operation"" failed and they had to pretend they were in it to win it anyway. Now they made themselves commit to it, but I am not sure they can cash the check their fantasy wrote.

""Yugoslavia's refusal to sign the Rambouillet Accords was initially offered as justification for NATO's use of force. NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the UN Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia, who indicated that they would veto such a measure. As a result, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the expressed endorsement of the UN Security Council and thus, international legal approval, which triggered debates over the legitimacy of the intervention.""",False,1675081318.0,t3_10os5ar,t1_j6hlr43,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Greetings u/musart-SZG.  I am not replying to your post.  26 days ago I had a lively discussion with u/batmansthebomb about the word ""massacre"".  The debate is entirely a linguistic one.  My argument was that the word does *not* carry a negative connotation when used in certain contexts.  

In this case the sentence subject was ""invaders"" and they got ""*absolutely massacred*"".  I read that as musart-SZG favors this outcome.  The sentence implies ""absolutely"" being better than ""partially"".  I believe musart-SZG thinks it being a massacre is better than just butchering one Russian invader.  

More recap: u/batmansthebomb did not like the implication of ""defenseless"" in the definition for ""massacre"".  That is a component in the post.  Something says something like ""Russians currently have no effective defense against cheap drones and cheap bombs"".  It in no way implies musart-SZG thinks the Russian soldiers are innocent.  On the contrary we should believe that muzart-SZG believes that cheap drones are the correct tool for a job he(she?) believes should be done.  Other tools are incorrect because they are either too expensive or they do not work due to Russian countermeasures.",False,1675106282.0,t3_10os5ar,t1_j6izq28,,3,-5,0,-5,0,0,

[Technicals are one of the most capable weapons on the battlefield]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_(vehicle\) ). Don't hate on it. Its a legitimate tactic and surprisingly effective.

The Ukrainians _are_ brave enough to ride into battle with Technicals. This is how they've done their offenses so far. Giving them M2 Bradleys is going to be an upgrade for sure, but lets not pretend that the Ukrainian's don't know how to do an offensive.

We're going to make the Ukrainians better at it by giving them a better weapon and/or tool. We're upgrading them from pickup trucks to M2 Bradleys. But in terms of overall combat capabilities, they're kinda similar in many ways.

Because of how effective fucking Toyota Truck + Machinegun + Rocket-launcher dude sitting in the bed is... I expect Ukrainians to continue to do this tactic even after we've given them M2 Bradleys.

-------------

Remember: Dude riding Toyota Pickup truck + Javelin == dead T-72 tank. Its true before we gave them M2, and it will remain true after we've given them M2 Bradley.

What M2 Bradley changes is the quantity (more weapons == more soldiers doing this tactic), and quality (bigger gun == better) of this tactic. But the fundamental operation on the battlefield remains similar... strangely enough.",1675109989.0,1675109519.0,t3_10os5ar,t1_j6jl2zy,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

A pickup truck + machinegun + javelin has three modes.

1. Movement -- Truck moves faster than legs.

2. Machinegun -- Kills a lot of things.

3. Javelin / Rocket -- Kills the things the Machinegun fails to kill.

-------

If the enemy vehicle is bigger than you, you're supposed to run away. But if you're ""trapped"", you use the rockets and hope for the best. (Javelin is just one shot: if you miss you're dead. M2 Bradley has two shots, so its a bit better, but its clearly not going to be useful in a long term engagement)

Otherwise, you have a moving + shooting platform, using your main gun (machine gun) to do most of your jobs.

These jobs are all accomplished better with an M2 Bradley. But it helps give the other people here an idea of what the M2 is doing on the battlefield exactly.

M2 Bradley loses to a number of vehicles on the battlefield. But it ""can"" stand and fight even an enemy tank (though at a disadvantage), if forced. Otherwise, the 25mm autocannon is incredibly good at killing lots of smaller vehicles.

The U.S. was in favor of the swap, but the difficulties of having the planes fly to Germany to be handed over there was a bit unpalatable in those early days. I can't recall reading them ever having revisited that. But ya, it wasn't a knock on Poland's contributions, just a reflection on their comments that seem to consistently be to put Germany, and the EU, under the gun (and I'm not the biggest fan of German dithering during this conflict, though i do get it culturally from my time there, especially as it weighs on the heavy war guilt the society still feels at-large). And Poland has had grievances with the EU trying to clawback or withhold funds/transfers to Poland for years a as result of very similar, Hungarian-even moves Poland has undertaken over the last decade under the current ruling party, which also has an authoritarian bent. 

So, it is great and I am a supporter for what Poland is doing for Ukraine, but I know there's much more to it than that for Poland. If anything, Poland should've just said they'd give F-16s if the US supports it, as we'd have to give the ok to re-export them, not NATO. Using NATO as the excuse is just allowing them to put out a soundbite that superficially looks great for them without there actually being real substance behind it, as well as further putting the pressure on nations like Germany, Hungary and perhaps even Turkey. It's easy to make that comment knowing there is nothing of substance behind it, in other words.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,10os5ar,j6jufd1,"Having read your other replies in here, I'll choose this one to reply to. Speaking from in Russia, I want to say that you have some good points, but I want to give my perspective on what you say. 

Firstly, you should understand that the vast majority of people in this country don't have this level of knowledge that you do, and thus they don't have the awareness to feel this fear. From our knowledgeable perspective of course it seems ludicrous to keep your head down knowing it may not save you in the end, but they don't know that. Life in the big cities is a bubble of happy ignorance, and the Kremlin absolutely tries everything to keep it that way. Ignorance isn't an excuse of course and just like a person who ignores warning labels because they are ""depressing"", any consequences of this Russian apathy will only rest on their shoulders. But it's important to keep this in mind because I constantly see users here acting like Russians all frequent this live thread and act as if they know as much as we do. 

Secondly, there is a dilemma. Actively liberal pro-Ukrainian Russians are maybe 5-10% of the population at best, around 20% are ethnofascist, and the rest are in this drunken sleep deaf and blind to all. Of course these numbers are just best estimates of ""expert opinion"" but without anyway to get scientific results, in my experience this is probably close to the truth. Given the sheer size of the Russian police state (1.5 million approx, 400,000 of which are brutal armored national guard - Rosgvardiya and OMON), we're talking about needing not just hundreds of thousands, but likely millions all rising up to be able to change something. This number could be lower if it were possible to organize action, but it's not. Anyone who organisms or leads disappears immediately. So spontaneous action is the only alternative, and that requires people acting alone or in small groups and just ""hoping"" that their deaths or torture will embolden others. 

Other factors make that difficult. Right now there is no opposition government or leaders to rally behind, no clear hope of victory, and absolutely no idea what to do even if victory was possible. Now that alone isn't a big problem and it is a bridge that can be crossed after the fact, but it makes it harder to act alone and risk your life and your family when not only 80-90% of the country don't care or will cheer at your death, but on top of that there is no goal or plan or endgame to fight for. 

So at this point, as a liberal resident of Russia, I have a choice: go and protest now and almost certainly get sent to the front to die, leaving my kid fatherless (probably taken away from my wife and adopted out to fascists while she herself gets imprisoned). 80% don't even know what I did, or if any do, they don't want to know, because it's too scary for them. 30% cheer for my death as an evil nazi Satanist. 

The alternative to this isn't just ""evil thrives when good men do nothing"". That 80% of the apathetic population needs to change. Something needs to shock them awake and realise they have no choice but to take a side. Something needs to hit them hard and the government clearly to blame. And right now the Kremlin is doing everything it can to shelter the big cities where tens of millions of Russians live. Because if Petersburg and Moscow alone have even 50% of their population turn against the government, suddenly that's around 7 to 8 million angry people, and suddenly it starts looking like the situation where spontaneous unrest can occur. But until that moment, there is no point in throwing my life away. It will not save Ukrainians, it will not topple Putin. While the Russian cities carry on like nothing bad is happening, there is no chance. Mobilization basically still doesn't even happen here. No one even talks about it. No one knows anyone who got forcibly taken away except who protested.

For that reason, as someone living in Petersburg, I hope this city goes to hell as fast as possible. I look forward to the days these apathetic zombies finally realise they can't drink away their misery, start losing their jobs, and start actually having their kids and friends and family conscripted. I can't wait to see the expression of realization that we were right all along. On that day, when it's clear that there is a shift in this apathy, I will be a lot more willing to throw hands on the street. Sadly it probably won't be in the very near future, but the government cannot bankroll bliss in the big cities forever. Revenue is drying up, the budget deficit is growing, and there's only so much money to throw at problems. It will start in the smaller cities - suddenly money won't be available to prop things up and it starts collapsing - cities like Perm, Krasnoyarsk, etc. Eventually they won't be able to afford to sustain the bigger cities either - Novosibirsk, Vladivostok, etc. The problems will really start for them though when Petersburg is losing money. Peyersburgers already have some minor resentment towards Moscow (like many Russian regions) for being underfunded while Moscow gets all the nice stuff. Petersburg is also probably the most liberal part of Russia (excluding Moscow, but maybe even more liberal still). Hopefully the walls will start collapsing this year.

Sorry for the long post. I understand if you still don't accept my view, or resent me as a coward or something like that. It's fair. But anyway, just wanted to share my world as I see it. Also I'm going to sleep now so the thread will roll over by the time I wake up - if you want to have a discussion you can send a DM or something. No stress either way.

Look, Russia is committing brazen atrocity. Certainly more so than the US by just about any measure. That doesn't mean the US is always the good guy. It's easy to sit within the walls of freedom and security and tell others what they should or shouldn't do.

It's like if you were forced to fight in a bloody war for your country, and then had to hear me tell you that you've got it all wrong and you should be ashamed despite the fact I've never fought a war in my life. I'm all for holding those accountable accountable, but I'm not for a witch hunt because a person is Russian and didn't have the balls to face 15 years in prison and the disappearance of their family by facing down Putin at the height of his rule.

Putin will fall. The Russian people will be the ones to bring him down in my estimation. Brave are the ones willing to risk it all to take him down. I see them everyday, Russians protesting the war, using soft protest and masked vigilante molotov. They are the most admirable sort.
