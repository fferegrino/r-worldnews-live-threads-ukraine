Today, the Russian army struck again in Kherson Oblast, hit Berislav - the local administration, houses, the museum... Even the historical museum in Berislav is a threat to Russia for some reason... A completely mindless state, purely a terrorist state, which we we will neutralize

In the free territory of the Kherson region, more than 50 villages were almost completely destroyed by the occupier. In some places, more than 90% of the buildings in the villages are broken. But even in such villages, people return, and this is proof that life still wins.

Today I was in one of the largest such villages - Posad-Pokrovsky. Once one of the largest, before the invasion of Russia. And we will do everything to make this village one of the largest again, we will do everything to rebuild our territories.

I am grateful to everyone who helps to restore the normality of life after the Russian evil. To everyone who, even in such difficult areas, continues to work and give work, to everyone who helps our soldiers.

I especially want to thank everyone involved in demining. It is nice to see when the fields of Kherson Oblast, cleared of Russian mines and shells, are cultivated again, live again.

Of course, there are still few such lands and there is still enough work for our sappers and pyrotechnicians... But I am sure that we will cleanse our land of all the deadly manifestations of Russia. All of Ukraine will live.""

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 23 March 2023.  


* Since the start of March 2023, heavy fighting has continued in parts of the Svatove-Kremina sector of the front line in northern Luhansk Oblast.  

* Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year.  

* In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres. Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River.  

* They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.  

* Operationally, Russia’s intent in the north-east likely remains defensive. Commanders probably fear this is one of the sectors where Ukraine could attempt major offensive operations.

Day 392-393 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were mostly quiet here in Kharkiv, but there were a couple of times where we thought that missiles from Belgorod might be headed our way. We don’t actually know where any of them landed, probably somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, or they also could have been used as AA missiles this time, so for their intended purpose.

We now also know what was hit by the last 3 Shaheds that weren’t intercepted in the drone attack 2 days ago. They hit a vocational school and its dormitory somewhere near Kyiv. The fucking bastards killed 9 people in that strike. Is that their definition of a military target, a school and a dorm? Well, I guess it’s to be expected after they just hit a school for the deaf children near me a couple of days ago.

Yesterday they also hit an apartment building in the middle of Zaporizhzhia with a missile. It was a direct hit, but miraculously it didn’t destroy the entire building, so there were relatively few casualties, 1 person died and around 30 more were injured. Of course, the fucking Russians immediately said that it was our own air defense that hit the apartment building.

I just came across this talk from last December... I hope it's OK to share it here.

He framed it as a call to arms for the games industry to contribute towards a ""cultural victory"".

(Incidentally, he's active on Reddit as u/vane303!)

The presentation is \~40 minutes long. I've transcribed some segments below:

>\[2:45\] In my opinion, we are at war. As a German, I *feel* at war. I think there's so many conflicts going on \[...\] all over the world, and obviously the war in Ukraine, which is in Europe, it's a horrible crime, and it really affects us. ""Why is that relevant to us?"" you may ask. We make games, we're business guys, whatever, we have our own lives. Why do we really care?

Most sci-fi is dystopian, can you really do dystopia in China? And why did they change? Because they wanna go to the moon. They're a high-tech country.

>Ukrainian Air Force denies Le Figaro’s report that France trains Ukrainian pilots on Mirage fighter jets (updated)

>Le Figaro reported that France is currently training a group of around thirty Ukrainian pilots on Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, Le Figaro writes. According to the report, the pilots are receiving an accelerated training program on French fighter-bombers at the Mont-de-Marsan and Nancy air bases, which has been ongoing for more than a month and a half. If the political decision is made, France could also deliver around ten fighter jets to the Ukrainian army, Le Figaro added.

>Information about the training of Ukrainian pilots in France on Mirage 2000 fighters is not true, according to Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He stated this in a comment to the Ukrainian office of Radio Liberty on March 22:

>“Currently, the information is spreading that allegedly Ukrainian pilots have been trained in France for a month and a half on Mirage planes. I would like to refute this right away, so that there are no distortions,” Ihnat said, adding that “Yes, various countries offer us their sites for the possible, potential, future training of our pilots for the type that will be chosen collegially during consultations with our Western partners.”

>At the same time, the spokesman does not deny that the Ukrainian military did undergo training in France, however, according to him, those were not pilots:

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after drawing criticism last week from   
fellow Republicans for dismissing the conflict as a “territorial   
dispute."" In an interview with “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” which is due to air   
Thursday on Fox Nation, the potential presidential contender clarified   
that he fully opposed Putin’s invasion, aligning himself more closely   
with other Republicans — and distancing himself from previous comments   
that he said had been “mischaracterized.”

“Obviously, Russia invaded \[last year\] — that was wrong,” DeSantis said,  
 according to a preview of the interview in a column published Wednesday  
 in the New York Post. “Russia did not have the right to go into Crimea or to go in February of 2022 and that should be clear.”<<

Interesting:

>Robotic system 97 is a medium-range anti-aircraft robotic system that can be used in all weathers, day or night. The system is used to protect communities and socially important objects from enemy air and robot attacks.

>The robots have a range of 40 kilometers and are equipped with a powerful warhead of 75 kilos that can be triggered in the event of a direct hit or at a certain distance from the target. The system also includes an intelligence unit, i.e. a radar station that can detect targets at an altitude of up to 18 kilometers, as well as compile the air situation using information from the PS-90 reconnaissance radar and assign targets to the system's fire unit.

Mishustin, a technocrat, naturally becomes acting president if Putin dies. However, as all technocrats in Russia, they intentionally have little to no political character or ambition - they only work and do their best to realise the goals of the government and Putin. So while Mishustin has zero capacity to centralize power around himself, it will be in the interests of the other power factions to let him continue to be the face of the government while said power factions vie for influence and future power. 

And ultimately, there are only two factions who are really capable of enforcing their influence: the military and the FSB, and the military is already gutted, and likely without strong or influential enough leadership to pull off a military coup. 

The FSB and it's two giants Bortnikov (current director) and Nikolai Patrushev (current Security Council chief and former director) will be the most powerful  and influential men in Russia after Putin dies, and I suspect any infighting within the FSB will end with them on top. Nikolai Patrushev's son Dmitri has already been speculated as a possible successor to Putin. After the aftermath of Putin's death, Mishustin will oversee the basic runnings of government while the FSB starts using the media machine to prime the population for whoever their successor is, whether that's Patrushev or his son, or whoever else they end up choosing. 

There will be the illusion of democratic change, but without any opposition figures, it's unlikely the Russian public will have any option but to choose whoever the FSB puts forward. In addition to the usual vote-rigging, they'll make sure the only ""opposition"" candidates are scandalous, boring, or otherwise undesirable. Then we are back to 2000 again. 

If the west wants to avoid another Putin rising in Russia, the FSB needs to be dismantled. Speaking as someone inside Russia, I think real democratic reform must be stipulated as a part of sanction relief. Many people here will moan or say it's unfair, probably many people in the west too, even some who hate Putin and support Ukrainian sovereignty. But it seems patently obvious to me that as long as the FSB exists as it does, there will be no fundamental change in Russia, let alone improvement.

These are your subject matter experts. Their analysis is always worth your time. They tend to post infrequently though.

OSINT guys who give frequent updates. They're all worth keeping up with, especially alongside other sources. Defmon3 is the most credible. Tendar's updates are less structured but highlight interesting events. Warmonitor3 attempts to give the most up-to-date info. He's not always right, but he'll specify when he's reporting rumors versus facts. He was my go-to source for updates during the Kharkiv offensive. Tatarigami is a Ukrainian Army reserve officer who posts really good threads about the tactics of the war.

* ISW:
 
There's no better single source for following the war. All of their claims are backed up with sources, and they track everything from tactical developments, to Russian internal politics, to each side's information space. Their analysis is done by a team of experts.

He refused to stand for the Russia national anthem at school or would stand and sing the Ukranian anthem instead. He also mostly refused to speak Russian even though he knew it.

He was of course beaten for this but continued to resist. I can't imagine the kind of mental strength it would take to be surrounded by people you knew would hurt you if you didn't obey and just keep resisting anyway, it's pretty incredible.

I wonder if these children also resisted and were returned because they refused to comply, since they were beaten as well it seems quite possible. I can imagine Russian authorities not liking kids running around Russia that clearly don't want to be there and resist however they can. Hard to push your propaganda that you're saving Ukranian's from the Nazi's if you know a Ukranian kid at school who clearly loves Ukraine and keeps shiting on Russia. Plus it probably makes it hard to find any families who will take them.

Edit: Seeing a translated video interview with one of the teenagers from this transfer he says that they were beaten for saying glory to Ukraine and that Russians tried to deny that Kherson was liberated which many of the Ukranian kids rejected as they knew it wasn't true. They were threatened with being sent to boarding school but eventually returned to Ukraine. It seems clear that the kids that makes themselves a real problem and reject Russian bullshit have the best chance of being sent back to Ukraine.

Gunners?  Sooner.

Ammunition (casing, warhead, fuse, charge).   Already happening

The issue isn't the gun.  The issue is keeping it fed so that it is effective in how it is used. 

Artillery is like horseshoes:  you only need to get close.  

When the US plays horseshoes, it brings three perfectly balanced and specially crafted tungsten horseshoes of a proprietary aerodynamic shape where any inside edge touching the pin results in a ringer.  The players train for a year and can toss a ringer while they're still walking to the pitch.

When Russia plays horseshoes, it brings shoes of all sorts, mostly dug up in barnyards from plough horses, ponies and crowd control horses, and pry the shoes off every horse they find along the way  They bring hundreds of shoes, some with the hooves still attached,  and completely ignore the judges.  Their team is made of players who were nearest and slowest to th coach when he grabbed out, are soused on vodka, and toss blindfolded.  It's dangerous to be within 200 feet of wherever they are pitching.  But because they throw thousands of horseshoes every try and completely ignore the rules, they usually get between two and four ringers, and regardless, declare victory simply by accumulated close hits. 

... but I digress...  the issue with Russian artillery is that they rely on saturation fire - lots of guns, lots of shells raining down.   Which means you have half a dozen pieces dropping things randomly in a particular grid square each one firing a couple times a minute...

... a couple times a minute... times an hour... hundreds of shells... per piece.  Multiply that by the dozen pieces within a km of the grid square you are trying to drive through, and Russia can lay down an hour of pure hell.

An hour of hell, and then, if they don't have thousands of shells on hand, hours of silence, while the truck bringing the replacement ammunition arrives.

If Ukraine can withstand the hour of hell, or in five minutes of precision counter-battery fire eliminate the dozen pieces covering th grid square through which they want to advance, they can overrun Russian positions in the silence that follows.  

Now... take that scenario and consider how many guns Russia needs to deploy so that there are a dozen within 3 km of every km Ukraine needs to advance through.   And you can see Russia's problem. 

They need to have hundreds of shells on hand at each of those guns, because HIMIARS has taken their depots and moved them back, far away.  If you do the math, Russia simply does not have enough artillery ammunition to cover everywhere they need to be.   They need to guess.

If you die, or are otherwise deposed before the public becomes aware of your presumptive successor, then you more than likely throw the country into chaos.  The initial technocrat who becomes steward of the state will undoubtedly attempt to use the same mechanisms of control to retain power, usually in an increasingly clumsy and desperate way.  Such stewards tend to do two things extremely well - die quickly, and destroy whatever cohesive and predictable chain of command might have existed underneath them at the time of the autocrat's death.  The various crime factions circling the throne will not wait for performative democracy.  This is the job of the presumptive successor - to keep the families in line while the steward is creating chaos.  That way, when they are ready, the successor can intervene and ascend to control under the guise of ""emergency powers.""  
  
But this only works if there is a clear ""shit your pants"" line of succession.  As in, when the new boss walks into the room, people shit their pants in fear.

But  he’s been pushing the mobilisation narrative for long, and then it was actually done. He criticised first wave of people in command, and then they were replaced over and over, and in the end Russians managed to stabilise the front after they were forced to retreat from Kharkiv and later from Kherson.

Now looking at the last couple of weeks they’ve been actually doing it.

A large number of Trump voters, I think, were turned off by his outright treason but the official Democratic response to his insurrection on January 6th, 2021, was to shrug their shoulders and go on with business as usual.

788263b586c9c20dd1568e643749d730,11z84m6,jdf0bjz,"Well, not really.

First, western weapons have proven remarkably efficient at shutting down Ruzzian missiles, the problem is Ukraine doesn't have enough of them.

They need dozens more to have an effective blanket over their airspace. That's the problem, what they have works great, but they don't have enough of it.

And some missiles can't be stopped by the air-defense tech provided, they would need something like the Patriots, which are not yet in Ukraine.

So, I think this is you drinking a tall glass of Ruzzian and Chinese propaganda, or you not understanding the sources you're reading.

Second, Ruzzia hasn't found replacements for what they were selling to the west, regarding oil and gas, which is their economy basically.

India and China find the current prices of Ruzzian energy to be favorable, and that is only happening because the west said ""you can't sell your oil and gas for more than what we say you can.""

That's it. So of course India and China are buying cheap oil and gas from Ruzzia. They'd be stupid not to, but they haven't replaced the west.

Not only are they not buying the same volumes that Europe was buying, they are buying at a remarkably lower price than what Europe used to buy it for. more so, they will never be able to buy the same volume.

Speaking of volume, they have serious issues supplying even the volumes they are currently providing.

To Europe it was easy, pipelines everywhere. pipelines built and designed and mostly maintained by the west with western tech.

The long talked about pipeline from Siberia to China was just recently deemed to be too expensive to build. China is not willing to pay for it, so Ruzzia would have to do it. It's not profitable.

The already existing pipeline was also fully built and financed by Ruzzia, China doesn't pay for stuff like that.

Third, you think that not banning Tik-Tok is some sort of proof of Chinese superiority?

Tik-Tok is already banned on governmental devices in both the US and Europe, Canada, and more to follow.

And if this step was taken, the blanket ban of Tik-Tok will follow, this is not some impossible thing. India already did it, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc, will be more than happy to fill in the gap left by the ban of Tik-Tok. In fact, they are heavily lobbying for this to happen.

Fourth, you don't understand US politics. You may live in the US, but you are clueless.

Trump is done, nobody wants him as president, not even Republicans. He has other problems to deal with, turns out paying hush money to prostitutes and then committing fraud to hide it is not a smart move.

DeSantis is a political whore. He will say one thing, look at the polls, then change his mind and go with what his electorate wants to hear.

Yeah, he blabbered about Ukraine, and then, like the whore he is, just yesterday changed his mind and said Putin is a war criminal.

Again, you are out of date with the info you're operating with.

Plus, republicans overwhelmingly support Ukraine, most polls show this. The loud mouth Republicans fringe elements you listen to are not representative of the majority.

Trump also had the presidency n the bag in 2020, yet somehow, somehow, Biden is president. I don't know why you guys speak as if it is a fact the next president will be republican.

Probably the biggest factor influencing this outcome is when it happens. If it happened today, there would be more incentive to continue the war in Ukraine, given that as far as we know, the majority of the population supports it. On a higher geopolitical level, China's newfound influence in the Kremlin clearly has a prolonged conflict in their interest, so they might possibly pressure Putin's successor to continue. China certainly doesn't want to risk a successor that is potentially friendly or at least amiable to the west. They've already staked a lot on backing Russia so far. 

However, if Ukraine is able to liberate significant portions of territory this year, especially Crimea, there is inevitably going to be a huge drop in public Russian support for the war. Even if Ukraine has Crimea under siege, and the bridge taken out for example, the Kremlin will not be able to hide images of Russians desperately fleeing the peninsula on whatever they can - packed ferries, swimming across the Kerch strait, etc. After the annexation of Crimea, Putin's popularity rating went from 61% to 86% (+25%) practically overnight, so watching Russians flee the peninsula chaotically and the thought of Ukraine overpowering Russia to take it back will undoubtedly shatter public support for the war. 

In that case, a successor may be strongly incentivised to use Putin's death (whether accidental or arranged) as a change to blame him for the war, purge his loyalists as traitors who enabled Putin's destruction of Russia, and try to negotiate as favourable a peace term with Ukraine as possible. In that case I could imagine Russia agreeing to respect and possibly even constitutionalise Ukraine's sovereign territory (in any case, it will be clear that Russia will never be able to touch Ukraine after the war), and agree to let the frozen sovereign wealth fund be used for reparations. Even things like tracking down and returning kids are easy peace policies for Russia to make. 

So what I think the West and Ukraine needs to do is not settle for who *Russia* decides is guilty of the war, but look deeply at the power structure and make sure they get the other dangerous ones who sit in the shadows. Patrushev or his successor will happily throw Shoigu, Lavrov, Peskov, Medvedev, Solovyov, Simonyan, Prigozhin, and all the other well-known ""Putinites"" under the bus as the ""architects of the war"". But Patrushev is ideologically the same or even worse than Putin, and if given the chance, he will make sure nothing fundamentally changes.",False,1679572843.0,t3_11z84m6,t1_jdcbqus,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

Putin is locked into the conflict as his own life is forfeit if he was to back out now. Any potential replacement has the choice of either shackling themselves to the same sinking ship or taking that brief chance to change course. 

The message will be ""the Special Operation was right and Justified but has handled incompetently by the former regime and therefore, for the good of Russia (and the world), we will make (trivial) concessions to seek peace."" This will allow them to undermine Putin loyalists and get rid of any other problem characters that they can tar with the 'incompetence/betrayal' brush.

But they will, in the first instance,only be offering minor territorial concessions which are unlikely to be acceptable to Ukraine (and the West) and therefore it is unlikely to actually stop the war immediately - they will only undermine the Russian war effort with concessions and I think likely see second and subsequent waves of succession and infighting until finally realism has taken root.",False,1679574373.0,t3_11z84m6,t1_jdcbqus,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

In my opinion, Malcom's take (Like him or hate him he's another lighting rod of opinions) had the most nuanced take that aligned with what I had seen following James' posts on Twitter.

He started out as a fundraiser & guy who would do the last mile delivery to TDF and volunteer troops in Ukraine during the fist couple of months, then returned to the US for a month or so and then headed back to Ukraine.  It was at this time that flags started to raise on my end, like him getting a divorce and selling off everything he owned here, but I figured he would be going back to formally join the International Legion.  Then in the second half of the year he got tied up in the first flare-up over Ripley's Heros charity issues, followed by his best friend getting killed (this is the point where I think things took a change for the worse with him).  With what I saw over the last 3 months, he started to portray himself as fighting on the frontlines, and as a member of the UAF, which is where things started to fall apart for him.

Overall, I don't think James is a bad person, just someone where the fighting in Ukraine, combined with the sudden Twitter fame got to him and not in a good way. As Malcom said, he needs to get help and get back in the proper mental state, and if he still wants to help Ukraine, do it the proper way.",False,1679593132.0,t3_11z84m6,t1_jddmzh5,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

But, one of the big reasons modern warfare devolves into trench war if you can't pull off mobile warfare is because untrained and inexperienced troops can be effective, especially on the defense.

Who is “we?” In Kherson the Ukrainians were able to severely weaken the supply lines but the routes in and out were still passable just not in the way needed to sustain a defense of the city. The fighting around Kherson was incredibly extensive and Ukraine was having to attack fortified Russian positions, manned by the best that Russia had over open ground without a 3:1 attacking manpower advantage. As Ukraine gained ground they brought more of their artillery and HIMARS within range of the supply lines and Russia couldn’t maintain the supply lines necessary for their troops to hold their defensive positions. Once the defense became untenable Russia withdrew. 

The Russians were never fully encircled nor did the Ukrainian high command ever say that they had fully encircled Russian forces. There were some internet rumors and speculation based on unverified claims that an encirclement had happened but those were of course false. Ukraine won a hard fought victory in Kherson due to superior weapons and tactics although Ukraine did suffer significant losses in that victory.

Later, US confirmed the destruction of air craft, but no pictures.  It's a big plane, why no pictures?  I'm guessing the US and Ukraine confirmed they shot it down on radar.  Maybe the plane banked back toward Russia after being hit and went down across the Russian border, where people couldn't get images?  You never know.  Similarly, how many vehicles might have been destroyed behind Russian lines, where Ukraine bars dissemination of video due to security concerns?  How many vehicles were abandoned in early days of war due to fuel and quietly picked up by Ukrainian tractor with no one bothering to photograph?

Personally, I think at the level of ""photographic evidence"" that 20% - 30% is probably low.  We are still getting new video and images today of equipment destroyed in March 2022.

- The battles going on all over Ukraine differ greatly from one another. The character of the fight for Bakhmut is quite different from the fight around Vuhledar, and both are themselves different from the fights around Avdiivka and Vuhledar. Knowing one battle means exactly that, you know one battle.

- The biggest problem facing Ukraine right now isn't equipment, but force quality. Ukraine has lost most of its best trained troops and it hasn't done a great job with training replacements, and Western training has been quite small with mixed reviews according to Ukrainian troops. Kofman claims that most Ukrainian troops are mobilized personnel who have no previous military experience at this point.

- Kofman once again listed what he sees as Ukraine's greatest needs in order: artillery ammunition and the replacement of artillery barrels, air defense munitions/platforms, and armored fighting vehicles most importantly IFVs and APCs. Ukraine has a lot of manpower, but it needs more protected mobility to be able to conduct offensives. He also noted the need for more drones/ISR as well as communications equipment for Ukraine.

- When he was in Bakhmut he saw a reinforcing tank platoon that was composed entirely of T-80s that were captured in Izyum from the 1st Tank Guards army. He also noted that the problem for Ukraine is that it doesn't have enough replacement parts to keep running all of the Russian vehicles its captured.

- Once again reemphasized that providing Western planes will take a long time for their effects to be felt and their effects won't be worthwhile compared with their cost. There's a limited amount of funding available for Ukraine and providing planes will consume a lot of those funds with no effects during the upcoming decisive period of the war.

- Ukraine still has a positive casualty ratio against Russia around Bakhmut, but the ratio is worse now than its been previously. It's a fight that doesn't play to Ukraine's strengths.

- Kofman thinks the decisive period of the war will be in Spring-Summer of this year. There is the possibility that this offensive will have the effect of altering the future trajectory of the conflict, especially if Ukraine is able to sever the Russian GLOC between Crimea and the Donbas. Kofman thinks that whatever happens at Bakhmut is unlikely to be important longterm, but Ukrainian offensive could have a major impact on Russia's ability to sustain the war and potentially even cause a breakdown of cohesion like what happened during Kharkiv (though he's caveats this as being less likely). This doesn't mean the war would be close to being over though, Russia is really the one who decides when the war ends.",1679593833.0,1679593138.0,t3_11z84m6,t1_jddo623,,7,0,0,0,0,0,

This is where you are wrong. As others have explained to you before, they can stay neutral in two ways:

1. Trade with none of the sides.
2. Trade with both of the sides.

Right now Switzerland is already trading with Ukraine. If Switzerland only trades with Ukraine they are obviously not neutral.

I will make it simpler for you. During the 2022 offensives, the offensive force cumulating Kherson + Kharkiv was about 100k soldiers. (30k in Kharkiv, 70k in Kherson). Training has been ongoing in-between with something like 30k additional soldiers. That doesn't even include réserves to the offensive (they didn't go all-in)

The only reason thing that would make them have a 20-30k offensive force today is if they somehow lost 100k of their offensive force this winter.

What most people don't understand is that Switzerland has a very direct form of democracy. Much more so than most other Western countries. They hold countless elections on almost everything and the power is incredibly decentralized. This means that Switzerland is VERY resistant to change of any kind. For example they only joined the UN in 2002 and women only gained the right to vote in all parts of the country in 1990. Decades later than all comparable countries. The banks and finance sector are not secretly keeping Switzerland neutral for their own gains. Instead, the Swiss political system is just so fucked up that they are unable to change their decades out of date neutrality policy. It made sense for them to be neutral during the world wars and maybe even during the Cold War. Now it doesn't.
