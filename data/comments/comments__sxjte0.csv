Putin will hold a large meeting of the Security Council

President Putin will hold a large meeting of the Security Council on February 21

MOSCOW, February 21 - RIA Novosti. Vladimir Putin will hold a meeting of the Security Council, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

""This is a big Security Council,"" he said.

The head of state himself and other speakers will speak at it. The Kremlin spokesman stressed that the meeting would be extraordinary.

""The president also has several international telephone calls today,"" Peskov added.

In recent days, the situation in the Donbass has escalated - [Kiev](http://ria.ru/location_Kiev/) ignores the agreements, has concentrated most of the army on the line of contact and regularly fires on the militias, including with the use of prohibited equipment

Because of the threat of [Ukraine](http://ria.ru/location_Ukraine/) 's invasion in the self-proclaimed republics, women, children and the elderly began to be evacuated to Russian regions. General mobilization announced.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been going on for eight years, during which time, according to the [UN](http://ria.ru/organization_OON/) , more than 13,000 people have become its victims, and about 44,000 more have been injured. De-escalation is being discussed at contact group meetings. The Minsk agreements are taken as a basis, which provide for a constitutional reform, a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact.

Tensions in the Donbass are being fueled by the [United States](http://ria.ru/location_United_States/) and other [NATO countries](http://ria.ru/organization_NATO/) , which are pumping weapons into Ukraine and sending military instructors there. [Moscow](http://ria.ru/location_Moskva/) has repeatedly called for a halt in the supply of weapons, as this could provoke Kiev into military adventures.",1645433840.0,1645433338.0,t3_sxjte0,t3_sxjte0,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

The military of the Russian Federation announced the destruction of five Ukrainian saboteurs

Moscow. February 21st. INTERFAX.RU - The Russian military reported the destruction of saboteurs who entered from the territory of Ukraine.

""As a result of the clash, five violators of the border of the Russian Federation from the sabotage and reconnaissance group were destroyed,"" the Southern Military District said.

""There are no casualties among the servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the border troops of the FSB of Russia,"" they said.


According to the Southern Military District, the sabotage group was discovered by the border squad of the FSB on Monday, February 21, at about 06:00 Moscow time in the area of ​​​​the settlement of Mityakinskaya (Rostov Region) on the section of the state border of the Russian Federation with Ukraine.

""In order to detain the sabotage group, the border detachment of the FSB of Russia requested reinforcements from the unit of the formation of the Russian armed forces of the Southern Military District allocated for the operational cover of the state border,"" the report says.

""During the clash for the emergency evacuation of a sabotage group from the territory of Ukraine, two infantry fighting vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the state border from the Russian Federation. A unit of the Russian armed forces that arrived at the scene of the clash promptly destroyed both infantry fighting vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with fire from anti-tank weapons,"" the Southern Military District said. .

The heads of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik appealed to Vladimir Putin with a request to recognize the independence of the DNR and LNR.
As Pushilin noted, the Ukrainian authorities decided on a forceful solution to the conflict. He stressed that the Donbass highly appreciates Moscow's efforts in the negotiation process on the Minsk agreements, but the agreements do not prevent Kiev, which receives military support from Washington, from violating the established truce.
In addition to recognizing independence, the head of the DPR asked the President of Russia to consider the possibility of concluding a cooperation agreement and the possibility of interaction in the defense sector.
Pushilin added that the residents of Donbass feel Russian in spirit, and their main goal is integration with Russia.""",False,1645451967.0,t3_sxjte0,t3_sxjte0,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Putin and Kozak(deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff) and the rest of the Russian Security Council are  discussing the request to recognize the separatists regions Donetsk and Lugansk as republics. Putin says he'll continue the talks but he hears what Kozak has to say. The State Duma already [voted](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-duma-asks-putin-to-recognize-ukrainian-regions-as-independent/a-60783596) weeks ago on this and 351 lawmakers voted in favor of the resolution and 16 voted against it; just one parliamentarian abstained. 

They've said they don't think Ukraine is serious and also that the US is 'going through the motions'.

This recognition step would be important because if the states are recognized and *then* Russian troops move in there it would technically NOT be an invasion.

As of now though Putin said the Minsk agreements still have life even though Kozak and Lavrov seem to think those agreements are dead.

Russian army says it destroyed two Ukrainian vehicles, in first report of direct clashes between militaries

Russia has claimed it destroyed two Ukrainian military vehicles straying into its territory, killing five people, in an unconfirmed incident that would be the first direct clashes with Ukrainian forces since Moscow mobilised 190,000 troops on its border.  
The army’s southern military district said in a statement that a “diversionary reconnaissance group” was discovered at 6am on Monday near the border village of Mityakinskaya and claimed that Ukraine sent two infantry fighting vehicles to “evacuate them from the battlefield”.  
Russian forces “destroyed both Ukrainian fighting vehicles with anti-tank weapons”, it added. “As a result of the clashes five members of the diversionary reconnaissance group who violated the border of the Russian Federation were destroyed,” the statement said, adding that no Russians were hurt in the fighting. Russia did not provide any evidence to support its claims.  
Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region have accused Kyiv of launching an offensive to retake the breakaway territories on the Russian border, where more than 14,000 people have died since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.  
Ukraine says Russia is trying to use the claims as a pretext for a renewed invasion of the country.  
Europe’s Stoxx 600 dropped sharply after the Russian army released its statement. The gauge was down 1.8 per cent in afternoon trading, with Russia’s Moex stock index off 8.1 per cent. The rouble bell 1.5 per cent against the US dollar.",False,1645450856.0,t3_sxjte0,t3_sxjte0,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

An invasion was imminent.  I mean like it would probably be happening by now if not for one thing.

Macron called Putin last minute.  Remember this call was quite strange in that it was unplanned and at an odd hour of the night.  There had to be something significant to prompt it.  Given the recency of this fairly alarming article an invasion order was given, I think it’s reasonable to assume this was the prime factor at play.  Macron was able to convince Putin to delay the invasion under one condition.  He would meet with Biden person to person and let him know he’s serious about this.  Not a bluff, not a flex of the Russian military’s capabilities, but he is dead serious about invading Ukraine. 

So, assuming these individuals are acting rationally (I’m not sure they are, to be fair), Putin is now holding off and waiting for this potential meeting.

Now, we currently don’t even know if this meeting will take place.  In the interest of avoiding a massive escalation in Ukraine I hope that it does.  Let’s assume it does take place.  Here’s my bet for what will happen:

There will be a deal reached.  Hold on to your tomatoes!  Before you start pelting me let me at least explain myself.  

Neither side wants a war.  Putin is cornered and probably afraid, and NATO is feeling more vulnerable than they have felt in decades.  

Putin has surrounded Ukraine and committed an exceptional amount of military resources in the region.  It’s expensive, and it’s diplomatically significant.  All eyes are on him now.  He can decide to suddenly withdrawal his forces, but without any kind of concessions it makes this stunt look completely ineffective, and worse, makes the Russian military look incapable.  That being said, he knows an invasion would be bloody, likely unpopular, and cause crippling sanction.  He’s between a rock and a hard place.  

NATO on the other hand is facing its own dilemma.  The west has enjoyed the decades of regional peace in the post WW II world.  A full scale war with Russia is just simply off the table.  That being said, Ukraine has recently been seen as a regionally ally.  It was even on a long term path for NATO membership.  If it were granted NATO a membership it would easily become the most powerful NATO country in Eastern Europe, and a powerful ally.  

So here we are.  Putin has amassed an army, and is expected to come up with results, while NATO is faced with the prospect of losing a valuable partnership, and in the process end up looking more vulnerable that it has since the Cold War. So where do we go from here?

Putin needs to look strong, and NATO needs to keep their partnership intact.  So enough with the rambling. Here’s the deal I think they’ll reach:

Ultimately it will be a gradual troop draw down by Russia, with each draw down being met with a concession from NATO.  Initially Russia will withdrawal a small amount. Probably 10-20k troops for a minor NATO concession as a gesture of good faith.  I have no idea what NATO would concede, but it could be just be something as simple as a promise not to further arm Ukraine.

The next several weeks would likely be met with continuing draw downs and concession.  I don’t really care to speculate too heavily on what they are, as there could be any number of minor concessions that I think NATO would accept.

Then we will get to the final stage.  I imagine at this point Russia will probably still have a moderate build up in the region.  The last concession needs to be decisive, a political win for Putin, and a strategic win for NATO.  Here’s my guess as to what it will be.

NATO will agree to allow the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk to separate from Ukraine and become independent countries (although in reality they will be Russian satellite states), and Russia will fully withdrawal its forces, except for troops in the newly formed nations to “provide security”.

Russia is Kanye, and Ukraine is Kim Kardashian. Pete Davidson is NATO. Even though both have been split for some time now, Russia (Kanye) still thinks Ukraine (Kim) belongs to it, and is being aggressive to try to get them back, regardless of what Ukraine (Kim) wants. Ukraine (Kim) wants to get closer to and enter a union with NATO (Pete), with which they currently have somewhat of a relationship. While both Russia (Kanye) and Ukraine (Kim) share an extensive common history, perhaps it is better for them to move on as their own entities and for Russia (Kanye) to abandon the aggressive tactics, because they won't result in Russia (Kanye) getting what they want. Instead, it will only lead to more turmoil for both (custody battles, damaged reputations, etc). Just like Russia will get harsh economic sanctions and Ukraine will fall apart due to violence as Ukraine battles to remain sovereign like Kim is right now.

In spite of Putin's bullshit over the past couple months, Zelensky's still dedicated to joining NATO. He's also been outspoken about re-developing nuclear weapons recently. Both of these desires are strongly against Russia's national security demands. This is why I think that the summit will either: fail, not even happen or get betrayed. Russia's already at an unfair posture, because they invaded Ukraine in 2014 and reneged the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. So they're entering this situation while already violating a prior treaty.  


Russia's also been up to some really sketchy shit. These activities include falsified genocide claims, cyberattacks, false-flag attacks, massive troop movements and theatre activation in Eastern Ukraine. Putin also lied to Macron's face about ending the exercise on 20 Feb 22. Today, Lukashenka and Putin agreed to station 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus for an indefinite period. So this is yet another one of their reneged promises.   


NATO intelligence, coupled with OSINT on social media and elsewhere, has largely indicated that a Russian-Belarusian-Abkhazian invasion of Ukraine is in the cards. I am not saying it will or won't happen, and nor do I want it to. I'm also not providing an exact date or time (because all predictions have passed with no incident so far).

It is possible, but currently chances are pretty low.

Moldova is currently out of Russia's claims, and our government keeps things pretty neutral so far, no official declarations regarding Ukraine situation. Of course this is not the best thing to do for external policy, but it is the best thing to do at the moment.

And Transnistria does the same towards Moldova, even their leader recently complimented our president saying she has a good point regarding some external policy stuff, we seem to be getting along pretty well so far.

They had some military drills recently, but aimed at defending in case something is going on st their border with Ukraine, which is a land border, unlike""border"" with Moldova, which is basically a large river.

Transnistria has a somewhat democratically elected government, and not somebody put in place directly by Russia.

And their so-called government are actually just businessmen (largest corporation there - Sheriff), and their business is doing better than ever, and they would really rather not change the status quo.

Additionally their military is not that advanced, and Russians have just about 1k soldiers here, of which 200 professional officers and 800 conscripts - kids carrying AKs.

And even more - for Moldova it's easy to defend considering the relief, river, bridges, valleys where tanks are easy targets and so on.

Aaaand our pro-EU government unfortunately is a huge disappointed and probably will lose next elections and be replaced by some less-pro EU guys or even pro-russians. So Putin can just wait out....

With all due respect, that is an absolutely idiotic take, I'm sorry to say.

A) Civilians will be killed regardless. Are you suggesting that the lives of journalists and LGBTQ people are more important or worthwhile than children's?

B) If the US puts troops on the ground there to protect those people, they will be in direct conflict with Russian troops. That would very likely lead to a nuclear exchange. Are you willing to support global annihilation for some people being targeted? 8 billion peoples' lives for a few hundred or thousand peoples' lives?

C) The US ignores other countries doing similar things. Did you know that our NATO ally Turkey jails political opponents, has one of the highest incarceration rates for journalists, has rampant femicide, and has a long history of targeting ethnic and religious minorities?  The same goes for nearby Azerbaijan, which is the country Biden is trying to arrange to make up for Russian oil to Europe.

A war would be unpopular on the home front and the resulting Ukrainian nationalist insurgency would be an untenable situation.

It would result in the current major pipeline they have through Ukraine being destroyed which would lose them huuuuuge sums of money in the short term especially with nord stream 2 getting subsequently killed off.

It would make for a rocky relationship with their major ally China who his going hard on the point that Ukraine has a right to core national interests /integrity as it would help undermine their claim to Taiwan.

The primary fighters would be those in eastern Ukraine who are ethnically Russian and Russia has promised to protect, demonstrating they would inadvertently drop their own people under the bus and are unreliable in protecting other Russians out side Russia proper.

The subsequent sanctions would hurt citizens in Russia who would take the major brunt of it causing further destabilization at home Necessitating strong responses on the citizenry should they push back on the government.

Putin sees both nord stream and the Ukraine situation as legacy issues and if he can secure his own positions on these it would, in his eyes, cement his place as a strong Russian leader. If he can’t he’s just the dunce who got them bogged down in Afghanistan 2.0 with their former little brother who would subsequently “win” the way the Afghans did with both the Russians and the Americans, albeit severely hurting said little brother at the same time.

Putin just dosnt want nato to expand because historically it’s been a gun pointed at Russia and with it up against their boarder in Ukraine they could realistically have forces and military hardware closer to Moscow then it was to Washington when the soviets moved missiles to Cuba(in response to nato putting nukes in Turkey and Italy mind you) ultimately he wants this with out confrontation, as it would be a really good showing of his skills as a diplomat on the domestic front. He would have been able to stop nato from expanding something no soviet leader(or Yeltsin) ever was able to achieve.

If this summit goes through, Putin will demand a ceasefire from Ukraine. But Ukraine isn't who's doing the shelling right now. Putin's own forces are doing the shelling, and in order to protect ethnic Russians in Donbas and Rostov Oblast, he'll have to invade. Keep in mind that this summit is predicated upon Putin not invading Ukraine by Thursday. That's not a guarantee.  
  
NATO also has no intention of rolling back their extent to 1997 levels. They're not going to kick out several Eastern European countries because it'll greatly destabilize European national security. Additionally, Russia's already reneged on the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances by invading Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine has just now stated that they wish to fast-track NATO membership and wish to develop their own nuclear weapons. This goes completely against Russia's national security demands.

1c63f6ff77d1095dc976529e4f49399a,sxjte0,hxt0kiy,"**Effectively zero  - let me explain:**

* Nukes provide effectively zero strategic utility from an **offensive** purpose, and *Russia* is the one with the nukes, not *Ukraine*. 
   * Assuming the goal of the attacking actor is to capture/take control of the territory they are attacking either directly via occupation (think Crimea), or indirectly via installing a proxy government (think Afghanistan), then the use of nukes as an offensive weapon is directly counter to the attacking parties strategy.
   * Nukes do enormous environmental/collateral damage to literally everything in their theatre and are INCREDIBLY costly to clean up, meaning any attacking party who nukes their enemy is just creating HUGE additional costs for themselves in the future and destroying huge amounts of the exact assets they are invading to capture.
   * Additionally, the usage of nuclear weapons in an offensive move will have enormous civilian casualties, immediately galvanising the entire population of the territory you are invading against you and providing them with an almost infinite motivation to resist your occupation/puppet government.
      * People seriously underestimate how critical it is to win over the native inhabitants of a region in order for an invasion to be a success. All you need to do is look at Afghanistan and further back, Vietnam, to see how effective long-term insurgencies by highly-motivated local inhabitants are.
      * You go nuking a city or even a country-side, you're guaranteeing yourself **generations** of resistance fighters/insurgents who are going to be making that territory hard/impossible for you to hold, let alone see any strategic ""profit"" from.
* Nukes serve a **single** strategic utility, and it's defensive. They are as close as this planet gets to a true geopolitical safety guarantee.
   * Nukes are the nation-state equivalent of a ***dead-man switch*** \- basically a big fuck-off red button that says *""If you take me down, I'll take you with me""*.
   * An example of this is the ""fail-deadly"" policies put in place by most nation-states with an effective nuclear weapons delivery capability.
   * Essentially the system is designed in such a way that if the nation-state comes under attack by a suitably dangerous adversary - or if the nation-state's command-and-control infrastructure is taken offline (indicating an extremely effective & massive precision strike on their government), the nuclear-armed state's military organisation will ""fail-over"" to a default mode of *""nuke the shit out of our enemy""*.
   * Examples of this are how truly **""final""** launch control for submarine-based ICBM's actually rest with the captain/first-officer of each submarine, not the head-of-state of the nation that submarine belongs to - and will default to launching their missiles if it's found that their country is under significant attack. 
   * SSBN's will surface at periodic intervals and basically ""phone home"" to check that they're still receiving the ""all clear"" signal. If they don't get that ""green light"", then the captain & first-officer will access launch codes held in *""letters of last resort""* and launch their nukes.
* This is the fundamental concept that underpins the ""nuclear peace"" theory. Basically arguing that nukes are actually the most effective ""peace-keeping"" tool that the human race has ever developed.
   * They effectively make large-scale conventional warfare between ""major nations"" no longer possible. Because both sides are nuclear-armed and both sides implement ""fail-deadly"" mechanisms, there's effectively no way that one major power can stage an effective attack upon another major power in a way that won't be SIGNIFICANTLY more costly than anything they'll ever gain by ""winning"" the war you start.
   * Obviously, though, this only ensures peace between large, nuclear-armed nations (or their defensive allies). Ukraine isn't a member of NATO so they don't get that protection.

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Yes, Russian troops are in Russian territory. I find it hard to believe there would be zero concern if the US had a significant portion of their military in forward positions within 15km of the Mexican border. They may be in Russian territory but their positioning is certainly not common, and they continue to move closer to the border. It is not simply a non story, it's very significant.

> said fully unironically.

Of course I said it unironically. Governments authorize sources to ""leak"" things all the time, when they want that information public without it being their ""official"" stance. The fact that there's been no word until now on what a sanctions package could look like is at the very least interesting timing. As things appear to be escalating, all the sudden details of a sanctions package are revealed. Certainly doesn't seem like a coincidence.

 >The Gleiwitz incident (German: Überfall auf den Sender Gleiwitz; Polish: Prowokacja gliwicka) was a false flag attack on the radio station Sender Gleiwitz in Gleiwitz (then Germany and today Gliwice in Poland) staged by Nazi Germany on the night of 31 August 1939. Along with some two dozen similar incidents, the attack was manufactured by Germany as a casus belli to justify the invasion of Poland, which began the next morning. The attackers posed as Polish nationals. During his declaration of war, Hitler did not mention the Gleiwitz incident but grouped all provocations staged by the SS as an alleged ""Polish assault"" on Germany.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had some influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

I wouldn't put those two in the same argument, somewhat different incidents. 

Iraq WMD was an outright fabrication by the Bush administration (though strangely enough there is good evidence that many of them genuinely believed they'd eventually find chemical weapons, but convinced themselves that they had to make up the evidence to justify their invasion, and retroactively would find the evidence; mind you, WMDs never were the reason why they wanted to invade, only their justification)

Anyway, on the horseshoe plan... historians agree that it never existed, but the consensus is also that it wasn't an outright fabrication, but uncertain Bulgarian intelligence taken (too) serious by German officials. At least there never was evidence that there were actual doubts in Germany it was good information. On the contrary, there is good evidence that it was thought to be real. Various sources of information show that the (new and inexperienced) German administration (mis-)took it as genuine. And from fairly broad sources it seems the discussion in the White House was shaped by fears that the situation would play out as it did in Ruanda, with Clinton afraid they'd be accused of again standing by and doing nothing in the face of a genocide. Questions about the quality of the information were raised, but only in second order meetings, they weren't passed on to the President who worried about looking weak on foreign affairs.",False,1645453376.0,t3_sxjte0,t1_hxtydkb,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Based on the North American P-51 Mustang, the F-82 was originally designed as a long-range escort fighter for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in World War II. The war ended well before the first production units were operational. In the postwar era, Strategic Air Command used the planes as a long-range escort fighter.

Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an aerial refueling tanker or command center.

 >The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely-piloted, surveillance aircraft. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

 >Fail-deadly is a concept in nuclear military strategy that encourages deterrence by guaranteeing an immediate, automatic, and overwhelming response to an attack, even if there is no one to trigger such retaliation. The term fail-deadly was coined as a contrast to fail-safe.
 
**[Nuclear peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_peace)** 
 
 >Nuclear peace is a theory of international relations that argues that under some circumstances, nuclear weapons can induce stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation. In particular, nuclear weapons are said to have induced stability during the Cold War since both the United States and the Soviet Union possessed mutual second-strike retaliation capability, which eliminated the possibility of nuclear victory for either side. Proponents of nuclear peace argue that controlled nuclear proliferation may be beneficial for inducing stability.

Russia is the primary de facto internationally recognized successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War; while Ukraine has, by law, proclaimed that it is a state-successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union which remained under dispute over formerly Soviet-owned properties.

hes probs average intelligence otherwise he wouldn’t have both worked in intelligence prior to being president or lasted as long as a leader of a major country as he has.

I just have a hard time seeing him invading Ukraine, and if anything happens it’ll probs be because of the people in eastern Ukraine who want to fight for independence forcing his hand to help them as he already said he would do. If it does happen he’s not sending Russian troops anywhere Kiev or out side of Donbas/ Donetsk. He can smooth things over with the Chinese by building them a pipeline and giving them cheep access to Russian gas more easily then he can win a Ukrainian nationalist insurgency through out a nation roughly the size of Texas on top of the added pressure of western economic sanctions and guaranteed nato expansion afterwards.

Yes, they're building *some* new reactors. No, they're not focusing on nuclear, as these are merely replacing a part of their aging fleet of reactors, much less expanding its importance, as seen by their intention of reducing the share of nuclear in their mix from 70% to 50% in the next 13 years.

I don't want war, and at least try to be reasonable with it. I follow newsthreads from all over the globe, Guardian, Al-Jahzeera, CNN, RT and then try to get some kind of objective truth from all these different - and often conflicting - newssources.

Then I come here, and honestly, what I see is people who are truly being resonable (Putin doesn't war, Russia doesn't want war, NATO is just as responsible for this by intensively militarizing Europe through the past decade, Putin knows this will turn out bad for him, Biden is not being objective, but so is Putin, there should be more dialogue and less posturing) being downvoted in favor of a huge-ass jerk around the NATO stance of Putin as this moustache-twirling bad guy complete with white cat and a volcano lair.

He is not that.

He is volatile, and sometimes psychotic, but he also has enough people in place that will say *no* to him if actively tries to sabotage their foreign investments. Like, you guys seriously believe he wants to go to war (!) with the entirety of NATO (!!) over a fucking coal-mine filled with rednecks? Get a grip, people. His children go to school in England, his partners have investments in Sweden and in Ireland. He knows that just as well as the next guy. Will there be war? Possibly. Will the future history books tell the story of the brave America who stopped the evil Russia from invading? I am fucking certain of that. Will that be true? No. Europeans and Americans need to have a good hard look in the mirror, if I'm being honest and realize that their perspective is far from the only - or the mainstream - one.

Nobody in Russia wants war. The oligarchs, the politicians, the students, the people on the streets. And Putin knows that just as well. So stop falling for the fake constructed narrative and try to think for yourself.",1645454297.0,1645454011.0,t3_sxjte0,t1_hxu1c4h,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

 >The February 26 Incident (二・二六事件, Ni Ni-Roku Jiken, also known as the 2-26 Incident) was an attempted coup d'état in the Empire of Japan on 26 February 1936. It was organized by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers with the goal of purging the government and military leadership of their factional rivals and ideological opponents. Although the rebels succeeded in assassinating several leading officials (including two former prime ministers) and in occupying the government center of Tokyo, they failed to assassinate Prime Minister Keisuke Okada or secure control of the Imperial Palace.

They can help you with the essentials and probably a flight to the US or at least Poland. You should be able to wire your husband money from abroad if you have any friends or family who can help. They won’t be able to help your husband unless he has US citizenship until the fighting actually starts, but at least by being in Lviv it is a relatively short trip to safety in Poland. In such a situation, he (or the both of you, if you refuse to leave him behind in Ukraine) should proceed to a Polish border checkpoint and say you formally request asylum under Polish law and the UN convention because your country of residence is at war. They will take all your money then, but they are legally obligated to give you housing and allowance for food until your asylum request is approved. If it is approved, which it definitely will be if Ukraine is at war, you will get a work permit for Poland that I think can be valid for all of the EU once you get permanent residence, if you have to stay there that long. With some luck the war will be over in less than a year though, and you can go back home. Best case scenario of course, there’s no war at all, you don’t need to leave the country, and you don’t lose any money besides what you spent on your ""holiday"" in Lviv.
