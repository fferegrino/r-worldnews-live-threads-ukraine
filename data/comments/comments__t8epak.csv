We’re receiving more information surrounding the corridors Russia has reportedly agreed to open this morning.

According to various Russian state media outlets all citing Russia’s defence ministry, the corridors - which will be opened from the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy - are being set up at the personal request of French President Emmanuel Macron.

Some corridors appear to involve the evacuation of Ukrainian civilians to Russian cities and Belarus.

According to routes published by the RIA Novosti news agency, the corridor from Kyiv will lead to Belarus, and civilians who are seeking to flee Kharkiv will only have one corridor leading to Russia.

Corridors from Mariupol and Sumy will lead both to other Ukrainian cities and to Russia.

Those who want to leave Kyiv will also be able to be airlifted to Russia, the ministry said, adding that it would use drones to monitor the evacuation and “attempts by the Ukrainian side to deceive Russia and the whole civilised world ... are useless this time”.

China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has stressed that the friendship between Beijing and Moscow is still very strong - despite international condemnation of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine - and says China is open to helping mediate peace.

Beijing has walked a tight diplomatic tightrope throughout the crisis, refusing to condemn its close ally Moscow after only last month touting a “no limits” strategic partnership between the two countries.

“The friendship between the two peoples is rock-solid, and both sides’ future cooperation prospects are very vast,” Wang told an annual press briefing on Monday.

But he said China was “willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation, when necessary”.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said last week that China should mediate future peace talks between Russia and Ukraine as Western powers cannot fulfil the role.

Beijing has repeatedly said it would play a “constructive role in calling for negotiations” to resolve the crisis, but has not previously committed to joining or hosting any peace talks.

Wang also said China would send humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

He described the China-Russia relationship as “the world’s most crucial bilateral relationship”, which “is conducive to world peace, stability and development”.

The foreign minister referred to last month’s partnership commitment as “clearly and unmistakably showing the world” that both countries “jointly oppose the revival of the Cold War mentality and stoking ideological confrontations”.

Wang also said the informal alliance would “not brook interference by third parties”, in a warning to the US and its Western allies who in recent days have lobbied China to play a more active role in mediating the conflict. (Via AFP)",False,1646642161.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

I mean just full on Russian propaganda. It was so bad that even Fox News, which is basically RT's affiliate in the US, had to call him to task. Anyways, the reason I bring it up is I thought it was a fascinating chance to hear, in native English, the Kremlin's talking points for the invasion. And this is some of what I got:

- Ukraine isn't a real country, Ukrainians are indistinguishable from Russians

- The US and Western Europe should not get involved in what is essentially an internal dispute between one people

- The Ukrainians are being led by bad people, like Zelensky, who are convincing them to fight a hopeless battle which will only cost them their lives and not change the outcome

- The goal here should be to stand back and let Russia enter, and convince the Ukrainians that putting up a fight here would only lead to needless suffering and death on behalf of people who are taking advantage of their suffering for their own nefarious purposes.

So yeah, if you hear any of the those points above they probably also get their marching orders straight from the Kremlin as well.",1646630545.0,1646630138.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,67,0,67,0,0,

Where civillians in towns just run over turn out in *threatening* numbers for rallies against the invader.

First is that Russia's nukes preventing an intervention means that more countries will want them. For offense, it means you can take from your neighbor. For defense, it guarantees your right to exist. NOT intervening here greatly increases the chance of a future nuclear war because more people will have nukes. A precedent of consequences needs to be set, and it needs to be set now.

Second is that Russia's status as a nuclear state and superpower means it can do what it wants.  Russian troops are comitting mass rapes, massacres, killing children, looting, and now Putin keeps threatening billions of people with WMDs and will probably deploy chemical weapons if they aren't already on the way.

""Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation: SBU is preparing a provocation with radioactive contamination of the area in Kharkov
According to the agency, nationalists mined a reactor at an experimental nuclear facility at the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology


MOSCOW, 7 March. /TASS/. The SBU and Azov battalion militants are planning to blow up a reactor at the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology and accuse the Russian Armed Forces of launching a missile attack on an experimental nuclear facility. This was reported on Monday in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.

""The SBU, together with the militants of the Azov battalion, are preparing a provocation with possible radioactive contamination of the area near the city of Kharkiv. Nationalists mined a reactor at an experimental nuclear facility located at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology,"" the report says. ""The SBU and the militants of the Azov battalion"" plan to blow up the reactor and accuse the Russian Armed Forces of allegedly launching a missile attack on an experimental nuclear facility.""

The Ministry of Defense noted that ""Foreign journalists arrived in Kharkiv on March 6 to record the consequences of the provocation, followed by accusations of the Russian Federation of creating an ecological catastrophe.""

Earlier, the Russian armed forces, during a special military operation in Ukraine, took control of the Zaporozhye and Chernobyl nuclear power plants. This was done to ""exclude the possibility of Ukrainian neo-Nazis or terrorists organizing provocations fraught with catastrophic consequences,"" the Kremlin's press service said following a telephone conversation between Russian and French Presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron on Sunday.

Commenting on the proposal of the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency to hold a trilateral (IAEA-Russia-Ukraine) meeting in the Chernobyl zone to develop a mechanism for ensuring the safety of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, mentioned by the President of France, Putin noted that in principle this idea could be useful, but it was worth consider holding such a meeting via videoconference or in a third country, the Kremlin said.""",1646624593.0,1646624454.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Those who compare Czechoslovakia in 1938 with Ukraine in 2022 are wrong.

Czechoslovakia had a defense agreement with UK and France. UK and France had drawn a line in Czechoslovakia: were Hitler to invade Czechoslovakia, they'd go to war with Germany. And they backed down from that, with the results we all know.

Ukraine has no defense agreement with NATO or EU. NATO and EU are bound to defend countries that belong to those organizations, but not Ukraine. 

So, by not going to war with Russia, NATO and EU are not backing down from anything.

&#x200B;

Philippines President Rodrigo ­Duterte has described Russian leader Vladimir Putin as “suicidal” and said all countries would be ­affected if Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine were to descend into a ­nuclear conflict.  
  
Speaking at the weekend about the escalating crisis that has now killed thousands of civilians, Mr Duterte said he wanted The Philippines to stay neutral over the conflict but accepted that it would eventually have to choose sides.  
  
“For me, we stay neutral. But reality tells me that in the end, we’ll just have to select which side we would be,” the outgoing Philippines leader said.  
  
“I just pray to God that this will not really go out of control. If it is not put under control, the world is in danger.  
  
“Once they start to push the button of nuclear warheads or ­nuclear bombs, well, as one commentator said, it will melt the world.”  
  
Mr Duterte made the comments just days after his country voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, along with fellow ASEAN member nations Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar and Malaysia.  


“I made a statement six years ago before I became a president. I was asked about Russia … I said the Americans will never stomach death and destruction. They are afraid,” he said.  
  
*“I said the Americans will not but you watch out for Putin, he is suicidal. If he loses face, he would run amok. And I realised it when I went to Russia.*",False,1646632529.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

For the Ukranian people, where the odds of being killed are higher, the risk / reward for a nuclear response are way different than the rest of the world. We don't know the probability of Russia actually using nuclear weapons. Frankly the odds are probably really low. But when you factor in a risk / reward of hundreds of thousand vs billions, that probability even as low as it is, has huge ramifications.

Too many of you are far too fixated on Kyiv. Its a hugely important from Ukraine's perspective as it represents the existence of Ukraine. Its somewhat important for the Russians for the same reason, but if they take the entire East of the country, Kyiv isn't going to matter nearly as much.

For **ANYONE** still suggesting that NATO ""just get in there already"".  We get it, you are frustrated, and think the world isn't doing enough.  It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  The problem is, we are facing a real life ethical nightmare. It's called ""The Trolley Problem"": 


>The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.  


https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/trolley-problem-moral-philosophy-ethics


The basic application is that Russia is the Trolley, the 5 people represent the world at large, the 1 person represents Ukraine, and the onlooker is the US.

However, in this situation, it’s more like if the onlooker pulls the lever, **everyone dies**, not just the people on the tracks.


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

https://twitter.com/sheenagreitens/status/1500613352661430277

I think this is spot on analysis of the chinese position. I'm glad that this means Putin will never use nuclear weapons. China is afraid that if Putin uses nukes, the US will use nukes to defend Taiwan and blame the authoritarian regimes for using it first. 

China has been trying for years to enter the russian market (through unionpay, more direct pipeline investment) and failing because the Russians don't trust China, especially since China has been very aggressive about trying to settle the Russian far east (and Russia has so far limited that kind of investment). Keep in mind that Russia is one of the great powers that humiliated China when China was weak so relations will never be normal and it will be motivated by self-interest.

China does not actually hope for an off-ramp which is why they haven't tried to create one. As explained above, china and russia have  a love hate relationship and this Ukrainian crisis is a great way (foolish on NATO's part) to further the positive image of China in Russia.

China's ultimate strategic goal is east asian domination. The first clear objective is reunification with Taiwan. This is the only PRC interest.

After 10 days now, I am starting to think that it's true, that this military action and of course the immense sanctions are a total disaster for Russia, an absolute ruin.  

I think it's true that Putin was so deluded, believing in his own fairy tales. No surprise, as he is surrounded by ""yes men"" who are afraid to speak the truth to him. (That Youtube clip where Putin talked to his own Spy Chief as if he was a Kindergartner, and you could see the fear in the face of that guy, spoke volumes).

I strongly believe that only recently (in the last few days) the magnitude of this failure and with it the likely ruin of their economy DAWNED on Putin. This is NOT what he expected. 

I hope that this now weaker position of Russia (obviously he will continue playing the strong man) will influence the next talks.

If Putin has 3 working brain cells left, he will agree to widthdraw. Ukraine can leave them Donbas and Crimea and strikes a deal that they will NOT (!) be joining NATO. If Putin is smart, he will agree. Despite not having reached their delusional goal of replacing the Ukraine gvt, no ""demilitarization"", no ""de-nazification"".  Because Putin knows, it will never happen, and even if it happened, if they ""won"" this conflict, Russia's future would still be over. I don't think Putin wants to pay this price.

In 1914, the killing of the heir of Austria-Hungary provoked a series of events that led to WW1. Austrians attacked Serbia to retaliate for the murder, but also to be seen strong at home in a moment of great weakness and tensions between the different parts of the Dual Monarchy. One thing led to another, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, Germany on Russia and France, France and UK on Germany, and so on. The result was the biggest war the world had seen at that point.

In 1939, the invasion of Poland provoked WW2. Hitler was sure France, and specially UK, wouldn't risk a war with Germany over Poland, despite Poland having pacts of mutual defense with France and UK. Well, we all know how it went: France and UK declared war on Germany, then Italy declared war on France and UK, Germany declared war on USSR, Japan declared war on US, US declared war on Japan, Italy and Germany, and so on...",False,1646639566.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,-4,0,-4,0,0,

080544e61bd639a6805e68f2a60c4694,t8epak,hznvkiy,"Guys. We need to accept the fact that Russia is going to win this war unless one of two things happens. Russian soldiers refuse to fight en masse. Or western powers directly intervene.

Ukraine is putting up an incredible fight with the indirect support from the western powers. Russia, however, just has far too many soldiers to send into the meat grinder. They are moving at a much slower pace than expected. But the end result will be the same. They’re eventually gonna cut off the supply lines and then start taking the cities. Fresh troops will continue to come in while Ukrainians get mentally and physically drained. I hope I’m wrong. But I feel the writing is on the wall. Zelenskyy knows it too and is pleading with western powers to help his beloved country more. He knows what happens if they don’t.

Russia is the first ever nuclear nation to really test how offensive they can be with the their threat of nukes in the background. They’re attacking another democratic nation unprovoked, committing war crimes, targeting civilians, you name it, because they have the nuclear arsenal in their back pocket. Any non nuclear nation does this to Ukraine and the western powers have already intervened directly. Probably similar to Desert Storm. Russia, however, has that threat and are using it as an offensive weapon. Western powers don’t want to directly engage Russia unless they have to (essentially if a NATO nation is attacked).

Right now, the precedent is set forever moving forward. First, if a nation is planning on joining NATO, but Russia attacks them before they officially join, then they’re fucked. Sucks for them. Second, a nation with a nuclear arsenal has free reign. Pick on the little guys all you want. Commit the war crimes. Target civilians. Any other nation capable of stopping you militarily won’t do so because the risk of you using your nukes is too high. Putin is using the nukes to bully the world. It’s all he’s got. Clearly his military isn’t as great as many thought, and would get steamrolled in a war against other top countries. He continuously states western nations intervening via a no fly zone or even lending military weaponry is an act of war against Russia. So I guess what he’s doing is okay because he’s already there. In his mind anyway.

I’ve thought about this a lot. It’s terrifying. It truly is. And nobody wants WW3. But guess what? Nobody wanted WW2 either. And before that, nobody wanted WW1. Right now, the world is allowing an adult to beat up on a 10 year old inside a boxing ring. They help in every way they can aside from stepping in there collectively and fighting that adult themselves. They don’t step in because the adult in the boxing ring also has a rifle strapped around his shoulder and has threatened to use it if any other adult intervenes. The adults watching and helping the 10 year old also have this rifle, but they really (correctly) don’t wanna use it.

And the second harsh truth of this thread comes to light here. Putin ain’t stopping with Ukraine. He knew the consequences of invading. The sanctions. The isolation. The economic impact. He did it anyway. He’s not stopping now. That would show weakness. He will take Ukraine at all costs. When he does, do we really think he’s gonna say well that was a bloody war. That’s all I wanted though. We are good now. Nope. He’s gonna keep going. Eventually, a large scale war is likely. It really depends on if Russia can be self sufficient and how much China decides to help them.

The correct course of action would have been to be proactive. Western powers send a carrier task force into the Black Sea as soon as Russia mobilized toward the border. Make Ukraine a no fly zone before Russia invaded. Ensure Russia knows the consequences. Put them in a situation where they have to be the ones to attack a western power. As it was, the western powers are being reactive. Now Putin can play that card if anything you do to them in Ukraine is an act of war. Since he’s established a Russian presence there. Now in order to implement those sorts of things it would require direct military engagement with Russia. 

That ship has sailed though. Now it’s about being reactive. Do you stand up for the little guy? Do you say this is not okay what you’re doing. You’re killing innocent people. You’re targeting civilians. You’re committing war crime after war crime. Nuclear arsenal or not we are not allowing that. The end result here could be that Russia decides to use a nuke. Or do you do absolutely everything in your power to help the little guy without directly engaging with Russia? The end result here is the little guy getting killed slowly. Tough decision no question. In the 1930s until September of 1939, all of Europe had the same mindset. Nothing can be worse than another world war. So they kept letting Hitler do what he wanted. He lied and said one thing. Did another. Kept taking more territory to expand. Kept saying it was to restore the old Germany. Sound familiar to anything happening now? In September of 1939, they finally realized it. A Europe controlled by Hitler is worse than another world war. So here we go.",1646625633.0,1646625409.0,t3_t8epak,t3_t8epak,,0,-13,0,-13,0,0,

I am not trying to justify or defend this invasion, I fucking hate imperialism and this is a clear blatant act of it. I’m just trying to put myself in an imperialist’s shoes and understand why the end of the world wont happen due to this.

If the US drew a line at nuclear missiles in Cuba, why is it so insane to believe that Russia’s line is to stop expanding nuclear influences on their borders?

Even if Ukraine doesn’t have NATO nukes in their borders, Macron has been making it clear that NATO is a nuclear alliance.

Maybe average American citizens wouldn’t care about Russian nukes in Cuba, but their government was willing to end the world over it.

Putin (probably? Idk I’m not in his head) just wants to stop NATO from expanding. Is it justified? Probably not. But stop worrying that he’s this unhinged maniac that will drop nukes on a whim.

When I was in the Army we trained with frequency-hopping encryption, sure, but I definitely needed to reteach myself how to do it every time we went to the field.

Now, if we were getting ready to deploy in a no-shit combat environment, of course we wouldn’t cut corners, but that level of training is very deliberate and requires a lot of organizational memory in the form of experienced NCOs to keep SOPs and shit straight.

What we’re seeing with Russia, on the other hand, is a notoriously hollow and unprofessional NCO corps, tons of conscripted soldiers who don’t regularly train with their units, and months of training where *they and everyone else believed they weren’t going to war.* That’s a recipe for shit training and shit preparation, which is why we’re seeing unencrypted comms, civilian supply cars being shipped to the front, and vehicles breaking down.

Problem is when you are attacking down single roads and punch only a handful of holes through enemy lines, and do not clear the enemy in between roads, well the enemy no longer needs to attack your tanks to 'kill' them, all they need to do is attack the fuel and cargo trucks that must travel down that road. Added to that, it's the mud season  over their right now, the tanks are limited to the roads or they will get stuck. So to stop this tank attack all you need to do is blow up a bridge, no bridge? got an ATGM? Blow up the lead guy and block  the road. Can't take out the tank? Blast a trench into the road for the tank to fall in and get stuck. Plenty of options in this case

Now a tank can be useful in a city, it can blow up offending buildings that would rip apart a strictly infantry based assault and can provide cover for infantry units advancing up a road for example but alone without infantry support, the defenders can maneuver around the tank, which has limited view to the outside (the commander can't exactly stick his head out of his hatch without putting himself at risk), and hit the tank in its weak points from behind, the sides and the top.",False,1646623233.0,t3_t8epak,t1_hznnwr9,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Large commodity trades are performed on two levels.  Contract buys (meaning X will import some predetermined amount on a monthly / weekly basis from Y).

Meaning, you don't want to agree to sell a million barrels of oil per day at a set price for the next three months where the currency is wildly fluctuating so you choose something thats not (usually USD).

You then have the spot market, which is buys for immediate demand that was unforseen.  Again you can set up those contracts in any currency you like but the counter parties have to agree.

Russia is going to have an issue trying to set prices in rubles as they are depreciating with every breath you take.  Their central blank is blocked from accessing it's reserves from most of the world (except china).  So they will most likely be setting contracts in yuan.

Shutting down the Keystone Pipeline has also enabled Russia; Trump did not get paid over a million dollars by the Mayor of Moscow’s wife. Pretty sure Durham has the goods about how it was a Clinton funded operation using false intel to try to tie Trump to Putin. 

When the nation thinks about unifying the hubris of some to continue to harp on Trump is asinine and doesn’t help at all. 

I know this will get downvoted but at the end of the day what I am saying is true; no land was acquired when Trump was President and gas prices were low. Gas already doubled by the time this conflict took place; people can deny all they want. 

The smug arrogance of leftist operators to assume all Trump supporters are ignorant after they were lied to due to a false dossier Clinton paid Russian operatives to create never ceases to amaze me. 

Bottom line: Intel was on the money about this invasion but continuing to complain about former President Trump accomplishes absolutey nothing.

>However, in this situation, it’s more like if the onlooker pulls the lever, everyone dies, not just the people on the tracks.

This is such nonsense. 

The reason it is a ridiculous analogy is a trolley can't modify its own behaviour or choose whether to stop, it has no fear, it is incapable of being reasoned with or deterred and it doesn't care whether or not it faces nuclear annihilation itself. 

Imagining Russia as the trolley leads to a logical conclusion that if russia tomorrow indicated it intended to drop a nuclear bomb on Kiev, or indeed Warsaw or Berlin, then regardless of Article 5 the US should immediately stand down all its nuclear weapons, take no military action and do nothing to prompt a wider exchange. Because there is no way anything could be done to make 'the trolley' think twice and saving the lives of the people under the trolley (ie the entire population of Warsaw) is not worth the risk of hundreds of millions of people dying in the US.

Thankfully for humanity, fifty years of the cold war indicated the exact opposite of this, Russia can modify its behavior when pressured, it is very afraid of the West, it can be reasoned with and deterred and it has just as much reason to want to continue to exist as the rest of the world.

Based on their own government policies and basic common sense, nothing about a no fly zone over ukraine is sufficient to justify a nuclear response from Russia. .

It suits Putins interests to pretend Russia is some sort of implacable war machine who will destroy the entire world via nuclear holocaust if the West shoots down one of his planes over another country, precisely because it minimises the risk they will intervene.

real non sequitur here..

anyways, NATO isn't like a fraternity that goes around looking for members. and Ukraine isn't qualified for the EU, much less NATO, but it's expressed interest for the future. which is part of the problem.

NATO never ""backed Ukraine as an in"". NATO doesn't want ""in"" to Ukraine. If NATO could choose, it would probably choose to permanently segregate itself from that whole neighborhood, forever. But that's impossible.

Rather, NATO's connection here is that 1) Ukraine is on NATO's border, and NATO is a defense alliance, so war in Ukraine is like stomping around next to a hornet's nest (only thing worse would be stomping *on* it), and 2) Russia's problem with Ukraine is clearly - explicitly, in Russia's own tales about its problems - related to Ukraine's interest in NATO, therefore the war is not only *next* to NATO, it's *about* NATO. so of course NATO is ... interested.",False,1646636531.0,t3_t8epak,t1_hzocqih,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

 >The Raid on Sidi Haneish Airfield was a military operation carried out the night of 26 July 1942. A British Special Air Service unit commanded by Major David Stirling attacked a German-held airfield in Egypt during the Western Desert Campaign of Second World War. Several Luftwaffe aircraft used to ferry supplies to the Axis forces were destroyed or damaged with machine-gun fire and explosives.

 >A cluster munition is a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions. Commonly, this is a cluster bomb that ejects explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles. Other cluster munitions are designed to destroy runways or electric power transmission lines, disperse chemical or biological weapons, or to scatter land mines. Some submunition-based weapons can disperse non-munitions, such as leaflets.

For reference, this is the market that caused the 2008 crisis.  People bought credit default swaps from AIG to insure their investments in mortgage backed securities (which were just mortgages bundled together and sold off, where investors got the mortgage payments).  When people started defaulting all at once, all the insurance (swaps) triggered at the same time.  This was made much, much worse when Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy, because this was a company that AIG had sold a ton of protective swaps for.  Even though AIG had a shitload of capital, it wasn't anywhere near enough to pay what they owed on Lehman's defaults on top of all the others, and so AIG was going to go bankrupt.  But that would have meant that every other bank would have declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter, because they were counting on the money from AIG to give them enough capital to stay afloat.

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

If *anyone* had a reason to deliberately release a virus in order to disrupt global civilization, it was Russia. You may have noticed that they have taken advantage of the situation to invade another country and try to take them over. What has China done that indicates that they have used the pandemic to profit in any way.

I ask you to consider the following: The first SARS epidemic started from a wet market in China. It took awhile, but we were able to track down the source, and there were lots of warnings over the years that it could easily happen again. China was so worried about it that they actually focused on researching coronaviruses and trying to track down their sources.

Now, here we have a wonderful setup to implicate China in the outbreak - another wet market, conveniently close to a research institute that specializes in coronaviruses. Release a contagious coronavirus there, and the world will automatically assume that this *second* coronavirus came from there, and accuse China of creating it in the nearby laboratory.

It's interesting to note that we seem to have successfully traced the origin of SARS-1, but, despite some intense searching, and despite the fact that China has spent the years since then searching out coronavirus sources and studying them, we haven't definitely found the source for SARS-2.

Maybe, just *maybe*, that's because the origin is in *Russia*, not *China*.

Their doctrine also tends to favor slow pushes using mass artillery, with resupply points placed ahead of time. They tried a variation of ""shock and awe"" with little to no experience and are now trying to fall back to standard tactics but cannot resupply because they are now trying to resupply everyone at once, and are bringing the supply units in through lightly defended territory where they keep getting ambushed.

Russian supply lines are only effective for around 40 miles, they are now trying to supply troops in the north over a 150 miles away from depots... its not going to go well unless they can establish some sort of supply depot near the front and actually be able to get supplies to that point for redistribution.

Another issue they are going to run into is the way they organize. Western doctrine is something like 40% combat troops, and 60% supply/support. Russians favor combat, to around 70% combat, 30% supply/support, so once they bog down it is very difficult to get supply lines up and running again. This is why they preplace supply points ahead of time. This works well... with the usual tactics of massive bombardment, before taking some ground, then holding that location, waiting for the next objective to be flattened by artillery, repeat.

Basically, Western armies fight surgically supporting multiple engagements at once, including strikes deep into enemy territory. Americans in particular prefer highly mobile fire and maneuver tactics. This makes Western armies very adaptable to changing battlefield conditions as well. Russians are more like a hammer, and cannot effectively maneuver around multiple fronts, because it is not something they really train in. They prefer massed attacks, and defense of key points where they have artillery and forward bases set up so they can make slow but inevitable progress.

For the last year, there has been chatter about an oil supercycle (which is where commodity prices basically explode to record highs in short order - it's more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it).  So there were already concerns.  

But when Russia opened a war, two things happened.  First, it created an increased demand.  Moving material and personnel (especially of a military nature) takes a lot of oil.  Think gas, jet fuel, etc.  Second, it became pretty clear that other countries were going to be pissed and levy sanctions.  When they did, there was (and still is) a risk that Russian oil will be embargoed.  Even Shell - the major company still buying Russian oil - has said that it is really only doing that in the short run so they can supply their buyers and are looking elsewhere for oil.  

Russia produces something like 10% of the world's oil. If anything disrupts that flow, that's a huge negative supply shock (which would drive prices up and exacerbate the issues already ongoing).  So things like oil sanctions, a collapse of the Russian economy that disrupted production, or a prolonged conflict that caused Russia to use more of its own oil would all disrupt supply.  Yes there were already supply problems, but this is layering more issues on top of it.  And when problems add up, they tend to compound rather than adding in a linear fashion.  

While it is possible to produce more oil in the other Petroleum Exporting Countries of the world, there are limits to this - both physical and political - and many of the countries that could do this won't because they benefit from higher prices.  The same oil they produced last year now sells for 2x as much.  Why would they flood the market to drive down prices?  Without a commitment from OPEC that amounts to a massive increase in supply, prices are likely to continue to rise as people anticipate increased scarcity in oil.",False,1646629203.0,t3_t8epak,t1_hzo17vu,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

This is then amplified by networks of automated or semi-automated accounts (like: hundreds of thousands), who spam out likes and follows (or whatever) for what the ""influencer"" posts. 

We all get onto the internet thinking that it's one-man, one-IP address, and everybody has the same chance at speaking up and being heard. ""See? It's not like the old days where we sat and watched talking heads - we actually get to talk back now!""
But in reality, it's far worse, because these loud voices are amplified by unseen forces, and we get this false impression that it's a message or narrative that's somehow more real, or factual, and meritorious of such a following. When it's just straight up bought and manipulated by some of the worst people in the world with some of the worst motives in the world. 

And it's a grossly tilted playing field exactly because of the way Social Media works. And the more money they make off of this, the more attention and engagement they receive, until it's an unstoppable feedback loop.  Before you know it, they're buying politicians and laws, and now: we have politicians playing roles as major social media influencers (think Trump's twitter account - could you imagine if he still had that?).  And now it's ALMOST as if you can't even be a player in politics anymore unless you have a well-followed Twitter account.  Don't have one? No problem! How much money do you have?

People are all worried about Putin, and they're forgetting how he got there. Putin's just a symptom.  The USSR used to play this game with their state-run media, Pravda.

Then funneling money directly from the Russian FSB, via straw donations to the NRA, to US Politicians. (She almost certainly blew Rick Santorum and likely a few others).

shes not even wrong

The experience that you have gone through is in many ways comparable to what happens with domestic violence. Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today’s warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children. Women are again the victims in crime and domestic violence as well. Throughout our hemisphere we have an epidemic of violence against women, even though there is no longer any organized warfare that puts women in the direct line of combat. But domestic violence is now recognized as being the most pervasive human rights violation in the world. Here in El Salvador, according to the statistics gathered by your government, 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted and the number of domestic abuse complaints at just one agency topped 10,000 last year. Between 25 and 50 percent of women throughout Latin America have reportedly been victims of domestic violence.  
  
The problem is all pervasive, but sometimes difficult to see. Every country on earth shares this dark secret. Too often, the women we see shopping at the markets, working at their jobs, caring for their children by day, go home at night and live in fear. Not fear of an invading army or a natural disaster or even a stranger in a dark alley, but fear of the very people — family members — who they are supposed to depend upon for help and comfort. This is the trust-destroying terror that attends every step of a victim of violence. For these women, their homes provide inadequate refuge, the law little protection, public opinion often less sympathy. That’s why we have to say over and over again, as Elizabeth has done and as so many of you have echoed, that violence against women is not simply cultural or a custom. It is simply criminal, a crime. The devastating effects of domestic violence on women are just as dramatic as the effects of war on women. The physical injury, the mental illness, the terrible loss of confidence limits the capacities of women to fulfill their God-given potentials.",False,1646626858.0,t3_t8epak,t1_hznxlt3,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

 >The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing war primarily involving Russia, pro-Russian forces, and Belarus on one side, and Ukraine and its international supporters on the other. Conflict began in February 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity, and focused on the status of Crimea and parts of the Donbas, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The conflict includes the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014), the war in Donbas (2014–present), naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and political tensions. Intentionally concealing its involvement, Russia gave military backing to separatists in the Donbas from 2014 onwards.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Edit: They also reported days ago that the red line had been set up, and the other end was answering. As long as they keep answering, I think we're probably good.

I am concerned about how far Putin is willing to push this, though. He's still destroying huge swaths of Ukraine when he should be talking about a ceasefire. I'm wondering his back-up plan is to continue killing as many Ukrainians as possible in order to destroy their national identity, and cause so much damage that the country can't recover enough to defend itself in a few years when he tries again.

He's probably right that, if he had managed to just walk in and take Ukraine in 3 or 4 days, the rest of the world would have just let it go. Somehow he failed to realize that the West knew he'd be coming back for the rest of Ukraine, after the Crimea thing, and prepared for it. Pretty much had to draw the line at Ukraine, if we didn't want to deal with his expansion elsewhere.

Maybe a lot of his original plan depended on the orange one being in office/remaining in office, and the pandemic and the American voters screwed him over.",1646621678.0,1646621129.0,t3_t8epak,t1_hznldey,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

""Ukraine held the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, including an estimated 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The last strategic nuclear delivery vehicle in Ukraine was eliminated in 2001 under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). It took years of political maneuvering and diplomatic work, starting with the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, to remove the weapons and nuclear infrastructure from Ukraine.""

As for ramping up, the only policy he could give is a massive taxpayer funded subsidy to oil companies to get them to increase production.

Also, oil companies don't want to push into new locations because they're scared of the price drop of 2020 happening again and they'll lose money.

It was crucial for Belarus to swing down and cut off western supply lines very early on. That didn’t happen. Too many Belarusians refused to obey orders, including commanders. As a result, Ukraine’s had one less front to worry about and they’ve been armed to the teeth. And the goods just keep on coming.  
  
As for the bulk of the invasion force: It’s mud season, which has kept Russian convoys conveniently confined to roads. Russia’s logistics has been a total nightmare, their equipment is falling apart, their morale is shot to shit, their commanders keep getting sniped while trying to unfuck their troops, and they’ve been bogged down with fierce resistance almost every step of the way. 

The pace at which Ukraine has destroyed and captured Russian equipment is mind boggling. It’s not sustainable for Russia. That’s likely why we are seeing Russian trains move *very* old unarmored vehicles toward the front; they’re scraping the bottom of the barrel already. 

Hard to say how much longer Russia can sustain combat readiness because the fog of war is very real. But I would be surprised if they can last another 5-7 days. I expect to see more Ukrainian counteroffensives as they maneuver to prevent encirclement, continue disrupting supply lines, etc.  

I don’t know what Putin plans to do if his forces continue to get routed. At some point there needs to be an exit strategy but his ego can’t handle such a concept. And who even knows what his generals are telling him? His inner circle may be too afraid to let him know they’re getting their asses handed to them.

She isn't a completely awful person and she isn't all to blame for the things i mentioned above. Obviously the state that NZ is in, is much deeper than the result of one person. Polluting our country to feed China whilst essentially forcing NZ's economy to rely on China is part of a much bigger plan than Jacinda Adern could have possibly initiated. The framework for becoming in debt to China was set up before her term began. 

But the fact that people buy so deeply into her facade is what gets on my nerve. She smiles for the camera and appeals to every minority and sad story whilst doing nothing for the future of NZ. Which is why I always take the opportunity to remind people she is and always will be a politician (and a fantastic businesswoman) first.

I have plenty of family who live there, (and until recently I lived and worked there) who at first supported her strongly but have come to the realisation that she does not stand for the betterment of the livelihood of New Zealand citizens at all.

 >The ten stages of genocide are an academic model created by Gregory Stanton, the founding president of Genocide Watch, to explain how  genocide develops. The stages are not linear, and several may occur simultaneously. Stanton's stages are a conceptual model for analyzing the events and processes that lead to genocide, and for determining preventive measures. In 1996, Stanton presented a briefing paper called ""The 8 Stages of Genocide"" to the United States Department of State.

* Putin presumably had some type of leverage over Trump and the GOP in general over the DNC which facilitated his pro-Russia rhetoric in the States to take root.

Probably never overtly blackmailing him b/c Trump holds grudges and acts irrationally, and instead making him paltry offers like real estate for more property in Russia w/ his name on it.
* Trump being the paranoid person that he was couldn't involve additional parties outside of guys like Manafort and Bannon to handle this type of work, and by virtue of that they were intelligence savy people who would know fake documentation when they saw it.  So it wouldn't have been hard to start sending Putin disinformation that way.
* Flash forward to the present and despite Putin's puppet no longer being in power, he thinks he has everything he needs to invade Ukraine.

* Now Putin being vain means that he can't rescind the ""special operation"" b/c it will mean that all of his dead soldiers and lost material will mean nothing to those looking for a strongman on the home front.  He can't give up ground in Ukraine either w/o losing face.  He can't even get Belarus, Georgia, or Kazakhstan to send troops b/c they see this horror show and want ZERO part of it.  Meanwhile about 5% of the total invasion force is either dead or wounded in action and can't be used for follow-up operations.  So now he has to bring in mercenaries and the Syrians who really have no idea what they're in for.
* Even if Putin takes over the country now it will be an eternal shit show right on his doorstep.  He can't hold a mass draft b/c that means admitting a lot of soldiers died, and the financial sanctions are going to create chaos from the ground up as supplies and money runs low.

Officially (or on the record) nobody could prove it. Mostly because everyones pulled out of russia by now. 

Now what do you think NATO/UN would look like if there were reports of a nuclear/dirty bomb attack on a major population center and go ""you know. Thats not real. i don't buy it for a second that happened""

The thing that matters is it happened, and unless an investigative agency could confirm or deny officially (not likely considering the only thing left in Russia that could investigate, is a russian agency.) who or what triggered the detonation. Nato/Un/Redcross would be forced to intervene on russia's behalf because you know. A lot of radiation affecting civilians/potentially spilling into India.

the UN by all accounts wouldn't do anything on russia's behalf. instead opting to choose to endlessly kick the can down the street, but at the same time they can't outright imply ""you are doing bad things. its ok for other countries to nuke you"". That would trigger WW3. (although in a more roundabout way)

Instead Nato/UN would be forced to turn a blind eye while russia would get a bonafide freepass to just turn Ukraine into a parking lot. because again, they can't just imply that its ok for russia to get Nuclear attacked by ""proxy actors"" because they are doing things nobody approves of.

Politically speaking a dirty bomb false flag is probably the freest get out of jail free card russia could have in its book of tricks. Nobody would believe it for a second the Ukraines did it, but if the UN/Nato doesn't have hard proof that russia did it to themselves, then they can't condemn russia. Theres a reason why Nato/UN wasn't allowed to take a more active role in preparing Ukraine for its defense in the 2 or so months we were getting intelligence reports that they were getting invaded ""any day now"". The best any country could do was sell them guns and bombs because without official hard proof, they can't jump the gun like that.

It turns out the Russian army is a lot less functional than they wanted the world to believe (and even less than they believed themselves). And it turns out that this time Russia faces harsh 
sanctions. But this is still a terrible situation for Ukraine's future.

The campaign was heralded by the Battle of the Kalka River in May 1223, which resulted in a Mongol victory over the forces of several Rus' principalities. The Mongols retreated, having gathered their intelligence which was the purpose of the reconnaissance-in-force. A full-scale invasion of Rus' by Batu Khan followed, from 1237 to 1242.

It's just not worth the investment for a ""maybe some resources"". For example, the US spent decades in Afghanistan, throwing away trillions fighting a much weaker, less equipped insurgency which drained so much from the U.S that resulted in Taliban returning anyway.

And while China is not allied with Russia, they are on neutral/friendly terms, meaning they need Russia's support if they are to fight off future competition with the west on other stances, which is why they've been trying to tip-toe around the invasion.

But even if they end up in an armed conflict, weakened or not, it is still an armed conflict. Meaning more resources need to be diverted for military logistics and support. They haven't had an armed conflict since the 70s. All of this takes resources away from developing infrastructure, economy, and other things within the country itself - an issue that Russia had for decades, and why it declined into a Soviet slum, while China raised millions out of poverty.

Russia's most valuable resource is still currently oil, and while that's great, China is heavily moving towards renewable energy. It's also nowhere near territories China can easily access again without a huge investment in resources to secure, invade, drill, then build infrastructure to transport across thousands of kilometres of hostile winter tundra...

China is playing both sides of this conflict and watching eagerly to see what comes of this. If we don’t somehow support democracy in Ukraine because our sanctions backfire, they could take it as evidence that the West is reluctant to push back against territorial ambitions. China could decide to more aggressively expand their reach into the South China Sea, prop up their de facto sphere of influence in the Himalayas and Subsaharan Africa, and continue posturing against Australia, India, and Japan while buying out sympathetic puppet leaders. Things could cascade and then we end up with a legitimate crisis around Taiwan and or the Korean Peninsula where geopolitics are the most tenuous.

We need to make sure that Putin’s strategy cannot work against the democratic world… or China WILL rear its head and do the same thing, but FAR more effectively.

EDIT: I see what you’re saying. I guess I am willing to watch gas prices go up for this war; the precedent of watching a pro-NATO country fall would just be infinitely worse long term than the stagflation we’re seeing now.

Elaborate on how that wouldn’t escalate things into becoming worse when Putin has been extremely clear and vocal about any involvement from NATO would be considered acts of war in his eyes and would face severe retaliation. What does he mean by that?

Even he doesn’t use nukes, it would still lead to war with many more countries involved. Many more people dying. Much more destruction. Intercontinental missiles aren’t just nuclear.

I'm aware that the idea of Russia running out of gas is insane. 

But, they told Korean Air that they couldn't refuel their commercial aircraft in Moscow due to ""sanctions,"" which makes no sense because sanctions should mean that Russia has more fuel. It's definitely a lie, but why?

They're also shutting down all international air travel of Russian flag airlines, nominally to make sure the aircraft aren't seized, but that shit isn't gonna happen in Kazakhstan or India or Pakistan.  The only international flights are in and out of Belarus and Kaliningrad. 

Russia's Air Force being largely absent also seems to tie into this theory, as well as the first and most consistent logistical failure of their ground forces being fuel for their vehicles.

If they do anything nuclear, I’d expect a series of dirty bomb attacks. At this point the rhetoric is entirely divorced from reality, but they seem to have the nuke plant (also useful for fucking with electrical supplies) and be pushing the “Ukraine is building a dirty bomb here oogity boogity boo” line (how dare they make weapons with fissile material!? even should one attempt to take it seriously). That would help achieve a few strategic goals (clear an area permanently, advance quickly, deny enemy ability to retake), plus twist that ol’ Chernobyl knife (because that was basically a big fuckin’ dirty bomb the USSR set off in Ukraine).

I mean they can build a space shuttle, im sure they know how to refine oil.  


>It's definitely a lie, but why?

That one seems kinda obvious. i think its just a way to say ""see you are not only punishing Russia with these sanctions, all sorts of innocent people/countries are effected""  


>They're also shutting down all international air travel of Russian flag airlines

That could just be an excuse to keep some sort of martial law going and prevent too many people (ie troublemakers) coming and going from Russia   


>Russia's Air Force being largely absent also seems to tie into this theory, as well as the first and most consistent logistical failure of their ground forces being fuel for their vehicles.

The best two theories ive heard on this are the following;

&#x200B;

1. They dont want to embarrass themselves by demonstrating that their ""new modern upgrade airforce"" is actually ineffective and they dont really have the command and control/pilots/bombs or whatever to do what they are claiming it can do.  

2. They are simply not wanting to, as you say, waste fuel. (or bombs or whatever) and dont feel like they are really needed yet.  


The reason for number two could be quite disturbing.  


For example if you thought this localized conflict could turn into ww3. You might decide its better to keep these planes ready to go against Euro/USA rather than waste too many smart bombs and fuel on ukraine.  


Or maybe its just knowing that they are facing decades of embargos, they are trying to be conservative in their usage of limited resources.  


The cost of running around the clock combat air patrols all over ukraine might just not be worth it.

&#x200B;

Russia certainly doesnt have Americas war chest.  


They might be going slower to save money and i also think they will be trying to avoid a massive spike in ukrainian deaths that could force euro to intervein.  


If they went balls to the wall in the first week, and killed 100k soldiers, or lost 100k soldiers, it wouldnt be popular, at home or internationally.  


But spread these deaths over 6 months and it becomes easier to manage and harder to draw that line when ""something has to be done""  


kind of like a decade in iraq causing thousands of innocent deaths.
