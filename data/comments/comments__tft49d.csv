Day 21 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today the sound of explosions and planes flying close by just doesn’t stop, and even right now I’m hearing it non-stop. Some shelling landed around 600-700 meters from my home and it was really loud, hopefully it didn’t kill anybody, but there are apartment buildings everywhere around where it landed so it might have broken some windows.

Even though we are being shelled non-stop there are still a lot of people around, in the morning you can see hundreds if not thousands of people going to the stores, there are queues almost everywhere, especially in the morning, cars are still driving in the streets, but their current number is incomparable with pre-war numbers.

Then around 3-4 pm when it’s still not the time for curfew, streets just suddenly die out, they are completely empty, it looks so bizarre. City starts looking abandoned, but that’s just how it looks. A lot of people didn’t evacuate, they either stayed inside their homes like us or they moved to the basements/shelters or to the subway, and subway gets completely sealed off from the outside world at 6 pm when curfew starts, you can’t enter or leave after that until they reopen it again in the morning.

>It’s Day 21 of the invasion, and there are a few significant updates:

>First, the Pentagon assesses today that Russian warships are now shelling areas around Odessa, a major port city in southwestern Ukraine. 

>Other naval activity also has increased, with Russian landing craft moving around but not going ashore, the senior defense official said.

>It’s still unclear if Russia will attempt an amphibious landing on or near Odessa. Russia launched one amphibious landing farther east early in the landing, but it was small and on an uncontested shoreline, the senior defense official said.

>For the first time, the Pentagon assesses Wednesday that Russia is discussing sending “replacement troops” to backfill for combat losses. It sees no indications yet that any have moved yet, the senior defense official said. Open-source reports suggest that some already may have.

>On weapons deliveries: The Pentagon declines to say what drones it is delivering but calls them “tactical” in nature.

>Knowing that many tactical drones are single-use and kamikaze in nature, I asked if it’s possible more could be delivered in rolling fashion, like Javelin missiles are. 

>“I wouldn’t rule it out,” the senior defense official said.

>Advance north of Kyiv is still stalled. Cities that were isolated still are. Ukraine is still in control of Brovary, a town to Kyiv’s east where fierce fighting has occurred, senior defense official says.

>More than 980 Russian missiles have been launched since the war begin, the senior defense official says. That number continues to climb by several dozen per day.

>It’s “safe to assume” that @SecDef
 will be asking Slovakian and Bulgarian officials this week what Soviet/Russian systems they may be willing to provide to Ukraine, the senior defense official says. 

>Some countries may have concerns about giving their own systems away, he adds.

>“I know that everyone is focused on the S-300, but there are lots of different air-defense systems” that could be provided to Ukraine, senior defense official says, declining to name them.

>No appreciable change in how much Ukraine and Russia are flying in the war, senior defense official says. 

>To date, Ukraine is flying a handful of sorties per day and Russia has been flying about 200, though some do not cross into Ukrainian airspace.

>Finally: Two reporters raised the lack of media access to U.S. military units deployed in eastern Europe in response to Russia's buildup and invasion of Ukraine.

>Senior defense official says ""I appreciate the question,"" but that he has no change in media posture to share.

>Footnote there: A couple of journalists did briefly visit U.S. troops in eastern Europe countries recently while traveling with Gen. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Nothing any longer than that in duration has materialized so far.

People are quite rightly pointing out his Stalinist style plans, but I think there is another, subtler influence: East Germany.

Putin spent a deal of time there in his KGB years and one thing the Stasi had over the USSR was its ability to make German citizens do their job for them.

People could be compelled through fear to turn on their neighbours. Sometimes it was ideology, sometimes to settle a grievance. What matters here is that it was *state sanctioning of oppressing your countrymen for the greater cause*

Putin has sown all these seeds in his speech. The fear your neighbours may be watching you with suspicion, the idea of Russias destiny, mentioning the rich, targets of ire and envy of ordinary people....  

He knows that once sanctions bite hard, people will become increasingly desperate. And people who are suspicious and fearful of each other are less of a challenge to authority. They can be persuaded to do heinous things for their own survival.

>Gen Breedlove talks about how Ukrainians knocked out escape routes for stuck Russian trucks: “Those tanks are never coming out of those holes. They’re a monument there.”

> Biden’s announcement of further help for Ukraine’s military, which the Pentagon valued at $1bn, fell short of Zelensky’s request for the US and Nato to embrace a no-fly zone or directly supply fighter jets to the country.

> “They’re designed to deliver a punch,” said a senior US defence official of the 100 drones to be delivered, adding the new aid package includes anti-aircraft and anti-armour missiles needed by Ukrainian forces.

And it makes sense why, they likely have a friend dying and/or are close to someone who knows someone dying due to the war and have also traveled the world and know what Russia's leadership really is.

In order to put this in the bag, it seems like Putin would have to mobilize the entire country into war mode. And I don't mean just isolating their economy, but turning the entire population into willing soldiers ready to die for the cause.

So far his so called reasons and justifications for war don't seem like they will be very useful for getting the young, internet savvy citizens ready to die for this cause and apparently the youth only support the war at around 30%.

So he doesn't have the rich, he doesn't have the youth behind him, he only has 35+ adults who are usually the last to be drafted and sent to war.

If he uses nukes on Ukraine, he opens a Pandora's box that would decimate Russia militarily and hopefully not end the world exchange. I don't believe Putin has the sole power to launch nukes AND if he tried I think he knows he would quickly be removed from power.

Even the soldiers surrounding Kyiv sure as hell are likely not prepared for the amount of bloodshed it would realistically take to take the city. The foreign fighters he has hired have even less reasons.

His only way out is the removal of the Ukrainian president, who because of his own actions, is now a fucking international icon and hero.

So, we don't fight under our own flag. We fight under the flag of the United Nations through the UN Peacekeeping force. And before you say Russia could veto it, let me inform you about [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_377):

> United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 377 A,[1] the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution, states that in any cases where the Security Council, because of a lack of unanimity among its five permanent members (P5), fails to act as required to maintain international peace and security, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately and may issue appropriate recommendations to UN members for collective measures, including the use of armed force when necessary, in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.[2] The resolution was designed to provide the UN with an alternative avenue for action when at least one P5 member is using its veto to obstruct the Security Council from carrying out its functions mandated by the UN Charter.

The [resolution](https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/ufp/ufp.html) allows the GA to take direct action, including military action under the UN flag and command (UNC) when necessary. Nobody has a veto in the GA:

> ""Obviously, the crucial element of resolution 377 A (V) was the affirmation that the General Assembly may, if deemed appropriate by it, recommend collective action, including the use of force.""

There is precedent for this. The above resolution was during the Korean War. United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 recommended UN member states to provide assistance to South Korea in the Korean War to repel the attack by North Korea and restore peace and security.

The fact that Russia mentioned they would agree with a Sweden or Austria type neutrality its a clear sign they are desperate to get out of Ukraine asap and that is for clear reasons.

1. Sweden and Austria are not neutral. Switzerland is technically neutral but Sweden and Austria aren't. Both Sweden and Austria are part of the European Union which has a mutual defense clause simmilar to NATO. Please see it below. The clause states that in case one EU member gets attacked every other EU member must come to its defense with all of its capabilities. That means countries like France, Italy, Sweden, Greece etc will all defend ukraine in case of an attack by Russia. And yes France is a nuclear power with nukes. Also quite hilariously almost all EU members are NATO members so in case any of them gets attacked NATO equipment will be used against Russia. And I am 100% certain if Russia will attack a EU member, EU armies will be around moscow in like 2 weeks (depending on weather). From a military perspective the EU is basicly NATO without the USA, Canada and UK, which means that although its weaker than nato its still more than enough to take on troll second world countries like Russia whose main strats are zerg rushes.

[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:mutual\_defence#:\~:text=This%20clause%20provides%20that%20if,binding%20on%20all%20EU%20countries](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:mutual_defence#:~:text=This%20clause%20provides%20that%20if,binding%20on%20all%20EU%20countries).

2.      Ukraine joining the EU will guarantee it will have a clear path to join NATO immediately afterwards since Russia will not be able to enforce any treaty. Even if ukraine signs a treaty with Russia stating that it won't join NATO, the moment they will join the EU they will be able to to rip it off immediately since if Russia would attack them while in the EU all of the EU countries will defend ukraine and given how Russia can barely handle ukraine by itself I seriously doubt it can handle all EU countries at once. So it will be an unenforceable treaty.

3. What the cowardly little genocidal bastard Putin is aiming for is for a short term ""save face solution"" to make him look though in his last years of his reign and of his life. He knows the average Russian is dumb enough to not realize that the EU is also a defensive alliance so the Russians at home will perceive this as a concession by the west. By the time the EU will prop up Ukr enough for it to be a stable state and join NATO, Putin will be retired (he stated he wants to take a backseat role in 2024) or maybe even dead so his successor will be left to decide on whether or not they would want to take on the entire European Union by himself. If Putin will be alive in his typical cowardly way he will say to his successor ""dunno dude they weren't joining NATO when I was in power you figure it out!"".",1647479614.0,1647479384.0,t3_tft49d,t3_tft49d,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

They even numbered the theorized future superpowers! The first world, the second world, and the third world. India was supposed to be the superpower that the Third World revolves around. (China was little more than an enormous numbers of subsistence farmers).


The theory that three superpowers would be stable imagined the weaker two always allying against the strongest, alliances changing as soon as a new most powerful superpower started to emerge.



It’s all complete horse shit, of course, and every country big and small are all up in each-others spheres of influence all the time and nobody cares who spheres on who the most. But a lot of that kind of thinking is still very common, especially among world leaders. 



I do think it explains what’s going on with India a bit. They want to be a super-power in their own right, on their own terms. Which is understandable, but also kind of dumb. No country in their right mind should want to be a ‘super-power’ super-power.

So here is what concerns me, he's losing, his troops are stalled, getting ambushed and generally not making any progress besides launching artillery randomly into populated cities. Literally not even going for strategic positions, just trying to level cities at this point because that's all they've got. 

This leads me to believe he WILL eventually use chemical weapons and unconventional means (possibly nuclear) to get his way.

Key points since it is paywalled:

>The reality might look like this: Putin will raze Ukrainian cities to the ground and continue targeting civilians with terror tactics and blockades, but he will never break the resistance completely. A bloody, drawn-out conflict might do to Russia what the war in Afghanistan did to the Soviet Union, but the most harm will be to the people of Ukraine. The question is whether inflicting this level of damage would effectively achieve one of Putin’s objectives: making Ukraine too unstable to accept into either the E.U. or NATO. And would a long war in Ukraine sufficiently weaken Russia economically and militarily to deter Putin from future targets such as Finland, Sweden and ex-Soviet republics? Of course, different outcomes are potentially feasible with different constraints. Ukrainian people and their government have been vocal in calling for better alternatives from both Russia and the West — including President Volodymyr Zelensky’s videos appealing directly to the Russian people and pleading for a no-fly zone. But Russia and Putin remain steadfast in continuing the war, and NATO has been determined to limit its involvement.

>The reason for the persistent fantasy of overthrowing Putin is that it’s psychologically easier to dream than it is to acknowledge that the West’s second-best outcome could involve destroying Ukraine. But this is not fair to the millions of Ukrainians who are risking their lives to stand up for democracy and the right to self-determination. The least we can do for them is to stop clinging to the fantasy that the “Putin problem” will resolve itself as easily as a 3-year-old’s game. We need to start thinking seriously and creatively through the second-best outcomes, which of them are acceptable to us — and at what humanitarian cost.",False,1647470613.0,t3_tft49d,t3_tft49d,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

About the operation in Ukraine

Russia launched an operation in Ukraine to help the residents of Donbass, who for eight years ""were subjected to real genocide,"" and to disrupt the offensive plans of Kiev, which was preparing ""for a scenario of force, bloodbath and ethnic cleansing."" Ukraine's pursuit of nuclear weapons also posed a real threat.

A limited intervention in the Donbass would not lead to peace, but would create a ""new front line"": ""We had no other option for self-defense < ... >, except for a special military operation. And all the tasks set, of course, will be solved.""

""Our guys, soldiers and officers show courage and heroism, do everything that depends on them to avoid losses among the civilian population of Ukrainian cities."" The Ukrainian authorities ""beat indiscriminately, in squares, with fanaticism and frenzy of the doomed,"" ""like fascists who in the last days of the Third Reich tried to drag with them to the grave as many innocent victims as possible.""

About sanctions

In any case, the West would impose sanctions against Moscow: ""It's just about the reasons. The policy of containment, weakening of Russia, including through economic isolation, blockade, is a conscious long-term strategy."" At the same time, the West no longer hides that they are trying to strike ""at every family, at every citizen of Russia.""

Sanctions have hit the West itself, including undermining its credibility. By freezing Russia's reserves, the U.S. and the European Union ""declared a real default"" to Moscow, and ""now everyone knows that financial reserves can simply be stolen."" Their actions have also become a lesson for Russian business - ""there is nothing more reliable than investing in your own country.""

At the same time, the sanctions did not achieve results: ""It was not possible to organize an economic blitzkrieg against Russia, demoralize our society, take us by snoring.""

About the ""fifth column""

The West is trying to split Russian society, betting ""on the so-called fifth column, on national traitors, on those who earn money here, in our country, but live there, and ""live"" not even in the geographical sense of the word, but according to their thoughts, according to their slave consciousness.""

""I am not at all judging those who have a villa in Miami or on the French Riviera, who cannot do without foie gras, oysters or so-called gender freedoms < ... > This, in their opinion, is the sign of belonging to the ""upper caste"", to the ""superior race"". Such people are ready to sell their mother, if only they were allowed to sit in the hallway at this highest caste < ... > But they forget or do not understand at all that this so-called upper caste needs them, if at all, as expendable material to use them to inflict maximum damage on our people.""

The Russian people will always be able to distinguish ""true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like a midge accidentally flew into their mouths, spit them out on the panel.""

Many countries have resigned themselves to ""living with their backs bent and obsequiously accepting all the decisions of their sovereign,"" but Russia will never be ""in such a pathetic and humiliated state"": ""The struggle we are waging is a struggle for our sovereignty, for the future of our country and our children. We will fight for the right to be and remain Russia.""

On the restructuring of the economy

""It is obvious that the ongoing events draw a line under the global dominance of Western countries both in politics and in the economy. Moreover, they question the economic model that has been imposed on developing countries in recent decades, and indeed on the world in general.""

""The Russian economy is necessarily adapting to the new realities <... > Of course, in the new realities, deep structural changes in our economy will be required, and, I will not hide it, they will be difficult, will lead to a temporary increase in inflation and unemployment. In this situation, our task is to minimize such risks.""

Now the authorities must ensure the availability of essential goods and medicines, as well as reduce poverty and inequality in the country: ""This is a feasible task even today."" Even under sanctions, Russia has enough revenues not to resort to emission, ""the central bank will not need to print money.""

About foreign companies

""We appreciate the position of those foreign companies that < ... > continue to work in our country. In the future, they will definitely receive additional opportunities for development.""

""We also know those who cowardly betrayed their partners < ... > At the same time, unlike Western countries, we will respect property rights.""

About the Russian response

In the near future, the authorities will increase the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum, the salaries of state employees and all social payments, including benefits and pensions. Measures to support people who have lost their jobs will also be expanded.

Private business will be freed from unjustified administrative barriers: ""We must respond to external pressure with maximum entrepreneurial freedom and support for business initiative."" In addition, advance payments on state contracts will be at least 50% (the government is working on an increase of up to 80%), and entrepreneurs will have access to financing from development institutions.

The regions will receive additional powers, the Ministry of Finance will open credit lines for them in the amount of 10% of the income of a particular subject of the Federation. The volume of infrastructure loans will be maintained and, if necessary, increased. The regions will also be exempt from payments on budget loans this year, and payments on commercial loans, if necessary, will be replaced by budget loans.",1647465610.0,1647465451.0,t3_tft49d,t3_tft49d,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

If the Russian re supply and logistical issues are as bad as they are made out to be, then we are coming to a crucial point in this conflict.

They either

A. Negotiate a settlement with Ukraine, get what they can like no NATO, getting Crimea, Donbas independence and save face. Maybe try to get the war criminal thing to go away and sanctions lifted.

B.  Re supply either by unknown or known resources and actors such as other allied countries besides China or from China itself under the table and continue invasion at current pace.

C. Get frustrated by lack of progress combined witj critical logistical issues and resort to higher end weaponry such as fuel air or tactical nuke. Unlikely, but they have made the threat alot. Faced with either retreating with nothing or doubling down using a WMD, which do you think he will do. I think it's unlikely, but they sure threaten it alot.

D. I guess they could theoretically retreat with notbing but I wouldn't count on it. Would shatter his image.

Hopefully its A and they make a deal they can all live with. I get it that it sucks for Ukraine, but it stops this madness and stops the killing. I don't blame Ukraine for not wanting to give them shit. If the Russians get the slightest concession from Ukraine, it's a victory and reward for their actions in invading Ukraine. Yeah they didn't get the whole thing but they got more than they had, so it's a win however you look at it which really sucks. It will encourage them to do it again. 

Even though it's a hard pill for Ukraine, it's the best thing for the rest of the world in the sense it stops this thing from spreading into a larger possibly global conflict.

However, if it worked once, it will work again, so the threat will always be there as long as Russia is there in its current state and format.",False,1647490219.0,t3_tft49d,t1_i0z6wvj,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

NATO couldn't intervene directly because NATO countries fight under their own flag, which could lead to nuclear escalation in the worst case scenario.

So, we don't fight under our own flag. We fight under the flag of the United Nations through the UN Peacekeeping force. And before you say Russia could veto it, let me inform you about [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_377):

> United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 377 A,[1] the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution, states that in any cases where the Security Council, because of a lack of unanimity among its five permanent members (P5), fails to act as required to maintain international peace and security, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately and may issue appropriate recommendations to UN members for collective measures, including the use of armed force when necessary, in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.[2] The resolution was designed to provide the UN with an alternative avenue for action when at least one P5 member is using its veto to obstruct the Security Council from carrying out its functions mandated by the UN Charter.

The [resolution](https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/ufp/ufp.html) allows the GA to take direct action, including military action under the UN flag and command (UNC) when necessary. Nobody has a veto in the GA:

> ""Obviously, the crucial element of resolution 377 A (V) was the affirmation that the General Assembly may, if deemed appropriate by it, recommend collective action, including the use of force.""

There is precedent for this. The above resolution was during the Korean War. United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 recommended UN member states to provide assistance to South Korea in the Korean War to repel the attack by North Korea and restore peace and security. United Nations Security Council Resolution 84 established a [United Nations Command
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command) that still exists.

If they see strong public support for intervention, on the other hand, they’ll conclude that NATO’s current line is the best Russia can hope for and they won’t push it.

My personal opinion is that civilians have always been, and always will be, casualties in wartime. It’s the devastating truth. There’s no shortage of genocide in recent history. And the bigger this war gets, the more civilians will die.

The ONLY way to end civilian casualties is to end the war, and preferably end it for good. Part of me hopes that the western sanctions and military aid are a “long term” strategy to ensure that, despite what happens in Ukraine, Russia won’t have the capability to wage war for at least another 5 generations.

It’s disgusting that we live in a world where civilian casualties are made into a statistic that people have to sit around and decide what’s acceptable and what isn’t.

Air superiority *is* how you make progress on the battlefield in a modern war. Multi-unit coordination is very dependent upon the ability to get over targets and hammer them and then leave. Air support opens opportunities for ground units to make their way to AA and other suppressing forces which limit the viability of sortie effectiveness. 

For fucks sake, people should *really* trust Ukraine when it says it needs something. They don’t want jets so they can just sit there and look at them, they need more jets because right now they are only flying between 5 and 10 sorties a day, which is not even close to enough.

People everywhere keep bringing up the fact that they have a majority of their fixed wing craft sitting, but what they keep being utterly unaware of is that these craft need to be maintained constantly which puts them out of commission for a time, and in order to be truly effective they need a consistent sortie ratio to fully support their air efforts. Without a concerted effort to maintain momentum with air support, they are better off used more sparingly until they can get a proper number of these in the sky and doing their job, otherwise they become AA fodder.

Realistically Russia will either keep going and get a pyrrhic victory, or they'll have so little support at home and in the ranks that they'll end up negotiating a peace agreement that accomplishes little for them geopolitically but manages to save face among the propaganda addled people in Russia. 

Where the line is on ""always Putin"" individuals who will eat up whatever the Kremlin offers is, i don't know. But once they get to a point where the number of people on the Kremlin propaganda truck is barely enough to maintain current power structures they'll get way more desperate. 

And back to my original point: either that desperation means military force to win the war outright as fast as possible or it means concessions and a peace agreement of some sort.

Right now they don't really need to make a major push because Russia is imploding. Between literally being stuck in the mud and out of fuel, there's no reason to go after those troops until they move closer. That said, they are doing small scale ambushes, which makes more sense (keeps the Ukrainians more protected and is pretty demoralizing). 

Final point, a good portion of the weapons can be used at a distance (NLAWs, Javelins, etc) or drones. Russia still thinks we're in the 1940's, plus they're the invaders, so they're going a more traditional style with this invasion. I'd be suicidal for Ukraine to face them head-on, they're much better off laying traps for the Russians and relying on advanced weapons.

The absolute best case for him if he loses power is that he gets to go to The Hague next to Milosevic for the rest of his life.

Between him and Aleksandr Dugin, the picture I'm seeing is maybe better framed as something close to a ""holy war"" from the Russian perspective.  The whole linked article is worth a read (it's not particularly comforting).  Here's a fun extract:

> “Perhaps Jesus’ most remembered commandment is to love one’s enemy, from the Gospel of Matthew: “Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” Ilyin maintained that the opposite was meant. Properly understood, love meant totality. It did not matter whether one individual tries to love another individual. The individual only loved if he was totally subsumed in the community. To be immersed in such love was to struggle “against the enemies of the divine order on earth.” Christianity actually meant the call of the right-seeing philosopher to apply decisive violence in the name of love. Anyone who failed to accept this logic was himself an agent of Satan: “He who opposes the chivalrous struggle against the devil is himself the devil.” Thus theology becomes politics. The democracies did not oppose Bolshevism, but enabled it, and must be destroyed. The only way to prevent the spread of evil was to crush middle classes, eradicate their civil society, and transform their individualist and universalist understanding of law into a consciousness of national submission. Bolshevism was no antidote to the disease of the middle classes, but rather the full irruption of their disease. Soviet and European governments must be swept away by violent coups d’état. Ilyin used the word Spirit (Dukh) to describe the inspiration of fascists. The fascist seizure of power, he wrote, was an “act of salvation.” The fascist is the true redeemer, since he grasps that it is the enemy who must be sacrificed. Ilyin took from Mussolini the concept of a “chivalrous sacrifice” that fascists make in the blood of others. (Speaking of the Holocaust in 1943, Heinrich Himmler would praise his SS-men in just these terms.)”

These are some dumb motherfuckers who are living not on this or any possible Earth.  Doesn't matter how sophisticated or cunning they are, they are fundamentally divorced from anything consistent or reproducible.  At the core is an ideology that references but rejects observable reality, which might be why lying is so natural.  But that particular part of their game seems to be known now, along with quite a bit of its effectiveness (I hope).  I wouldn't count on them being rational actors though in the sense that they wouldn't use nukes.  Do you see any evidence of respect for life?

Hope they all get squeegee'd off the face of the earth (Putin and cohorts, not the Russian people).  Then we can breathe a sigh of relief and focus on the next thing.",False,1647466585.0,t3_tft49d,t1_i0xpual,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Is that obvious? I don't speak the language, but they don't look concerned or otherwise under duress. In the videos which were not press conferences but were just soldier talking to surrendered soldier (the early conscripts) they did not seem at all under duress (which is weird honestly).

It's different because they behave differently? Because Ukraine doesn't have a reputation for torturing, murdering, spying on, and just generally shooting in the back their own citizens as the Soviet Union did?

I do think many people underrate the possibility, I'll say that much. I could see putin using them essentially as a show of his ""greater resolve"". Once he and Russia are already pariahs, the incentive to say ""you will fear me, one way or another"" becomes very strong. The fact that people treat it as so unthinkable becomes part of the incentive. How would westerners react? I suspect a lot of people who currently talk boldly would say ""I don't actually care about Ukraine all that much, actually!"". Similarly, it could be a way to weaken NATO. to call the bluff of the west that we would really go to war with a nuclear power over Latvia. 

Rather than a small nuke on the battlefield, we would more likely see something like.. a large nuke over the black sea in view of, say, Odessa.

 >The Great Purge or the Great Terror (Russian: Большой террор), also known as the Year of '37 (37-ой год, Tridtsat sedmoi god) and the Yezhovshchina ('period of Yezhov'), was Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin's campaign to solidify his power over the party and nation; the purges were also designed to remove the remaining influence of Leon Trotsky as well as other political rivals within the party. It occurred from August 1936 to March 1938. Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924 a power vacuum opened in the Communist Party. Various established figures in Lenin's government attempted to succeed him.

Russia wants Belarus to join the fight.  Russia wants to claim that Ukraine (a country currently engaged in a fight for their continued existence) is provoking Belarus.  It doesn't make any sense for Ukraine to do such a thing, AND the overwhelming majority of Ukraine's air force remains grounded due to Russian anti-air.

The Belarusian president isn't taking the bait, so far.  Lukashenko is claiming that NATO is threatening Belarus by deploying troops along Belarus's western border.  It's true that NATO is deploying additional forces along Poland's eastern border, but their purpose is to dissuade Belarus / Russia from trying to attack a NATO country.

Lukashenko is using the NATO forces in eastern Poland as a justification to keep the bulk of his forces far away from Ukraine, and on Belarus's western border.  Perhaps that was part of the intention of deploying forces to Poland... to give Lukashenko a political reason to keep his forces deployed along the Poland / Belarus border.

Given Russia's abysmal performance in Ukraine, I'm willing to bet that Lukashenko will do everything he can to avoid getting involved.  **Had Russia** been successful in their blitz, AND if the economic sanctions remained minimal, I would have said Belarus might get involved.  But Lukashenko's political calculus has to have changed given the severe sanctions plus the stiff Ukrainian defense.

 >The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943), was a major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II where Nazi Germany and its allies unsuccessfully fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (later renamed to Volgograd) in Southern Russia. The battle was marked by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the Second World War and is one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare, with an estimated 2 million total casualties.

 >The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, informally known as the Iraq Resolution, is a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress in October 2002 as Public Law No. 107-243, authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein's Iraq government in what would be known as Operation Iraqi Freedom.
 
**[War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution)** 
 
 >The War Powers Resolution (also known as the War Powers Resolution of 1973 or the War Powers Act) (50 U.S.C. ch. 33) is a federal law intended to check the U.S. president's power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of the U.S. Congress. The resolution was adopted in the form of a United States congressional joint resolution. It provides that the president can send the U.S. Armed Forces into action abroad only by declaration of war by Congress, ""statutory authorization"", or in case of ""a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces"".

Just because they have a million men available does not mean all 1 mil are going to march into an invading territory. You don't send janitors or administrative staff into combat. You don't give sailors artillery and tell them to march across a border. So it's absurd to see a number like that and go ""that's how many boots they can put on the ground"".

Georgia had 37,000 active troops in their army and 800,000 reserves. That's nearly the same standing capacity as UA had before Russia stormed in. If Russia were to counter active troops alone, they'd need to send nearly 2-1 defenders out of Ukraine into Georgia, somewhere in the range of 70-80k active troops. That's a huge swath of the invasion force gone just to hold Georgia.

One plan assumed a surprise attack on the Soviet forces stationed in Germany to ""impose the will of the Western Allies"" on the Soviets.

Each of the defeated powers were required to make payments in either cash or kind. Because of the financial situation in Austria, Hungary, and Turkey after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled. Bulgaria, having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled.

Someone in Russia is going to be thinking that is it worth keeping him in power as the rest of the country goes to shit. If it comes down to it and the Russians do kick him out they're likely to trade his ass for a lifting of restrictions on the Russian Economy.

The west has not attacked Russia, Russia has attacked it's neighbour attempting to kill their government and when they failed started killing innocents out of pure spite. The west has cut the Russian's off economically from as much as possible because of what Russia has done and they're trying to do everything they can outside of armed conflict of helping Ukraine by providing as much of an economic lifeline as possible to keep them in the fight.

Russia is boxed in, they haven't got the resources to continue this, every day that passes more damage is done to Russia while Ukraine endures. They cannot general mobilisation, their logistics are in shambles, the people would cop on quickly and refuse to fight and doing so would cause NATO to escalate because it would be forcing them to raise their alert too.

Nukes are not happening, the west wont fire first but if the Russians do the end result is the Glassing of Russia: A nightmare that NOONE with any sanity would want to see realised, the Russian's nuclear capability is just as questionable as the rest of their forces and it's a bluff they do not want to try and use.

 >Richard Wayne Penniman (December 5, 1932 – May 9, 2020), known professionally as Little Richard, was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was an influential figure in popular music and culture for seven decades. Described as ""the architect of rock and roll"", Richard's most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his charismatic showmanship and dynamic music, characterized by frenetic piano playing, pounding back beat and raspy shouted vocals, laid the foundation for rock and roll. Richard's innovative emotive vocalizations and uptempo rhythmic music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk.

But yes, people are celebrating. Why? Because it means the sanctions are working. There's a clear logical path here: Sanctions are chosen among many choices as the most realistic option. They're not symbolic. They're a political and military strategy meant to achieve an end: Russia's defeat and the end of the war. Russians 'suffering' (by merely not enjoying the massively inflated standard of living of the 21st century global economy, not by starving and being killed) is literally the goal. Let me repeat: suffering (to a nonlethal, loss of luxury degree) is explicitly the goal. It means the strategy is achieving its objective, which is to diminish the Russian economy (which directly affects its ability to wage illegal war on many neighbors) and to diminish the credibility of Putin's regime (which indirectly affects it).

So people are cheering a strategy that is part of the war achieving its desired end. It's really no more complicated. People in other threads are cheering the severed half of a Russian tank commander being tossed across a road in 1080p. That's considerably more ghoulish, imo, but still, the psychology is the same.

 >Borscht (English:   (listen)) is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word ""borscht"" is most often associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, and cabbage borscht.

Same with the Russian public. If they're out in hundreds of thousands and they keep it up, Russia doesn't have enough jails. If you start rioting and wrecking infrastructure, they can't fix it and they're obviously out of control and that makes for more enthusiastic protestors.

That's speculation and no one can read Putin's mind or indeed the minds of NATO allies. A large scale nuclear exchange is hopefully off the table but I do think a small scale use localized to Ukraine to force capitulation makes some sense if I were a Russian analyst looking at thousands of dead troops and the possibility of gridlock on the front.

That said, there are two educational points that aren't repeated enough: in the event that Russia nukes a random Ukrainian city, I'm afraid the west's response will be largely the same as it is now... Increased arms shipments and further cutting off of Russia from the world.

In the absolutely bonkers idea of a global nuclear exchange: life will actually go on. The world won't end. Nuclear weapons are way more localized than most people think. It's probably good people think they are more powerful than they are from a geopolitical perspective but I've literally seen people argue a single nuke would take out a state. It's fantasy, they are large bombs with some longer term consequences of usage. The world will go on, it will just be shittier than it was before.

Apparently nothing else matters in this world except for your toddler.

I swear to Christ, this species will never get off this stupid fucking rock becauses the apes on this pathetic little mudball  fail to grasp that their fates are intertwined.  If the West fails to truly intervene in Ukraine, the lesson to be learned is that nuclear weapons guarantees security.

There are many things that can happen but the best case scenario is that we make this war so costly Putin will have to pull out worst case scenario Ukraine gets nuked by a desperate Putin I have no clue how NATO would respond in that regard I don’t think NATO would end the world over a nuke dropped on Ukraine
