Russia is using their typical braindead tactics of shelling a defensive position out of existence because they cannot storm it or go around. As a result, Ukraine loses defensive positions, but Russia cannot advance. The gray area expands larger and larger.

The area East of Avdiivka is a huge gray area. Ukraine and Russia move around there a lot, but the line doesn’t change much. This is why sometimes you get reports of Russian shelling way further east than you’d expect.

Day 268 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet with no missile strikes or drones, and only 2 air raid alerts, one of which happened at 4am, so it’s more like 1 alert, as most people weren’t even awake when the first one happened. We did have some blackouts today, but it was very limited, actually just a part of my apartment building was without electricity for 2 hours, and it doesn’t seem like there were any more blackouts in my district.

It already started snowing yesterday; it’s kinda crazy how the war started with it snowing in Kharkiv on the February 25th, which, at least to me, was pretty memorable, then we cycled through all the seasons and now we are already back to winter and negative temperatures. If Russians were getting frostbite at the start of the war, when the winter was ending, then now they will be getting the taste of real winter with degrees down to -30c, though usually it more like -10c to -20c, and right now it’s only -5c, but the winter has barely started, so it will definitely get colder.

It really doesn’t feel like almost a year has already passed, especially during the first 5 months, when we were getting shelled every single day in Kharkiv, it felt like one really long day, we didn’t even know what day of the week it was, it all blended together because we slept whenever it was quiet and not when we wanted. It’s incomparable to how it is right now as we haven’t been shelled even once since Russians were thrown out of Kharkiv oblast, so we finally got some normalcy back, and it does feel good.

>Neither the Ukraine nor the West can change Putin’s ambitions—so they must create reality in which even Putin understands that he must not pursue them by war and in which he lacks the capability to continue fighting even if he wanted to.  
>  
>How can that reality come about? The West should help Ukraine liberate the areas that are strategically vital to its security and economic well-being and then build up the Ukrainian military and economy to a point that deters future Russian invasions. Moscow will continue to pursue means short of invasion to undermine pro-Western Ukrainian governments and coerce Ukrainians to surrender their independence. Success for Ukraine and the West lies in turning this hot war into a cold war on terms that leave Ukraine strong enough to survive and ultimately win it.   
>  
>Advocates of negotiations now might claim that this is precisely what they are doing. But they have judged their moment poorly. Freezing the conflict where it is now invites renewed Russian invasion sooner and badly undermines Ukraine’s ability to prevail in either a renewed hot war or in the new cold war.

>Allowing Russia to keep some or all the areas it currently holds also condemns millions of Ukrainians to the ongoing Kremlin efforts to Russify them; to identify, torture, and kill people who still give their allegiance to Kyiv; to abduct Ukrainian children and adopt them forcibly into Russian families; and to continue the ethnic cleansing campaign Putin is pursuing to eliminate the Ukrainian national identity everywhere he can.

Without the presence of the West, Kyiv’s position is “highly changeable,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.

“Directives” from those countries are “very scrupulously implemented by Kyiv,” he added. 

The Kremlin repeatedly accused Ukrainian authorities of withdrawing from negotiations with Moscow and demonstrating an unwillingness to resume talks, amid renewed Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and energy facilities.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously told CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour he did not rule out peace negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

The tense diplomatic relationship between both countries further unraveled after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.

As the war approaches the nine-month mark, Zelensky proposed a 10-point peace plan in front of world leaders at the G20 summit on Tuesday.

>Regarding the shooting of prisoners: Legalized Atrocity

>Friends from high school, performed together at the local KVN club - there are still tapes online. Ordinary schoolchildren, they were humoring in Russian on stage. And they were not in the National Security Forces, but in an ordinary cadre unit. How did the former comedians turn into ruthless killers, devoid of human form?

>It's simple. It is a legalized atrocity that has been practiced in Ukraine in recent years. Clandestine prisons, torture, rape, extrajudicial executions... All these are episodes of various reports by all kinds of Western human rights organizations. From Amnesty International to the UN. Have you heard about the high-profile war crimes trials in Ukraine? Maybe Western partners have demanded that Kiev investigate? Of course not.

>Moreover, with the start of the special operation, Ukraine officially released from prisons those rare animal killers who had been convicted of serious crimes. Remember the initial stage of our operation. Killing prisoners on camera, cutting their throats, shooting them in the knees. They didn't hesitate to do it on tape. Because they knew they would get nothing for it. This is a legalized atrocity, practiced at the instigation of the current Ukrainian government and with the bashful silence of the ""civilized West.

>Today, Valery Fadeyev, head of the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council, said that he would send the video of the execution of Russian POWs to 2,000 addresses - including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, Amnesty International, the International Committee of the Red Cross... By the way, you know what the latter did to the video from near Kupiansk that the HRC also sent to investigate? (In that video, recall, the bodies of those whom the ""Ukrainian patriots"" considered to be ""collaborators"" were thrown into the pit.) They sent it to the Kyiv office of the Red Cross. Whether we should expect it to investigate is a rhetorical question.

>But the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights assured me that they would give their evaluation ""with all possible attention. I personally have no illusions, though. But first of all, these illusions must be dispelled by our soldiers who are defending our territory today with weapons in their hands. Our enemy has no rules and conventions. Once again he has proved it. And sooner or later it will play against him.

To be honest, this is an interesting addition to the current picture painted by Russian media (a short summary):

* Ukrainians are nazis who are bombing poor Donetsk children (hence ""special operation"")
* Poland & Baltics are states which turned the EU into a fascist organisation acting against Russia (helped greatly by Anglo-Saxons, see below)
* Everything is secretly governed by evil Anglo-Saxon warlords to force Russia to accept gays and LGBT

For those who don't know, while these worms don't harm raccoons, when they infest a different animal, they travel through the body tissues to the brain and eyes, causing severe neurological disease and blindness, almost always leading to death. It's usually contracted by exposure to raccoon feces.

WW2, they took massive initial losses, retreated, dug in, and held the Germans along the front at Stalingrad, rebuilt and attacked with western aid, but also with a lot of home built equipment. Hitler commented about finding tank factories that had thousands of people  living in them, for example. A significant data point, all Soviet school children in the 1930's received military training at school, which was one of the things that allowed them to mobilise so quickly back then. Didn't stop them taking massive losses of course.

I doubt he thinks it would hamper western support or harm his reputation. I think its likely he believes the information he is being given by his military commanders and they may genuinely believe it was a Russian rocket. 

Ukrainian investigators have now visited the site and may update the information available to the Ukrainian armed forces which may either enforce their current belief or change their mind on the issue. 

As to why NATO and western leaders would downplay/lie about Russian attempted provocation/threat/incompetence we can only speculate but there are some conceivable scenarios where one might not want to inform the Russians about exactly why one of their missiles veered off its flight path or perhaps they chose to deal with the issue some other way behind closed doors which has happened in the past and did happen oftentimes during the cold war.

Its conceivable this was meant as a provocation to ratchet up rhetoric ahead of a full scale mobilization later this yer in Russia where a lot of public relations effort is going in to framing this as a war between Russia and NATO.

By saying it was a Ukrainian missile fired by mistake you remove and back and forth blame game between NATO and Russia which would fit in to the Russian propaganda narrative.",1668746477.0,1668746250.0,t3_yyai6h,t1_iwt97ix,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The missiles are supposed to use radar to find air targets while this one zeroed in on a ground heat source. Which is what the Russian missiles are adapted to do.

Could have been a captured s300 system that had modified missiles to attack ground targets. Or another country could have modified the missile at some point and forgot about it. Could be sabotage.

These metals have tensile strengths ranging from 600-1000 MPa, which surpasses most if not all other alloys. These alloys have good machining qualities and plasticity and can withstand intense temperatures, while still having a thermal conductivity that is 5 times that of die & punch steels. They have 1.7 times the radiation shielding capabilities of lead and are non-toxic to biological systems (which cannot be said for lead). Iron makes these alloys magnetic, which is important to know if they are planned to be used in any magnetism-sensitive operations such as medical imaging equipment. Tungsten nickel iron alloys have a low expansion coefficient useful for glass-to-metal seals and possess high moduli of elasticity, which makes them resistant to elastic deformation. These alloys are perfect for radiation shielding, as its high density matched with its radiation resistance are ideal for protective components. Some notable applications include balance weights, security and defense applications, ballasts, bearing assemblies, and more.

Sure, that's a legitimate fear but the course of the direction of the Russian government can only be legitimately changed by the Russian people. If they're unwilling to do anything about it then they are complicit. Just like in WWII the Germans that sat around and did nothing while the smoke of genocide was wafting over their villages were complicit. These Russians know what's going on and they refuse to do anything to stop it because it's inconvenient.

Now look at Iran. They're out in the streets protesting an extremist Islamic sect that's more than happy to gun them down in the streets. Just for the right of women to show their hair in public. They're risking far more (their lives vs a fine or jail in Russia) for far less (civil rights vs genocide in Ukraine).

If you support Putin, you approve of his actions. If you refuse to do anything (e.g., speak up, protest, etc) about Putin's actions, then you tacitly approve of them.

Yes, thats right. Thousands of collateral victims were caused when homes full of familys were bombed.   


I dont support or make excuses for Russia but i also dont support Ukraines decision to just declare everyone a fair target.

Its like the soviet invasion of afghanistan again, and all of a sudden we are pretending like the mujahideen are upstanding citizens of the world.  


Or perhaps American support for Ba'athist Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War.  


Idk, im sure this is a just a late night rant but the world does wierd shit sometimes.  


During the Catalan independence movement (which was ruthlessly put down btw) no one cared too much about the will of the people or democracy.  


The Spanish government referred the declaration to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled in March 2014 that the declaration of sovereignty was unconstitutional  


So did ukraine during the 2014 Donbas status referendums.   


But unlike the Catalans, the dombas seperatists decided to fight for it, and had the backing of a powerful neighbour.

There was no significant independence movement in Donbas, before in 2014 the ""little green men"" showed up and eliminated the legitimate local governments.

In Catalonia, there is for a long time a genuine, local independence movement, with no foreign power in the background wanting to annex the territory. And it stayed mostly peaceful. In my opinion, therefore, the two cases are not comparable.

And there also is a difference between shelling a city right on the front lines, where enemy troops, command centers and logistic bases are located, or purely civilian infrastructure far away from the front lines, the destruction of which does not achieve any military objective.
