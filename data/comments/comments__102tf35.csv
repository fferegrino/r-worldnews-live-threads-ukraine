Day 315 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another pretty quiet day. We had some country-wide air raid alerts, but it was just Russian MiG-31K as usual, which they mostly use to scare us, but also for reconnaissance, because apparently it is used in a pair with their AWACS aircraft. There’s a pretty high chance that the next big missile strike might happen in the next couple of days, because it will be orthodox Christmas soon, and they will almost certainly try to ruin it for us.

The strikes on Russian bases and weapon/ammo warehouses seem to happen almost daily now, which is great to see. Most of them are happening in the occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia oblast, it might have something to do with the next planned offensive by our forces, which a lot of our officials have been openly talking about recently. I’m not sure why they are even talking about our planned offensives, I guess either you can’t hide it anyway, or they are trying to mislead Russia by talking about it, which also might be the case, it wouldn’t be the first time that it happens during this war. 

Actually, the timing also kinda fits, because we are expecting weather to become much colder in the next couple of days, and the change is supposed to be very sudden. The temperature is hovering around -1c to +5c right now, but in just two days from now the forecast shows that it will go down to -17c, so the ground might finally harden and fighting will definitely accelerate when it happens.

The news about us getting new vehicles from France are also amazing, the AMX-10 might not be tracked, but it is still using the gun of a tank, a western one too, so it might be the start of a wave of new weapons being approved for transfer, moving the red line farther back. It will be great if we get Bradleys as well, and we just might get them soon, otherwise I don’t think there would be so much talk about them right now.

>The Russian leader has dropped the pretense that life goes on as normal despite the war, evident in the Kremlin’s quick acknowledgment of mass casualties inflicted by Ukraine last weekend.
>
>In footage released by the Kremlin on New Year’s Eve, President Vladimir V. Putin is seen chatting with soldiers, exhorting them: “We can’t give up anything. We must only fight, only keep going.”
>
>He then adds: “Of course, there is still much that needs to be done.”
>
>As winter sets in and the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine looms next month, Mr. Putin has dropped his earlier efforts to shield the public from the pain of war and is now seeking to prepare Russians, and his own military, for a long fight ahead.
>
>“He’s gotten a lot less relaxed, a lot less optimistic,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian analyst who studies Mr. Putin for her political analysis firm R.Politik. “You can sense a certain anxiety, a desire to mobilize all possible forces to achieve his goals.”
>
>Keeping a low profile this week during Russia’s extended New Year’s holidays, Mr. Putin made no statement about Ukraine’s rocket attack in the city of Makiivka last weekend. The resulting torrent of criticism from pro-war bloggers on social media was aimed at Russian commanders and spared Mr. Putin himself, a pattern evident over months of blunders by Russia’s military.
>
>Russia’s Defense Ministry issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the death toll from the strike had reached 89 servicemen, including the deputy commander of the regiment. Ukrainian officials have said the toll is much higher. Neither claim could be independently confirmed. The statement also said that the main reason the site was able to be targeted was cellphone use by soldiers — a factor that Russian military bloggers had pinpointed as a vulnerability.
>
>On social media, initial calls by pro-war Russian commentators to charge officials responsible for the Makiivka losses with treason gave way to more guarded criticism of local military decisions and advice for avoiding future disasters. None appeared to direct criticism toward Mr. Putin, with veiled attacks more often aimed at his senior officials.
>
>The instinct to spare Mr. Putin of blame was evident in a post by an influential Russian military blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, a native of the Samara region, on Monday night. “Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich, we love our country,” she wrote, referring to Mr. Putin. “I love Russia so much that I hate specific characters in your entourage.”

This is a popular talking point that has been instrumentalized by Russia since the Vietnam War, basically blending in Anti-Americanism with a zero-sum rethoric about NATO being US puppetry. What is unusual is that it used to be a talking point of the left but has since found fertile ground among right-wing extremists as well, horseshoe theory in action I guess. 

>When addressing supporters, she stops short of explicitly supporting Russia’s invasion and instead focuses on the conflict’s impact on Germans worried about rising heating bills.

Classic concern trolling about heating and costs of living. It is worth noting though that this rhetoric does not seem to go anywhere, since over 70% of Germans support Ukraine despite rising costs of living. And support for weapon deliveries has gone up - 48% now even support sending tanks to Ukraine (up from 41%) and the percentage against it is shrinking (41%, down from 47% in the month before).

Why a trap? It has an enormous number of layered defenses, as do all of the towns around it. And, let’s be honest, all of the towns behind it as well. Russia never could have taken this city without enormous casualties. Bakhmut absorbed the entire momentum of the Russian army.

The only possible way Russia can win a war is to push through huge amounts of land with their mechanized infantry, establish a line, and then grind through whatever forces are trapped behind this line. They don’t have the ability to fight through strong resistance.

But what’s funny is that Russia doesn’t have the logistical capacity to wage the one sort of war they can win. They never should have started a war at all, they weren’t ready.

6de10e7ff53c15655a6e259e79ce7f84,102tf35,j2vu1bq,"It was bound to be a failure as soon as:

1) Russia defined its limited, and therefore immediate, war goals to necessitate full control over the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. This basically forced them to have to throw everything at Bakhmut, because Bakhmut controls highway access to Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

So why not just go around Bakhmut and create a risk of encirclement leading to a forced Ukrainian retreat? Which brings me to the second reason why it failed:

2) The Kharkiv counter-offensive took the only way that Russia can encircle western Donetsk oblast out of the picture (the south is either too flat or has too many prepared defenses ie. Avdiivka). Now, some of Ukraine's most experienced units are conducting maneuvers with the goal of retaking Svatove and Kreminna, and later even Severodonetsk/Lyschansk. If Russia is *losing* ground north of Bakhmut, their only way to fulfill their stated goal of taking all of Donetsk oblast requires the head-on assault we are seeing now.

I agree that the offensive has been practically a trap, and a huge drain on Russian resources and materiel. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that Russia has a lot of resources and materiel. Even if plenty of it only exists on paper due to corruption, Ukraine has to prepare for the worst case scenario, because the consequences of not doing so could be horrific.

Mobiks and convicts especially are seen as disposable, and Russia is more than willing to throw hundreds of thousands of men at Bakhmut in order to take it. Look at the Battle of Narva, where Russia lost >450k men in order to retake the isthmus. Hardly anybody in the West has even heard of the battle, and ultimately it wasn't that consequential, but more Soviet men died there than thrice of the current estimated Russian death toll. As a result, high Russian casualty counts are unlikely to force a Russian public outcry, like was seen in the US forcing it to withdraw from Vietnam. The only way to victory is for the West to continue supplying Ukraine with the weapons they need.",False,1672819391.0,t3_102tf35,t1_j2vjhyd,,1,35,0,35,0,0,

**Interview with Mikhail Shishkin**

*We are sitting in a warm café, people in Ukraine are cold because Russia is bombing their country. What is going through your mind?*

I see these images every day; 2022 was a terrible year. I have never felt so bad in my life. I have always identified with Russian culture. The war made me lose this reference point. After the mobilization, tens of thousands of Russians go to war enslaved. Are these still my people? I have nothing in common with these murderers, even though I am Russian.

*Do you feel guilty?*

The Putin regime has turned my language, the language of the great Russian authors, into the language of murderers. Every sentence I write is illustrated by images of the crimes committed in Butcha. The texts that were written a hundred years ago and that will be written in the future will also be illustrated by these images. The meaning of my life now is to defend the Russian language, the dignity of Russian culture against Putin and his regime.

*As an outside observer, one always wonders: why do Russians participate in all this?*

After the February invasion, there were few protests in Russia. Of course, I told myself that people were afraid. Those who took to the streets are now in prison, have lost their jobs, have ruined their lives. Fear - it's understandable. But then, in October, after the mobilization, people went like sheep to their deaths, without thinking. This is not fear.

*So what is it about?*

The whole history of Russia is reflected here. We see here how every Russian regime has abused the words ""fatherland"" and ""patriotism"" to protect itself. Russians think they are defending their homeland, but in reality they are defending their jailers, their regime. It has always been so: my grandfather was exterminated by Stalin and the son, my father, went to war to defend his regime. He thought he was defending the fatherland. The Russian state settles in Russia like an occupying army, the Russian poet Alexander Herzen once wrote. Those who have understood this principle no longer support their own army in the war in Ukraine, but that of their opponents.

[...]

*Kiev is now razing Russian monuments, Russian books are banned. How does that make you feel?*

What do you expect from a country that is being bombed by Russia? On a purely emotional level, one can understand it very well. But of course, yes, it hurts me when monuments to the Russian national poet Pushkin are destroyed. Of course, this is not to say that his poems were bad; he was misused by the regime and placed there as a sign of colonial power.

But if they think that their own punishment or consequences will be better by saying it, then they will. ""I came to Ukraine to help repel the polish invaders, what can I do, my bad government lied to me in the media by saying that poles were invading Ukraine... and I thought I had to help"".

That's a lie that any mobik in Ukrainian custody will happily tell, because it makes their motivations look slightly less evil. 

Actually I think when the russian media puts out stories about an invasion of Polish mercenaries - the savvy viewers all know it's fake, but they quietly celebrate the introduction of a new narrative they can later pretend to have been fooled or motivated by.

Same with the video of the Witch of Bakhmut yesterday, about how her captives all say they were raped by Kadyrovites.

I'm sure it happens, but if a master dissembler thinks he'll receive better treatment, he'll say it happens to every mobik all the time everywhere.

War does not make sense.  Invading Ukraine was really stupid.  

We would need accurate numbers on Ukraine's losses to really evaluate if Bakhmut is dummer than other areas that Russia attacked.  

Consider a 152mm shell.  What is its purpose and how is it used?  You load it into a 152mm tube and shoot it at an enemy.  They are not good for much else.  When Russians manufactured the 152mm shell they had no idea who the enemy would be or where the shell would be fired.  Most of what the Russians are doing right now is pulling shells out of storage and hauling them west/southwest.  This is done with a mix of railroad, trucks, and manual labor.  ""Doing it better"" or ""doing it worse"" involves the cycle time.  If they get the rail car empty faster then it can be reloaded sooner.  

Over the summer there were huge depot fires.  That is a poor use of 152mm shells from the Russian tactical perspective.  Lobbing the shell at a farm field which might periodically have a Ukrainian soldier will sometimes cause an injury or death.  It is also disruptive because Ukrainians will take cover or dig in instead of plotting some anti-Russian activity.    

Wagner is using troops as ""canon fodder"".  That term has changed meaning a bit.  By advancing troops into a battlefield they either take the field or they encounter resistance.  If there is resistance then there must be a defender in that field.  That means the artillery shells are sometimes blowing up a Ukrainian soldier and not just a farmer's empty field.  

Bakhmut may not have mattered at all.  It does now.  There is a bunch of national pride committed.  There is public perception of who is winning or losing.  Zelensky highlighted Bakhmut in his speech to the United States congress.  There is competitive conflict between Wagner and the regular Russian Army.

An assault against a prepared enemy requires training and well prepared troops of your own to have a chance at success. As well as the ability to supply those troops as they get farther away.

Ukraine doesn't have their best troops at the border with Belarus but they've had time to prepare and will be informed by NATO intelligence the moment an attack started, not to mention the weeks of warning they'd get seeing the build up allowing them to move more forces into the area to defend.

________

> Ok I’ve read this, and she absolutely takes zero accountability for her multiple misdeeds.

> First, she and her handler/escort blatantly broke the rules.  She’s been working in a war zone for months—the onus is on *her* to comply—not the military, not her handler, *her.*  She and her escort/handler (1) proceed to a no-go zone to interview the farmer, and (2) didn’t even wait for their documents to be approved to be in the region, anyways.  She takes zero responsibility for this—it’s everyone else’s fault.  Mostly, her handler—a total newbie—for letting them set off towards something in a no-go zone. And another journalist previously interviewed them, so must be ok? And her DR boss wanted interview, so must be ok? Take some accountability, lady.  It’s not your escorts fault. Or your boss. Or the slow office. Or the other journalist.  Or the guards at the checkpoint. Or the farmer.  

> Second, she thinks that since she placed some phone calls and they told her procedures and various people advocated for her reinstatement, she’s *entitled* to reinstatement. She’s not.  She’s there at the approval of Ukraine.

> Third, she proceeds to insult Ukrainians for not understanding her Danish jokes. That she sarcastically posts about Putin, and Ukraine shouldn’t take that seriously.  Lady, this is war.  Act professional.

> Fourth, she absolutely did herself no favors by having a history of covering annexed territories in such a way that didn’t make abundantly clear that Ukraine has “been wronged” by Russian aggression, including displacing thousands of people who are now not in those places to represent the extreme *dis*pleasure at annexation. 
Since she’s been there so long, she should know how incredibly sensitive Ukraine is regarding coverage of stories from occupied- Donetsk and Crimea.  They expect to make extremely clear that it’s all morally wrong and a criminal state—any “straight journalism” from there is considered by the Ukrainians to be pro-Russia.  Why does she think she’s the only one in Donetsk in 2017?  All other journalists know that can’t be unbiased/straight there or else UA finds you suspicious.  And she didn’t have a solid justification or explanation for Crimea.  She instead showed parades? Happy faces? Prosperity? What the heck, lady?  

> Fifth, she’s offered some friendly advice—“go make some clearly pro-Ukrainian articles, or at least fb posts, so we know you’re not pro-Russia, and we’ll take that under consideration if you appeal.”  Does she do that?  Nope.  And a load of excuses why she hasn’t, that are—frankly—bs.

They understand they are at a disadvantage, because of that their operations are conducted with a great deal of care and preparation.

784b805a8b81e1a3284a3c2a9975d55a,102tf35,j2wq2q7,"I think the most general reason is that Ukraine doesn't post military losses. The numbers you mentioned is this one-off estimation by those intelligence agencies. You have a war with two biased sources so it's not easy to just pick up the truth.

As an example when Zelensky gave the daily death numbers in the east Donbas fighting (100-200 deaths daily) those were posted here a lot. This was a rare moment they wanted to highlight heavy military deaths and it was coupled with a ""if we don't get HIMARS we can't really fight back"".

As for Russian victories, I do think they are posted in general but that it's rare? My impression is that often you'll have Russia make tons of claims and Ukraine be silent so it can be hard to know what's true or not. As an example villages on the front sometimes change hands back and forth but we only hear about it from either side when it's them taking it back. But I do think some stories get buried like when some village on the outskirts of Bakhmut might get taken. Russia will act like it's them winning big while Ukraine might want to minimize it so many of these smaller victories or losses get lost in the sauce.

Overall though, I think the answer to your question is propaganda. I think people care about ""the truth"" as hard as it can be to find in a war but I also think they care about the side they think is justified is winning and they might be afraid that showing too much of Russia doing good will discourage people. People might think that if Russia is shown to be a complete failure that Russia will be more likely to give up or people feel more confident to keep supporting Ukraine to victory. We see this also with Russian propaganda that always claims they are killing more Ukrainians that they have losses because it's easier to keep up high morale with it. If it was easy to maintain a clear objective reporting of the war I think we'd see more of it but when you have the choice of two biased sides you'd pick the one you agree with more / trust more and sprinkle that with everyone treating propaganda a bit like a smaller war itself and we end up where we are now.",False,1672841241.0,t3_102tf35,t1_j2wi2l7,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Ukrainian casualties are probably around 100k, give or take a few thousand. However I would wager that only about 1/3 of those are fatalities, with the rest being wounded. The thing about the wounded is that depending on the severity, they can eventually be brought back to the front if needed/desired. 

Russian casualties are working a bit differently. Western sources agree that their casualty rates are well above 100k, probably approaching 150k by now. The only semi reliable reports on Russian fatalities are Ukrainian sources, so you can expect some inaccuracy. However given the Russians lack of proper CASEVAC and their terrible offensive strategies I would think that the amount of Russian dead is possibly around 80-90k with only 60-70k wounded. 

As for record keeping, both sides are bound to hide their casualties for moral, propaganda and OPSEC reasons. As the aggressor, it's a lot harder for the Russians to hide their casualties. Their dead and wounded lay in the fields and streets for every Ukrainian to see and record. Doesn't really happen with the Ukrainians. On numerous occasions the Russians have had to fake Ukrainian casualties just for propaganda purposes.

This is true, but the American and British intelligence services are the best in the world. So I do trust them to at least provide accurate estimations. You can't expect them to get the figure accurate to the individual man. But the estimation is that of equal losses.

That just isn't true. The UA and UA foreign office, and defence ministry provide losses in certain battles, offensives, fronts and time specific ones across the whole front

This is also true.

The Foreign Office is pro-Europe because it’s really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that the Common Market didn’t work. That’s why we went into it. Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least 500 years: to create a disunited Europe. In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, French and Italians against the Germans, and the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule, you see. Why should we change now, when it’s worked so well?

It’s all ancient history, surely.

Yes, and current policy. We had to break the whole thing up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn’t work. Now that we are inside, we can make a big pig’s breakfast of the whole thing! Set the Germans against the French, French against Italians, Italians against Dutch —The Foreign Office is terribly pleased! It’s just like old times!

Surely we are committed to the European ideal!

If not, why are we pressing for an increase in membership?

For the same reason. It's just like the United Nations, in fact. The more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.

What appalling cynicism!

Yes. We call it diplomacy

There is none. You're looking at it from the perspective of having standards.

If at the end of a long line of Russian corpses there is victory, that is viewed as flawless success. For US forces, that would be considered an utter failure, despite victory.

What? No. Ukraine is getting a significant amount of funding from international civilian organizations. Posting videos encourages people to support them.

I think we've all seen those numbers here but it's what you expect people to change that gets weird. I do agree with you though about bias and often weird impressions. One common thing we see is ""why does Russia only hit civilian targets?"" when it should be a common known fact that Ukraine doesn't report on military targets being struck by PGM attacks due to OpSec but they do report each missile or rocket that unjustly targeted or fell on a civilian target.

I don't bother trying to change the impression of each of these people because it feels like a waste of time for something that in the end isn't that important to the big picture.

Yes

That's the thing about tanks, they can afford to miss their first shot... and pop out more shots before you have time to blink.

I expect a number of M2 Bradleys to be destroyed. They're not a tank. They still will lose on the battlefield when placed up against a tank.

---------

However, I still think M2 Bradley is better for Ukraine. Remember that Ukraine has ~200,000+ more infantry they need to carry around all of a sudden, now that all their fresh conscripts are arriving on the front lines.

The M2 Bradley's ability to carry 6 troops at a time (though less room than a 12-troop APC), is critical to its usefulness. Ukrainian troops need to move faster on the battlefield, and M2 Bradley is the most obvious way to help those infantry get from Point A to Point B.

EDIT: APCs don't work, even if they carry more troops, because ""what if they come across a tank??"". Yeah, M2 Bradley _probably_ loses, but it still puts up a good fight thanks to its TOW Missiles.

 Basically - its not so much a problem that Russia will recover to its former strength - its a problem of Ukraine being much weaker to start with - and needing to really reform their society to actually have hope of being admitted into NATO, or even the EU.

 You're proposing that Ukraine joining NATO is a foregone conclusion - but that's actually far from being a sure thing. If you listen carefully - the likes of Macron are saying it would take Ukraine decades to qualify. And apparently Russia needs to be given security guarantees - which guess what: means exactly that Ukraine will not be admitted as a concession to Russian concerns. And that's Macron... What are the likes of Orban going to do? What about Erdogan?

 Now if it takes Ukraine decades to qualify - then those are decades without Foreign capital. And Foreign capital in general is going to dry up a bit, World is de-globalizing, most developing countries have their largest generations going into retirement. Which means they're taking their investments from risky international funds that would go to a developing market like Ukraine - and putting that money into bonds as they're a lot less risky.

He did not do so in the financial sector - and there you go - they are showing good skills. Having paranoia about your own people taking you out isn't necessarily an inevitable result of being an Authoritarian.

 Main issue with governments controlled such a way is that they don't normally have a mechanism to replace an incompetent Authoritarian leader. So where as a Republic can replace a bad leader by simply voting him out - the only ways to replace a Tyrant is to either wait for him to die or to have a very bloody and disruptive revolution.
