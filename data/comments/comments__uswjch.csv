Day 85 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Shelling definitely came back, in fact we are being shelled right now, guess quiet nights are over yet again. This shelling started around an hour ago and the shells/rockets land somewhere pretty close to us, it‚Äôs very loud and our building is shaking with every explosion. They are not shelling just one place either; there are reports of shelling from different parts of the city, including in the center.

We were shelled during the day too; they shelled Northern Saltivka again, as well as Pyatihatki, which is very close to us, so we can actually hear when they are getting shelled. Today they targeted endocrinology clinic, another very high value target in the eyes of the Russians.

About repairs, they have actually already begun and are proceeding pretty quickly. Just this week multiple holes from shelling were patched up in our building, also electricity is already being restored in Northern Saltivka, which is basically destroyed from all the shelling. 

Some public transport has also already started working again, and our mayor is saying that subway might start working in a couple weeks as well, when all the people still living there are placed in temporary shelters.

Completely closed or open? Should there be a military obligation for all boys and girls? Should the state regulate who to involve in defense, or leave people the choice during the war? Of course, I have my answers. But Ukraine differs from Russia and other tyrannies in that not one person decides everything, but people can choose for themselves.

Russia has claimed its use several times going back to March, but defense officials have downplayed the impact, with US defense secretary Lloyd Austin stating that the March claim of hypersonic use was designed to intimidate the international community more than achieve any military end.*

The US President is limited in what he can transfer in terms of arms (both type of arms and amount) without direct Congressional Approval.

Though it had been raised by Congress once, he was at the end of his authority this week, which is why passing the $40 billion dollar bill was such a big deal. This was literally the last $100 million of that pre-existing authority until that bill was passed today.
You would presume shipments will accelerate rapidly beginning possibly as soon as tomorrow.
As for ""Lend Lease"". the Lend Lease act that was passed does not resemble the WW2 Lend Lease act, that's just not how the US sells arms legally these days. The main thing it did was remove a number of restrictions on the type of arms the US can legally send Ukraine, namely as governed under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act. Notably these acts specifically and purposefully restrict the sales of so-called offensive weapons.

Ukraine's most senior military figure has met with his NATO counterparts and given an upbeat assessment of the conflict.

""Today, we are not just defending ourselves. We have conducted a series of successful counter-attacks,"" General Valeriy Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian General Staff, said he had told the NATO Military Committee.

Ukrainian forces had unblocked sieges of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, and were fighting in the Kherson direction, he said.

Zaluzhny said he had stressed that Ukrainians are paying an extremely high price for freedom and European choice, and Europe is experiencing the greatest security crisis since the Second World War.¬†

Ever since 2014, ""we were aware that the full-scale aggression would eventually begin, and we were getting ready for it,"" he added.

Ukraine's military had ""acknowledged that the first month would be the turning point. We managed to take away the enemy's strategic initiative, cause critical losses, and force them to abandon the main objective ‚Äî the capture of the city of Kyiv,"" he continued.

However, despite Ukrainian successes, he said, ""the Russians are maintaining missile fire of high intensity, on average 10-14 ballistic and cruise missiles per day. This is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to NATO member states,"" and it was crucial to strengthen missile defenses.

From CNN's Katharina Krebs in London

The first Russian soldier on trial for war crimes in Ukraine, Vadim Shishimarin, told a widow at a Kyiv court on Thursday that he is ""sorry"" for killing her husband during the war.

""Yes I acknowledge my fault. I understand that you will not be able to forgive me, but I am sorry,"" Shishimarin said.

When asked if Shishimarin repented for what he did, he replied: ""Yes, I acknowledge my fault.""

He also said he felt ""shame.""

The woman questioned the Russian soldier as to why he came to Ukraine, asking rhetorically: ""Did you come to defend us? From whom? Did you defend me from my husband you killed?""

""We were ordered to come with the column, what will follow I did not know,"" Shishimarin said.

Some background:¬†This is the¬†first Ukrainian war crimes trial¬†held since Russia invaded the country on February 24.

The 21-year-old soldier pleaded guilty Wednesday to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in Ukraine‚Äôs Sumy region on the fourth day of the war and is facing a life sentence.

The trial was adjourned on Wednesday because too many members of the media were crowding the courtroom. The trial has been moved to a larger Kyiv court.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia‚Äôs reported use of ‚Äúlaser weapons‚Äù in its invasion of his country is a sign of their failure. It follows a claim by a Russian official that the technology ‚Äì capable of taking down drones ‚Äì was being ‚Äúwidely deployed‚Äù on the battlefield.  
  
The Russians are searching for a ‚Äúwunder-waffe‚Äù Zelensky mockingly claimed. It was a reference to the hunt for a wonder weapon that would turn the tide of World War Two while the Nazis were losing on the battlefield.  
  
Zelensky spoke just hours after the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of military development claimed secret laser technology was already in use in Ukraine. Yuri Borisov said the systems were capable of taking down drones three miles away and blinding satellites.  
  
The Kremlin often shows off new prototype technology. Many times it is never seen on the battlefield.  
  
On the ground, the Ukrainian military said it was facing increasing bombardment around the Donbas region as Russia continues its campaign to take the east of the country.

NYT: The Senate overwhelmingly approves $40bn in aid to Ukraine, sending it to Biden. 

> The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to a $40 billion emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine, as the United States deepens its support for an increasingly costly and protracted fight against a Russian invasion.

> The measure will bring the total American investment in the war to roughly $54 billion in just over two months. The Senate approved it overwhelmingly, on a vote of 86-11, in the latest reflection of the remarkable bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for a massive investment in Ukraine‚Äôs war effort, which propelled the spending package through the House last week.

> President Biden was expected to quickly sign it into law. His administration and Ukrainian leaders had pressed hard for its swift enactment, warning that they would run out of aid by Thursday if Congress failed to act.

> The measure‚Äôs relatively smooth path through Congress has demonstrated how the searing images of suffering in Ukraine, coupled with fears about Russian aggression spreading beyond the country‚Äôs borders, have ‚Äî at least for now ‚Äî overcome resistance from both parties to American involvement in war abroad.

> ‚ÄúBy passing this emergency aid, the Senate can now say to the Ukrainian people: ‚ÄòHelp is on the way ‚Äî real help, significant help,‚Äô ‚Äù said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. ‚ÄúWe Americans ‚Äî all of us, Democrat and Republican ‚Äî cannot afford to stick our heads in the sand while Vladimir Putin continues his vicious belligerence against the Ukrainian people.‚Äù  
Of the few Republicans who opposed the bill, several cited concerns about sending billions of dollars abroad for a conflict whose endpoint is unknown at a time when the United States is struggling with economic challenges, including inflation.

> Leaders in both parties sought to ensure that skepticism about the scope of the package did not derail its passage. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, led a delegation of senators in his party in a surprise visit to Ukraine last weekend and pledged bipartisan support for the country‚Äôs fight against Russia.

> ‚ÄúAid for Ukraine goes far beyond charity; the future of America‚Äôs security and core strategic interests will be shaped by the outcome of this fight,‚Äù Mr. McConnell said on Thursday. ‚ÄúAnyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger costs should Ukraine lose.‚Äù

> The legislation is substantially larger than Mr. Biden‚Äôs $33 billion request, which came only weeks after Congress had cleared a $13.6 billion aid package for Ukraine, roughly equally divided between military and humanitarian aid. The bill passed on Thursday has a similar split.

> It would allow Mr. Biden to authorize the speedy transfer of up to $11 billion of American weapons, equipment and defense supplies to Ukraine, and allocate about $9 billion to replenish that stockpile.

> Transfers thus far have included relatively expensive weapons like the 5,500 Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and 1,400 Stinger antiaircraft missiles given to Kyiv, as well as less-costly munitions like the 184,000 155-millimeter shells provided to Ukraine for a protracted artillery battle in Donbas.

> The package also includes $8.8 billion for a dedicated fund intended to help Ukraine‚Äôs government continue to function, and $4.4 billion for international disaster assistance, part of an effort to stem the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. Another $900 million would go to assistance for Ukrainian refugees, including providing trauma and support services, English language training, and housing.",False,1652981517.0,t3_uswjch,t3_uswjch,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered.



Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food.



""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said.

What will this achieve? Will this end the war? No, not at all. At best - it will reduce the frontline, not more. Let's say the enemy suffers heavy losses (they do now). But in those weeks they will be able (thanks to continuing mobilisation) to prepare new fresh reserves. Moreover, they already have these reserves! The enemy is so confident in the strategic stability of their frontline (abandoning 1-2 localities in 2-3 days has no effect on this) that they continue keeping a relatively large group at the border of Transnistria, and even created a new (several army BTGs) at the border with Belarus. And they continue forming new units and detachments both in deep rear, and also in Sumy and Chernihiv Oblasts given up by Russian forces during the 'run to the border'.

From CNN's Tim Lister

The Ukrainian military reported on Thursday that Russian forces trying to break through to Sloviansk, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, had suffered losses and retreated.¬†

Despite artillery and missile attacks by Russian forces on a wide front over the past 24 hours, there are no signs they have taken new territory.¬†¬†

""The enemy conducted battle activity in Velyka Komyshuvakha area with the support of artillery; had no success, suffered significant losses in some areas and was forced to withdraw to previously occupied positions,"" the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed in its daily update.

There has been fighting in the Velyka Komyshuvakha area since late April ‚Äî since the Russians took control of Izium and tried to push toward Sloviansk ‚Äî but the front lines have changed little.¬†

In Luhansk:¬†On the other main front, in the parts of Luhansk region the Ukrainians still hold, Russian aircraft have attacked several villages, according to the General Staff.

Ukrainian defenses were holding around the industrial city of Severodonetsk, and Russian assault operations in the Zolote area had been unsuccessful, it said.

Serhii Hayday, head of the Luhansk military administration, said Severodonetsk had suffered the most in the latest attacks and confirmed that four civilians were killed on Wednesday.

Elsewhere:¬†Other regions also reported Russian artillery and missile strikes overnight. In the Dnipropetrovsk region in the south, the city military administration in Kryvih Rih said ""there was enemy shelling along the entire line of contact during the night.""

It said there had been heavy shelling of residential areas of Velyka Kostromka, a town that lies some 20 miles south of Kryvih Rih that has been on the front lines for more than a month.

The two U.S. officials said the M270 or similar system like the M142 HIMARS would be considered for shipment to Ukraine once Congress passed a $40 billion supplemental funding bill that would authorize an additional $11 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority. That lets the president authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

In a statement, the prime minister said: ""I updated the president on support flowing to Ukraine's defence, including long-range artillery, shore-to-ship missiles and unmanned drones. This is part of our additional ¬£1.3 billion military aid package for Ukraine.

""We also discussed how we can stem the global economic damage caused by Putin's reckless blockade of Black Sea ports. We're looking urgently at options to open up critical sea and land supply routes for Ukrainian grain stocks.""

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also tweeted about the conversation, saying that he had spoken with Mr Johnson about ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"".

**The Putin Show - How the war in Ukraine appears to Russians**

*When vladimir putin was first elected president of Russia in 2000, he changed little in the office he inherited from Boris Yeltsin. Yet in place of a pen on the desk, Mr Putin put a television remote control, one visitor noted. The new president would obsess over the media, spending the end of his days watching coverage of himself. One of his first moves was to bring under Kremlin control the country‚Äôs television networks, including ntv, an independent oligarch-owned channel, which had needled the new president with unflattering depictions of him as a dwarf in a satirical show called Kukly, or Puppets.*  


*After more than two decades in power, today Mr Putin is the puppet master. The state controls the country‚Äôs television channels, newspapers and radio stations. The Kremlin gives editors and producers metodichki, or guidance on what to cover and how. As young audiences shift online, the Kremlin seeks to control the conversation there, leaning on social networks and news aggregators, blocking or undermining unco-operative digital media and flooding popular platforms, such as the messaging app Telegram, with state-approved content. Propaganda has long propped up Mr Putin's regime. Now it fuels his war machine.*  


*Since the president announced a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine on February 24th, control over information has become even tighter. Censorship laws bar reporting that cites unofficial sources. Calling the war a ‚Äúwar‚Äù is a crime. Protesters are detained for holding signs that contain eight asterisks, the number of letters in the Russian for ‚Äúno to war‚Äù. Many Western social networks and platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have been banned or blocked. The last remaining influential independent media bastions have been pushed off air. Dozhd, an online tv station, has suspended its streams; Novaya Gazeta, a liberal newspaper whose editor recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has halted publication; Echo Moskvy, a popular liberal radio station, no longer broadcasts from its longtime Moscow home on 91.2FM.*

> Video showed the fighters carrying out their wounded on stretchers and undergoing pat-down searches before being taken away on buses escorted by military vehicles bearing the pro-Kremlin ""Z"" sign.

> Mariupol's defenders grimly clung to the steel mill for months against the odds, preventing Russia from completing its occupation of the city and its port.

> Its full capture would give Russia an unbroken land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. It also would allow Russia to focus fully on the larger battle for the Donbas, Ukraine's industrial east.

> For Ukraine, the order to the fighters to surrender could leave President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government open to allegations it abandoned the troops he described as heroes.

> ""Zelenskyy may face unpleasant questions,"" said Volodymyr Fesenko, who heads the independent Penta think tank in Kyiv. ""There have been voices of discontent and accusations of betraying Ukrainian soldiers.""

>what did you know about Ukraine until 2022 

I was very hopeful about Russia and her neighbors when the Soviet Union collapsed, and even moreso as Russia participated in the ISS.  But gradually, starting with the Moscow Apartment bombings, and various wars, I started to question whether keeping Russia as an ally was worthwhile, since Putin's rise to power, and his increasing authoritariansm, and embracing of bigotry in Russian law.

I have pretty much always known the basic history of Ukraine, (incl. Crimea) - but around 2010-2014, I became aware of Ukraine issues and the Euromaidan protests, and revolution. (maybe it started with the revelations from the Litvinenko poisoning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko )

A pet-peeve of mine is when people try to subvert democracy, and it was pretty clear that Yanukovych was not the legitimate president. 

After that, I learned of American presidential candidate Trump's treachery, and especially his campaign manager  Paul Manafort. I had known about Paul Manfort's horrid reputation since the 1980's.

- Ukraine's roll in WWII and Cold War as part of the USSR 
- Ukraine's roll in global wheat supplies and gas pipelines
- Ukraine's non-aligned status after the soviet collapse 

What I knew from politics / the news
- Ukraine / Zelenskyy roll in Trump's impeachment 
- Ukraine's corruption problem, with the narrative that the new government was trying (but not always successful) in managing that corruption 
- Russian 'little green men' taking Crimea and the subsequent BS referendum 
- MH17 and how the Russian separatists murdered those inn

- The Maidan Revolution (winter of Fire)
- The corruption and electoral fraud behind Yushechenko's election 
- Zelensky's background as a comedian 
- How aggressive Russia has been backing the LPR/DPR

How we feel about Ukraine now... 
Ukraine is now at the center of a global battle between democracy and autocracy. Starting from the rumors of invasion during the Olympics until the very first day of the war, my SO and I have been following developments daily, crying for the Ukrainian people when the bombs started falling,  and rooting for your victory in those early hours while thinking Russia would ultimately take Kyiv in a few days - with the recent memory of the Afghan capitulation still in the back of our minds. 

We stayed up late that first night watching livestreams from YouTube and watching CNN's live coverage into the morning.  
For reference, midnight for me is 7am in Kyiv. We went to bed not really knowing what to expect but woke up to increasingly optimistic news as we heard of herculean Ukrainian victories and the staggering resistance the Ukrainians were putting up.  

As time went on we went from thinking Ukraine was going to end up in a long-term partisan war after Kyiv will eventually fall,  to thinking Ukraine may be able to hold territory from Kyiv westward, to now believing that Ukraine can kick Russia out of Ukraine and possibly even to pre 2014 borders. 

We are in awe of the bravery and perseverance we have seen in the Ukrainian people, and shocked at the barbaric and atrocious actions by the Russians. 

We now fly a Ukrainian flag in our window overlooking the Capitol here in DC. My dad is a US  veteran who feels that the Ukranians are doing the work our military trained for decades... he flies your flag over his house in Florida along with the US flag and his tropic lighning flag. 

We are ecstatic that our politicians put aside their differences (with some GOP exceptions) to revive lend lease and approve billions in support for Ukraine. We will support you until the end.  

We hope to someday visit Kyiv and Kharkiv and buy everyone we meet a drink for defending liberal democracy while we watched from the sidelines.

Not much. I knew that it was invaded in 2014 and Crimea was a thing. I knew it was a former USSR state. All in all, I only really knew how it was related with regards to US-politics (Crimea, Trump's impeachment, etc. etc.).

Also, it was that country in the board-game Risk, the last country in ""Europe"", right?

I really started to pay attention to Ukraine about last year in 2021. Believe it or not, the movement of Russian troops was becoming a big deal, and USA politics was grossly talking about Taiwan and Ukraine as the next possible battles. As far back as the Afghanistan Withdrawal (July 2021 or so) forced me to study back up on Ukraine.

I also was playing ""Hearts of Iron 3"" last year, which helped solidify my general European understandings. Sure, its about WW2, but I learned the swampy-terrain and cold winters of Ukraine in that game. So you could say that a lot of my pre-existing knowledge about Ukraine was largely video-game based.

We didn't ""know"" Russia would attack, but clearly things were heating back up again. So around that time, it became more-and-more clear that Ukraine would be a very important location to think about.

> How has the image of Ukraine changed for you?

I knew about things like ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" from history classes, but I didn't know it occurred in Crimea / Ukraine until I started studying the history of this place.

I took a world-history class a long time ago, so I'm not nearly as ignorant as most of my fellow countrymen. But I'm having to ""Relearn"" a lot of this culture to remember where Ukraine fits inside of my world-history classes. The various European wars that fought on its soil, the history of the Kyivan Rus', etc. etc. I also attended a Catholic school growing up (unlike many in USA), so there was some Religious studies about the Great Schism, Eastern-orthodoxy vs Roman Catholics, and a few other such issues that I've learned outside of my history classes.

a3f068ecf6c95a521808acee52a9e8e7,uswjch,i982r1q,"WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said, amid concerns more powerful weapons that could sink Russian warships would intensify the conflict.
Ukraine has made no secret it wants more advanced U.S. capabilities beyond its current inventory of artillery, Javelin and Stinger missiles, and other arms. Kyiv's list, for example, includes missiles that could push the Russian navy away from its Black Sea ports, allowing the restart of shipments of grain and other agricultural products worldwide.
Current and former U.S. officials and congressional sources have cited roadblocks to sending longer range, more powerful weapons to Ukraine that include lengthy training requirements, difficulties maintaining equipment, or concerns U.S. weaponry could be captured by Russian forces, in addition to the fear of escalation. read more
But three U.S. officials and two congressional sources said two types of powerful anti-ship missiles, the Harpoon made by Boeing (BA.N) and the Naval Strike Missile made by Kongsberg (KOG.OL) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N) were in active consideration for either direct shipment to Ukraine, or through a transfer from a European ally that has the missiles.
In April, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Portugal to provide the Ukrainian military with Harpoons, which have a range of up to almost 300 km.
But there are several issues keeping Ukraine from receiving the missiles. For one, there is limited availability of platforms to launch Harpoons from shore -- a technically challenging solution according to several officials -- as it is mostly a sea-based missile.
Two U.S. officials said the United States was working on potential solutions that included pulling a launcher off of a U.S. ship.
About 20 Russian Navy vessels, including submarines, are in the Black Sea operational zone, the British defense ministry has said.
Bryan Clark, a naval expert at the Hudson Institute, said 12 to 24 anti-ship missiles like the Harpoon with ranges over 100 km would be enough to threaten Russian ships and could convince Moscow to lift the blockade. ""If Putin persists, Ukraine could take out the largest Russian ships, since they have nowhere to hide in the Black Sea,"" Clark said.
Russia has already suffered losses at sea, notably the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet.
WHO GOES FIRST?
A handful of countries would be willing to send Harpoons to Ukraine, the U.S. officials and the congressional sources said. But no one wants to be the first or only nation to do so, fearing reprisals from Russia if a ship is sunk with a Harpoon from their stockpile, the third U.S official said.
That U.S. official said one country is considering being the first to supply the missile to Ukraine. Once that ""well stocked"" nation commits to sending Harpoons, others might follow, the official said.
The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) can be launched from the Ukrainian coast and has a range of 250 km. It also takes less than 14 days training to operate.
The sources said NSMs were viewed as less logistically difficult than Harpoons, because NATO allies could loan mobile ground launchers which are available, and warheads from Norway.
The first two U.S. officials and the congressional sources said the United States was trying to work out a way for Ukraine to obtain NSM and launchers from European allies.
The congressional sources said another option would be for Norway to donate NSMs to Ukraine, an idea supported by Norwegian members of parliament. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment on what additional contributions of arms and defense equipment it may consider offering to Ukraine.
All weapons requests that have U.S. content such as Harpoons and NSMs would have to be approved by the U.S. State Department, which takes guidance from the White House.
Another weapon high on Ukraine's shopping list are Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 made by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) which can strike a target 70 or more kilometers away, a three-fold increase over many of their current howitzer rounds. read more
In recent weeks, the Biden administration decided instead to send M777 towed howitzers which could be deployed faster and shipped in larger quantities, the two U.S. officials said.
The two U.S. officials said the M270 or similar system like the M142 HIMARS would be considered for shipment to Ukraine once Congress passed a $40 billion supplemental funding bill that would authorize an additional $11 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority. That lets the president authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. read more",False,1652980114.0,t3_uswjch,t1_i980fd9,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

you think Biden would sue for peace after very publicly saying that Putin had no soul ?

Vladimir Putin has no soul, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden concluded after meeting with the Russian leader at the Kremlin in 2011, according to an article in the New Yorker published online on Monday.

Biden told the magazine about his 2011 visit with Putin, who at the time was prime minister, and said he found himself just inches away from the Russian leader.

‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòMr. Prime Minister, I‚Äôm looking into your eyes, and I don‚Äôt think you have a soul,‚Äô‚Äù Biden told the magazine. ‚ÄúHe looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, ‚ÄòWe understand one another.‚Äô‚Äù

Also another point is that Russia has been losing a lot of soldiers and equipment pushing into Ukrainian defenses. If Russia would decide to dig in and defend instead then their losses might become more manageable and Ukraine's losses would likely increase.

 - NATO is a defensive alliance. Russia likes to claim that NATO is a threat, but it‚Äôs baseless propaganda. It‚Äôs purpose is to be so big and powerful that it guarantees peace and security through deterrence. If NATO decides to go on the offensive it loses all credibility in stating it is a strictly defensive pact.

 - Ok, but what about individual countries, like the United States? The second US soldiers kill Russian soldiers is when we have a real risk of this conflict escalating beyond eastern Ukraine into an all-out war between two nuclear nations.

 - The threat of Ukraine losing Donbas isn‚Äôt by any logical calculus justification to risk all-out war. If you want the US to go paint Ukraine with Russian blood, expect proportional strikes on US military facilities. Russian submarines launching missiles at Californian and Virginian naval bases and our ports is a real possibility. Don‚Äôt think Putin won‚Äôt frame it as an existential conflict and treat it as such.

 - For the first time since the war started we‚Äôre seeing Russian TV pundits, journalists, and even public figures like Lukashenko publicly admit the operation isn‚Äôt going as planned. Friends and family are just starting to realize their loved ones are dead and part of casualty counts exceeding what the government is admitting to, and public mood is turning sour, which increases internal Russian domestic pressure to end the fighting. If NATO were to get involved you‚Äôd see public opinion skyrocket and harden to the likes of America after 9/11.

'Only USA is talking about nuclear weapons (absolutely laughable), USA could nuke Ukraine and blame it on the Russians

' Ukraine Nazis could have done Bucha'

And for me the highlight, as its not just regurgitated Russian bullshit

'Europe is not sovereign, they have done sanctions on Russia, that doesn't seem like sovereignty to me, the Americans make them do it' 

He literally can not see why a European country would not want and would try to punish a nation for causing a war on their continent. For all the terrorism, false flags, nuclear threats, far right sponsoring Russia does in Europe, he actually seems to believe the europeans love Russia without pre condition. Yet no comment on the much more direct attack on the sovereignty of Ukraine.

Encirclements only matter if the encircled troops can't escape and/or can't be resupplied. If the Ukrainian troops just retreat, its a tradeoff of land for enemy soldiers, which is **always worthwhile**.

Strategically and Tactically speaking, Russians are throwing away their men to capture territory. Territory that the Russians won't be able to hold, because they've lost too many men. The more dead Russian troops, the fewer, weaker, and pointless their defense will be. The inevitable June/July counterattack would steamroll the few demoralized and weakened Russians remaining.

------------

If you know that the Ukrainians are going to counterattack, the Russians need to be **massing** units, and building strong defenses for them across the line.

As long as Ukraine is fighting a war with effectively infinite NATO dick-wagging contest money and a reasonable number of foreign volunteers cycling in, any month that passes is going to at least benefit their ultimate defense strategy. Russia, on the other hand, wanted a short war and has to push very hard into infinite NATO artillery for every gain they make. To make a push in the first place, Russia has to logistically supply a force of trained soldiers. They have seemingly been failing to do that on an eye-popping level for months now...

As long as Ukraine can keep inflicting real material losses to Russia, this isn't quite on the same scale for Russia as the United States' military embarrassments were for it. Ultimately, the US sort of wanted to be in disgusting bloody embarrassing forever wars to waste Raytheon and Northrup Grummon money. Russia in this war is seemingly almost as desperate as Ukraine is and they seem to have forgotten that this war isn't going to end until they either effectively push the Ukrainians back to Kyev again or build an umbrella that can stop artillery shells from hitting their entrenchments.

 >The war in Donbas is an armed conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine, part of the broader Russo-Ukrainian War. In March 2014, immediately following the Euromaidan protest movement and subsequent Revolution of Dignity, protests by pro-Russian, anti-government separatist groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, collectively called the Donbas. These demonstrations began around the same time as Russia's annexation of Crimea, and were part of wider pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine.

software (of all kinds) is all about covering all the edge cases and error conditions as well as any malicious actors' petty rules lawyering while still meeting the objective successfully (no matter if it's the back end of a commerce site, a new pro-abortion law, or a mutual defense treaty).",False,1652987164.0,t3_uswjch,t1_i98grzi,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

In the past, in English, this was commonly translated to ""the Ukraine"", referring to it as a region rather than a sovereign nation. 

The argument is that now Ukraine is a sovereign nation with a distinct national identity, they deserve to have a name that follows usual English rules of naming countries, without the definite article (the). 

People who don't understand English or just want to troll throw up ""exceptions"" like the Netherlands/Philippines, or the UK/USA. In the former case, these countries are so named because historically they were a plurality of areas and so took a plural name with the article. Traditionalists might argue that such historical precedent can be applied to Ukraine too but neither the Netherlands nor the Philippines are facing massive threats to nationhood, and in general Ukrainians and many sympathetic to Ukraine recognize and are fine with changing to regular naming rules.

In the case of the UK/USA, it's customary to use the article with the full official title of a country. For example, we say Russia, but ""the Russian Federation"".

108f17d6573188a5881cc3eb801e0575,uswjch,i9804tg,"> Basically, the word Ukraine comes from a Russian noun meaning ""borderlands"", 

As far as I know, that might be a case of bad linguistics and is what is the cause of the arguments. 

The word ""krai/Kraj/–∫—Ä–∞–π"" which roughly translates to ""land/country"" exists in most Slavic languages (including most geographically close neighbors of Ukraine: Slovak Polish and Belarusian languages) except in Russian where only the word ""borderland"" (–æ–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–∞) remains and the country is translated as ""—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞"".

And that's where the opinions start to differ. Russian or Russian-aligned linguists claim that the origin of the word ""Ukraine"" is the Russian word ""–æ–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–∞"" while Ukrainian or Ukrainian-aligned linguists claim that the origin of the word is a shorthand of the phrase ""in a country"" ""—É –∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ"". The latter is in some ways supported by Ukrainian poetry that uses forms ""–í–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞/–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞"" (Vkraine/Ukraine) interchangeably (–≤/y are two forms of the preposition ""in"" that are used similarly to a/an).

In Ukraine, this question is extremely political as the first interpretation supports the idea that Ukraine as a country is a Russian invention while the second indicates that the country's name originated from the Ukrainian language and so the language itself is not an invention of Austro-Hungarian emperors as the Russian propaganda is claiming. 

This question of the origin is the real political background of the problem, the rest are merely the consequences of it. The most frequent one is the distinction between ""–≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ/–Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ"" in Russian. The distinction between ""Ukraine"" and ""the Ukraine"" is another debate that comes from the same origin point.",False,1652979066.0,t3_uswjch,t1_i97qdq7,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

It doesn't include articles like ""the"" or ""a"" or ""is"", they're inferred parts of communication.

I guess what I'm saying is it could also be similar to how people refer to ""red states"" and ""blue states"", or ""the South"", and Australia is ""down under"", etc., And how we call a lot of countries ""ex-Soviet"" etc.

Either way, I fully agree that it's 100% encoded language that refers to Ukraine as an extension of the Russian Empire. I'm just not convinced that it's always used purely with malicious intent, as opposed to a relative geographical term or an outdated term.

It looks like the same bit of woodland but whether they got quite the right spot seems to be in doubt - looks like they're off to one side a bit to me.

Correct, like when I don't insert my opinion about what I thought Biden would do or has done.  And you read that and then address me directly on my opinion of Biden, it shows a complete lack or reading comprehension or understanding of the English language.

It's interesting that you still choose to not address the fact that your entire little term paper was addressed to me and my opinion of Biden, when I clearly and repeatedly talked only about what Putin thought of America's potential response in the lead about to the invasion.
