>The exchange is more honest and direct than anything you‚Äôd expect in this breakaway statelet. Bibilov criticizes individual soldiers for returning from the front and complaining about problems in combat. The soldiers push back, describing absolute chaos.

>‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt know this, but a lot of guys have already come to me, asking to be sent [to the front], and they‚Äôre not talking about money or ‚ÄòGive us weapons.‚Äô‚Äù Trying to shame the soldiers for requesting weapons!!

>The soldiers told Bibilov how they were deployed to areas 800 kilometers away from where they were supposed to be, artillery fire missed targets by 2 kilometers, but officers didn‚Äôt care, and groups were constantly ambushed due to the lack of battlefield intel. An utter mess.

>In late March, roughly 300 soldiers from South Ossetia refused to fight under these conditions and returned home. About 100 have since reenlisted and some of these guys are already back at the front. A couple dozen are still disputing their dishonorable discharges in court.

Day 70 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was just a single confirmed shelling and it was very quiet around my area. Apparently Arestovych even said that artillery is now pushed back far enough from Kharkiv that they can‚Äôt reach the city anymore, which is great news, though I think their MLRSs still might reach us. When we look out the window in the direction of Belgorod, we can still see constant flashes on the horizon, and we can hear the sound from them too.

Also today the Russian RIA Novosti reported that ‚Äúpunitive groups of SBU (Security Service of Ukraine)‚Äù and ‚Äúbattalion Kraken made up of criminals‚Äù have entered Staryi Saltiv under the guise of Ukrainian Armed Forces. This most likely means that they lost it, and soon we might get confirmation of it being liberated. The bridge over the Siverskyi Donets also might have been destroyed.

Actually just now as I‚Äôm writing this, there was an official confirmation that Staryi Saltiv has been liberated, though I‚Äôm not sure if the bridge is still standing, we will probably get information about that soon.

There was also a report from Staryi Saltiv which said that the whole town has been completely ransacked. Apparently they stole literally everything they could get their hands on: windows, doors and even *the floor* (linoleum). They tore out the fucking floor and took it with them, the fuck?

Their RIA Novosti is a real goldmine too, first they told us about ‚Äúnationalistic flying squadrons of death‚Äù that apparently drive on the streets of Kharkiv and shoot at residential buildings. This is news to me, but Russia never lies so of course it can‚Äôt be anything else but the truth.

But now they are on an entirely new level of bullshit. Now they are saying that they found signs of black magic being used in our army‚Äôs HQ. They also came to a conclusion that apparently those black magic users are *anarcho-fascists*. What even is this? Who writes this? Are they saying that they are not making much progress because their enemy is cheating and using black magic?

I don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but saying that our army is using flying squadrons of death and black magic sounds pretty metal. In fact it sounds more like an advertisement than anything else, ‚Äúcome to Ukrainian Armed Forces, here you can become a black magician!‚Äù",1651703234.0,1651702988.0,t3_uhy47q,t3_uhy47q,,0,217,0,217,5,0,{'gid_1': 2}

> Since new systems allow units to remain passive and yet see the battlefield clearly, the defense will have a distinct advantage. Electro-optical and electronic warfare sensors can provide a great deal of information that, combined with external sensors such as satellites and drones, can allow the defenders to visualize the battlefield without revealing their own positions.

---

> In contrast, attackers will have to move if they intend to execute anything but strike missions against the defender. The very act of moving will create a signature. While attackers will retain the traditional advantage of selecting the time and place of attack, the advantage of physically massing either offensive or defensive forces is declining as weapons ranges increase dramatically. Mass can be achieved by assembling long-range fires rather than massing forces. This favors the defender since attackers may well be forced to pass through restrictive chokepoints, while defenders can disperse to the maximum effective range of their weapons. However, as the Azerbaijanis demonstrated against the Armenians, the offense can remain dominant if the attacker adopts modern concepts and weapons while the defender relies on 20th-century weapons and concepts.

All in all, an interesting think-tank piece on the nature of warfare. We will see if Ukraine/Russia conflict concurs with this 2021-era assessment, or if it will have to be revised.

The theory of this piece can be tl;dr as follows: We're in a period of defensive-dominance. When attackers move on the battlefield, their very act of moving can be picked up by drones and/or satellites. Since defenders are NOT moving, they cannot be picked up upon **unless they choose** to move.

> The Soviets intervened militarily in Hungary in 1956 (as they did in the GDR in 1953 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968) for several reasons. First among them was certainly strategic considerations, the desire to maintain the integrity of the Warsaw Pact and thus their battle lines in the event of a war with the West, which they never stopped thinking about. Then there were the power-ideological considerations: it would be dangerous to admit that in some country the people had the right to abolish the communist regime; it would be a precedent that one day someone might want to repeat, perhaps in Moscow. From the point of view of the Soviet regime, these were reasonable and practical reasons. But one cannot underestimate another that has always been attached to them - all the more so because it is still in play: the myth of the irreversibility and sacredness of the results of the Second World War.

> Here we are no longer dealing with Russia disguised as the USSR, but with Russia itself, with the core of its thinking and beliefs.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been giving details to the European Parliament of a sixth package of sanctions targeting Russia's economy, its military and propaganda. She said that Russia's Vladimir Putin wanted to wipe Ukraine from the map and would not succeed and it was his own country that was sinking.  
  
""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" she said. ""So in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and at the same time be very careful that we minimise the impact on the global market.""  
  
The big question is whether two EU countries, Hungary and Slovakia, will be allowed exemptions from the oil embargo. Von der Leyen made no mention of any exemption, but said crude oil imports would be phased out over six months and refined products by the end of 2022.  
  
""Thus we maximise pressure on Russia while at the same time we minimise the collateral damage on us and our partners around the globe. We have to ensure that our economy remains strong.""  
  
She went on to give details of a package of relief and reconstruction for Ukraine: ""We want to Ukraine to win this war,"" she said. Von der Leyen said Ukraine's economic output was set to fall by 35%-50% in 2022 and it would need ‚Ç¨5bn a month just to keep going.

With this sort of context, it's not too hard to understand why Russia has been going all out on Ukraine's rail infrastructure recently. They're exhausted, demoralized, and scared of what's coming.

So whenever you think about all the good we're doing in Ukraine with supplying weapons, you can realize how far Ukraine has come from Russia and the USSR.

The ONLY confirmed bot/disinfo operation I have been able to spot that is targeting this comment section and /r/worldnews in general are comments trying to advocate for hate and genocide towards the Russian population.

There was a comment in this thread, that was upvoted and had positive feedback, within the last few hours from an account I suspect to be from this ring. At least, it was a six year old account, with only two posts two years ago, and then less than a dozen comments this week. All of them clearly designed to make people hate Russians.

This has always been Russia's MO in online operations. They've literally never run an operation online that was not designed to inflame racial tensions. In 2013 and 2014, they split Russian speaking Ukraine from Ukrainian speaking Ukraine, in 2015 and 2015 they enflamed both pro BLM and anti BLM feelings within the US, and during this conflict they are appearing to try to make the Russian people and the western people angry at each other, instead of everyone being angry at Putin and Russian leadership.

Regardless of what your feelings of the Russian people are (it's pretty complex) please be aware that there are inorganic forces trying to inflame negative feelings.

> Footage of the pro-war hysteria at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium has gone around the world. As did Putin's speech, in which he threatened ""Western-thinking Russians"" that the nation would ""spit them out like flies"" and thus ""carry out self-purification."" For many, it reminded them more of the atmosphere of the NSDAP congresses at Nuremberg and of German fanaticism in the 1930s than of Soviet times. Greater-Russian aggression is similarly megalomaniacal to that of the Nazis. But somehow it lacks the ability to translate words into action.

> Nazi Germany had enough people willing to die for Hitler until the fall of the Third Reich. In the early victorious years, it was the elite divisions of the SS and a good part of the Wehrmacht. And in the last months of the war, there were still plenty of members of the Hilterjugend, the fanatical youth who had experienced nothing but the F√ºhrer and his regime and were ready to face Soviet tanks with nothing but a Panzerfaust in their hands.

> **Slaughterhouse**

> The debacle of the Russian attempted blitzkrieg in Ukraine, however, offers a different picture. Putin's army, for years held up to the skies by state propaganda as a force that would stop only on the western European shores of the Atlantic when it felt like it, did not even reach Kharkiv after less than a month of fighting.

> **Fight, you stinkers!**

> Yet the very demographic that forms the backbone of the Russian forces, young people under thirty, has long shown the lowest support for Vladimir Putin's policies and the overall direction of Russia. The core of popular Putinism lies on the other side of the age curve. According to the Russian research center Levada, 73 percent of Russians over the age of fifty-five agreed with Putin's policies in February 2021. Support for aggression against Ukraine is now hitting the 85 percent mark among the same group.

> Militant aunties with permanent headdresses adore the god Putin and his prophet Vladimir Solovyov (this host of an extremely watched talk show plays the role of a kind of TV Goebbels in Russia) and fully support any Russian aggression, including a possible nuclear attack on the West in general and the US in particular. As a staple, they are present in virtually every state propaganda outlet. 
Ordinary Russians of retirement and near-retirement age who are solidly behind Putin usually share the following characteristics: they have never been outside Russia, they get their information exclusively from television or state-controlled platforms such as the Vkontakte network, and they see the Putin era as redemption from the humiliation, shame, and chaos of the 1990s, when a ridiculous drunk was at the helm of a declining country.

> In a rapidly aging and dying Russia, they make up about thirty percent of the population. They are hoping that the authoritarian Tsar Putin will be the one to beat out of the younger generation an unhealthy admiration for Western luxury, culture and conveniences, as well as a downright dangerous leaning towards liberal values. For example, by sending them to the front line, where boys obsessed with Instagram and Nike sneakers will become real Russian men. Sending more young Russians to the Ukrainian meat grinder is thus most encouraged by a demographic in Russian society that is personally in no danger of such a thing.

> The bloodthirsty pensioners, however, are happy to hear about the next ""victorious advance of our troops"" on the evening news, comfortably ensconced on the sofa. While in the Czech Republic, the aggressive geriatric and terrorist Balda had to get his ""guaranteed information"" about the Praguers, the youth, the refugees, the West and the world in general through obscure websites and chain emails, in Russia the same propaganda is being blasted to the seniors by all media twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

d9f8e6a757b9f39217c8ab0c53065385,uhy47q,i79hqhu,"Okay,

Been thinking about this for a few hours.  This war has been absolutely devastating for Russia's equipment store piles.  I know we have all seen the big numbers of losses and thought 'wow, those are big', but let's put some of them into perspective.

**Tanks**

Before the war, Russia started with about \~2400 active duty tanks.  The balance of the claimed 12/13K inventory are in various stages of storage and decay.  These are some of the better tanks in storage: https://i.redd.it/cir7emcdwlr81.jpg .  You can see they have little to no reactive armor and are decades old.  There is no tell what condition any of the hydraulics, seals, etc., are in on those tanks.  We don't know if the engine can run or the condition of the turret and barrel.  I mention all of that to say those tanks aren't going to be re-entering the battle in any sort of hurry, and if they do enter in a hurry they aren't likely to last long with or without enemy fire.

So let's assume Russia had maybe 3K serviceable tanks at the outset of the war.  We know that Oryx has visually confirmed over 600 tank kills.  We also know Ukraine claims over 1,000.  Now it is entirely reasonable that not every tank kill would have been photographed/videoed and those that were maybe not all made their way to Oryx.  Based on this I am tempted to lean more towards the Ukraine number.. but in the interest of a reasonable assessment I don't want to give them the full count... so I will split the difference plus a bit (which I think is fair) and lets baseline the killed, abandoned, captured tanks number at 850 at this point in the war.

Now it is easy to just stop there and say well, that's 28.3% of Russia's tanks gone.  You'd be right to a limited degree as well.  But there are two factors we haven't accounted for yet;

First of all we have to deal with readiness rate.  Tanks (and most complex equipment) aren't always ready for service, even if they are on active duty rosters.  Things break during exercises, moving them around, etc.  Parts wear out and need to be replaced.  We could be very generous and give Russia's standing tank fleet an 80% readiness rate.  Given the extensive age of their equipment it is unlikely to be this high.  I'm only going with it for two reasons: 1) Russia doesn't publish the data that I can find and 2) their older tanks are simpler and less like to suffer the electronic inspired breakdowns of modern tanks.

That means Russia's total available tanks at any one time are not likely to exceed 2,400.

The next number we need to consider is how many tanks have been withdrawn suffering battle damage that may make them still drivable but not combat ready.  It is safe to assume based on the huge numbers of tanks Russia has abandoned that this seems to be their preferred method of dealing with this gear, however, with the big withdrawal from the Kyiv area, it is likely they had at least a few in this condition.  It is also likely that more have been abandoned for these reasons in the current occupied areas around Kharkiv and in the south, but we haven't seen them yet due to Ukraine not controlling the territory and Russia not bragging about dead tanks.   Let's conservatively put the number at another 150 tanks.  

Interestingly from historical data I could find readiness during combat for tanks was on the order of no more than 50-60% in real combat situations, so the 150 numbers is very fair.  

That all boils down to, conservatively, this war has taken 1,000 out of 2,400 available tanks out of service.  Things like sanctions are going to conflate the readiness rate numbers, and I have been VERY generous with both those and the number that could be ready from storage.  In reality Russia may be up to losing half their active tank fleet.

 From CNN‚Äôs Delia Gallagher in Rome

Pope Francis warned the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, not to become ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs altar boy,‚Äù he said in an interview this week. 

In his strongest words to date against the pro-war Patriarch, Francis also slammed Kirill for endorsing Russia‚Äôs stated reasons for invading Ukraine.

‚ÄúI spoke to him for 40 minutes via Zoom,‚Äù the Pope told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe first 20 minutes he read to me, with a card in hand, all the justifications for war.‚Äù

‚ÄúI listened and told him: I don‚Äôt understand anything about this,"" said the Pope. ""Brother, we are not clerics of state, we cannot use the language of politics but that of Jesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Patriarch cannot transform himself into Putin‚Äôs altar boy,‚Äù the Pope said.

Francis said the conference call with Kirill took place on March 16, and that both he and the Patriarch had agreed to postpone a planned meeting on June 14 in Jerusalem.

‚ÄúIt would be our second face-to-face meeting, nothing to do with the war,‚Äù the Pope said. ‚ÄúBut now, he too agrees: let‚Äôs stop, it could be an ambiguous signal.‚Äù

In March Kirill Patriarch Kirill said that the conflict was an extension of a fundamental culture clash between the wider Russian world and Western liberal values, exemplified by expressions of gay pride.

Experts say that Kirill's comments offer important insights into Putin's larger spiritual vision of a return to a Russian Empire, in which the Orthodox religion plays a pivotal role.

But the hardline stance of the Russian patriarch is costing him followers.

In March the Russian Orthodox church in Amsterdam announced it was severing ties with the leader, joining a growing number of priests and churches who are abandoning Moscow over the war in Ukraine.

https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-04-22/h_8a547b31ba42574343fd0202e0b23c07

I got two takeaways from this:
Kirill read the justifications for the war from a card like a damn bot, for 20 minutes. I wonder if the Pope's brain melted listening to that shit like Macron's melts every time he speaks to putler. 

The Pope used the altar boy comparison knowing full well the implications of that phrase now.

Is that a good advertisement? When the commanders who truly fought, from the locals, they were simply assassinated. And killed not by Ukrs. They were killed because they were in the way of bringing to power all this crap that was destroying the practically flourishing region of Donbas, at least for Ukraine it was flourishing. They were doing it for 8 years - what's this all about? Could it not reflect overall on the people's moods? It did reflect. Real incomes plummeted, significantly. The authorities showed that this whole Russian world it's nothing to them.

Russia is going to loudly and publicly present a 'peace agreement', allowing itself some very limited territory and probably some bullshit 'rights' for 'ethnic Russians' against 'Nazis' blah blah. This will be used so that, back at home, Putin can argue that Russia achieved its goals and it's Nato/EU/'The West's fault that they refused peace and 'opted for war'. The trolls are saying 'The EU economy will collapse without Russia' which is obvious nonsense but this is intended for internal consumption only, where they control the media and can lie with impunity.

This can later be used to either pull back and claim 'Nato are crazy' and thus it's not Putin's fault, or to justify a full mobilisation.

This could well happen on May 9th, but I sense even Russia has yet to decide that since the picture on the ground is so mobile.

This is all irrelevant to Ukraine who are strengthening by the day and can more-or-less ignore anything Russia says now.

Brazil‚Äôs Lula says Zelenskyy shares blame for Ukraine war

Brazilian presidential front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin bear equal responsibility for the war in Ukraine, putting the leftist icon at odds with Western powers.

‚ÄúI see the president of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,‚Äù Lula, Brazil‚Äôs president from 2003 to 2010, told Time magazine.

‚ÄúThis guy [Zelensky] is as responsible as Putin for the war,‚Äù he added.

The remarks will likely raise eyebrows in the US and Europe, which are supplying military support to Ukraine and have hit Russia with punishing sanctions over an invasion widely seen in the West as an act of unprovoked Russian aggression.",False,1651692924.0,t3_uhy47q,t3_uhy47q,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Everyone likes to talk about what Putin will do on May 9th. My wild theory is that if there is going to be a coup, it will be on that day.

Reasoning: 

1. Putin is currently hiding in a bunker or behind very long tables for fear of an assassination, but that is the one day of the year he has to be out in the open.

2. Most of Russia's forces, including a lot of Putin's Rosgvardiya is getting decimated and out fighting, leaving Russia weaker than normal internally. That and they'll also have to spare people to do the stupid parade. May 9th is also the day where a lot of crowd control will be needed, stretching the police even thinner.

3. A lot of sabotage has been happening in Russia recently, some very far from the front lines suggesting that it could very well be internal forces at work. This points to a far larger internal opposition than anyone realizes.

4. Putin's arrogance could also make him more vulnerable, as his narcissism might make it so that he cannot imagine that he will be touched on his precious victory day.

5. I just think it'll be really funny if he gets overthrown in live TV.

I randomly came across [this](https://youtu.be/268zZqs-rvI) small Danish YouTuber, his prediction video inspired me to come up with my own theory about where this is going next. Here me out on this. 

- Existing RU forces are going to stop trying advance, instead opting to camp the parts of Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson they control. They will try to slow down the looming Ukranian counter offensive while the Kremlin works on 'totally legit' referendum.

- Once they've formally annexed these territories, they may call further 'acts of agression' from UA against their 'legally' post-referendum annexed states as illegal and use it as pretext to deploy some reservists to the region. Possibly threaten nukes in the guise of 'perceived existential threat'.

- If they fail to hold and the UA counter-offensives get too attritional, Russia is going to capitulate and accept defeat (not publicly), and a slow systemic withdrawl will take place. 

- Putin will attempt to keep his power by framing the narrative as not a 'loss', but a tactical retreat in preparation for a formal declaration of war with the West. He will announce that the western weapon supplying and the sanctions are proof that we are in WWIII. 

- He might step down and elect a puppet leader at the end of his 2024 term, the new leader will be more hardliner about how they plan to help China secure Taiwan, and other pursuits leading to a direct military confrontation with the West. State media will quadruple down on the warmongering rhethoric, more language of global reset. They may try to extend the conscript service terms while attempting a complete reform and overhaul of Russia's armed forces.

- Sabre rattling dial is going to get cranked up to 11. We're going to see alot more disruptive politics and Nuclear tests. Russia is going to be place in an indefinite wartime preparedness state.",False,1651702368.0,t3_uhy47q,t3_uhy47q,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

ed069749f9bc3eb6172a3a2f0149dabd,uhy47q,i79l889,"I have little doubt Russia is going to mobilize their reserves on or by May 9th, unless Putin himself has resigned to lose this war. The polls in Russia show sufficient support for Putin and the war so far. The Russian propaganda machine is working, and the voices and strength of the opposition are relatively dead. Sanctions do not stop wars, which has been correctly pointed out by many already, especially in the case of Russia which is too resource rich.

Russia‚Äôs aggressive nuclear rhetoric suggests to me that they intend to do whatever it takes to keep NATO out, and possibly to also use nukes to hold onto any captured territory that Russia appears to be able to hold onto conventionally for a sustained period of time before, and if, Ukraine‚Äôs counter-offensive momentum begins to manifest. That latter threat is coming, mark my words. 

From the perspective of sociopathic rulers, the goals achieved by the capture of strategically and economically important territory is a timeless achievement that will always brush away the costs of lives lost. Their subjects are just materials to be used to achieve the geopolitical aims of the state. History remembers borders and leaders, not the lives of soldiers.

So Putin will gladly waste the lives of tens of thousands of more young men and boys to achieve those goals in Ukraine. Sanctions? A decent gamble that they‚Äôll be relatively temporary even if very crippling in the short term. No more than a few years, maybe a decade, for the biggest sanction measures, because Russia is just too resource rich and many non-rich or non-Western nations of the world are neither emotionally invested, nor able to be invested, in European stability. Still, against the backdrop of our future historical record, does Putin care about such short term economic consequences for the Russian people if it means he can achieve some measure of long term victory in Ukraine? Doubt it.

Tens of thousands of dead working age Russian men? Russia is in a population decline anyways and that will not change with or without this war, because the leaders and those who will lead after them, are too corrupt to put the country first. Putin had to act before either Ukraine had modernized and westernized too much, or Russia had fallen too far behind demographically and/or militarily to invade. Also, their Soviet era stockpiles may finally just reach the point of no return in the near future. The war will expedite the decline but the time to act works still be now, not later.

A depleted military as a result of this war? Russia doesn‚Äôt even need a navy or airforce, because they have thousands of ICBMs, and a willingness to threaten their use just as North Korea does in order to get their way. Rest assured that shift in Russia‚Äôs diplomatic approach will be coming aswell. It already started, they are already threatening to use nukes even when they are not existentially threatened themselves.

Political change has to come violently to Russia, but the polls indicate so far that it won‚Äôt happen domestically, and the thousands of Russian nukes dictate that change cannot happen by foreign hands either. Maybe domestic sentiment will change but that depends how well the Russian propaganda machine can sustain the fraud it is committing against the Russian mind. North Korea is going on for more than 50 years strong, so let‚Äôs not get our hopes up.

Unlike just about every other conflict that has taken place since the nuclear bombings of Japan, a nuclear power likely intends to use and threaten the use of nukes to hold onto and annex the conventionally captured adjacent territory of a non-nuclear adversary. If that scenario happens, Ukraine‚Äôs ability to push Russia back to 2014 lines will be perilous indeed.

So, continuing on with my point, if Putin is willing to just hold onto captured territories by drawing his own red line for using nuclear weapons for ‚Äúdefense‚Äù, then it gives him a lot more military options. Russia might not have American aid to back them up now like it did in WW2, but they are willing to throw their men into the bloodbath for victory and maybe that is enough. They wont need many soldiers alive to hold the line afterwards afterall.

Putin wants his victory, and in order to achieve a minimal victory then he needs to push Ukrainian lines back far enough such that all economic and resource centres in the east and south of Ukraine are outside the Ukrainian military‚Äôs artillery range. A nuclear red line is far less likely to hold up against artillery strikes, in my opinion, but that is not impossible if Putin is crazy enough anyways.

I can see a red line being threatened and adhered to by Putin with respect to the movement of Ukrainian ground forces onto captured Ukrainian territory. Not sure when Russia may pivot to this strategy but I fear it is coming.

Nevertheless, such a victory for Russia doesn‚Äôt look possible yet, to push Ukraine far enough from eastern Donbas and the southern cities, unless full mobilization happens. With full mobilization, then maybe we will see such a Russian ‚Äúvictory‚Äù come to fruition in 6-12 months from now. 

Can Russia, or Putin for that matter, keep this conflict going for that long without complete economic or political calamity? What is Putin‚Äôs alternative really? He has set up his power structure and the story of this war in such a way that he must not lose at all cost. I think he goes for it. The only way I see full mobilization not impacting the outcome of this war is if either the Russian people finally revolt and political change happens swiftly, or Putin feels like such an outcome would take place if he were to call for full mobilization. However, without full mobilization, any measure of victory is simply out of reach for Russia except for the land they currently hold.",1651650317.0,1651649731.0,t3_uhy47q,t3_uhy47q,,0,-29,0,-29,0,0,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also proposed that Sberbank, Russia‚Äôs largest bank, and two other major banks be disconnected from the SWIFT international banking payment system.

Von der Leyen, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, called on the EU‚Äôs member nations to phase out imports of crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year.



‚ÄúWe will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimizes the impact on global markets,‚Äù von der Leyen said.

The fundamental problem in this war isn't attack/defence but the complete inadequacy of Russian combined arms off the back of really bad C3i. At its most basic, Russia has struggled to get Fire Support, Air Support and coordination of multiple force elements into one focused attack, across every theatre.

Combined arms is still king, if done well it still works regardless of the enemy intel. Precisely because you can pick the time and the place and good allied imagery can pick out defensive positions as easily as a drone can pick up movement signatures.

But the war aside, the reason I think this piece is way off is that imaging and intel doesn't require movement to function. It just doesn't work like that.

And intel can just as easily give the attackers information about a quick-response force moving to defend as it can giving the defenders information on the attack.

A cautionary tale to everyone who reads think-tank pieces - never assume they are right; they are wrong as often or more often as they are right. But it's not their job to be right but to think about possibilities and causalities. They also often have contributors that don't have **recent** Operational experience.

Still - interesting piece.

Russian energy imports include coal, natural gas, oil, refined oil (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, ...), uranium. 

End-Uses might include:
- transportation (aviation, rail, road, shipping)
- heating (homes, buildings, or water)
- cooling
- electricity (domestic, commercial, industrial, powering EV)
- manufacturing (giant furnaces to melt and manufacture things)

Then look for sectors that COULD be shifted in some way off of Russian energy. Temporarily shutting down European data centers and instead using USA data centers, and then increasing network bandwidth. (USA has plenty of electricity, even if powered by more US natural gas usage, local production and local pipelines don't compete with LNG export). Even if European data centers are ""technically"" powered by renewables, they do cause displacement. Ireland could shut down data centers, and then export power to the continent. Pricing European aviation, that uses Russian fuels, such that rail is the more cost effective choice. Maybe add self-imposed tariffs on Russian energy so that the market finds a way to stop using it. Rapidly replacing gas powered clothes dryer with sun-powered clotheslines or electric heat pump dryer. Heat-pump home heating. Heat-pump water heating. Heat-pump powered cars, heat-pump powered airplanes :p

Could we run trans-atlantic power cables, connecting US/Canada to Greenland to Iceland to UK to continental Europe? Then the US just exports electricity? Ditto for gas pipeline? I'm sure there's technical obstacles, but these initiatives could play out in a future global low cost low carbon power system. The sun always shines somewhere on Earth.

Yulia Marukhnenko poses for a photo in the Dnipro Academic Drama & Comedy Theatre.
Yulia Marukhnenko also had been renting an apartment near the theater. When she heard the bang, Marukhnenko first looked to the field kitchen, but she knew everybody there was buried. So she rushed to the basements.

Trained in first aid, with a full kit on hand, she was facing problems no first aid could begin to help: limbs attached to no bodies, bodies with no limbs, bones sticking out. Those were the ones who died, either on the spot or in the days afterwards in a city with almost no functioning hospitals. One woman had her leg amputated but died anyway.

Marukhnenko and the two police officers working alongside her said a dozen people were pulled from the rubble, the last one around 4 p.m., six hours after the airstrike. Her name was Nadia.

Still in shock, Nadia said the explosion pulled her young son and husband away, and they died in the basement. The woman cradled a dachshund that belonged to her son, who had named the puppy Gloria. Nadia begged her rescuers to take the dog.

She asked for a cigarette. She said she hadn‚Äôt smoked for seven months because her son had asked her to quit. But there was no longer anybody to quit for.

Nadia was taken to the hospital, and Marukhnenko doesn‚Äôt know what happened to her. The dog is with Marukhnenko still.

‚ÄúIf Nadia has survived, tell her that Gloria is fine,‚Äù Marukhnenko said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs eating well, she‚Äôs all right, and she‚Äôs with me.‚Äù

>The theater now lies in ruins, with its side and center blackened by fire. Russian forces control the neighborhood around it, and AP video shows heavy equipment swarming the rubble to further dismantle it. But the questions remain: How many bodies are there, and what happened to them?

A police officer who passed the theater a week after the airstrike said the smell of death was overpowering. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he still has relatives in Russia-controlled territory. Video taken by Russian state media shows no bodies inside, contrary to the descriptions of multiple witnesses.

The lack of bodies led the police officer and a Mariupol Red Cross official to speculate that perhaps fewer than 500 people died, but most survivors suggested the bodies were either pulverized into the dust or removed by the Russians. With the site off-limits to investigators and the rubble itself taken away, witness testimony and photos and video of the theater before and after it was bombed will be crucial, said Clint Williamson, who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues from 2006 to 2009.

‚ÄúWithout being able to get to the scene, it is going to be difficult to go much beyond that,‚Äù he said.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has declared the attack on the Mariupol drama theater an ‚Äúegregious violation‚Äù of international humanitarian law. The organization‚Äôs mid-April report found that ‚Äúthose who ordered or executed it committed a war crime.‚Äù It also found no dispute that the destruction of the theater was deliberate.

>This finding was echoed by two munitions experts interviewed by the AP, who said the scope of the destruction points to a 500-kilogram bomb from a Russian warplane.

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much too much for an artillery shell,‚Äù said Mark Cancian, an explosives analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former artillery officer. ‚ÄúThe fact that it hit square on would lead me to believe that‚Äôs what they were aiming at.‚Äù

 - The Russia has tried to 'steal' Crimea before, multiple times, so it's a huge goal for them and they're never going to stop trying.

 - The geopolitical ramifications of Ukraine shifting to a EU or western alignment is catastrophic for Russia; and so is the economic relationship - especially if Ukraine gets to develop oil and gas resources. Ukraine is poised to become a massive economic powerhouse, and Russia can't abide with that competition.

 - The strategic propaganda moves Russia has made since 1991 are aimed at weakening the EU, and NATO in particular, but much moreso since around 1999-2000. This was to prevent Ukraine from making this alignment shift. Russia had a ton of success in this area, but ultimately failed. 

The only head-scratcher is: Russia had planned to do this for decades, but failed to build-up their army - and after the disasters of Afghanistan and Chechnya, you'd think they'd have learned their lessons and taken this seriously.  Putin very much failed; catastrophically, to reign-in the kleptocracy. And ended up keeping himself in the dark on his most critical asset for bringing this plan to fruition.

I've seen this argument before and it seems pretty good to me but the big thing I wonder about is how capable Russia is of defending without mobilization. We all know attacking is probably too costly but just how stable are the Russian controlled territory? From some reports we've heard Ukraine is waiting on counter-attacking for the moment as they are switching to new equipment and Russia's offensive is over. So maybe there's this false sense of security from Russia's side? Or maybe we on the pro-Ukrainian side are just being too hopeful about the future counter-attack and it will be really hard.

Depends on who would have taken over. From a few times she's appeared on the news, Yulia Svyrydenko (Vice President) seems a pretty inspiring character too, she's just not had as much airtime.

The US is probably intercepting every single communication signal from both sides. Russia can‚Äôt fight a war in radio silence, so they accept the transparency of their signals. They know we know. [Edit: maybe not at the individual combatant level, but at least at the upper command level.]

I‚Äôm sure Russia has secure communications available at the highest levels. We break it, they rebuild it. They break ours, we rebuild it. What they don‚Äôt have is even marginally secure handheld radio equipment in the field. Electronic warfare aviation is certainly in the air, intercepting any signals. I doubt that you can win a war with EW alone. But the sum of all the individual advantages Ukraine has received (organizational and technological) from the US and other allies is more than just quantitative. Taking out command and control is one result. Taking out individual pieces of artillery, tanks, and ships is another. 

I am sure that Ukraine can hold out, at some level, indefinitely so long as the supply chain keeps working. But I don‚Äôt think the Russian political system can last that long.

Russian casualties aren‚Äôt going to reach 50,000, nor will they hastily withdraw in chaos without something breaking. Either the current leadership will vacate, or will become extremely desperate.

Putin thought he was going to be Hitler kicking off his war of conquest in Poland, and he wound up being Mussolini trying and failing to make long-term gains in Africa/Greece.  The Russian Army has lost any mystique it once held as the fighting force of a World Power, it's been exposed for the grifting and dishonorable institution that it is, its' actions have bankrupted its' home country, and worst of all it's now effectively been completely defanged in on the World's stage.

The Russian Army barely has the force projection to operate 50 miles outside of its' own borders, and in order to accomplish anything more than that it had to expend 75% of its' total combat power.  That's an insane amount of a given country's combat troops to be deployed to one region.  Civil services from EMTs to Police are being pulled into this bottomless pit of Russian corpses, the Russian mechanized fleet has a limb or two cut off, national security along w/ security agreements w/ what few allies it still has are being invalidated, and even the Separatist Enclaves in Ukraine are now dangerously depleted of fighting age males.  4/10 Separatist soldiers are now dead or permanently disabled, and the average age of people voting for annexation in the territory was freaking 70 years old!

China will NOT approve a declaration by Putin or anyone else in the Russian government saying they would ""help"" them invade Taiwan.  In fact China would probably pull a 180 and make stiffer statements telling Russia to GTFO of Ukraine while it still has soldiers left.

This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.""

When someone says ""appears"" in this context I get suspicious. Credibility is based on background, not how a person talks or appears.

There also seem to be a ""deadline"" as in how much the Russia is able to push, and it appears they are very close to that limit. Wasn't there a US general who expressed yesterday, that the war can be over in weeks?

**Transnistria and the invasion of Odessa**

*This is a discussion cut from my daily posting on the Russo-Ukrainian War.*   
  
*Do not think Odessa is in danger anymore from amphibious invasion. The range of a Ukrainian manufactured Neptune missile is 175 miles (280 kilometers). The distance from Odessa to Sevastopol is 188 miles (which is reported to have militarized dolphin pens). The distance from Odessa to Chisinau, the capital of land-locked Moldova (pop. 2.6 million), is about 100 miles. Finally saw an article today that backs my view of the situation: Russia struggles to turn Black Sea rule into amphibious attack. There does some to be some action on and around the now famous Snake Island, which is just off the coast of border between Romania and Ukraine.*   
  
*I do hear some talk about the Russian separatist Transnistria (pop. maybe 347,251), officially called PMR (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic), becoming somehow involved in this war, but I don‚Äôt see it. They are pretty small and pretty isolated. Russia does have a force of 1,500 troops there based at a decommissioned Soviet-era ammunition depot at Cobasna where it guards 22,000 tons of military equipment and ammunition. This force consists of two motor rifle battalions, and independent security and support battalion, a helicopter detachment and other smaller administrative detachments. These troops also patrol and man the borders of Transnistria. Suspect the threats to activate them is more for the sake of drawing Ukrainian attention away from the main battle front. Actually activating them would drag Transnistria into the war, which being isolated and almost 200 miles from the nearest Russian units would probably end poorly for them. The ‚ÄúDnestr Republic‚Äù was reported to have 4,500 to 5,500 troops and the Moldavan armed forces consisted of 6,500 troops as of 2007, with their ground forces being 5,710.*  
  
*A Russian news agency (RIA) quoting the Russian defense ministry today said that 1 person was killed and 27 were missing from the sunk cruiser Moskva and the remaining 396 crew were evacuated. 396 + 1 + 27 = 424, which is less than the ship‚Äôs reported strength of 485 or 510. There are reports out there that the count of missing exceeds 27.*

>Founded in October 2014, Meduza or Medusa Project is a news website headquartered in Riga, Latvia. Meduza is a Russian news website that isn‚Äôt based in Russia. Galina Timchenko, who got fired as chief editor of Lenta.ru. (Russia‚Äôs most popular news website), launched Meduza in Latvia. Meduza, also known as its English version, is called ‚ÄúThe Real Russia Today.‚Äù

>**Meduza is banned in Russia due to its critical coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.**  
>  
>...  
>  
>Meduza is a news aggregation website, but they also create original content. Meduza is similar to Vox, which provides card stacks that provide context and define terms within an article.In review, Meduza uses emotionally loaded language in their headlines, such as ‚ÄúLeonid Slutsky must resign from the State Duma.‚Äù In articles, they typically source anti-Russian government sources such as RTVI, which is unavailable in Russia. However, **Meduza also utilizes credible sources** such as the BBC, The Financial Times, AP, and Reuters and Russian propaganda news sources to illustrate misleading information like Russian News Agency TASS and Russia‚Äôs international news agency RIA Novosti.Editorially, Meduza also has an anti-Putin/Russian government bias because Putin and the Russian government, in general, are socially conservative, anti-gay, and pro religion/traditional values. They are also strongly opposed to the Russian invasion of Ukraine with articles such as this No to War An editorial from Meduza.

The Pope ought not to endorse what NATO is doing. The Pope should necessarily be seeking the immediate peaceful end to the conflict with as little bloodshed as possible. NATO will achieve peace in time, but that peace will be paid in blood, and will end up giving NATO a more favorable position on the world stage. Jesus never taught anyone to arm themselves and kill their oppressors. If the Pope were to speak differently, he would be in direct violation of his mandate from God. It is just to defend ourselves against aggressors, but if you were to ask what would Jesus do? He would give himself up, because the true gift of salvation is through God and these kingdoms will crumble. In fact he literally rebukes Peter after Peter cuts off the ear of one of the guards who had come to arrest him. 

With all that said, I want to see the Russian forces in Ukraine turned into a fine mist, but that's certainly not compatible with my beliefs or moral code. That's my own burden and I wont project that onto the Pope. Yes, NATO's existence provokes Russia. Of course it does. It was made specifically to oppose Russia. The Pope is correct in stating that the East-West conflict that has raged since the end of WWII has created this current conflict and that both sides have contributed to the hostilities and escalation.

Fantastic!  So what magic supply of cruise missiles have you found that the Ukrainians can immediately deploy without training?  Is there some mass stash of MiGs available that Ukrainian pilots can fly and their ground crews can maintain?  Training to fly an F-16 in combat-effective manner will take Ukrainian pilots months.  Getting ground crews trained and supply lines established to maintain F-16s will take 1-2 years.  F-22s and F-35s are a considerably longer proposition.

>They need to be hit a lot harder they just need to avoid civilian centers so Russia can‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs existence is being threatened.

Russia decides what it considers an existential threat, not NATO or the West.  Targeting anything deep in Russia with cruise missiles will be viewed by the Russians as an existential threat and they will respond.  Would they use nukes? Not in my opinion, but they could make things much worse for Ukrainian civilians with conventional ballistic missile attacks on all major Ukrainian cities, and they could lash out at other European targets.

They will have to activate a general mobilization to keep funneling troops to the war (a desperate and politically dangerous move in a country that has been told they are winning).

This sounds crazy but Russia has committed a lot of manpower to taking the Ukraine right now, and I do mean a lot, they likely don't have the forces to spare to March into belarus at this time. In addition russias nuclear doctrine and precedent only covers non allied aligned nations. If belarus chose to go to the mats for Ukraine and fight Russia there, then it would qualify as infighting.

In short Victor could fire his generals, appoint new ones from his rank and files, even a bad one would be acceptable, and open negotiations with the west to make concessions for him and his country in exchange for his aid in a back channel somewhere.

Russia would not be expecting Victor to make such a move, they lack the ability to pressure him with anything substantial, and it will be months before Russia would have anything beyond a token force or some spetsnaz tomahawk backflipper assassins ready to go try and depose him. And if he chooses to simply migrate to kyiv he stands a very good chance of living through the war, repairing huge cultural damage between the two nations, and possibly going down as just what Ukraine needed to turn the tide of the war. The Belarusian military has shown it would sooner turn on Russia then fight for its interests. If Victor made the right steps today he could use that to his advantage and remain in power for quite some time after this fiasco still.

Plus could u imagine putins  look of abject horror when he discovers that his forces are fighting the belarus army in a concentrated push in the north, he would need to redirect huge force values in the south and east if he wanted any chance of arresting such a drive of fresh men and equipment. Not to mention a loss of vital airspace.

Russia can conjure up roubles at their own central bank, just by writing down a number in a ledger, but they can't create dollars. Only the Fed can do that. 

If the Russian government instructs Sberbank, say, to pay a billion dollars to Citi, then Sberbank will in turn instruct the Federal Reserve to transfer that much from Sberbank's account to Citi's account - or, more likely, they'll do so via an American bank which holds the dollar account on Sberbank's behalf, so the Russian bank would have an account with a US bank which in turn has an account at the Fed. Either way, the numbers that matter are in a database in New York, not Moscow.

Now you might have heard that banks create money, and that's true; money isn't just central bank money, it's also all the loans made on the back of that, all the promissory notes and credit lines and overdrafts and cheques. Banks can do this because the public is confident that they can exchange bank money for cash dollars if they want to. Russia can also create dollars in this sense: they issue debt instruments and promise to pay dollars in exchange at some future date. They've been doing just that; the problem is that the date to pay is coming due on many such promises, and any foreign creditor with any sense will ask for Federal Reserve money, not dollar denominated promises at a Russian bank. If they don't deliver, they ruin the public's confidence that Russian promises are worth Federal Reserve dollars, and every such promise they've made becomes nearly worthless.",1651693120.0,1651677092.0,t3_uhy47q,t1_i7aokgf,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Then your blood pressure starts fluctuating in weird ways, so (for example) every time you bend down and stand back up, you get what I call the ""consciousness wobbles"" where you start to fade out and have to hang onto something to stay upright.

Had the west stepped in and been firmer and more hands on, they might have been able to neuter the proto-oligarchy and ensure the proper establishment of a strong market economy.

The meeting took place one day after Trump fired James Comey, then head of the FBI, who had authorized the probe into Russian election interference. Kislyak was a subject of that investigation. Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor) was forced to resign, and Jeff Sessions (attorney general) recused himself from the investigation, due to multiple undisclosed meetings or phone calls with the ambassador during the campaign. He was suspected of being an intelligence operative under his diplomatic cover, and a central figure in the intereferrence effort. 

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/photos-trump-russia-sergey-lavrov-sergey-kislyak-oval-office-meeting/

The meeting was closed-door, and we only have photos of it because the Russians brought a TASS (state news agency) photographer. No American press were invited/admitted. A week later, The New York Times later got their hands on summary notes from the meeting, and published these excerpts of the conversation;

>""I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,"" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office, according to a summary of the meeting, obtained by the Times. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off,"" he added.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-called-comey-nut-job-told-russians-that-firing-him-relieved-great-pressure/


Two weeks after the meeting, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence had caught Kislyak on a wiretapped call back to Moscow, describing attempts to set up a secret secure phone line with Jared Kushner that could not be listened in on.

""Sitting in the tow boat wheelhouse, Captain Rider tells us barging grain is definitely the most efficient way of moving Midwestern-grown crops to southern U.S. ports for export. To back up his claims, he shares data complied by the Iowa Department of Transportation:

A grain barge holds 12,500 tons or 52,000 bushels of grain. With a 15-barge tow, you‚Äôd have 787,500 bushels of grain.

A railroad jumbo hopper car holds 100 tons or 3,500 bushels of grain. A 100-car unit train could move 350,000 bushels of grain.

An 18-wheeler semi-trailer carries 25 tons or 875 bushels of grain.
So when it comes to moving grain, a 15-barge tow of grain is the equivalent of 2 100-car trains or 900 truckloads.

These 15 barges would be 1/8 mile long, the trains would be 2 ¬Ω miles long and the trucks would stretch over 36 miles if there were a 150-foot distance between each vehicle.""

So if The Russia keeps their troops in Ukraine, and Ukraine destroys and degrades Russia's military further, until they get their territory back, there will be nothing but remnants of Russian troops, fleeing back to The Russia.

So if Ukraine continues into The Russia - who's actually going to stop them?  Only The Russia's raggety-ass air force.  It's probably true that Ukraine could not gain air superiority on The Russian soil. But other than that, Ukraine could basically march their army straight to Moscow with impunity.  

I think it was reported that something like 80% of The Russia's combat forces were sent to Ukraine.  So how could The Russia get the remaining 20% all the way over to Western The Russia, to stop a Ukrainian invasion?

Even if Ukraine did not go to Moscow, it would make sense to take some territory as a defensive buffer, since The Russia can never ever be trusted again to try to abide by any peace agreement.  The Russia will be shelling and harassing Ukraine from across the border if The Russia is forced out. It'll be like the Palestinians.

It honestly blows my mind when anyone even semi-believes that crap.

Any basic fact-checking or napkin logic completely debunks it.

Even if we ignore the fact that Ukraine's choice to join NATO or further integrate with EU is her own; one simple question comes from this line of thinking... Why would Russia not want Ukraine in NATO?

It's not because of invasions fears, NATO has never invaded Russia and there's the whole MAD factor.

Therefore the answer is simple - because Russia can't then use violence to bully Ukraine anymore.

A secondary reason would be another Slavic/semi-Slavic country westernising and growing, and one with the resources, agriculture and demographics to show just how backwards Russia is.

I've always held the view of 'well I may not agree with x, y or z analyst but I can respect a different opinion'.

I Corps (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/I_US_Corps_-_Organization_2021.png) has 11 battalions (33 batteries) alone, based off of the org chart.

‚ÄúAlthough the United States supported the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which favored the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had assured the Arabs in 1945 that the United States would not intervene without consulting both the Jews and the Arabs in that region. The British, who held a colonial mandate for Palestine until May 1948, opposed both the creation of a Jewish state and an Arab state in Palestine as well as unlimited immigration of Jewish refugees to the region. Great Britain wanted to preserve good relations with the Arabs to protect its vital political and economic interests in Palestine.‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon after President Truman took office, he appointed several experts to study the Palestinian issue. In the summer of 1946, Truman established a special cabinet committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Henry F. Grady, an Assistant Secretary of State, who entered into negotiations with a parallel British committee to discuss the future of Palestine. In May 1946, Truman announced his approval of a recommendation to admit 100,000 displaced persons into Palestine and in October publicly declared his support for the creation of a Jewish state. Throughout 1947, the United Nations Special Commission on Palestine examined the Palestinian question and recommended the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.‚Äù

This is directly after WWII which ended in 1945. They needed a place to put the Jewish people who had been displaced from the holocaust - there were millions displaced and the US did not wanna deal with it. So here‚Äôs some guns, go ahead and take the home of these poor, non-white people and we will give you money.

Seems like a reasonable error. 

  

> there is no sign it was anything but money from his own entertainment companies

1. A network of offshore firms located in tax havens is not necessary to run an entertainment company. We're talking ""Zelensky owned a company in Belize (Film Heritage) that owned part of a company located in Cyprus (Davegra) which then owned a company in the Virgin Islands (Maltex)"" levels of shell companies here. 
2. Right before Zelensky was elected in 2019, he (via Film Heritage) gifted his shares in an offshore company (Maltex) to his friend (Serhiy Shefir), who he then appointed that friend as his chief presidential aide. 
3. In 2018 Zelensky made a financial asset declaration that did not list his ownership of Maltex, which was only disclosed via the Pandora Papers.    
4. Despite Zelensky's Film Heritage no longer owning any part of Maltex, Maltex was still providing dividend payments *to* Film Heritage (now solely owned by Zelensky's wife)---almost as though ""gifting"" $millions in shares was less of a very generous gift in more of a financial arrangement! 
5. During the 2019 UA election, Volodymyr Ariev published information alleging that these companies were being used to receive millions of dollars from Ukrainian Oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, who is accused of billions of dollars of fraud and whose media outlets supported Zelensky's election campaign. While the chart has never been fully corroborated, the Pandora Papers corroborate a lot of the details within it. 

> and in fact they date from before he ran for president.

1. Transfer of ownership of Maltex shares occurred *during* his Presidential campaign. 
2. The document that stipulated that Maltex would continue to pay dividends to Film Heritage despite Film Heritage no longer owning Maltex occurred *after the* election.

Russians have felt this way about Crimea for centuries. Because Crimea means the difference between Russia being a global power, able to field a navy and trade with other nations, and Russia being just another poor, land-locked backwater.

The problem is; Ukraine came first as the ""Kievan Rus"", and Russia arose as a nation and power later, after the ""Kievan Rus"" suffered from repeated Mongol invasions, and their power and influence (and territorial control) lapsed.  

Russia views the possession of Crimea through a 16th or 17th century lens.  When really, in the 20th century, the Russian Empire went through it's own collapse, and Ukraine declared themselves to be an independent nation - around the time the USSR started.  The fact that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic claimed Crimea at that time, gives them precedent over Russian Soviet claims.

Russia didn't see it that way when they stole Crimea (and Belgorod) in the 1920's.

The history is (from wikipedia):

 - Colonized by ancient Greeks; then ruled by Persians, then the Roman Empire, then the Byzantine Empire, then the Empire of Trebizond, and the Principality of Theodoro, then eventually the Ottoman Empire, up until the 18th century.

 - 1783: annexed by the Russian Empire.

 - Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR in the USSR.

 - Russia committed a genocide against the Crimean Tartars, around the same time they did it to Ukraine in the Holomodor (1930's-1940's). 

 - in 1954, the USSR legally transferred Crimea to the Ukrainian SSR. This is really the legal basis of Crimea belonging to Ukraine; IMO.

Russia disputes this, of course, because in 1991, the USSR collapsed, and the Ukrainian SSR declared independence, rejecting the newly forming Russian Federation.  So in Putin's view, neither party in the 1954 handoff existed as legal entities after 1954, so Crimea's ""ownership"" is legally ""up in the air"" as far as Putin is concerned. 

But I think it was 1997 that really got Putin pissed off: because up until then, Ukraine was leasing Sevastopol to Russia. Who didn't like that arrangement to begin with - but Ukraine gave Russia 20 years to GTFO Crimea. There was an end-date to the lease.  I think this is when Russia decided to start fucking with Ukraine's elections, get a puppet installed, and get the lease renewed.  Which happened in 2010 (extended to 2042).

Then Ukraine threw Yanukovych out in 2014.  So, in response, Putin invaded and annexed Crimea. And tore up the lease agreement. As far as Putin was concerned; the 2014 Ukraine was no longer the 1991 Ukraine, nor the 1917 UPR (Ukrainian People's Republic), nor the 1922 Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  As far as Putin's concerned, the 2014 Ukraine is illegitimate.

 >In rail transport, track gauge (in the U.S., alternatively track gage) is the distance between the two rails of a railway track. All vehicles on a rail network must have wheelsets that are compatible with the track gauge. Since many different track gauges exist worldwide, gauge differences often present a barrier to wider operation on railway networks. The term derives from the metal bar, or gauge, that is used to ensure the distance between the rails is correct.

Problem is, the Mig25 was just a fundamentally single dimensional and flawed design, and the Mig31 fixed _some_ of the 25's issues, and supposedly modernised some stuff, but it still has most of the flaws of the Mig25.

The 31 is an interceptor first and foremost, go fast at something, try shoot it down.

If your missiles miss, you are now in a fight where if it is a fast bomber you have to run it down, and if it is another fighter or interdictor you SOL because the 31 can't really point its nose at anything.

You see, the Soviets and Russians build planes that are usually one dimensional, because they had many different types to fill different roles.

The Mig31 is the Imterceptor, and the Mig29 is the point defense fighter. The Su27 is long range escort and air superiority. Each have their flaws.

The 25/31 can go fast to somewhere far but can't knife fight.

The 29 can go fast to a point close to the border and knife fight, but tp achieve this is has basically no endurance and only the basest of avionics.

The 27 is the best of the three, it can go far, but not as fast as the F15, it can mix it up in a dogfight but not as good as the F15, F16 or F18. Part of the reason for that is the Russian lag behind in engine tech means the Su27 has to carry so much fuel in order to go the distances needed that it is hasically a flying parking lot, and all that fat bottom it carries around makes it have one good go at the close in fight before it runs out of energy.

The West had a restriction on how many types of aircraft they had, so they had to go multi role and multi capability as far as possible.

The USA had the F15 and F16 (and the E variant for interdiction that still retains dogfighting capability). The Navy have the F18 that took over a few roles from the Tomcat and the A7 etc.

The Swiss had the Viggen, and them the Draken, and now the Gripen. All designs that had to be good at many roles.

The French had various models of Mirage, but usually one main multirole front line variant, The Mirage III, the F1, the 2000 (not counting the 5 as it was a buy when the export for it petered out) and now the Rafale.

The rest of Europe had the Phantom, The Tornado and lately the Typhoon.

Sure there were specialised planes as well like the Aardvark and the Jaguar, but they had or have niche roles that got taken up by the newer generation multirole fighters.

The Russians never cracked the formula to make a fighter that is good at multi role. Even the newer Su variants are still rather single focused, if much better than older generation stuff. The Su34 has the ground attack focus that the F111 had, the Su35 has the air superiority role, but still is the size of a decent hockey field. The two seat Su30 variants are better at a few things, but need two people in the cockpit to do what one person can do in the F16, F18, Rafale and Typhoon.

Russian aeronautical design is behind because they;

* still cling to old doctrine - many types for many roles, controlled by a central ground control hub.
* are a generation or more behind on avionics - countries that buy russian airframes usually install western avionics

Some hyper advanced artillery, like Excalibur, use small steering wings to adjust slightly in flight to gain some additional accuracy and correct for air currents etc. 

Missiles are propelled by a continuous propulsive jet, like the rockets we shoot into space. This gives them a longer range and more accuracy.

However, the plume of the propulsion behind a missile also makes them highly traceable and targetable, and anti-missile weapons can make use of their high heat signature to track them.

Missiles are also larger than shells of the same payload, because shells' propulsion chamber is discarded when its fired, like a bullet cartridge, whereas a missile carries its propulsion chamber with it. That means that not only are they more noticeable, but missiles also have a bigger radar signature because they are physically so much larger. 

Tracking shells is possible, but almost never in time to stop them. Also, shells are cheap while missiles are expensive. Anything used to stop a shell would cost many times more than what the shell costs. The most effective anti-shell strategy is counterbattery - you aim for the artillery that fired the shell, by tracing the shell's arc. Since offensive missiles are more noticeable and are major investments, it is both easier and more cost effective to intercept them mid flight.

However, it's really just a non-aggression pact, and according to the Wikipedia page, 

>It refers to assurances, but it does not impose a legal obligation of military assistance on its parties.[1][27] According to Stephen MacFarlane, a professor of international relations, ""It gives signatories justification if they take action, but it does not force anyone to act in Ukraine.""[26] In the US, neither the George H. W. Bush administration nor the Clinton administration was prepared to give a military commitment to Ukraine, and they did not believe the US Senate would ratify an international treaty and so the memorandum was adopted in more limited terms.[27] The memorandum has a requirement of consultation among the parties ""in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning the ... commitments"" set out in the memorandum.[28] Whether or not the memorandum sets out legal obligations, the difficulties that Ukraine has encountered since early 2014 may cast doubt on the credibility of future security assurances that are offered in exchange for nonproliferation commitments.[29] Regardless, the United States publicly maintains that ""the Memorandum is not legally binding"", calling it a ""political commitment"".

My understanding, from reading about it, is that it's basically a worthless piece of paper that really leaves Ukraine with no protections, as, even in the event of a nuclear strike against them, the signatories only promise to ""Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine if they ""should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used"" and ""Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments.""",False,1651691858.0,t3_uhy47q,t1_i7bopu5,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

This is an *extremely* generous reading. Let me quote from [the English version of the interview](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/22_maggio_03/pope-francis-putin-e713a1de-cad0-11ec-84d1-341c28840c78.shtml): 

> Maybe it was ¬´Nato barking at Russia‚Äôs gate¬ª that compelled Putin to unleash the invasion of Ukraine. ¬´I have no way of telling whether his rage has been provoked¬ª‚Äù Bergoglio wonders, ¬´but I suspect it was maybe facilitated by the West‚Äôs attitude¬ª

This is no different - and no less despicable - than suggesting that a sexual abuser had been ""provoked"" by the victim or by the attitudes of society at large or so forth.  

Then:

> He is opposed, as Jesus was, to violence of any kind, even in self defense.

Let me quote from the [Cathechism of the Catholic Church](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P81.HTM): 

> 2308 All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war.
However, ""as long as the danger of war persists and there is no international authority with the necessary competence and power, governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed.""

> 2309 The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration. the gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same time:

* the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
* all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
* there must be serious prospects of success;
* the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. the power of modem means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.

> These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the ""just war"" doctrine.
The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good.

> 2310 Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense.

All the four criteria mentioned of 2309 apply to Ukraine's defense; none of them apply to Russia's aggression. The Catholic Church never espoused absolute pacifism of the ""never fight back no matter what"" sort - for example, if someone attempted to invade the Vatican to do harm to Pope Francis they *would* be stopped, hopefully not more violently than necessary but as violently as it'd take to protect the Pope. 

To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with that; but nonetheless, absolute pacifism is not a Catholic doctrine and it is not practiced by the institutions of the Catholic Church.",1651686205.0,1651685866.0,t3_uhy47q,t1_i7bdz0i,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

In May 1946, Truman announced his approval of a recommendation to admit 100,000 displaced persons into Palestine and in October publicly declared his support for the creation of a Jewish state.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites, and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

A rational action is one that, given the understanding of reality an actor has, arises from that actor's own internal logic and, within that logic, represents a step towards accomplishing the actor's goals.

In this sense, Putin's actions are rational, because they reflect a step towards accomplishing his goals within his own internal framework.

Now.for the key differences between this, Iraq and Afghanistan.  

1)  almost no Afghanis in the west supported the Taliban.   Similarly Sadam had very little support among western Iraqis.  This isn't the case with Russia and Russians.  Putin and the offensive still enjoy support among many Russian ex pats., despite access to western media, etc.

2)  Iraq wasn't the aggressor in the second gulf War.  We (the west) invaded them under false pretenses.  Similarly Afghanistan was only a very tangential aggressor in that war, and again we were the invaders.  The biggest ""culprits"" for 9/11 were arguably the Saudis and we still guzzle their oil like it is no ones business.  Russia however is CLEARLY the aggressor here.  Russia is also committing all the atrocities.  I think it is safe to say fewer Americans died on 9/11 than Ukrainians in this war and we went and flattened an entire country and impacted all their citizens and vilified their expats.  All we have done to Russia is sanctions and give their enemy guns and information.  

My point is, the three conflicts aren't remotely equivalent and if Russia ""stars"" can't play for a year it is hardly too much of a cross to bear.

Only ~55 are frontline. Which is a tiny portion compared to the total invested force, that would play an insignificant statistical difference over a week. Still has nothing to do with the lack of proof of current claims of 'crazy as hell losses' of frontline units.

>700 vehicles. Simply put: catastrophical.

They are at closer to 550 a week, long term that catastrophic yes, without full mobilization Russia could only maintain that for another ~3 months. Still, provides no proof of the current claim of 'crazy as hell losses' of frontline units.

>They are up on both categories, while daily average fluctuates...daily. You on the other hand took one slow day and made a trend of it

Troops are down, 350 is needed to maintain average. Tanks are down, 17 are needed to maintain average. This has been the pattern for this week, not just 1 day. And yet again provides no proof of the current claim of 'crazy as hell losses' of frontline units.
