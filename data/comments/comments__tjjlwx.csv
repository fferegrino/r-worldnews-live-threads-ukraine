Day 26 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Shelling was almost constant today, and it sounded really close to us, the whole building was shaking from the shockwaves with almost every explosion, sometimes it even felt like windows might break. 

In the middle of shelling we heard prolonged gun fight which was also pretty close to us, it continued for about 10 minutes and then it was back to regular shelling. Not sure where it happened, there were reports of explosions being heard in almost every part of the city at the same time.

We don’t know where the fight took place but our governor reported that today our army took out one of the Russian planes near Chuguev, he said that it caught fire and crashed in Russian territory and also said that 2 Orlan drones were destroyed too.

There have been no planes sighted in the sky over Kharkiv in the past couple of days, but we still get constant air raid alerts, one is even going off right now, though my district apparently doesn’t have any working sirens so instead we get our alerts through an app on our phones.

We continue looking at comments from Russian people on their social media and when you just look at what they post you would think that they have all collectively gone mad and that there are no sane people left there. 

They have 2 “main” social media platforms, one being “VKontakte” where they just eat up propaganda happily and the other being “Одноклассники (Classmates)” which is the platform mostly populated by older people, and there they don’t just eat up the propaganda but also actually want USSR to come back (apparently there’s a petition to sue Gorbachev so it comes back I guess? It is nearing 100 000 signatures too). The amount of nationalists they have is just insane and after that they accuse our people of being nationalist?

When people posted videos from Russian troops shooting at protesters in Kherson as always they said it’s fake and that it’s not blood – it’s obviously ketchup. Even people that were previously from Ukraine still almost completely believe Russian propaganda. And you know what they also post? It’s something also taught to them from childhood, that you are just a “little person” and that your voice doesn’t matter, so just sit still and don’t do anything and let “big people” do things. This time it means don’t protest against the war and let Putin do his thing.

The amount of people saying “our ancestors didn’t finish their job” (killing all Nazis) and that they are doing it for them now is honestly scary, a lot of people truly believe that they are killing Nazis here and it looks like they are very proud of it. And it’s not just some people being this ruthless, there are a lot of them and they seem to thoroughly enjoy this war.

Stalled Elsewhere, Russia Focuses on Mariupol in Ukraine Plan B

Monday, March 21, 2022 05:23 PM 

(Bloomberg) --Russia is refocusing its military campaign in Ukraine on the east and above all the port city of Mariupol, in a drive to seize territories at the heart of what may become a narrower set of war aims for President Vladimir Putin. 
The bombardment of Mariupol from land, sea and air continued on Monday, as a Russian ultimatum for the city’s surrender expired around sunrise. The intensity of the attack is all the more striking given the slowing Russian war effort elsewhere.

With reports of fighting in the center of the city, the siege has reached a grim stage. Much of the pre-war population of about 500,000 has managed to leave, but people are still trapped there without running water or heat, and having to scavenge for food. There are no reliable casualty estimates amid claims on social media of collective graves and bodies abandoned in the streets. 

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has described the assault as a war crime that will be remembered “for centuries.”


A man pulls a shopping cart in Mariupol, Ukraine on March 20.
Officials and diplomats from several countries say the intensification around Mariupol suggests the Kremlin’s short term plans are shifting gears following the failure of an attempt to force rapid regime change in Kyiv, strip the nation of its armed forces and create a dependent relationship similar to the one Moscow has with Belarus.

Instead, Russia’s focus now appears to be to take those parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Donbas not already under its control and secure a land corridor to Crimea, the peninsula jutting into the Black Sea from the Ukrainian mainland that Putin annexed in 2014.

Russia has also made clear it would expect Ukraine to declare its neutrality in order to stop the conflict. According to a senior U.S. administration official, Russia also would want to be named as Ukraine’s security guarantor.

Ukraine is unlikely to accept those demands, even as the situation in Mariupol becomes ever more desperate. Authorities have pressed for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from the city since March 5, but multiple efforts have had limited success. Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych acknowledged on Friday that Ukrainian forces have no way of breaking the siege, because they would have to cross at least 120 km (75 miles) of open terrain to get there.


Civilians in Mariupol on March 20.
On Friday, Zelenskiy aide and negotiation team member Mykhailo Podolyak told Bloomberg TV that while there had been some progress in peace talks, a resolution could take weeks, with territorial concessions off the table. Ukraine has also said repeatedly that security guarantees would need to come from nations including Germany and the U.S., not Russia.

Moscow continues to say it wants to see the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of all Ukraine. The Defense Ministry on Sunday accused “Ukrainian neo-Nazis” of blocking 4.5 million civilians in cities to keep them as human shields, Tass reported. There has been no support for that claim from people interviewed as they escape Mariupol and other cities.

Escape From Mariupol: One Man’s Story of the Devastation of War

But if Russia is indeed shifting to more limited immediate goals, Mariupol holds the key. It is the last piece of Ukrainian-held territory blocking a land corridor, the largest city in Donetsk and Luhansk still in Ukrainian hands, and an important steel making hub and port for the transport of goods and grain from the eastern territories that Putin plans to sever.

Russia would then own both coasts of the Sea of Azov, turning it into a Russian lake while releasing troops and armor to boost other fronts within Ukraine. These are military gains that would be difficult to reverse, forcing Ukrainian troops to counterattack across the open plains of the south, where Russia’s military can make the most of its advantages in equipment and firepower.

Taking Mariupol would also offer a significant victory for a campaign that has otherwise seen Russia’s armed forces struggle against a much smaller, but more determined and nimble adversary. The Azov regiment, with its Nazi-Germany era wolfsangel insignia, is part of Mariupol’s defense force and has been key to Putin’s baseless accusation that Ukraine is run by neo-Nazis.

“I think Moscow is searching for something it can use to declare a victory. Taking the Donbas, and having leverage to attain concessions from Kyiv is probably what they’re looking to accomplish at this point,” Michael Kofman, a specialist on the Russian military at CNA, a Washington think tank, said in a Sunday Twitter thread.",False,1647891092.0,t3_tjjlwx,t3_tjjlwx,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

He was interviewed by Angelina Kariakina, Head of News at UA:PBC; Michal Kubal, Chief International Correspondent at Czech Television; and Agnès Vahramian Jeru, International Correspondent at France Télévisions.

Russia claims Crimea and Donbas in the ceasefire negotiations, but according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this is an unacceptable ultimatum that future generations would not forgive the country. The head of the Ukrainian state stated this in an interview conducted by journalists of the European Broadcasting Union, including the special correspondent of the Czech Television, Michal Kubal, in besieged Kiev. Zelenskyy added that Moscow did not and don't want peace, and called on the people of the Western world to empathize. According to him, a possible compromise with Russia would be approved by the Ukrainians in a referendum.

To date, the US has provided Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. These systems, however, are primarily effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, rather than higher altitude combat aircraft.  


  
It has been reported a number of countries - including Slovakia - have expressed a willingness to give Ukraine S-300 anti-aircraft systems, provided they receive something to replace them.  


  
Ukraine already uses the S-300 and has personnel trained in its use.  


  
While Kirby does not comment directly on Slovakia or the S-300, he says the US is in ""active consultations"" about “the kinds of defence capabilities to include long-range air defences, that we know that they’re \[Ukraine\] comfortable using.""""

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later.

""The only thing that I would say that's different since the last time we had a chance to talk is that we have seen some increased naval activity in the northern Black Sea.""

""The Russians have a little bit more than a dozen warships, different stripes and sizes -- amphibious ships, surface combatants, mine sweeper and some patrol boats that they've got up in the northern Black Sea""

""It is not clear that this is an imminent pre-staging sign of an amphibious assault on Odesa, so it would be, at this point, we would assess that it would be wrong to conclude that this is somehow an indication that Odesa is under an imminent threat of an amphibious assault""

""On the hypersonic claim that the Russians made, we're not able to refute it, but we can't independently confirm it, either. It's not entirely clear. So what we would assess is it's certainly possible. But it's a bit of a head-scratcher, to be honest with you""

""it's not exactly clear why, if it's true, why would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building? It could be that they're running low on precision-guided munitions and feel like they need to tap into that resource.""

""It could be that they're trying to send a message to the west, but also to Ukraine, and trying to gain some leverage at the negotiating table. But it's a -- from a military perspective, if it was a hypersonic missile there's not a whole lot of practicality about it.""

Responding to a question on leadership- ""The other thing is, Jack -- and people forget this... they [Russia] don't organize their military the way we do. They don't have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officers corps, for instance""

""And their [Russia] junior officers don't have the same wherewithal, flexibility... they don't invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do.""

""You know that we [the US] put a lot into an E-4 and an E-5 and an E-6 to -- to make decisions literally in the moment on the battlefield. They don't have that kind of a tradition. They don't have that structure.""

""We believe that they [Russia] are having command-and-control problems just in terms of communications... they just weren't fully prepared for operations of this intensity for this long on so many different multiple lines of attack""

""We do see them having some command-and-control difficulties, both in terms of a military operational concept issue, being able to integrate air to ground, to make decisions in real-time effectively, but also in terms of their ability to communicate over established links.""

""We're seeing them [Russia] use a lot more unclassified communications because their classified communications capability is -- is being -- is -- well, for one reason or another, is not as strong as it should be."" (Sounds like he slipped up and almost said being jammed or disrupted)

In response to a change in strategy- ""What we assess is that they [Russia] are looking for a chance to break out, they are looking for a chance to gain some momentum, not even re-gain momentum, because they never really had it, and that's what's so frustrating for them.""

""I mean, when you look at the map, you can count literally on one hand the number of population centers that we assess are in Russian control right now.""

""So what -- so what have they gained in -- in now 26 days? They got Melitopol', they got Berdyans'k and they got Kherson. That's it. They don't have Kyiv, they don't have Kharkiv, they don't have Mariupol, although... I mean, there's a lot of fighting going on there.""

""They [Russia] haven't achieved anything, in terms of what we assess to be their objectives, which is population centers so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine.""

""With these increased long range fires, missile strikes, artillery bombardments, in trying to encircle cities so that you can lob more long range fires into those cities, is a reflection of what some people believe is a desperate attempt by them [Russia] to gain some momentum,""

""And rather than demoralizing the Ukrainians, I think you've all seen that this kind of violence has only motivated them more, which means that they're resisting more, which means the Russians continue to get frustrated and flummoxed and kind of stuck where they are.""

""I mean, my goodness, here we are, day 26, they're still -- we still hold them a good 15 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, which is where they were last week. We still hold them about 30 kilometers from the east of Kyiv, which is where they were last week when we talked before.""

""Again, not that we're pushing back on this idea of a war of attrition but we're not exactly using that phrase here. What we're seeing is a near desperate attempt by the Russians to gain some momentum and try to turn the course of this in their favor.""

**The Suwalki corridor (also known as the Suwalki Gap) separates the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea from Belarus, now host to thousands of Russian troops and soon home to permanently stationed Russian forces, including advanced fighter jets and nuclear weapons. It is also the only way to get by road or rail from Poland and Central Europe to the Baltic states—arguably NATO’s most exposed members.**

A Russian move to seize control of the corridor may seem far-fetched, as it would explicitly involve an attack on NATO territory, triggering a U.S. military response. Nonetheless, if Moscow’s reinvasion of Ukraine has any central lesson to offer at this point, it’s that U.S. and allied officials must prepare now for worst-case scenarios by focusing on actual Russian military capabilities in the region, rather than the Kremlin’s announced intent, considered estimates of Russia’s strategic logic, or intelligence assessments of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s outlook.

> **“Ukraine - the beehive”**
> 
> Why Ukrainians have mounted such a successful defense against the Russian invader: a defense that has stopped the ground assault of what was once thought to be the most powerful army in Europe.
> 
> One explanation is this: Ukrainians are bees. 

>  Bees won’t sting unless your threaten them. If you approach the hives confidently, with appropriate respect, bees will even share their honey. It takes practice, but well-intentioned beekeepers can even draw honey without a mask or without gloves. 

> Bees work. They collect pollen and nectar, carrying their own weight in their “sacs” up to 2 miles from flower gardens to the hive. On arrival, they unload their freight to “indoor” (hive) bees who through mechanical-chemical processes dry the pollen converting it into honey. 

> They seem to understand the process without having to be taught – or perhaps we have simply not yet discovered their outstanding educational system. Either way, bees know their stuff! And the effectiveness of their horizontal cooperation is unmatched. 

> Bees love sunflowers. Bees are particularly active when the skies are blue. In case you missed the allusion there, I’ll make it clearer: bees thrive when the land is covered with yellow blossoms and the sky above is clear. The two colors represent the Ukrainian flag. 

> If you’re a bear, sticking your claws into a beehive is a bad idea. You may think that you are large and powerful, and that you are the dominant beast in your area, but don’t touch the bees! Attacking their hive is just a bad idea. 

> Bees that are defending their hive need no instructions - no formal leadership. They organize themselves. Each bee is prepared to die for the sake of the hive, and they seem to know exactly where to sting for maximum effect. 

> Incidentally, a bee sting is not just painful for the victim, it is fatal for the bee. Self-sacrifice and spontaneous organization seem to be genetically programmed. 

> Finally: bees mourn their dead. President Zelensky signed an Executive Order mandating a nationwide moment of silence every morning at 9am to honor the Ukrainians who have given their lives for our “hive” – for all our fallen soldiers, for our civilians, for our children. 

> This nation is invincible!

Putin has, at this point, committed the bulk of his military to this operation: there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. His troops have been stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face supply problems and constant attack. All this is a good lesson for China which, like Russia, has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade but they have no combat experience. 

The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army air force, which has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership won’t delude itself as to its capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a move against Taiwan. 

So let’s not be prematurely defeatist. A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom’, and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to those brave Ukrainians. I look forward to a time when I can return to a peaceful Ukraine and resume the slow, boring work of fortifying democracy.

We cannot control what Putin will do. He has the authority to destroy the world at any time for any reason or no reason. (If his generals would obey his orders is another question.) Our task is to impact his decision-making against doing so. I do not believe he is suicidal.

&#x200B;

My belief, based on Putin's character & track record, is that the greatest risk of nuclear escalation comes from his becoming so intoxicated on impunity that he believes the West will do nothing to stop him from attacking a NATO nation, or even using a nuclear weapon.

&#x200B;

You may say confronting Putin is more likely to cause escalation, but you are arguing against history. Not only Putin's history, but that of every hostile dictator of the past. The greatest danger is the dictator believing that you cannot stop him because you chose not to.

Russia has claimed that it has fired a number of “hypersonic” missiles against targets in western Ukraine.

If true, these were likely the Kinzhal; an air launched ballistic missile system based on the Iskander ballistic missile which has itself already been heavily used by Russian forces in their attack on Ukraine.

Russian claims of having used the developmental Kinzhal is highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign.

Deployment of Kinzhal is highly unlikely to materially affect the outcome of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine.

For those who are nervous about whatever Russia just announced, here is a timeline of things that were going to immediately win the war for Russia: 

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. 

Day twenty-two: three guys from the Tennessee national guard were found in Ukraine, dead or maybe actually alive and still fighting, we're not sure. Is NATO going to be pulled in and start WWIII because of foreign volunteers? Better stop allowing them! 

Day twenty-three: Russia is sending their generals to the frontlines. Putin just spoke to a loud group. Russia is revitalized and starting *right now* will take the war seriously. 

Day twenty-four: Russia says it used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for first time. Russia actively mobilizes male population 

Day twenty-five: Greatest hits compilation. Syrian forces are finally ready, another Mose Schrute brought a surviving Chechen brigade to Ukraine, and Russia bombs more shelters. This time all of these repeated failures will work though. 

Day twenty-six: Putin sent a letter threatening Poland if they allow weapons to be sent from within their birders.

There are situations in which the answer is obviously yes. To defend the US from attack? Yes. To defend any NATO country? Supposedly yes. To prevent genocide? Apparently not.

Putin did not need any pretext to launch this invasion. He did not need any pretext to shell & bomb innocent civilians in Ukraine. He won't need a pretext to use nuclear weapons. What we do know is that Putin always escalates when he isn't stopped.

""What, do you want WWIII?!"" No, I desperately want to avoid it. Just as I hoped to avoid this horrific war. Did the appeasers want this bloody massacre in Ukraine in 2014 when they made similar excuses to do nothing? Ask them if they want WWIII.

Russia's plan was to seize a lot of ground in a few days and then just hold onto it and negotiate a cease fire.  Just what they did when they seized Crimea and part of Donbas in 2014.

The difference now is the sanctions and the call in the west to not normalize relations with Russia and let them seize part of Ukraine and then go back to normal.

Ukraine cannot drive Russia out.  Being on the defense essentially makes your forces 2x or 3x as strong.  Ukraine is winning now because they are on the defensive.  But they cannot win on the offensive if Russia digs in.

1. W/ the exception of the generals nobody seems to have been given advanced notice that this invasion was going to take place.  Testimony from Russian prisoners indicates they thought they'd be on drills, their phones were collected, and then they were simply advised to unknowingly cross the border, and move to a coordinate point on the map.
2. My theory on why this was meant to be a surprise is b/c when something similar occurred in Chechnya the invasion plan was announced, and it resulted in a huge portion of the then Russian military refusing to commit to the invasion, and a mass of resignations occurred depriving them of a lot of senior personnel.  Putin avoided that pitfall this time by literally surprising everybody.
3. Putin not having an overall commander of forces pretty much means he's the puppet master here, and he's having the now 15 remaining generals run their campaigns in the North, East, and the South.
4. This makes sense b/c Putin clearly thought he could gamble and grab the whole country in 48 hours, which we now know wasn't possible.  So now he's going to plan B.  Letting the commanders compete against each other in theater  to grab up what resources they can before giving the go ahead for peace talks.  The generals are working to carry favor w/ the Boss, and to that effect they're literally dying based on his orders.
5. Putin himself is the overall commander b/c he's paranoid and wouldn't dare give that much power to one man even subordinate to him b/c he thinks that person would in turn take that army and march right back to Russia to depose him.  Putin's Russia could now never produce a James Mattis or an Omar Bradley b/c they'd carry the loyalty of the men under their command, and provide another viable alternative in leadership to Putin.
6. Generals and Army officers actively competing against each other is right out of the army of a dictator playbook.  Senior officers play politics just as much if not more in these situations b/c they literally built their careers in such a way.

All of those generals that have been dying were sent to the front lines to restore order and attempt to fix this blunder of an invasion.

> **Now Ukraine accuses Putin of kidnapping 2,500 children: Kyiv makes new 'Nazi' allegations after claiming Ukrainian refugees were being deported from Mariupol to 'filtration camps' in Russia**
> 
> By LAUREN LEWIS FOR MAILONLINE

> PUBLISHED: 13:29 EDT, 21 March 2022 | UPDATED: 20:33 EDT, 21 March 2022
> 
> Vladimir Putin has been accused of kidnapping nearly 2,500 Ukrainian children from Donetsk and Luhansk and 'deporting' them to Russia in scenes reminiscent of 'Nazi' transportations.
> 
> Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Russia of 'abducting' children using 'forced displacement' and warned the alleged deportations 'are a gross violation of in particular international humanitarian law.'  
> 
> It comes hours after Moscow was accused by Kyiv's intelligence agency of deporting Ukrainians to 'filtration' centres before forcibly taking them to remote Siberian towns after confiscating their phones and documents.
> 
> 'Several thousand' people have so-far been taken, Mariupol city council claimed, before being processed through 'filtration camps' and sent to 'remote cities' in Russia where they will be obliged to stay for years and work for free.  
> 
> The Ukrainian foreign ministry called on the international community to 'respond to the illegal removal of children' because depriving children 'of parental care puts their lives in further jeopardy in Russia' and warned 'the perpetuators of these crimes will be brought to justice'. 
> 
> EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before he chaired a meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels that 'what's happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime. Destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody in an indiscriminate manner. This is something awful'. 
> 
> Russian news agencies have reported that buses carrying hundreds of refugees from the besieged southeastern port city Mariupol had arrived in Russia in recent days. Moscow officials also said a trainload of over 280 Ukrainians were being 'rescued' from Mariupol, showing footage of them thanking Russian forces. 
> 
> Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko likened the alleged forced deportations to transportation of prisoners by the Nazi regime during World War II. Boichenko said: 'What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people. It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people can be forcibly taken to another country.' 
> 
> Mariupol is in the throes of a humanitarian emergency after being encircled by Russian troops, cut off from energy, food and water supplies and facing a relentless bombardment.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy
Kofman said Russia had dispersed its forces across too many fronts, succeeding fully on none, as a result of fundamentally misguided assumptions about Ukraine and its military. He said the next week was likely to see a significant attempt by Russian forces to close on Mariupol and on Ukrainian troops holding a more than 400 km line in Donetsk and Luhansk.

“There’s a desperation to show progress. Increasingly it looks as though the Russian mil is focusing on the Donbas, and maintaining along other fronts,” Kofman wrote.

Putin has from the outset called the conflict a special military operation to protect the Donbas area, where pro-Russia separatists have been fighting for years. That could give him a claim of success to fall back on in his rhetoric.

Kofman forms part of an emerging consensus among officials and military analysts that Russia is reaching a point of so-called culmination or exhaustion, at which it would have to pause to reconsider its strategy, replenish losses and regroup. That would give Ukraine time to do the same, but may not be a good sign for Kyiv in the longer term. 

“The point is that although Russia has been out fought and out thought by the Ukrainians, this only makes them -- and Putin -- more dangerous,” Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general, said in another Sunday Twitter thread.


Civilians take shelter in safety areas as they are trapped in Mariupol on March 19.
Russian forces have for the first time been digging trenches around their positions near Kyiv and placing land mines to defend them, according to the latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington non-profit. It saw those as indications that it’s preparing to pressure the capital through shelling, rather than continue with efforts to encircle and capture it.

The ISW also reported stalled Russian campaigns in the south, toward the Black Sea port of Odesa, and in the north, around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said it saw other signs that Moscow is preparing the Russian population for a long war, including covert attempts at mobilizing new recruits across parts of the country, and to draft mercenaries from Libya, as well as Syria.

Not all sources agree the Russian military has changed its focus. 

Two diplomats from western governments said there was little indication Putin’s overall intentions had shifted. The people said they expected Russian forces would regroup before continuing to attack Kyiv, and remained skeptical about Russia’s genuine engagement in the peace talks.

The U.K. Defence Ministry said in a Monday update that “despite the lack of progress, Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective and they are likely to prioritize attempting to encircle the city over the coming weeks.”",False,1647891112.0,t3_tjjlwx,t1_i1khqlg,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Putin has, at this point, committed the bulk of his military to this operation: there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. His troops have been stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face supply problems and constant attack. All this is a good lesson for China which, like Russia, has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade but they have no combat experience. 

The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army air force, which has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership won’t delude itself as to its capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a move against Taiwan. 

So let’s not be prematurely defeatist. A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom’, and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to those brave Ukrainians. I look forward to a time when I can return to a peaceful Ukraine and resume the slow, boring work of fortifying democracy.

Russia previously claimed that Ukraine could be neutral or de-militarized because Russia would provide it with all the security it needs hence the argument that Ukraine doesn't need to be part of NATO. 

In fact in the Budapest agreement/memorandum of 1994 Russia signed on to never invade or threaten Ukraine's sovereignty (in return for Ukraine being a party to non-proliferation and giving up their nuclear weapons)*

Now?

How can Ukraine now ever agree to de-militarize or not join a military alliance ever when Russia is constantly knocking on the door to re-invade?

IMO its much better to go with memes that convey abrasive political statements via image (much harder for the viewer to reject before its entered their thoughts)

Stuff like the meme of Putin polishing Xi's shoes, or gifs of Russian soldiers being totally incompetent, jokes about Russian military corruption resulting in embarrassingly bad equipment for the troops, Ukrainian farmers stealing Russian tanks, Moscow police being overzealous 
etc.

The memes need to just take the piss without overtly taking a moral position or being seen as intentionally political.

> 
> Bridgestone has been carefully assessing the impact of the war in Ukraine and its impact on many innocent people. As a result, we are suspending our manufacturing activities in Russia until further notice. The decision will take effect Friday, March 18 after the necessary preparations. The company has also decided to freeze any new investments and suspend all exports to Russia with immediate effect.
> 
> We condemn any form of violence and hope that peace can quickly be re-established. Our primary concern in this crisis is the safety of our employees and their families. We continue to care for our more than 1,000 employees in our passenger tire production plant in Ulyanovsk, Russia and our sales offices. Therefore, we will support our employees financially at this time.
> 
> Bridgestone’s global and regional management will continue to closely monitor the situation. We expect our manufacturing and supply chains outside of Russia to remain stable in the coming weeks, and we will be prepared to flexibly adapt plans if necessary.
> 
> Bridgestone has donated more than €3.5 million Euro ($3.8 million USD) globally to the Ukraine humanitarian crisis, including a $250,000 USD donation made by Bridgestone Americas to the International Committee of the Red Cross. In addition, many of our employees have participated in spontaneous volunteer activities to support the refugees from Ukraine.

Seriously, why would the defending side, the morally and historically right one, fluff up their BDA's when they need to be as accurate as possible to guage leftover local force strength? To know how much is left? It's dumb to lie about it - especially when the Territorials are doing lots of the fighting too - you'd see their own locals call out overcounting.

Also - defenders advantage. You sic conscripts against any defensive position that's dug in by people who are:

1) Motivated as fuck
2) Western trained (this war has demonstrated at the individual level, the Western way of fighting is straight up superior at a 1:1 level).

Well shit - those Ruscist conscripts are about to have very shitty days.

No shit they're getting absolutely domed (see Hostomel's early defence) - they don't have a 3:1 numbers advantage to make the attack. Not to mention, there's probably about another 15k WIA (normally I'd assume more, but Russia lacks the developed medical logistics systems that western nations take seriously since the Afghanistan mission).

Overall, Russia is running close to a 15% overall casualty rate on the deployed forces. Not to mention the sheer number of units that are degraded well beyond 30%.

If the units remain in the field whilst undermanned for too long, every defensive gap will be exploited by a Ukrainian army that now has the information and night-time advantages. Even if Russia digs in to bite and hold, they're going to really struggle to beat the infiltration tactics of an intelligent, confident and well trained enemy.

Putin has, at this point, committed the bulk of his military to this operation: there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. His troops have been stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face supply problems and constant attack. All this is a good lesson for China which, like Russia, has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade but they have no combat experience. 

The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army air force, which has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership won’t delude itself as to its capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a move against Taiwan. 

So let’s not be prematurely defeatist. A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom’, and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to those brave Ukrainians. I look forward to a time when I can return to a peaceful Ukraine and resume the slow, boring work of fortifying democracy.

One of such mine-traps is the anti-personnel high-explosive mine PFM-1 ""Petal"". Mines are usually green. Length 12-14 cm. Width 5-6 cm.

> Human injury is caused by traumatic injury to the lower extremity. The explosion occurs at the time of attack on the sensor. Due to the unusual shape of the plastic body, children often perceive a mine as a toy, and get seriously injured or die.

Especially given that last time his people tried to oust him, he required Russia's military aid to stay in power.

If you mess any of this up you could easily end up shooting down your own planes or leave your radar on so Russian ELINT can home in on you with air launched anti-radiation missile.

Real life military weapons systems isn't like your Toyota Corolla. It's not like connecting to public Wi-Fi. It doesn't just *work*.

A friend asked for an explanation why ""It's just Putin"" is wrong and dangerous. I felt it needs a longer response. Here it is:The problem is immeasurably deeper, wider and older than Putin and his band of gangsters. Generation after generation has been raised in a lie. And the despots who have ruled Russia have always gotten away with it internationally.The terror of Bolsheviks, Stalinist purges, the GULAG as a system have never been criminalised, there was never a national, leadership-led redemption attempt. The opposite, all this is now, again, officially preached as a proud process of national cleansing and strengthening.Stalin's generals and NKVD bosses were not tried at Nuremberg or Moscow process for co-conspiring with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1939, for Katyn, for invading and illegally annexing all or parts of the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, Romania, Hungary etc,never tried for genocide in all these countries nor for war crimes anywhere they went. I'm not even talking about the wave of Bolshevik aggression against all neighbours in 1918-24…Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine were all independent democratic nations back then whose future was crushed by Moscow. All these countries were betrayed by the Paris Peace Conference first and at Teheran and Yalta for the second time. By the West.Hence the deep suspicion in these countries that it’s going to happen again. If Ukraine would have not fought or fought but lost in a week, Ukraine would have been betrayed in a second. By Macron, Scholtz, Biden. Realpolitik and all. New Minsks, new mediations, soon new warsCurrent national myth of Russia & the core of Putins ideology is the lie about Russia as liberator. All of us between Russia and Germany are watching Ukraine being liberated and hope that for once the West understands that this is how the Russian liberation has always looked likeThis is what was done to us \[Estonia\] either in 1918-21 or 1939-45 or both. And it kept going until 1991. And it began again in 2008 and the West pretended, again, that it was not happening.Germans have apologised for 80 years but I still felt a bit uneasy listening to Scholtz saying: wir werden uns remilitarisieren \[""We will remilitarize\]. Thankfully, for once, the Germans r on the right side of things because even there, after 80 years, the demons are not entirely dead under the surface.So. No. It’s not about Putin. It is very much about the state of Russian society. It's not Russians' ""fault"", there are too many factors, but to fix this means a process of national breakdown, regrouping, redemption and re-education for, well, 80 years.It can only be done by the Russians themselves and the best thing we can do is not get in there to tell them how. Because we don't know better.All that is needed is help Ukraine win, set strict cold war rules relating to Russia until the war crimes have been tried, by them, and a representative government is in office. Let them demilitarise. And then take it slow. Very slowAnd jail every and any Westerner who tries to engage in corrupt business with them. And help them rebuild Russia not Russian imagined expansionist interests.Of course, it's not going to happen. At least not with the current bunch of leaders we got.

 [Soviet Union's opposition to the treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Francisco#Soviet_Union's_opposition_to_the_treaty) 
 
 >The Soviet Union took part in the San Francisco conference, and the Soviet delegation was led by the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet delegation made several unsuccessful procedural attempts to stall the proceedings. The Soviet Union's objections were detailed in a lengthy 8 September 1951, statement by Gromyko.
 
**[Kuril Islands dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute)** 
 
 >The Kuril Islands dispute, known as the Northern Territories dispute in Japan, is a territorial dispute between Japan and the Russian Federation over the ownership of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. The Kuril Islands are a chain of islands that stretch between the Japanese island of Hokkaido at their southern end and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula at their northern end. The islands separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean. The four disputed islands, like other islands in the Kuril chain that are not in dispute, were annexed by the Soviet Union following the Kuril Islands landing operation at the end of World War II.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

 >On 19 March 2011, a multi-state NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya, to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, in response to events during the First Libyan Civil War. With ten votes in favour and five abstentions, the UN Security Council's intent was to have ""an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute “crimes against humanity” . . .
 
**[Kosovo Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Force)** 
 
 >The Kosovo Force (KFOR) is a NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Its operations are gradually reducing until Kosovo's Security Force, established in 2009, becomes self sufficient. KFOR entered Kosovo on 11 June 1999, two days after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1244. At the time, Kosovo was facing a grave humanitarian crisis, with military forces from Yugoslavia in action against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in daily engagements.

If we try to look at the 30,000ft game theory version of this, we have a weak leader in Putin who’s already outmatched military has been exposed for a comical clusterfuck but it’s performance in this invasion. On the other hand, we have a coalition in NATO which is structurally conflict averse and who’s liberal democracies hold it to a higher moral standard than any military coalition in history. Putin’s remaining cards are all escalation, and the terrible state of his military leaves only the Chemical or Nuclear escalations as credible threats. If Putin attempts his favorite tactic of escalate to deescalate, he’s going to have to convince NATO that he really is willing to go all the way, otherwise it can be seen for what it is, a bluff. Where we are at this point, some escalation on NATO’s part could be strategic, as it takes the initiative away from Putin’s escalate to deescalate strategy. I’m not saying NATO should jump in with both feet, but if Russia does try to use chemical weapons, a quick and brutal retaliatory strike on those capabilities within Ukraine could effectively cut off Putin’s tactics. The real risk is that Putin again escalates to tactical nuclear weapons, which is where we don’t want to be. 

Personally I think a cornered Putin is dangerous enough to not try to play this game with him, and the fact that he is cornered is indication enough that what the West is doing to help Ukraine is working, we just have to weigh the certain loss of life with what we are doing verses the exponentially larger possible loss of life, perhaps *all* life that could come with escalating.

You (general, not you personally) can howl whatabout till the cows come home, but the fact remains that there is a dichotomy, two schools of thought, however you prefer to think of it.

 To remove it from world events, let's use a local crime as an example. When we hear of a brutal murder, how often do we hear people respond by suggesting all the terrible things that should be done to the murderer? It's as if they don't object to the act of murder, or the brutal thing that was done, they just object to the perpetrator in the news story having done it. They will even try to think of things that are more brutal, more horrible, as if they wish to prove that they can be worse than the murderer.

Others will disagree, saying no, we don't want to glorify that, we don't want to emulate that sort of thing. It is wrong.

Returning to the world stage, we can see people who are quite rightly outraged to hear of Russia's atrocities in Ukraine. Yet they have remained indifferent for months to -- I lost count, but millions slaughtered in Ethiopia -- a week or so ago, they were burning people alive. The junta in Myanmar has been doing absolutely horrible things, besides the genocide of the Rohinga, which the US decided to recognize after what 3 years?  4? The Uighur also have been victims of every atrocity imaginable for years, yet the other day, in a US university, when a Uighur student asked a question about it, a bunch of Chinese students rolled their eyes, groaned, and walked out.

So as a global population, we have some thinking to do. Are we against atrocities because we are against them as actions, as behavior, as intentional doing of harm to another person or persons? Do we object to those behaviors based on this or that characteristic of the perpetrator? The victim?

 >Fourth-generation warfare (4GW) is conflict characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics, combatants and civilians. The term was first used in 1980 by a team of United States analysts, including paleoconservative William S. Lind, to describe warfare's return to a decentralized form. In terms of generational modern warfare, the fourth generation signifies the nation states' loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times. The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent non-state actor.

Zelenskyy has been very clear that he will not accept a resolution that doesn't return Ukraine to it's 1991 borders. And I think he can do it too. By all reports, the Ukrainian people are aware that Russia's economic problems mean they cannot possibly support this war forever, it's just a matter of taking the punches (read: civilian casualties) long enough until Russia goes away. This is a tactic Ukrainians are historically very familiar with, and they are MOST certainly furious at Russia.

With the popular support of his people to continue the fight, right now Zelenskyy has no real reason (other than his personal suffering over the deaths of his people) why he would accept anything less.

Perhaps the Ukrainians will be able to counter attack, and we've seen them do that both successfully and unsuccessfully in some cases, but there is certainly an element of risk here. 

The question will likely be more along the lines of how Russian society will react to this. There's some talk now of larger mobilization, and the economic sanctions will only become more pressing as they start to take hold. The question is, can Russia from a social and economic point of view withstand the cost of such a sustained war.

Asad gases his people. He's still not winning, however.

Then, in the chaos rise of ISIS starts, and the rebels were also against ISIS.

Then Russia comes in (""mercenaries"").

Then Russia does to Aleppo what he's doing to Mariupol: took it apart brick by brick. Plus Asad continues to use chemical weapons.

Literally does the same thing with humanitarian corridors: Opens them and bombs the people who come out.

Now, mind you, I’m not a realist, but I think Putin *is*.  

I believe that Russia would’ve maintained their status as a world power and even advanced if they’d practiced diplomacy focused on soft power like a normal fucking country. That’s what China does, and they’re doing tremendously better than Russia.

The important bits are that power plants try to keep a set amount of power flowing, if plants go offline then other plants have to work to keep up the difference. But power plants have a maximum load they can generate before they're automatically shut down to prevent damage. If that happens it's weeks or months to bring back online.

https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-electric-grid-failure-warm-up/?utm_source=pocket-newtab


> For the grid to function properly, the supply of electricity must always match demand; this equilibrium is reflected in the grid’s frequency, which usually remains steady at 60 hertz. Power plants across the state are tuned in to the frequency, and they automatically increase or decrease generation to maintain equilibrium. The grid is like a giant synchronized machine, its components linked across hundreds of miles, from Midland to Houston, from Amarillo to Brownsville. On this night, as demand drastically outpaced supply, the frequency dropped and the vast machine began churning faster. But eventually it couldn’t compensate on its own.

…

> At the precise time of the third call, the frequency reached a critical threshold: 59.4 hertz. The Texas grid, which has been around in some form since World War II, had only once in its history fallen this low. Automated turbines across the state began spinning even faster to produce more electricity, but when the frequency dips below 59.4 hertz, the turbines reach speeds and pressures that can cause catastrophic damage to them, requiring that they be repaired or replaced. This scenario was unlikely because, to prevent it, the grid automatically triggers a nine-minute countdown when it strikes 59.4 hertz. If the frequency did not rise in time, power plants would shut down and the grid would begin turning itself off completely. This would leave all 26 million Texans who relied on the ERCOT grid without power for weeks or months. 

…

> It is hard to fathom the devastation a total shutdown would have wreaked. Bill Magness, then the CEO of ERCOT, would explain as much to the Texas Senate ten days later. Magness is a lawyer with a buzz cut and ramrod-straight posture who spent time in the nineties and aughts as a practicing Buddhist. “What my team and the folks at the utilities in Texas would be doing is an exercise called ‘black start,’ ” he said. A black start would have required carefully rebooting a few power plants at a time and using them to jump-start others, thereby restoring the grid piece by piece. It’s not a matter of flipping switches. The steps required for a black start are numerous, complex, and delicate.

Who's suggesting that? 

It's really worrying when people view the options as either war or nothing.

>Russia was at war, is at war, with the West.

What does that mean? Russia is historically and presently antagonistic towards the West, sure. But in what sense is Putin currently ""at war"" with the West? He hasn't declared war on NATO countries. He hasn't attacked NATO countries. Are you suggesting that NATO countries should send their men and women to die in Ukraine just because Putin is hostile to the West?

Don't fall into the trap of making nonsensical generalisations that have real-world consequences. Nobody is being ""timid"" - numerous countries have sent materiel, money and aid to Ukraine in addition to the military training NATO has been providing since 2015. The world is imposing unprecedented sanctions to force Putin's hand. And European countries are taking in refugees en masse. That's not ""being timid.""

And not all hostility is ""war."" Just because you think Putin ""is at war with the West"" doesn't mean he is. It certainly doesn't mean the West is at war with Russia. When Putin is truly at war with the West, you'll know it.

""As General Lutes analyzed the supply crisis in October and November, he came to the conclusion that the greatest single difficulty arose from the absence of an adequate system of supporting depots. From the time of the invasion until early August, the beaches and ports in Normandy served both as base depots and as depots issuing directly to units in the field. When the break-through came, the supply organization had no choice but to haul supplies all the way from the Normandy dumps to the combat troops. There was neither time nor personnel for moving supplies to intermediate or advance depots where they could be sorted and then issued to the combat commands only a short distance away.  The famous Red Ball Express and other devices simply hauled the most urgently needed supplies, especially food, gasoline, and ammunition, all the way from Normandy to the French border for immediate pickup by supply units of the combat commands. Sometimes, when certain specific replacement supplies were needed, combat supply troops went all the way back to Normandy to find what they wanted. With the front lines stabilized in September, General Lutes joined with the staff of the Communications Zone in arranging a program for building up advance depots close to the combat zone. This meant that the combat commands would look to the advance depots for all their supply needs, while the advance depots would in turn be assured of a constant flow from Normandy.
 
The inadequate depot situation on land was matched by a serious breakdown in ship discharge. The ASF earlier had consented to selective discharge, which resulted in ships becoming ""floating warehouses."" This consent had been reluctantly given to the theater and with the understanding that it was to be a temporary expedient. But more and more throughout August and September, ships remained tied up in Channel waters still fully or partially loaded, upsetting the whole world-wide shipping program.
 
Another problem was direct shipment. While the ASF was willing to ship supplies directly to France from the United States to support the large numbers of additional troops which were sent to the Continent after  August, it was not prepared to meet all Allied supply needs solely from the United States. General Somervell was convinced, for instance, that much of the ammunition which Eisenhower's headquarters was now requisitioning was actually on hand in England. ETO supply officers were so harassed in trying to get materiel from the Normandy peninsula to the German border that they had practically forgotten about the supplies which remained in England.""

I agree that Jews and other minorities have been  frequently victimized in history for the sake of dividing societies and placing certain people in power, however the sorts of deprivations the accusers engage in are precisely what they accuse Jews of trying to do on a global scale, I see no reason why they wouldn’t try it themselves if and when they think they can get away with it, as they so frequently do.",False,1647908436.0,t3_tjjlwx,t1_i1lkntq,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I don’t contend that Russians are fundamentally evil in their DNA but it’s clear that the current generation there has been fundamentally conditioned to see the world in a manner conducive to their selection/approval of Putin as their leader, and I’m not sure a generation’s worth of re-education will be enough to correct that outlook.

I’ve known at least one Russian in person who has lived here in Canada for many years and blatantly argued that Russia should just go ahead and take whatever it wants from whoever it wants and wave the nukes around if anyone objects. In a society with as many information sources as ours, how can I excuse such a criminal attitude? Yes that’s an anecdotal example of just one person, but I don’t see how his attitude substantially differs from most Russians I encounter online nor most of the dozens of Russian immigrants I’ve known in person as a Canadian. Everyone agrees Hitler was bad but we can’t even agree on the reasons why, some people think he just chose the wrong targets to victimize.

On the subject of the false flag Chechen apartment bombings, FSB agents were caught by a local policeman mere days after those bombings placing live explosives in the parking garage of yet another heavily inhabited apartment block. Putin exonerated them from criminal charges by claiming it was just a training exercise. Who trains with live explosives in inhabited apartment buildings without even evacuating the residents or at least notifying them- since when?

If you ask me, most Russians know perfectly well by now that Putin was responsible for those bombings, and I believe they forgive him for it because it gave them an excuse to utterly crush some ethnic minority who humiliated them simply by having the audacity to defend their basic rights as sovereign human beings.",1647913749.0,1647913509.0,t3_tjjlwx,t1_i1lqw68,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
