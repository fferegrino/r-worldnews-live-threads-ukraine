d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,133fagn,jia6rj0,"Ukrainian officials hint at Crimea strike success.

Ukraine does not usually claim responsibility for attacks on Crimea. 

But as we’ve reported today, an apparent drone strike is thought to have started an enormous fire in the region. 

Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram that air defence and electronic warfare forces on Saturday shot down two drones over the region. 

And Ukrainian officials have hinted at a successful strike on Russian targets, while being coy as usual. 

In a daily update on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said units had hit ""two depots of fuel and lubricants, two air defence systems, one artillery unit and another important enemy target,"" but gave no more details, Reuters reported. 

Typically, the Ukrainian military will use euphemistic language – or vague descriptions like this – after a successful strike in Crimea. 

But a military intelligence official went into a little more detail, according to RBC Ukraine. 

The official, Andriy Yusov, did not say Ukraine was behind the explosion in Sevastopol. 

However, he suggested 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia's Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported. 

Mr Yusov described the blast as ""God's punishment"" for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. 

""This punishment will be long-lasting,"" RBC Ukraine quoted him as saying. 

Mr Yusov is said to have added a warning to Crimea’s residents to help them stay safe from future fighting in the occupied area. 

He said: “In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor's army."" 

Ukraine says control of all its legal territory, including Crimea, is a key condition for any peace deal.

> Brief summary of the second wartime April: 

> 1) In the last month the battle for Bakhmut has failed to be ""excruciatingly won"", the enemy continues to defend on the western outskirts, determined to hold out until a counteroffensive on some other (I guess) front. ""Wagner"" has been bled dry, its assault force (even with constant reinforcement by volunteer units and ""mobiks"" from the MoD) was not enough to complete the operation in April. The ""Bakhmut meat grinder"" continues for both sides, but the enemy has achieved their goals, while our side has not. 

> 2) Near Avdiivka, our forces have failed and are now - due to heavy losses - forced to pull back again, leaving some of the positions they had previously occupied. In Maryinka - largely no changes - bloody ""tug-of-war"" street fighting continued throughout April, with variable success. On the other fronts, there were local battles and exchanges of artillery and air strikes. 

> The overall conclusion is that the April battles were again broadly successful for the enemy (in the context of buying time in strategic defence). In May the summer campaign will start and the ""turn for the Ukrainians"" will begin, as our generals managed to achieve virtually nothing over the winter and spring except the disposal of the shock troops in the Donbass.",False,1682862547.0,t3_133fagn,t3_133fagn,,0,119,0,119,0,0,

The longer this war drags on the worse the growing poverty crisis the Ukrainians face.  

Here's a brief summary from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-431-of-the-invasion):  
>A growing poverty crisis in Ukraine has led many to turn to Kyiv’s pawn shops to surrender mobile phones, appliances and other belongings in order to get by. Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution’s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.  

There's also an accompanying article on the subject for those who wish to read a bit more. It's titled [Pawn shops and bread queues: poverty grips Ukraine as war drags on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-war-poverty-irpin-pawn-shops-bread-queues).  

With Russia targeting civilian infrastructure and cutting them off from ports to export goods many people are loosing their jobs.  

Here's a quote from that article:  
>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children’s toys.  

It's truly amazing the resilience the Ukrainians are showing against Putin.  

Here's another quote from that article which shows how some non-military support is helping Ukraine in this time of crisis:  
>The economist Olena Bilan sees a deepening crisis, but says that without a huge package of financial support from the international community, including pledges worth $43bn (£34bn), the situation would be worse.

>“We’ve seen GDP decline by 30% in large part because Ukraine exports 80% of its goods through ports it no longer has access too. We’ve had inflation of 26% – again which could have been worse – but people’s salaries have also been flat and the currency has devalued against the dollar by 20%. The biggest challenge is going to be how to create new jobs.”  

It's just like people have been saying since the start of this war. During this time of crisis Ukraine needs a wide range of support, not just the obvious military equipment, military intelligence support, training, etc.",False,1682906787.0,t3_133fagn,t3_133fagn,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

I didn’t understand the bravado...just today even talking about May 9, and the Russians haven’t seen anything yet, and how it’s all a distraction and playing puppets [some bakhmut channels started bickering, bc guys are dying, and folks are acting like it’s a game....]  My Russian and Ukrainian is limited, I don’t understand euphemism, colloquialisms, so I assumed what they have been saying was simply lost in translatio.

Looking at old posts from VolyaMedia, where they quote RF Staff Offices, there’s anxiety that Ukraine has lured RF to Bakhmut—but UA is on the precipice of encircling a massive swath of land, much bigger than Bakhmut. That it’s [Ukraine that’s made gains north of Bakhmut.](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1r5j2jwIyNBYbs5e-pinvLL_V0i8urcQ&g_ep=CAESCTExLjY2LjYwMhgAQgJVQQ%3D%3D&shorturl=1&ll=48.64761314544245%2C38.06833397579329&z=10)

> According to officers on both sides, the AFU in the city is being attacked but their situation is far from hopeless. **While PMCs and the RF Armed Forces encircle Bakhmut, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are slowly advancing north and south of the Russian positions and can at any moment go forward, arranging a cauldron for those who are trying to surround Bakhmut.**

The Russian Staff Officer:

> > “Two rings, two ends, and in the middle is Bakhmut. There is matryoshka [encirclement]. **We surround them, but they surround us.** The command insists that the city be completely blocked in the shortest possible time. PMCs have been strengthened, army units have been strengthened by the Airborne Forces, a tank formation, they have been given a weekly ration of shells, they have not yet arrived, but they should be. I do not understand why this is being done, because the situation for our troops is threatening. By cutting off Bakhmut, we ourselves can find ourselves in the ring, and even with the burning middle, which is controlled by the Ukrainians,” says the Russian staff officer. 

Ukrainian Staff Officer:

> “The harder they bite into the city, the better for us now. They compactly deploy troops in a small area that can be bypassed from two sides, moreover, quickly. **I won’t talk about plans, but we have a good chance of organizing the largest encirclement for the Russians since the beginning of the war**,” explains a Ukrainian staff officer. 


Then, a week later, VolyaMedia again address Bakhmut

> Some Russian staff officers believe that after the ""victory"" [in Bakhmut] the RF Armed Forces will be in big trouble, because the Armed Forces of Ukraine can strike southwest and northeast of the city. If they cannot be repulsed, **then not only the newly captured city will be lost, but also the Russian group that fought for it.**

Russian Staff Officer:

> > “A lot of artillery and fresh units arrived at the other side (AFU). They hold their positions, efficiently and prudently, and are clearly preparing for offensive operations. And our command has some moods [fantasies] for a parade. Now let's take the last quarters and report on the victory. They will report, and our Slav brothers will bleed us here. [RF wants a parade to celebrate Bakhmut, but the AFU is just going to recapture it.] They will strike from Kurdyumovka and Vesely and meet in Popasna already. The entire sector of the front will fall in three days,” says the Russian officer. 

> The Ukrainian military refused to comment on these assumptions of the enemy, saying only that the situation is complicated. 



I never understood all that cryptic bravado until now.   Even last night, the bakhmut channels were teasing of what is to come.

tbh I don't think that any of the commonly proposed vectors of attack are likely to be successful. we've already seen what happens when you try to punch an armoured fist through minefields covered by artillery without air superiority in the failed russian attack on vuhledar. to clear minefields you have to go slow to deploy the specialised equipment, to beat artillery you have to move fast. without air strikes to suppress the artillery you are fucked basically. Russia lost 100+ armoured vehicles for little gain and it's likely the same will happen to Ukraine in a similar situation if not worse due to the current 4x or thereabouts superiority in artillery ammo

There aren't the specific conditions that let Ukraine have their success on the offensive in Kharkov (critical lack of manpower resulting in thin defence lines) or Kherson (extreme supply bottlenecks resulting in inability to sustain an attritional battle)

There is a plan that I posted in noncredibledefense that I think is the only plan that can realistically win the war. if the attack is launched north east from Kharkov to take valuyki and then rossosh it would cut two of the four main supply arteries for the entire bulk of the Russian army in Donbas and the south. given that these supply routed are the ones coming from Moscow I'm guessing they're likely to be the two more important ones also.

the section of the front is lightly guarded as Russia is operating on the assumption that Ukraine won't make an offense into their territory. there won't be the density of minefields and fortifications to slow down an armoured offensive or the density of artillery to destroy units that do get bogged down so a breakthrough is actually likely here unlike everywhere else where it is basically just wishful thinking. there is also minimal chance of being repelled after the breakthrough by mobile reserves as the vast bulk of the Russian army is to the south while the bulk of the supplies will be to the north. you can expect the Russian supply situation to rapidly become critical crippling the ability of the Russian army to fight or manoeuvre and an intense counterattack will only make the issue come to a head even faster. by immobilising the Russians in this way it would become possible to outmanoeuvre them and concentrate forces favourably to isolate and destroy entire units and the actually valuable equipment kept in the rear echelons (strategic air defences, headquarters etc.) unlike the attritional frontline fighting that while it allows Ukraine to rack up impressive sounding casualty numbers the value of the Russian losses is actually pretty low and with further mobilisation could continue near indefinitely. also any wider rout that could start as supply shortages cause immobilisation will lead to large amounts of heavy equipment left behind due to the speed of such a collapse

I posted on NCD because for some reason the majority opinion is that Russia would react to the imminent defeat of their army with nuclear weapons but tbh I think theyre bluffing. anyway I don't see any other plan that this actually succeeding on any significant scale but I suppose we will have seen in a few months from now",1682843311.0,1682842995.0,t3_133fagn,t1_ji9ydtv,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Putin hasn't moved from his maximalist goal of regime change in Kyiv and full disarmament of Ukraine.

Ukraine also haven't moved from their goal of repelling these illegal genocidal invaders from all of their territory.  Can they win?  Perhaps.  They've managed to repel them from Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Snake Island etc.  A big counteroffensive is coming, which may break the ""land bridge"" and threaten Crimea.

Gorbachev later appeared to reverse himself, saying the subject of enlargement in fact never came up in 1989 or 1990. ""The topic of 'NATO expansion' was never discussed; it was not raised in those years. I am saying this with a full sense of responsibility. Not a single Eastern European country brought up the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact had ceased to exist in 1991,"" he told the newspaper Kommersant in October 2014.

On the point about Zelensky should go and fight. You do realise that some structure needs to exist for a country to survive a war? How would Zelensky dying help the Ukrainian war effort?

Other than that, there were 'Belozheva accords' in which Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have jointly agreed to disband the USSR.

More importantly however, there was no agreement or anything of that sort between NATO and the new authorities in Moscow, except a verbal 'nod' by some politician that was clearly insignificant and not ratified. Do you trust politicians in your daily life for example, when they make exquisite promises?

Another problem was the Primakov doctrine, which indicated that Russia was going to expand itself militarily in the post-Soviet space **regardless of** NATO expanding or remaining the same. This doctrine is not something new either, it was developed in the 90s when the union was falling apart.

This has naturally caused post-Soviet and post-Warsaw Pact nations to shift towards the West and join NATO on their free will, so NATO is not 'expanding'. Guess why? Because these nations have known how is it to live under Moscow's yoke, and they have the right to decide for themselves, which includes Ukraine.

THIS. 

There is a rather flawed theory that establishing a working relationship (f/ex: financial/trade) would somehow make Russia less of a bully, or a threat. The idea being that engagement would slowly undermine the military strength of Russia. By contrast, maintaining a simmering level of confrontation would keep Russian military forces in a state of perpetual readiness. These folks now point to the fact that Russia was ill prepared for the Ukraine invasion, and are currently relying on Cold War era gear and strategies. The money that should have paid for new armament ended up funding countless mega yachts. Russian corruption also weakened the military infrastructure. Etc.

The flaw in this theory is that none of the above has done anything to hamper Russian ambitions. If Russia became overweight and out of shape, they also became delusional with no checks and balances. Putin is still in power, and there is no organized or agreed upon line of succession. Talented individuals have been sidelined, and voices of dissent were poisoned or fell from open windows.

But that would be a setback for the more grinding warfare near Bakhmut. 

If it’s rocket artillery or drones, that would be worse for the counteroffensive, as it may impact how many targets behind russian lines Ukraine can service to soften them up, but the counterpoint is that rocket artillery is something the west does have more of that it can give, unlike standard artillery, which has proven more difficult.

Because of this, Austria-Hungary, blaming the Serbian government, declared war on Serbia (after getting their ally, Germany's backing). Russia then got involved because it had an alliance with Serbia. So Germany was at / declared war with Russia. But France and the UK were allies with Russia back then (!).

The main issue with the Treaty of Versailles is it was spun as a treaty that a loser would get when Germany didn’t truely lose the war (after all on Nov 11th, 1918 the Western front was firmly in France/Belgium) which bred the Stab in the back myth that the Germany military wasn’t defeated the Social Democrats betrayed Germany

I suppose the same reason that has made US think it has the authority to destroy nations one after the other has given the authority to Russia to have a say over its neighbors.
