Day 117 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling was pretty bad, first they shelled one of the districts of the city at around 3pm, which cut off the electricity for some people, it didn‚Äôt for us, but running water did stop for a bit. It was fixed within an hour after shelling stopped. Then it was quiet for some time, but as always they fired their scheduled missiles at us from Belgorod at 11pm, it was just 2 missiles this time.

The explosions from those missiles were pretty loud, and a fire started as well, but it was dealt with quickly. Then it got quiet for a couple hours again, until just 30 minutes ago. At 3:30am they shelled something in oblast, but the explosions were very loud, they sounded pretty close to us. So it might have been coming from Mala Danilyvka or from Derhachy. After that our own artillery immediately started their counter fire. They are still firing even right now, at 4am, but those sounds are pretty hard to distinguish from one another, some of them could still be incoming shelling.

Also that situation with gas platforms that we hit today, after which Russia started threatening to hit our ‚Äúdecision making centres‚Äù yet again, is just so absurd. They were ours to begin with, but then Russia stole them from us in 2014 along with Crimea. Today we struck them with missiles and for some reason that made Russia very upset. 

They are literally ours, we can do whatever we want with them, and no, the one who stole them has absolutely no say in what we can, and cannot do to them. It‚Äôs hilarious how Russia got so angry about it, that in retaliation they launched 14 missiles at Odesa right after we hit those gas platforms. They got very upset that we didn‚Äôt let them use stolen property. Yeah, how dare we not let them steal our resources?",False,1655774555.0,t3_vgcfme,t3_vgcfme,,0,97,0,97,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

From CNN's Benjamin Brown in London

In a nationwide first, German authorities have seized three flats belonging to a sanctioned Russian parliamentarian and his wife.

The Munich flats owned by the Duma representative and his wife were seized together with a bank account used to facilitate rental payments worth 3,500 euros ($3,700) per month to the couple, Munich's public prosecutor said Monday.

The case was the first in Germany in which assets belonging to a sanctioned individual were seized rather than frozen.¬†

The owner of the flat was only identified by his initial L., as is customary in Germany. The Duma member was sanctioned by the European Union on Feb. 23, 2022 ‚Äì one day before Russia invaded Ukraine ‚Äì over his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to recognize breakaway eastern Ukrainian territories as independent, Munich's public prosecutor said.

Two of the flats were owned by both the Duma member and his¬†unidentified¬†wife, while one apartment was only in his wife's name. As the spouse of a sanctioned individual, the man's wife was also subject to sanctions, Munich's public prosecutor argued.

With the seizure of the apartments coming into effect Monday, while the tenants are allowed to remain in their flats, they must deposit their rental payments with a Munich court rather than making these to their sanctioned landlords.

>Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Finance announced tax reform amid the collapse of budget revenues due to the war

There's a link in the tweet to an article in Russian that says some very interesting things about the Russian economy.

>So far, the budget has been kept from a collapse in revenues by oil and gas revenues, which, against the backdrop of record prices, are kept at acceptable levels, but even against such a background, the Ministry of Finance expects to end the year with a deficit of 1.665 trillion rubles instead of a surplus of 1.327 trillion rubles.

>At the same time, according to the forecasts of the Ministry of Finance, budget revenues will not be enough for four years in a row: in 2023, the deficit is expected at the level of 1.591 trillion rubles, in 2024 - 1.413 trillion, in 2025 - 1.358 trillion, in total - more than 6 trillion rubles. Moreover, the main budget expenditures, according to the minister, will be associated with overcoming the consequences of sanctions. For these purposes, 400 billion rubles will be allocated in 2022, and more than 2.5 trillion rubles in 2025.

There's another interesting article at that same source (it's a .ru, so you'll need to remove the brackets to make the link work).

**The Ministry of Finance announced a sharp drop in the income of Russians, contrary to Putin's words** https://theins.[ru]/news/252394

>According to the results of 2022, the real incomes of Russians will fall by 6.8%, and in 2023 growth will resume, but only by 1.3%.

>The dynamics in real wages will be somewhat softer, according to the Ministry of Finance: in 2022, real wages will fall only by 3.8%, and in 2023 they will already return to growth - by 0.8%. In parallel, the agency expects a significant increase in unemployment: in 2023, the Ministry of Finance predicts an increase in the rate to 6.6% with a further decrease in 2025 to 4.5%. At the moment, unemployment is at a low level - in the region of 4.1%.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum demanded from the government to grow incomes of Russians already in 2022, moreover, at the beginning of the year the president promised Russians a growth of 2.5%. However, the president's promises will not be fulfilled - even now Rosstat is recording a sharp increase in poverty among citizens.

>According to the results of the first quarter of 2022, 20.9 million Russians lived below the official poverty line, which is almost 69% more than at the end of 2021, when Rosstat recorded the same figure at 12.9 million.

**And Zelensky's telling is now the only telling of the war there is.** Lionizing any world leader is dicey business, but this is surely Zelensky's moment. To have monopolized the media main stage for months in his own videos is an extraordinary feat. To have built, brick by brick, a grand narrative that attracted aid from around the world is another. But to have reminded the world of the cultural interplay, home planet, and grounding in reality that make us humans is to pull off a rhetorical rout comparable to any heroism on the battlefield.

 Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 June 2022
 
- Russian ground and tactical air operations have remained focused on the central Donbas sector over the weekend.


- In the conflict to date, Russia's air force has underperformed. Its failure to consistently deliver air power is likely one of the most important factors behind Russia's very limited campaign success. It cannot gain full air superiority and has operated in a risk-adverse style, rarely penetrating deep behind Ukrainian lines. Some of the underlying causes of its difficulties echo those of Russian Ground Forces. For years, much of Russia's air combat training has highly likely been heavily scripted and designed to impress senior officials, rather than to develop dynamic initiative amongst air crews.


- While Russia has an impressive roster of relatively modern and capable combat jets, the air force has also almost certainly failed to develop the institutional culture and skill-sets required for its personnel to meet Russia's aspiration of delivering a more Western-style modern air campaign. This has led to a greater than planned weight of effort falling to ground troops, who are becoming exhausted; and on advanced cruise missiles, stocks of which are likely running low.

e61e3fa1c93925ba758ad08281b58b4b,vgcfme,id20jvn,"The Russian oil industry is never coming back from this. 




In the world of oil and gas, there are oil companies, and there are oil-development companies, or more accurately there is Halliburton, who has taken over most of the worlds oil development work. 



Oil companies gamble. Oil development companies don‚Äôt. If you have deep pockets and a check-book, you can be an oil company. Go find a plot of land that you think has oil on it, buy the mineral-rights, and then pay someone to come drill some holes. If you get the holes drilled cheaply and efficiently, and If a lot of oil comes out of those holes, you should make your money back in a decade or two and then start making profit. If the holes come up dry, or underperform your expectations, or if it ended up costing you more than you thought to get them drilled, you just wasted a bunch of money. Development companies don‚Äôt care. They get paid no matter what.



Some countries use nationalized oil companies and nationalized development companies. Russia does it all in-house. Venezuela too. Norway does a lot of their own in-house development, but they aren‚Äôt against using Halliburton if they want to. More and more, even the big state-owned companies are turning away from doing it themselves and hiring Halliburton, because if you aren‚Äôt, you‚Äôre competing against people who are, and Halliburton just does it better and cheaper.




The Russian oil industry is a lot like the Russian military. Once, it really was one of the best in the world, it was huge, and it was competently run. But years of corruption, mismanagement and neglect have let it fall apart. It‚Äôs barely holding together now, and would need truly massive investment just to stop the rot.



Nobody in the oil business is ever going to want to do business in Russia ever again. Not state-owned oil companies, not China, not India, nobody. People will buy Russian oil as long as it‚Äôs still flowing, but that won‚Äôt be for much longer. Anybody looking further down the road will be looking elsewhere. If China wants to invest in securing oil-supplies in to the distant future, their money would be better spent developing new fields pretty much anywhere. There are undeveloped fields in the South China Sea. Those are where China would rather spend their money if they‚Äôre going to try to get in to the oil business. But if China doesn‚Äôt want to use Halliburton, they‚Äôll have to create an entire development industry from scratch. They might try to do that. But Russia‚Äôs development industry isn‚Äôt capable, they can‚Äôt even maintain their own infrastructure.



The TV show Dallas gave people the impression that the oil business is easy money. It isn‚Äôt. For every JR, there are five who went broke. Back in those days there were tons of little oil-development companies, and some were better than others. If you hired the wrong one, you were going to have a bad time. These days, Halliburton reigns supreme. There‚Äôs less gamble in the oil business than there used to be because of that. It‚Äôs still a gamble if the holes you get drilled actually produce what you hope they‚Äôll produce, but you don‚Äôt have to worry if your development company is going to rip you off or have massive cost overruns or go out of business before they‚Äôre finished. Unless, of course, you‚Äôre trying to do oil business in Russia, where it‚Äôs pretty much a certainty that you‚Äôre going to get ripped off in one way or another, and nobody wants that.",False,1655730801.0,t3_vgcfme,t3_vgcfme,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

Donbas doesn't really matter.  Let's assume max doomerism: Ukraine loses the salient, pulls back to shorten the lines.  OK, that sucks I guess, but it's nothing really amazingly important.  They lose a city, after a long grind, I'm sure it sounds callous as hell to the poor people living there, but, it's not one of amazing importance in the grand scheme of Ukraine continuing to exist and fight back.

Realistically?  It's an attrition action, wearing down Russian stocks.  The Russians can get people, for now, sure, but they don't have anything but old materiel that's basically HIMARS bait.  Meanwhile Kherson is looking *incredibly* vulnerable, and people overestimate production capability for Russia.  Every time they get ammo to the front it seems to get blown up; they have more guns overall, but they're using artillery like a 1970s army and Ukraine is using it like a 2020s army.

Give it a few weeks and things like HIMARS will start doing real damage on Russia.  I don't think this will be a years long conflict.

STOP IT! (The doomering)

War is %&$&ed. People die pointlessly and ground is gained or lost for no purpose every day.

There is no 'accurate assessment'. Because of this, folks get lost in media hyperbole.

I try and avoid focusing on the smaller details and look at the conflict as a whole (strategic perspective).

The fact is that Russia has a lot of munitions and artillery, but little effective forces otherwise.

Infantry is key to power on the ground, force multipliers provide projection. Ukraine has demonstrated time and again an ability to effectively utilise force multipliers. Russia has not.

Be patient, be positive and wait to see what Ukraine does in July and August. This war isn't 'stagnant' or 'static' and the next 70 days will frame then next 2 years.

A recent poll showed that Finnish population blamed Russia for the war even more than the Polish population did. And Swedish population was right behind them. Denmark and Norway weren't included in the poll, but the sentiment is similar there.

Italy is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. It's easy for Putin to buy political support there. Whereas Scandinavian countries consistently rank as the least corrupt and most progressive countries in the world, hence why Putin has absolutely ZERO chance there (his chances in the US are much better, as shown during Trump presidency).

I believe the border guards were informed that -everything- gets seriously inspected except a bus full of Ukrainian men heading out. They just got flagged through in the first few weeks. Not many of them anymore I guess, pretty much everyone is back who wants to be to defend Ukraine.

Perhaps the Russians could try to ship sanctioned stuff through Belarus further down south, maybe near Brest in Belarus, but then I am pretty sure that a Russian train would have to go through Warsaw and then Bialystok up to Suwalki then into Kalininininingrad.

Warsaw and Bialystok are two cities that were absolutely destroyed by Russia (and the Germans) several times in living history.

So 1 USD is 1 USD but it buys a different amount of bread in Russia than it does in America, even tho it's still 1 USD. This applies to everything including the defence budgets, and Russia does not buy their major weapons components from the west.

The Czechoslovak People's Army was utterly defeated by the Warsaw Pact armies.

If it's at $40/barrel then I agree it might be hit or miss without good stewardship, but if oil is going to remain at $80+ it gives producers a lot more flexibility to be wrong.  Everything is really price dependent.  They currently cost $30/barrel to produce on land ($18 producing/$12 transporting).

Transportation is likely up significantly because pipelines are being cut off or shut down and container ships are being denied or rejected.  But they can likely solve that long term and maybe it only jumps to $20-ish.  But the $18 production cost is what they're doing now and even if they lost 50% efficiency it then costs them $36/barrel.  So then it's $56-60/barrel, that would still allow a profit at a relatively lower price than oil is now.

This allows them to sell electricity at much higher prices, but it also means their domestic consumers have to pay that same high price for consumption. But they are net exporters of electricity. Prices are set at the marginal price in the electricity market. That means the price of one MW is equal to the last MW produced or consumed/foregone (in case of a down regulation). I say this once more, you are an absolute idiot for spewing these falls facts here. You don't even know how cobbeling of areas affect prices. Electricity is traded between areas 2 hours in advance of the actual hour. Depending on the day-ahead scheduled flow and the intraday trades prices of the cobbled areas can either end at the same level in case of up/down regulations. If say, Finland or Denmark need 200 extra MW to satisfy consumption, the price can end up being 200-300% above the spot price.

All air defence systems can be overwhelmed or defeated.  Modern air defence is layered and amalgamated. The failure of any one system isn't necessarily an indictment of that system. US Patriot systems have had a lot of of problems in Yemen for example. The S-400 is well regarded by people who study such things so that's about all I can say about it. We haven't until now seen it field-tested as part of modern air defence. Some systems have been sold to Iran, and S-300 were used in Syria. 

In terms of procurement. Weapons, development from prototype to procurement can be difficult and is never smooth. We can look at the myriad amount of problems in our own F-35 development. Even as of 2020 it still has 7 critical deficiencies after a development that began in 1995, is 8 years behind schedule and 165 billion USD over budget.

In terms of the SU-57. It is actually the only next-gen fighter in the world that actually has seen combat in Syria and Ukraine now. Having said it only recently came out of prototype and is not in full production and Russia only operates a test unit, with the goal of having 3 squadrons worth by 2027. It has nothing to do with afford, these weapons are just coming online.

All of these is to say none of these weapons are wonder weapons, and none save the Pantisr-S-400 are actually in full service or were meant to be built in large quantities by the current year.

So the fact that weapons systems that were not planned to be built aren't built doesn't really tell us anything about Russian weapons procurement. Likewise, that systems have problems from prototype to full production doesn't either.

In terms of other things. We should be aware of our own biases and media biases in regards to this war if we are trying to take a more cold and calculated look at these systems or the Russian army.

We don't have a very good framework for analyzing a war like this. We have to go back all the way to Korea for the last time a western country has fought a near pear.",False,1655772924.0,t3_vgcfme,t1_id4dzsc,,8,0,0,0,0,0,

Not with these electricity prices. I used to use mine, and an AC to keep where I'm living warmer but this year I just kept heating only the living room with firewood once a day (the oven's not built for sustained fire), and straight up didn't use the other rooms, kept the doors closed and insulated. Still woke up to a toasty 13 degrees Celsius every morning though, throughout March and April. Slept in three layers of clothing and two layers of blankets. And *still* my electricity bills are over twice as high as they were two years ago, while wages barely move.

Poor people simply cannot afford portable electric heaters with this energy crisis. Frankly if the next winter's gonna be as cold as this one, I'm guessing *a lot* of woodfire heated houses where old people and poor people live are going to go up in flames as people are trying to keep warm (I live in Estonia. Lots and lots of old homes here without central heating or any type of heating besides woodfire).

You're trying to redefine what very right wing is, the Tories are certainly right wing to centre right wing. But very right wing they are not.

I wouldn't say letting the bodies ""pile high"" to save the economy, wanting people back to the office for the sake of landlords, signing DNRs for disabled people or trying to send refugees to rwanda are centrist views

Centre right in terms of the UK maybe sure, but my point is that the UK in general is a right wing country so if makes sense that the right are seen as centrist

The only historical context is that there's never been a foreign war the UK wasn't involved on that much of the population really cared about, that's normal and I accept it

Sure its not like tomorrow everyone's gonna turn against it, but most sources say the war will last years, that living standards will fall, inflation will rise etc. The original post itself is on a timescale of years talking about future elections, at some point I think ""here's another billion for Ukraine, sorry we can't do anything for working people in the UK we can't afford it, btw here's another tax increase"" will become unpopular, but sure agree to disagree

Not moving them, ""billions total"" doesn't mean the average person is donating half their salary, giving a few pound is still virtue signalling

Public support as in, virtue signalling mostly, sure some people did go fight there but the difference being the UK was actively involved which it isn't in Ukraine
