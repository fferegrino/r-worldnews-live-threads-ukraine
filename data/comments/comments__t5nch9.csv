Hi, my name is Eugene. I am a citizen of Russia and live there. I was born in Ukraine, near Zhytomyr. My mother is from there, my father is Russian. 
My country invaded a sovereign country of Ukraine on 24th of February, violating all international laws. Though I haven’t lived in Ukraine and only visited my relatives there once a year, it’s heartbreaking to see what’s going on there now. The war. In its full meaning.
And you probably know who to blame. Putin and his regime. He has been ruling over my country for more than 20 years, and I am 28 years old. During almost all my life I am witnessing the same person in power. The politicians should not have any right to rule for such a long period of time, and now we have a pretty clear example why.

During this time Putin turned Russia into police state with kleptocratic regime. This has been achieved also with a help of a heavy propaganda broadcasted by the state media, implying that Putin is the only available choice for people in order to avoid extinction of our country. 
The real reason of this “only choice” is that our opposition is not allowed to participate in state politics and it is heavenly oppressed.
Common people are brainwashed and have been taught to see only an enemy in the face of western countries for many years.

But still there is a hope for things to change. Since the very beginning of Putin’s reign there is a liberal community who does not want to share its future with Putin and his friends, and these people have been protesting for all these years. This community grows each year and Putin knows it, he is afraid of it and always try to hunt down its leaders, like Nemtsov and Navalny. Putin knows that if people can gather he will be thrown from his throne immediately.

Now we are in a situation when he has obviously gone mad, started a war and threatening everybody with nukes like a cornered animal. He wanted to repeat the Crimea effect to get people’s endorsement and successfully win the election of 2024 falsifying it again.
But this time he miscalculated, he believed his own propaganda that he could become a history figure and reunite “Russian Empire” or whatever. Doing this he started a war. He has stolen the future of Russian people, and, which is more sad, Ukrainians.

There are not many ways to stop him right now. One of them is to support the protest and hope that his own people will end this nightmare in Ukraine and start to live freely. We don’t support this war, we don’t need it, neither do people in Ukraine and other parts of the world. Our opposition leaders were forced to leave the country or imprisoned, our independent media was blocked, social networks are getting blocked as well, but still there are protests against Putin and war everyday in Moscow and Saint Petersburg and in other cities.

But, as I mentioned, Russia is a police state and Putin gathered a lot of recourses to beat his own people to not let the protests happen.
Nevertheless, there is a way of how everyone can help the protest.
There are several organizations which provide legal assistance to people during protests and help the detained ones and in courts. Below I provide links for their donation pages:

[OVD-Info](https://donate.ovdinfo.org/en): There is information in English on the webpage, you can read about organization and consider donation.
[Apologia](https://apologia.pro/): Unfortunately, the information is in Russian only.

These are two major organizations which support the protestors with legal assistance. I contacted them and asked if it is okay for them to have donations from abroad, they said that legally it’s fine, since they have already been claimed as foreign agents (this was done by the government last summer in order to cut their budgets off and make their work harder). There can be some restrictions due to SWIFT cut off, depends on their bank account (not all banks are sanctioned) and PayPal does not allow to withdraw money from the account at this point due to sanctions. But please, consider donating. 

I hope that sooner or later people in Russia will understand what and who led the country to the current point, and more and more people will become annoyed. The sanctions will help in this, and it is sad for me as a citizen of Russia, I don’t want to live in isolation, but I understand that those measures were applied due to obvious reasons. 

Anyway, there are lots of steps people in Russia will need to take in order to eliminate Putin’s heritage, build a proper democratic country and return the credibility in the eyes of the whole world. This will take decades, thanks to him.

And to my fellow Ukrainians: I’m sorry. We do not want this. Hopefully, we will manage to stop this nightmare together. Stay strong.

P.S.

Russia invaded. Russia attacked. No one was threatening them. There was no impending war. Countries join NATO because they are afraid of Russia because Russia is the aggressor.

As we all know, this has nothing to do with Russia's 'defensive' concerns. It had everything to do with their **offensive** intensions. Their whole ethos is built on conquest. I mean, look at the size of their country... Conquest is their only source of pride given that the USA and China have completely trounced them in every other aspect from medicine to technology (which is sad given their history in the areas of mathematics and physics).

This narrative that these bots and nationalists keep pushing implies that Ukraine has no right to self-determination at all. The US is doing this, the US is doing that.

Most people have said this means the old USSR territories but I have done a little digging and I actually think he means more than that. I also don't think it is a direct antonym to the ""Western world."" 

It seems like he means the areas stretching from Finland to the north Middle East to central Europe western Canada, including all of Alaska (formerly called Russian North America).

This more expansive meaning is roughly the same as the old Russian Empire from the 1700s, which included more territories and protectorates than the USSR but did have fluid boundaries over the course of time. The only parts I have been unclear about are a few small areas of what is now China that it doesn't seem Putin is interested in (go figure).

Of course it is wholly unrealistic that Russia could ever reclaim all of these countries but from what I see in the media I think it is reasonable that if given the chance Putin would try, which is very scary to think about.

All except for ""There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly."" seems to be correct.

As for the rockets bit, the shelling started about 2-3 days ago, so I'm (fingers-crossed) that shelling will level off during weekend.

I also saw an infographic which stated that Russian army has 1000+ rockets/missiles.  (Sorry, can't remember where I saw it.)  That plus recent news that 400 rockets already fired also makes me hope that Russian army is down to 50% rockets.

3. If they can convince the whole convoy to desert through kindness and education it’s a MUCH greater win on many fronts.

A political expert says a highly secretive defence intelligence facility on the outskirts of Alice Springs is likely gathering information about the escalating situation in Ukraine. 
Professor Richard Tanter from the University of Melbourne said the base would be playing a crucial role in gathering intelligence through covert communications from the Ukraine and border regions.

""Pine Gap collects two main sources of intelligence,"" Professor Tanter said.

""One is telephone transmissions, radar transmissions, any kind of electronic transmissions, communications or otherwise.

""It also collects the thermal imagery, that heat bloom, of missiles launching.""

I hope the Ukrainians understand this. It’s not that we don’t want to help. But this is a world war. We are just trying to be prepared for the worst outcome. If the other EU countries closer to you unite together it’s more than enough to take Russia out. It’s why Biden has been uniting nato to do the sanctions. To see who’s willing to get together to actually fight. I know it seems like an eternity. But the plan is to evacuate all willing personals to safety before a full blown assault is to happen. Please don’t think that we don’t care. This war isn’t a 10 day war. This war is permanently going to take Russia out to the point of never repeating itself. The other nations are coming.

Russia is deathly afraid of NATO. Ukraine is the line in the sand for them regarding NATO expansion. They will not allow NATO to expand right to their door step. This is the #1 reason for this action from the government.

Russian PEOPLE are fond of the old Soviet Union, the one with Greater Russians, Belarusians and ""little Russians"". Economically it sucked, but it was a source of national pride for them. They don't mind if the outcome of this conflict ends up with Ukraine becoming a vassal state like Belarus (independent but subservient to Russian rule). So while they may not like Putin, or even the war, they seem to tolerate it just because.

Unknown to most of us in the West, the conflict in the Donbass region was very traumatic for Russians. Russian government and people consider the conflict as a genocide against the Russian minority. This war has been going on for 8 years.

So what the end goal for Russia. You'll hear terms like denazification (this just means they are going to save the Russian minority in Ukraine from genocide), and another term like demilitarization (means NO NATO EXPANSION). 

Worst case scenario, Ukraine conflict last decades with Russia in control of it. This is fine for them because it means no NATO anyway and they are willing to ruin their economy to achieve it.

Best case scenario, they control Ukraine, install a puppet government and it becomes Belarus. They ask for sanctions to be removed to help Ukraine rebuild etc.",False,1646312027.0,t3_t5nch9,t3_t5nch9,,0,-34,0,-34,0,0,

Iraq/Iran sanctions have caused the deaths of MILLIONS, Iraq/Afghanistan wars, Syria, Palestine, Libya, funding/arming the Saudis in Yemen, these conflicts have direct/indirect death totals combined since 2000 that are probably upwards of 10 million with at least half being civilians and well over 1,000,000 children. We have maybe a dozen children dead in Ukraine and the entire Western world is screaming ""war crimes, Russia is subhuman, Putin is Hitler"", etc, while living under governments responsible for literally millions of children dying through political meddling, invasions, arms sales, militia training, poverty inducing sanctions, etc. 

Do you think Russians see this response and the sanctions towards everything as an attack on Russians rather than their government when up until now all these same nations turned a blind eye to atrocities and even partook in them? What about the people in all the countries that have been invaded by the same nations now condemning Russia, what do they think when they look at this outrage over something that happened to them for decades without repercussions? 

Also why has this garnered such a massive response in the West even before the escalation, everyone was going mad and disgusted from the very start even though for a military conflict it was extremely tame the first few days. I really can't think of a reason this is seen so much worse than other events that actually had much worse tragedy other than Ukraine is white. It's the first time an invasion was brought to a white nation in the 21st century and I think that's what has really got people frazzled. They didn't get that bothered when multiple impoverished non-white countries were plunged into wars because it's not a ""civilized"" country, it can't happen to me here in Europe, America, etc, so I'm not super concerned. But this has erased that facade that a war at home is only for less developed nations and that's what got the Western world so worked up, not because this is particularly abhorrent but because it popped their security bubble.",False,1646309559.0,t3_t5nch9,t3_t5nch9,,0,-40,0,-40,0,0,

 >Martial law in Russia (Russian: Военное положение в России) is defined in the Russian law as a special legal regime that is introduced in conditions of external aggression or its threat. In this way, it differs from the state of emergency, which is introduced in the event of an internal threat such as an attempted coup, unrest or disaster. Martial law should also be distinguished from the State of War- a term that refers to the period between the outbreak of hostilities and their end. The procedure for introducing and abolishing martial law in Russia is defined in the federal constitutional law “On Martial Law” (2002).

Financial measures need to be more robust. Crypto and gold needs to be dealt with. Any country offering an out eg Russia is still able to sell India and China needs to be dealt with as well. Be more robust vs propaganda and weed out agent provocateurs within their borders. Finally understand China and Russia are not your friends. Get your manufacturing out. Stop relying on them for anything. What's the point of imposing sanctions when you're still buying oil at the same time from them? Minimise trade so they're not using your money to fight you.",1646299905.0,1646299575.0,t3_t5nch9,t1_hz5v4yk,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Us Indians support Ukraine and understand that Russia is at fault here(ofc there are some people with other opinions but this is the general consensus). But we also understand our government's decision of staying neutral. 

The indian government and the Indian people by extention don't believe in the US promises. We have seen it happen in Afghanistan, Pakistan and now in Ukraine. The West doesn't really give a fuck about what we're doing unless they need us. Apart from the history, India, currently has two rivals: Pakistan and China(both of which are Nuclear states). We share a very long border with both of them. And not siding with the west is the only thing that is preventing a full scale war. I'm not saying that India cannot defend itself but war in general is bad. 

Its not about the current situation that's going on in eastern Europe but a general descision about our own safety. And it's really not the first time India is staying neutral. India follows a very strict rule of neutrality. We have economic and diplomatic relations with the West as well as the East (BRICS and QUAD). India simply cannot afford to loose either of them. 

In conclusion, even though the Indian people in general support Ukraine, the government's stance has to be neutral for our own well being.",1646304344.0,1646301286.0,t3_t5nch9,t1_hz5xddu,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The winter in Europe has been very mild (thanks, climate change!), so gas reserves are actually pretty good as we reach the end of winter. That means that Europe will do fine until next winter most likely. And by then, fallback options from alternative gas suppliers will have been arranged. They may be more expensive, but that's more manageable than people not having heating. Also, I'd imagine that we'll fill our gas storage to the brink over summer and accelerate the already ongoing phasing out of gas.

So Europe will be fine.

For Russia, gas is one of their main export products and with all the sanctions in place right now, a lifeline for their economy. This lifeline is already being threatened by the shift towards renewable energy sources, but for the time being it remains a significant source of revenue.

Some think this number indicates deaths + injuries, because in military speak casualties can mean both, is my understanding.

Some think that since Russia keeps throwing their young conscripts as just pieces of meat against Ukraine, and some POWs have claimed that even their commanders are running away or not giving instructions (some have even said that instead of treating injuries, their own leaders rather kill them - it sounds a bit farfetched if I’m honest), so if these are young men who have little to no training, no instructions etc. there could really be high numbers of dead. Not 9000 high, but still high. WSJ published an article about the very high numbers of injured being brought to Belarus and Russian border areas , so much so that civilians cannot access multiple hospitals anymore at all - they’re only for soldiers.

Last and not least - Russia admitted 500 dead. In reality, this number will be much higher - perhaps 4-5x higher. Russia always lies about thi, always. It rather saves its hide than admits to being wrong. Google how they solved the sinking of Kursk submarine - it was horrible.

Here's the problem. This diatribe is your identity. The beliefs you comment here are your identity. Humans are capable of opposing this and focussing on other aspects of politics that form part of who they are a person. That isn't wrong, or dangerous or vulnerable. Politics is driven by the passions people feel deep within themselves. If that is a burning desire to see gender equality, or to promote aspects of human culture they feel have been abandoned, that is their fight. Not everyone was born to shoot a gun, regardless of who else inhabits the world. 

What you're doing is telling people to abandon *a form of identity politics you disagree with*. You want people to stop playing the game their way and start playing it your way because you're better at playing it your way and you know you can beat them your way. 

This war, this brand of politics has nothing to do with 'identity politics' in the sense of the weird right wing conspiracy theories surrounding gender, equality and liberty. Nationalism is identity. Invasion of another country for the spurious reasons Russia has done so is identity. Picking up a gun and fighting for the patch of dirt you were born on, or the rules and borders that make up that land *is identity*.

Every decision you make relates to your identity as a human. People can no more abandon that than they can stop breathing or eating.

Precision strikes on comms and military targets can actually be easier to do than on civillian hardware. Ill give a few examples

Radar seeking bombs. Radars are important in managing modern guided weapons, thus Anti-air positions will likely be equipped with at least some form of radar. Radar seeking bombs can attack and hit these easily

Thermal. While a bunch of vehicles and military personnel can give off heat signatures that a plane could target, a single air raid siren doesn't really

Not only that but air raid sirens are much easier to hide around a city, and not easy to note their location when doing reconnaissance, versus say a gigantic radio tower. Not only that it serves little tactical purpose, the air raid sirens don't do much to protect strategic positions, but mostly serve to help civilians get to cover, something that affects Russian goals minimally if at all.

edit: Id also like to play devils advocate and argue that Russians are not shelling cities for shits and giggles. Trust me, if you saw the full ability of a country to use even outdated artillery on a city, it would look 1000x times worse than the shelling that has occurred.

 >KyivNotKiev is an online campaign started by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) together with the 15 member centre for strategic communications ""StratCom Ukraine"" on 2 October 2018. Its goal is to persuade English-language media and organisations to exclusively use Kyiv (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of Kiev (derived from the Russian language name Киев) as the name of the Ukrainian capital. It is a part of the wider campaign ""CorrectUA"".

And as sad as it is most of the countries you named have been perceived in Europe as failed states for a long time. With bad rulers, extreme corruption and nepotism, too many islamists, big inequality between men and women and other stuff people in Europe don't tend to approve of. Now while Ukraine was far from perfect, it seems to go in the right direction and people had hope for it. So it feels to many as a bigger loss when it comes to what is going on there now while people have often grown up with hearing one sad story after another about countries in the Middle East. 

When it comes to innocent people suffering there people in Europe have become desensitized. It is fair? No. But I think a common perception is that it is far away and we can't really help them either way, that those countries have been having problems for decades and if we would get involved, it wouldn't work out. I mean some of them tried in recent years with Afghanistan, only to see the Taliban get into power in a one day coup with no real resistance of the population which made them look like they approve of Taliban rule.

The truth is that most countries don’t care enough if children are dying as long as there’s no threat that their children will die.

I get it, but everything you listed there 1) has been protested, and 2) is more complicated than this invasion.    

Iraq/Iran sanctions: Pro-sanctions is pro sanctions, no inconsistency there.     
Afghan/Iraq wars: (Originally) seen as legit fighting back in Iraq and Afghanistan - *extra bullshit with respect to Iraq*, I know, and I hate it, but well sold at the time. Also widely protested in 2003, when many redditors (who are upset now) were still in primary school and not reasonably able to protest.    
(Side note: I'd like to think that the futility of the Afghan & Iraq invasions helped wake people up and make us more anti-war.  We should've been before, but now there's experience to back up antiwar arguments.)             
Syria - monstrous but internal, so protesting or even knowing how to ""help"" is complicated because several moving pieces.     
Israel/Palestine - many thoughts here, but bottom line messy & complicated at best. AIPAC in the US alone, along with decent people (not so up on current events) who want to support Israel because Holocaust, make people extra hesitant to call out Israel even when they're clearly wrong.  More about guilt (or money) than race.  


Echoed in conflicts in Ethiopia/Eritrea, South Sudan, etc.  Less well known/understood to the Western world.  And, frankly, fewer resources there, whatever color people are.

And none of those have been on the EU/NATO radar for trying to join, unlike now. Helps explain the European response. Directly affects all EU countries, and now NATO. 

Saudis in Yemen: truly despicable, and really the best point here.  Saudi has been low-key getting away with murder for decades, because oil. Way more oil and petro-influence than Russia. So it sucks, I HATE it, but more about resources then color.

> children dying through political meddling, invasions, arms sales, militia training, poverty inducing sanctions, etc.

All travesties, and none of them as clear-cut as *one country invading another sovereign country,* across a shared border, for basically no reason other than ""I want it and feel insecure right now.""      Closest is US in Iraq, and like I said... that was well protested, and the pro-war ""rationale""/propaganda was more widely swallowed in the wake of 9/11.  Unfortunately.  Hopefully we all learned from that, regardless of color.   

Also worth mentioning that some of the ""political meddling"" was in freaking Ukraine.  See: Manafort.  US is somewhat complicit in this because of Trump & his fixers' actions, and that angers many of us too.

TL;DR I get it, there're inconsistencies in the world's response, but ""because Ukraine is white"" is way too simplistic.",False,1646312018.0,t3_t5nch9,t1_hz69hje,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

However, China will soon leap-frog Canada if they haven't already, as they are developing nuclear powered icebreakers, which only Russia has so far (see below for cool chart of all icebreakers as of 2017, and some good articles to start with if arctic geopolitics is your bag).

Russian hopes for the arctic could be over-hyped, but who knows. It'll be a while before countries wean themselves off the demand for foreign oil and gas.

 >KyivNotKiev is an online campaign started by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) together with the 15 member centre for strategic communications ""StratCom Ukraine"" on 2 October 2018. Its goal is to persuade English-language media and organisations to exclusively use Kyiv (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of Kiev (derived from the Russian language name Киев) as the name of the Ukrainian capital. It is a part of the wider campaign ""CorrectUA"".

Since 2012, Russia maintains a centralized internet blacklist (known as the ""single register"") maintained by the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor). The list is used for the censorship of individual URLs, domain names, and IP addresses. It was originally introduced to block sites that contain materials advocating drug abuse and drug production, descriptions of suicide methods, and containing child pornography.

There actually were sanctions. The capitalist countries successfully isolated the USSR out of fear that communism would spread (and logically threaten our power structures). 


That is one reason that the USSR embraced “global revolution” at one point and actively supported similar uprisings; it is harder to isolate when you can form economic pacts with like-minded governments. 


Soviet citizens were generally not permitted to travel or purchase abroad outside of special circumstances. It took significant approval starting with one’s local government in order to travel outside of the USSR—sometimes even within it.

 >During the ongoing war in Donbas between the Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatist insurgents in the Donbas region of Ukraine that began in April 2014, many international organisations and states noted a deteriorating humanitarian situation in the conflict zone. A May 2014 report by the United Nations said there had been an ""alarming deterioration"" in human rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).

 >The Highway of Death (Arabic: طريق الموت ṭarīq al-mawt) is a six-lane highway between Kuwait and Iraq, officially known as Highway 80. It runs from Kuwait City to the border town of Safwan in Iraq and then on to the Iraqi city of Basra. The road was used by Iraqi armored divisions for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It was repaired after the Gulf War and used by U.S. and British forces in the initial stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

It seems that Ukraine has been extraordinarily careful in this conflict, the way a western power would be, in terms of precision, defensive narrative, and not giving any fuel to enemy propaganda. That being said, Russia is currently using its own aggression and nuclear chest-beating as a deterrent to anyone else to intervene; meanwhile, Ukraine holds no deterrent against Russian aggression. Theoretically there are things Ukraine could do, or threaten to do, to make this more costly to Putin personally.

If nothing else, hold some missiles in reserve so that before you turn the lights out in Kyiv, that palace is destroyed.

Putin said in 2018 that the world doesn't need to exist without Russia, and he's the leader of Russia. Meaning, without him, the world can burn. There is no counter in dialogue to an attitude like that, but knowing there would be a last second strike from a lesser force could make a meaningful difference.

There is a strong capitalist lobby in Russia, which initially did not want a war because they are losing money on it. There is a military lobby - they want war, because they earn money on it. One of them won a week ago. 

There are also capitalists in Ukraine (they are the majority and they are still winning) who can put pressure on the government to be more accommodating in negotiations in exchange for money to restore the economy and cities. And there are those in Ukraine who professionally earn money in the war: they sell weapons, launder the loot from humanitarian aid, hire mercenaries, well, stuff like that. In every counrtry with strong military past you'll see guys like them.

  
Militarists (on both sides) do not need an end to the war fast: they need an unconditional victory, the surrender of the enemy, increased fear of a military threat (and, accordingly, an increase in funding for their projects in future.

  
Formal state diplomats will agree exactly at the moment when the billionaires inside these lobbies agree or financial lobby unites and win over the military one. 

For the onset of peace as soon as possible, it is very necessary that it is precisely the capitalists who come to an agreement, that they act together against the military.

 But the guys who think only about finances are arranged in such a way that they do nothing for anyone for free: it was obvious that some capitalists would pay others conditional repatriations (in compensation for the weakening of Ukrainian businesses and the destruction of infrastructure). 

This is not official repatriations, this is private money that is comparable in size to some state money and will be used to restore the country from ruins, and this is normal and fair.  
Just in case, I will stipulate that the ordinary people of both countries have nothing to do with these processes.

""The system is designed to counter short-range rockets and 155 mm artillery shells with a range of up to 70 kilometers. According to its manufacturer, Iron Dome will operate day and night, under adverse weather conditions, and can respond to multiple threats simultaneously.[1]

Iron Dome has three central components:[1][24]

Detection & Tracking Radar: the radar system is built by Elta, an Israeli defense company and subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries, and by the IDF.

Battle Management & Weapon Control (BMC): the control center is built for Rafael by mPrest Systems, an Israeli software company.


An example of an interceptor missile used by Iron Dome.

Missile Firing Unit: the unit launches the Tamir interceptor missile, equipped with electro-optic sensors and several steering fins for high maneuverability. The missile is built by Rafael.[26] A typical Iron Dome battery has 3–4 launchers (20 missiles per launcher).[27]

The system's radar is referred to as EL/M-2084. It detects the rocket's launch and tracks its trajectory. The BMC calculates the impact point according to the reported data, and uses this information to determine whether the target constitutes a threat to a designated area. Only when that threat is determined, is an interceptor missile fired to destroy the incoming rocket before it reaches the predicted impact area""",False,1646303918.0,t3_t5nch9,t1_hz6125a,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Estimates of the number of deaths attributable to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin vary widely. The scholarly consensus affirms that archival materials declassified in 1991 contain irrefutable data far superior to sources used prior to 1991 such as statements from emigres and other informants, whereas a minority of authors and journalists maintain that ""statistics can never fully describe what happened"". Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the archival revelations, some historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher.

If your objective was to partially destroy an unarmored vehicle (a car, a truck, etc.) or to kill troops riding on the outside of an armored vehicle, the Stinger might be effective. Even using it to ignite either an arms cache or a fuel storage dump might be possible as its charge is large enough for its detonation to create sympathetic explosions.

 >A Venn diagram is a widely used diagram style that shows the logical relation between sets, popularized by John Venn in the 1880s. The diagrams are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses simple closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets. Very often, these curves are circles or ellipses.
