Day 251 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was one missile strike in the evening, at about 8:10pm. They fired 2-3 missiles, at least one of which blew up over Belgorod as usual, and one of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, it wasn’t too far from us, as we could hear it from Kharkiv, even if it was pretty quiet. At the same time it wasn’t as quiet in Belgorod, because they had more explosions happen there a second time, at about 9:30pm, though nobody knows what they were caused by.

During the day we also heard some distant explosions coming from the direction of Belgorod. People were saying that large scale artillery duels were happening closer to the border with Russia, and that more of our towns/settlements were getting destroyed by them. Though what we have been hearing throughout the day could have also been our military conducting exercises (which they do very often) and not the aforementioned artillery duels.
  
That Russian statement about grain deal where they want us to guarantee the safety of their black sea fleet for them to uphold their end of the deal is just hysterical. You just can’t make this shit up, they are seriously asking their enemies to guarantee the safety of their military assets, which they use to destroy our cities and kill our people. It reads like satire, but it isn’t, how is this even real? It’s so funny that the “second strongest military in the world” is asking us, their enemies, to protect their warships; because they can’t even protect their fleet against a country that they thought they would steamroll in 3 days.

At some point he'll be forced to stop for practical reasons but what happens then? Russian army go back home and Putin can declare victory anyway. Why? he destroyed a good part of Ukraine so he can sell the idea that the ""Ukraine threat"" has been defeated. 

But the moment he retreat his army fro Ukraine, what NATO can do to punish him? 

Keep sanctions on at full force. I suspect tho that it would be harder to convince people to maintain this stance if the war ends and russia stop attacking for good.

The problem remains if Putin and his inner circle remains in power after the crimes they committed. Only thing is ""helping"" russian people to finish the job but even this solution could be dangerous from a diplomatic standpoint.

Generally news from the Ukraine side feels accurate, and this is no different - being honest about devastating strikes. But they've really stated it in a doom and gloom almost helpless way a bit more than feels right - to be expected asking for more assistance but what if they're really amping it up, in order to secure a flood of more modern AA. Even better, their partners are all on board and it's a group effort to maximize value from a terrible time. 

Nobody is denying there are missile attacks, and any that get through are certainly effective, but it almost feels like we're being led to the solution of more AA - from mocking russian accuracy to suddenly russian missiles have pinpoint accuracy and ideal targeting? It just feels a bit like it was decided to let russia feel a bit more competent to justify a stronger response.

The simplest answer is probably true, that it just is what it is and we're all dealing with the situation in front of us, but if the west wanted to truly pull the trigger on comprehensive AA maybe they are leveraging this just a bit to enable that. Even the iran ballistic news is really being pumped - which seems brilliant because either they back the fuck down or they essentially force the green light on the best AA and maybe even 3rd party ballistic missiles.

Or poots is just a supreme dumbfuck and is essentially forcing a legit no-fly zone over Ukraine (for russians at least) because he's just too simple to see beyond terror as an effective strategy. Simplest answer and all...",False,1667316356.0,t3_yiy5lo,t3_yiy5lo,,0,-10,0,-10,0,0,

Russia was heavily affected by sanctions and as such can no longer get the parts; mainly chips to build new ""morden"" missiles. Many of these were designed to be multi purpose to save money. So can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. Its estimated they maybe have ~600 in total of these left. Which they can build but as stated can't get the chips for 

So in desperation they have started using USSR tech. Mainly old ""dumb"" missiles that can't aim for shit ( large number of hits off target/shot down by Ukraine). They had about ~10,000 of these just building dust. So the strategy is basically overwhelming Ukranian anti-missile systems. Even at 50% accuracy that is 5000 hits on Ukriane. It's bad because they are essentially shooting blind but they generate fear and once again they have ~10,000 of them that were just rotting away 

In a similar vain they have gotten drones from Iran that are basically cruise missiles. They reportedly have 2,400 of these and maybe can get several thousand more. These cost around ~$20,000 each so in terms of military equipment are dirt cheap. As it would cost millions to build modern cruise missiles. However once again these drones are dumb and can't hit moving targets. So they are easily shot down and arn't useful for actual combat situations 

So its costing Russia nothing for the USSR old stock missiles and $20,000 for Iranian drone hits 

This is both good and bad for Ukraine as when they run out that may be it for thses types of attacks. As with new sanctions on Iran and tighter controls they may not be able to supply Russia. With Russia itself unable to build new missiles 

However this means that Russia will use them indiscriminately ( 100 to 150 a day for up to 3 months). Which is what we are seeing now. As stated even if Ukraine hit 80% of these out the sky that's still thousands of hits. 

I hope this explains why we keep seeing head lines of ""Russia can't build missiles "", ""Ukraine shoots down 44 missiles"", ""Kiev hit, no power or water""",False,1667277240.0,t3_yiy5lo,t1_iul5s0n,,1,34,0,34,0,0,

These missiles are extremely precise and, by the time being, Russia's anti air defenses can't effectively intercept the GMLRS missiles (the ones supplied to Ukraine) and probably won't be effective against ATACAMs either. The problem for Russia is the range and no countermeasures. 300km of range could hit well deep into Russian territory. Not Moscow, but not far from it either. Crimea would definetely be a real target for these missiles. Either air bases (that have already been attacked) or the back sea fleet itself. The ATACAMs also has a way, way bigger warhead than the current GMLRS. I mean, they carry the same warhead as the Harpoon antiship missiles. It's a big BOOM.

The Iran thing is that they will supply ballistic missiles to Russia. Russia has used them greatly, depleating all their stock. For example the Iskander missiles used in the first months of the war. These missiles are usually long range and harder to intercept than the cruise missiles because they usually fly faster. Russia is currently using cruise missiles (KH101, Oniks, Kalibr, etc) because their ballistic missiles stock is depleted. That's why Ukrainian anti air defense is very effective taking down most of these missiles.

HIMARS has been extremely effective at decimating russian artillery so far in the war... But now the iranian Shahed drones and russian cruise missiles have entered the chat.

The Shahed drones have a range of 2,500 kms. Russia is launching them far closer than that but still too far away for HIMARS to hit the places they're being launched from.

Many people want the US to provide ATACAMS to Ukraine so they can hit the launching sites.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the mere threat of using nukes is a well-known tactic by the Russian government to both scare off any potential opposition *and* to coerce any potential negotiators into granting concessions for Russia in exchange for a peaceful resolution; Russia gains nothing by actually *using* those nukes except their own demise, and I think Putin's sense of self-preservation would prevent him from going down that road.

One of the problems Ukraine has is that the majority of their air defenses are Soviet era derivatives, which were designed to track faster moving targets like jets and proper cruise missiles. As such, they actually have trouble maintaining a lock on slow moving targets because the tracks move slowly enough to get filtered out by the part you'd call the ""clutter reduction software"" in modern systems.",False,1667288569.0,t3_yiy5lo,t1_iul8enz,,2,5,0,5,0,0,
72c4f3aad138228acb64b27ed14e9b1b,yiy5lo,iulmwcm,"They had thousands of Kh-55s (they got 561 from Ukraine itself). They were modernizing them or reusing their INS parts, warhead and engine to make newer version. Kh-55/Kh-101 family is not using any modern or western manufactured chips. Previously components for them were made in Ukraine, however later on production was moved completely to Russia. They were making 240 engines for Kh-101 per year, so it's safe to assume that was the production rate. Sanctions didn't have any impact on production of Kh-101 as it's main components are INS that is shared between Kh-55s family and some fighter planes, TERCOM module that uses technology from 1980s and the main logic board, which is so advanced it's using 741s and EPROMS that make ZX Spectrum look modern in comparison. The only relatively modern thing in that missile is GLONASS receiver (which looks like it's only 20 years old). All those components are made in RF. I don't think any western fab would agree to make them, maybe as an museum sample.

After this long setup let's answer the question about how good Kh-55s are. Short answer is - they are crap. Long answer follows. In the first massive missile strikes (using two full regiments of strategic bombers) they had launch capability of around 200 missiles. Targets? Stationary targets. Buildings. You can easily distinct between Kh-101 and Kh-55 (555). They have different shape and they have different engine sound, so you can take a look at the strike site and determine what hit it. You can also determine which direction they were flying from based on videos. So. From the first massive strike from Caspian sea region roughly half missed the Ukraine. Kh-55 needs to be launched from the specific point in space so when it reaches the coordinates (or it thinks it's there) it compares the terrain signal with what's stored in it's memory (no, no imaging, it measures the contour changes). If it's able to confirm the path - it continues the mission. If not - it can circle, fly straight or self destruct. Or just fly to the next waypoint. Well. The first wave failed miserably (path programming error? tech issue? no idea). What we know is that a little over half of them crossed Ukrainian border. Even those that were able to find the right track had later issues - from that wave I was able to confirm 5 (five) missiles that were able to reach target area. That's about 5%. Maybe more were able to reach targets, but from that day we know about 18 target hits in total. When we remove ones destroyed by S-300, Tornado, German, Kalibr and Kh-101 that leaves 5 struck by Kh-55s (or 555s). They launched them only one more time. Since then only Kh-101s are reported with occasionally Kh-555s. 

The only Russian cruise missile that I can think of that could be using some western tech is Kalibr. Again - Kalibr is a system, with multiple types of missiles. The older ones definitely are not using western tech (there was one that crashed without exploding in Kiev at the beginning of the war - photos if the insides were published. It looked similar to Kh-101, with some distinctive differences. But had the same 60s upgraded to 90s feeling.

Russians are massively using western tech in communication and UAVs. They were using it to make a thermal imaging camera for thermal sights for tanks and BMPs and in command and control modules.",False,1667289289.0,t3_yiy5lo,t1_iul8enz,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

To be fair, the nature of sanctions has changed since the Magnitsky Act.

Regimes in the past had always doubled down and limped along was because they generally withdrew inside their own borders, and kept their inner circles happy and fat while their people were impoverished.

Putin struggles to do that precisely because his 'carrot' to the oligarchs et al. was 'Get rich here, live to spend it in Europe.' They don't want to stay in Russia; they want to enjoy their wealth in the privilege of the civilised world. They don't want to live in the squalor of Russia.

A ""trial balloon"" is when an entity leaks a story to the press in order to see how people respond. Usually the subject of the story is a minor/secondary occurrence that is related to a bigger occurrence. It's common for politicians to do trial balloons before running for office, they'll have an acquaintance tell reporters that they're being recruited by a party for office. If the public responds favorably then they keep going. If they respond negatively they either do more PR work or drop the idea.


In this case the US DOD had an official tell reporters that American personnel were traveling through Ukraine keeping tabs on the weapons. That's a real story and a part of the distribution of aid, not a trial balloon.

This might be quite costly, however, to achieve in order to be convincing, depending on how sophisticated the system they try to fool is.

Some parameters of the radar are the frequencies it emits in, and the pulses themselves: How often, how wide, how intense...Then you would have another things like the way the pulses disperse depending on the antenna, and how it changes all the former.

So you might have an anti-radiation missile made simple enough to go for the strongest source of a given set of frequencies, or have it be sophisticated enough that you need to represent many other parameters to fool it into targeting something.

The normal school that a U.S. soldier needs to become qualified to be an Abrams mechanic is 4 months.  And that doesn't make you a good mechanic.  That's entry level.  Becoming a good Abrams mechanic gets learned over the course of years while you're in your unit, from NCO's that have been doing the job for years.  Ukraine doesn't have NCO's that have been doing the job for years that could teach entry-level mechanics how to do the job after their 4 months of training.

So they have the issue that they can't give many tanks without harming their own operational readiness.

Which, as you point out, does not look very good and there's a bit of a reckoning within NATO over this.

Giving Ukraine 20-40 tanks could be a potentially serious boon in a particular theater, giving them 5 would not, while causing a lot of headaches in terms of logistical problems. Not because of training, but simply because you have an entire logistical train that would exist to keep JUST those five tanks in supply. You'd likely get more utility out of using that transport space for parts more common to systems they already have in service.

Part of why modern tanks are as effective as they are is because they operate alongside other tanks of similar capabilities. Think of it like a Phalanx in ancient times. Five ""modern"" soldiers alongside fifteen random people will be much less effective on an individual basis than if you had twenty soldiers of the same caliber, simply because the trained soldiers would have to operate within the limits of the rando's so as not to expose their own flanks.

A tortured analogy, I admit, but the thrust I'm getting at is that 5 NATO tanks supported by 15 Soviet era tanks are going to have to operate in a restrained manner, limiting their effectiveness. To do otherwise is to either put themselves in a position without support, or to drag their support into a position they aren't capable of surviving in.",False,1667289487.0,t3_yiy5lo,t1_iulm8yy,,4,5,0,5,0,0,

UN is quicker and simpler, a public forum where everybody sees how everybody else stands on an issue is exactly what it's made for.

No? Many states seem to want us to intervene. All we ask is for them to do that publicly again, like they did in UNSC res 1244 from 1999.
