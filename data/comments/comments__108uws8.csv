[Gerasimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Gerasimov) is officially back in charge. While thought to be largely responsible for Russia's catastrophic losses early in the war, he is not an idiot himself. His Ukrainian counterpart Zaluzhny [described him in an interview](https://time.com/6216213/ukraine-military-valeriy-zaluzhny/): ""I learned from Gerasimov. I read everything he ever wrote … He is the smartest of men, and my expectations of him were enormous."" 

Gerasimov is a battlefield tactician. When Russians say he was appointed to ""expand the scale of the tasks to be solved"" and will be ""raising the level of management of the special operation"", we should listen.

[Surovkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Surovikin), the previous commander, now becomes Gerasimov's deputy. He's a far less capable thinker. The same Zaluzhny had a [very different assessment](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/12/15/7380870/): ""With all due respect to Mr. Surovikin, if you look at him, he is an ordinary commander from the time of Peter I, a simple murdering thug. You look at him and understand that you either do as you're told or you're dead.""

Surovkin is the guy that decided to start attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure and gave up Kherson. He will likely continue to oversee some ground operations, and his downwards move is likely to prevent him from becoming too powerful, famous, or too close to Putin. 

The second new deputy [Oleg Salyukov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Salyukov) is a lesser known general. He's been the nominal Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces since 2014, but of course the position is very different from that of a NATO Commander-in-Chief. That position is mostly administrative and deals with supplies and logistics. His career path is all along those lines: becoming first a supply officer, then the overall commander, of increasingly larger units, regiment - division - military district - all of Russia.

The last new deputy Alexey Kim is so little-known he doesn't even have an English language wikipedia article. The Colonel General was previously the commander of the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and his entire previous career was dealing with personnel training.

This gives us the new three-headed hydra that is clearly geared towards mass mobilization and operations across multiple fronts. Gerasimov is the brain, Surovkin is the brutal enforcer, Kim is the guy that prepares fresh meat, and Salyukov ensures everyone hurries up and waits precisely on schedule.",False,1673461513.0,t3_108uws8,t3_108uws8,,0,90,0,90,0,0,

>  
>Fighting is raging in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region as both sides battle for Soledar, a salt mining town just three miles from Bakhmut.  
>  
>Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, said late Tuesday in a statement on Telegram that his units had seized control of the city. The channel, which is affiliated with Prigozhin’s press service, also posted a photo it said showed Wagner units inside Soledar’s salt mine tunnels, although the image could not be independently verified.  
>  
>Earlier Tuesday, Britain’s Defense Ministry said that Russian forces and Wagner fighters were “likely in control of most of the settlement.”  
>  
>“This is what madness looks like,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said of Soledar in his nightly address Monday. “Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left.""  
>  
>Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.  
>  
>*Key developments*  
>  
>\* **The Kyiv-appointed governor in Donetsk described the Russian attacks on Soledar and Bakhmut as relentless**, the Associated Press reported. “The Russian army is reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble using all kinds of weapons in their scorched-earth tactics,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. “Russia is waging a war without rules, resulting in civilian deaths and suffering.”  
>  
>\* **The Pentagon will bring Ukrainian troops to the United States for training, possibly as early as this month**, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the development. The training will take place at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, a base that is home to the U.S. military’s basic Patriot missile defense training program. The move came after President Biden decided last month to approve the transfer of a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine.  
>  
>\* **Canada will purchase a surface-to-air missile system, or NASAMS, from the United States to donate to Ukraine**, the country’s Defense Minister said Tuesday. A NASAMS is a short to medium-range ground-based air defense system that “protects against drone, missile and aircraft attack, with a high success rate,” Canada’s Department of National Defense said in a statement.  
>  
>\* **Ukrainian authorities have indicted a leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for backing Russia’s invasion**, Ukraine’s intelligence service said in a statement on Telegram. The head of the Tulchyn Diocese of the church, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, distributed “propaganda leaflets” calling for changes to Ukraine’s borders and posted statements online in support of Russian forces, according to the SBU. Ukrainian law enforcement officers found “pro-Kremlin propaganda and literature” during a search of his residence and church buildings in the region of Vinnytsia, in western Ukraine, the statement said. The church official, who was not named in the post, faces up to eight years in prison.  
>  
>*Battleground updates*

>\* **A Russian vessel armed with hypersonic cruise weapons has carried out military exercises in the Norwegian Sea**, Russia’s Defense Ministry announced Tuesday. President Vladimir Putin sent the ship to the Atlantic last week. It is armed with Russia’s latest Zircon hypersonic missile, which Moscow claims can reach 7,000 mph and evade Western air defenses, according to the Associated Press.  
>  
>\* **Fifteen people, including a 2-year-old child, were injured in Russian shelling of the southern coastal city of Ochakiv**, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitaliy Kim said Tuesday. The attack was one of five to hit the town Monday, with another reported early Tuesday. The Washington Post has not been able to verify his account.  
>  
>\* **The secretary of Russia’s Security Council described the war in Ukraine as a fight against NATO**. “The events in Ukraine are not a clash between Moscow and Kyiv. This is a military confrontation between Russia and NATO, and above all the United States and Britain,” Nikolai Patrushev, a powerful Putin ally, told Russia’s Argumenti i Fakti newspaper in an interview published Monday.  
>  
>\* **Russia will keep advancing its nuclear weapon systems in 2023**, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday, Tass reported. “We will continue to develop the nuclear triad and maintain its combat readiness because the nuclear shield remains the main guarantee of our country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Shoigu said.  
>  
>*Global impact*  
>  
>\* **The European Union plans to extend sanctions to countries that support Russia’s war**, von der Leyen said Tuesday. She cited Belarus and Iran as examples. “We will keep the pressure on the Kremlin for as long as it takes, with a biting sanctions regime,” she said. Russia has positioned fighter jets in Belarus and begun a troop buildup there in recent months, sparking fears that Russian forces could invade Ukraine again from Belarus. The two countries are set to expand joint military exercises.  
>  
>\* **Putin “clearly failed” in his aim of taking Ukraine in a matter of days and causing dissent between NATO member**s, the bloc’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Tuesday. “We must clearly strengthen our support to Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said in a news conference alongside European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

> The capture of the centre and most of Soledar by Wagner units is certainly a tactical success. However, the enemy lines are NOT broken and neither the defending units nor the city have been encircled. The enemy is creating a new defensive line on the western outskirts, relying on the salt mines. The fighting for the city is not yet over - the western outskirts and suburbs will have to be stormed. The enemy command is definitely in control and although the retreat is accompanied by inevitable losses (including probably hundreds of garrison fighters ""forgotten"" in the buildings) - control is maintained and the enemy will not flee.

> As for Bakhmut, the situation there has not changed significantly so far, although reaching the city from the north will significantly worsen the prospects of further defence.

> The positions of the AFU near Siversk are also becoming vulnerable. But this location is of no particular value from any point of view and is inconvenient for a prolonged defence. In case of further advance of our forces to the north and north-west of Soledar, it will almost certainly be abandoned by the enemy without persistent defense. However, for that we still need to take the heights surrounding the town.

> As I have written and said more than once, even the fall of the entire Bakhmut-Soledar-Siversk fortified line will not lead to the collapse of the AFU front - in the rear they have the main fortification in the Donbas - the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk fortification. And it has yet to be reached.

> Whether our commanders intend to limit themselves to gradually squeezing the enemy from position to position in Donbas, or whether a new major offensive is being prepared somewhere - I do not know. So far, the fighting is following a scenario strategically advantageous to the United States - for them the longer Russia exhausts its forces in tactical and non-decisive battles in the Donbass, the better. The AFU has reserves; moreover, new ones are being actively created. Deliveries of a significant amount of modern military equipment by NATO countries have already been announced and will be completed by spring. There will be no ""freezing of the conflict"" (passionately desired by the Kremlin) - our dear American partners are happy for Russians to keep killing Russians for as long as possible.

>  
>**False narrative #1:** *The Revolution of Dignity was a coup d'etat and a prerequisite for ""civil war.""* The ""civil war"" rhetoric is frequently used by the Kremlin to rid Russia of any responsibility for persistently breaking international law in Ukraine since 2014. Placing blame on the Maidan movement for the occupation of Crimea and Donetsk and Luhansk regions is a purposeful deflection tactic aimed at redirecting attention away from Russia's years-long attempts at threatening Ukraine's sovereignty.  
>  
>**Fact:** *The Revolution of Dignity was a grassroots people's movement that began with a peaceful protest of students against the refusal of the pro-Russian government, represented by President Viktor Yanukovych, to continue with the promised Ukraine's European integration course.*  
>  
>**False narrative #2:** The *Revolution of Dignity results from Ukraine's ""external management"" by the EU, the USA, and the whole Western world.* While the Revolution of Dignity was underway, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused the USA and EU of creating a ""brown revolution,"" warning that Russia would use ""all of its influence"" to ""finally bring order to Ukraine."" Such claims seek to construct a harmful perception of Ukraine as a simple middle-man between Russia and the West and obscure the 400-year-long history of oppressive Russian-Ukrainian relations.  
>  
>**Fact:** *The Revolution of Dignity and the peaceful protests that preceded it were initiated exclusively by the Ukrainian civil society united by the goal of calling for their political desires to be appropriately represented by their elected political leaders.*  
>  
>**False narrative #3:** *The ""Heavenly Hundred"" killed by government security forces during the Revolution of Dignity is a made-up fact*. To obscure the human cost of the 2014 Revolution of Dignity and the willingness of its participants to stand up for their freedoms, some Russian and pro-Russian propagandists have taken to claiming that no deaths had occurred and the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred are made-up figures.  
>  
>**Fact:** *The ""Heavenly Hundred"" are real people with real stories whose families still mourn them. The Ukrainian civil society is seeking justice so that those complicit in the murders are punished.*  
>  
>**False narrative #4:** *The Revolution of Dignity caused the occupation of Crimea and led to the war in the east of Ukraine.* This narrative seeks to blame Ukrainian civil society and shift responsibility away from the aggressor. An example of such reports being voiced can be seen in pro-Russian politician Yevhen Muraiev's speech on his TV channel: ""There have been two revolutions: Orange Revolution and Revolution of Dignity, as a result of which we lost Crimea, and our country is now at war.""   
>  
>**Fact:** *The Ukrainian civil society is not to blame for Russian aggression then or now; Russia is.*  
>  
>**False narrative #5:** *The Revolution of Dignity shows how democracy leads to chaos and why freedom of speech and expression must be suppressed*. The alleged ""threat of Maidan"" has long been the universal bogeyman of Russian propaganda. Pro-Kremlin propaganda mouthpieces have compared the Jan. 6 USA Capitol attack to Ukraine's \[Revolution of Dignity\], purposefully obscuring the vast differences between the two events to enforce the image of Maidan as a lawless riot, not a peaceful protest expressing the will of the people.   
>  
>**Fact:** *Peaceful protests by Ukrainians are their inalienable right to defend their rights and freedoms.*  
>  
>**Remember, media literacy and fact-checking are essential tools in the fight against Russian disinformation! Russian propaganda is not just a set of narratives spread by Russian officials – it can be anywhere and promoted by anyone. Instead, it's an ideology that continuously seeks to divert global attention from Russia's crimes in Ukraine and to place the blame on anyone but Russia.**

1. This war won't end before russia's elite troops have been attrited to the ground along with the mobiks. russia will not surrender willingly but only through total defeat. 

2. Inflicting attrition is easier when defending as opposed to attacking.

3. russia was not using elite troops for offense in Bakhmut direction before Soledar.

Now that the obvious has been said, let's deduce the current situation.

1. Russia holding their elite troops from the battle for defending captured land is not good for Ukraine. Ukraine prefers russia to attack and be ground down instead of conserving their forces.

2. In Svatove-Kreminna direction it is Ukraine in the offense, which makes it harder to attrite the enemy. Especially when Kreminna is defended by elite troops from Kherson.

3. In Soledar direction attrition is easier, but still costly.  

Lastly, Ukraine has been taunting russia to attack sooner rather than later before the Spring. Once again russia took the bait. Soledar is of no strategic consequence. Meanwhile the elite troops must still be destroyed. In Soledar this can be done with the fewest losses. 

If the Soledar battle didn't take place, it would've taken place at some other time somewhere else. Possibly to the detriment of the UA army. Better get it over with now than later, in a setting more beneficial to Ukraine.",1673453169.0,1673452171.0,t3_108uws8,t3_108uws8,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

> Western—and some Ukrainian—officials, soldiers and analysts increasingly worry that Kyiv has allowed itself to be sucked into the battle for Bakhmut on Russian terms, losing the forces it needs for a planned spring offensive as it stubbornly clings to a town of limited strategic relevance. Some of them say that it would make sense to retreat to a new defensive line on the heights west of Bakhmut while such a pullback can still be organized in a coordinated fashion, preserving the Ukrainian military’s combat strength.

> “It’s not me, it’s King Leonidas who figured out that you should fight the enemy on the terrain that is advantageous to you,” said one Ukrainian commander in Bakhmut, referring to the ruler of Sparta who battled the Persian Empire at Thermopylae. “So far, the exchange rate of trading our lives for theirs favors the Russians. If this goes on like this, we could run out.”

Ukrainian casualties are also heavy, so some on the ground wish they had pulled back instead of being ordered to hold a nightmarish hellscape. That's of course perfectly understandable and not at all unexpected.

1. Partly intended to deter Russia from mobilisation. I.e. get in their first and escalate before Putin does perhaps giving him pause for thought about how this will end.
2. Regardless of whether this was the plan, could this actually deter mobilisation anyway?

I appreciate Putin is in deep, this will likely end his career, potentially his life, Russian society as we know it. However at some point Russia surely has to either back off or fall over. Perhaps this is one of the better and more likely windows for actually backing off. Putin does tend to pounce on weakness and waiver against united strength. Like the rhetoric on nuclear weapons, dithering over the response to the oil price cap. 

Or is further, expanded mobilisation 100 percent a done deal at this stage?

The fuckup was the deliberate bombing of civilian infrastructure, namely the power grid, in a repeat of Surovkin’s tactics in Syria.

Worse, it directly lead to Ukraine getting a ton of powerful weapons including a system Russia dreads having at its door, Patriot Systems. 

Surovkin is not that smart of a commander. He didn’t understand the difference between a civilian population rebelling against its own government and a country fighting a foreign invasion. In Syria, the rebels really only had civilian infrastructure to work with. In Ukraine, the enemy is a proper military so harming civilian infrastructure just strengthens Ukrainian resolve and makes Russia look bad.

If thousands upon thousands of poorly equipped Russians are decisively slaughtered by superior Ukrainian tactics, equipment, experience, and morale where the Russians wind up with nothing to show for it but a few small villages nobody outside of Ukraine has ever heard about? If that comes to pass, then heads will probably roll sooner than later in Russia. It would prove they have no more cards left to play and no hope for success. Who knows, an ill-conceived assault on Kyiv could result in such a disaster for Russia. But any kind of meager gain or just not getting booted from the country entirely might be enough for Putin to continue to claim great success and keep the war going for a long time.

Personally, I don't think any loss of life will sway Russian opinions on these matters. I think they will only stop once their military or economy hits a point of critical failure. Like, they can't run offensive operations anymore because they ran out of artillery shells and Ukraine did not. We don't know if critical failure points will happen though; however, things will look like normal until one day they will suddenly not be. 

The worst outcome is Russia loses but never hits any critical failure points and so the war drags on for years. It would only end at that point after economies and people have been ground down to a point of general failure. Geopolitically, this is a great outcome because it would leave Russia devastated for generations to come so they can no longer act as a global bully. Would be a nightmare for Ukraine though. Hopefully Western equipment, logistics, and support combined with Ukrainian bravery, courage, and tactics can induce a critical failure point in the Russian military soon.

Wagner isn't technically Russian army. Its a private military company. They're important for the Ukrainians to defeat in any case. But the most important tidbit is that Wagner is mostly full strength (at least, before this whole Bakhmut adventure they have had).

Defeating Wagner here, in Soledar... or at least destroying as many of their Tanks as possible, is the primary goal. Every Wagner tank blown up here is one fewer tank that they have next week, next month, next year.

I was tracking this early on and trying to get more accurate numbers but we just don't know.

What I can say:

- Ukraine's daily tallies are KIA, they are not total casualties (KIA+WIA). This gets *constantly* misrepresented.

- a few times early on, Russian media or mistakes leaked their actual KIA, each time it was remarkably close to Ukrainian estimates.

- the few times the Pentagon or allied intel released estimates they were on the conservative side of Ukraine numbers. Generally speaking allied intel will take claims from both sides and then run it through their intel in a formula-like fashion. Given how bullshit Russian numbers have been, that's why the numbers were likely conservative. Allies prefer to underestimate, rather than overestimate numbers.

- Ukraine has an incentive towards being truthful, modern, European. Whether that means their numbers are closer to real numbers, we don't know.

- Numbers get complicated and mixed up because it depends on soldiers, civilians and in the case of Russia; fake puppet states mobilised numbers. Are they included in various estimates, as IIRC Russia doesn't count them.

- Ukraine's 'high' dead days were reported at 50-100/day sometime around May. So baseline is probably around 30k on the high side. They haven't spoken about it since.

- Russia's 'high' days have been upwards of 800-900/day. Ukraine's estimates are around 110k KIA Russians atm.

Overall I gave up trying to be accurate by about May, but generally concluded Ukraine's numbers +/-20% for Russian KIA.

KIA-WIA is usually around 1:3, ish, depending on warfare and medicine. It would not surprise me if Russia was at 1:1.5 and Ukraine was more around the 1:3 or 1:5.

TLDR - Russia is losing far more KIA and WIA than Ukraine, has likely mobilised fewer people and struggles to equip them or save them.

The last thing we need is idolating the idiot. I'm obviously happy about the staunch Polish support, but I see this separate from the party (PiS is a fucking cancer for basic fucking human rights and democratic policies in the EU, alongside Orbán. There, I said it).

Yes, I would love it if the Germans provided tanks. The earlier the better. But you can't just ignore all the other things the Germans have delivered. Heck, they are even far less dependent on Russian gas than they were 10 months ago. They made big changes, a big fucking turn-around.

Edit:
Context being: A big part of Poland has been somewhat suffering from an identity-crisis since the end of WW2. Poland had often been the victim of partitions and foreign invasions. The conservative PiS party has been fanning the flames of this crisis. A lot of the rural and more conservative parts of Poland haven't really benefited much from EU membership or from the myriad of advancements brought by the 21th century, staying relatively poor compared to the western, more industrialised, parts of Poland as well as the cities. The correct Polish identity, according to PiS, is one that's catholic, embraces 'family-values', is against LGHTBQ, against abortion, (darker-skinned) migrants, etc. They picture themselves against imagined enemies of the state (gays, fascist German elites, anti-religious Western sentiments and a myriad of minorities). Even the Jewish community, which once thrived in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was a big part of the multi-ethnic make-up of the state, has suffered a lot from increasing antisemitism: They should be Poles first, Jews second. It's a bit of a Polish victim complex, really. This is not even the worst part, though, as the PiS party has also increasingly attacked the democratic institutions of Poland (fortunately being only partially succesful, in comparison to Hungary). All in name of so-called conservatism. The ironic thing is how this has truly divided Poland in an ex-Russian Empire, rural, conservative 'Poland B' and an ex-Prussian, industrialised, more progressive 'Poland A'.",1673474448.0,1673472889.0,t3_108uws8,t1_j3y35sh,,1,45,0,45,0,0,

UK plans to send tanks to Ukraine, Downing St says
Jim Pickard in London

Downing St has confirmed for the first time that the British government is planning to provide tanks to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against the Russian invasion.

A spokesperson for Number 10 told journalists that Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has asked defence secretary Ben Wallace to “work with partners” in the coming weeks to go “further and faster with our support for Ukraine including the provision of tanks”.

If a deal is done to supply Ukraine with the British Army’s Challenger 2 tanks, it would be the first time a western country has provided Ukraine with modern heavy battle tanks.

The move comes after Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the weekend he was “in negotiations aimed at creating a broader coalition of countries” to deliver western tanks to Kyiv.

“We are accelerating our support to Ukraine with the kind of next-generation military technology that will help to win this war,” the Downing St spokesperson said. “It is clear that battle tanks could provide a game-changing capability to the Ukrainians.”",False,1673456876.0,t3_108uws8,t1_j3ww7ux,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

How poor or good that training is will depend on time, resources and know-how of the people doing the training. We've seen reports of countless mishaps (people getting trained on tank operation and then getting sent in as infantry; not warm housing for boot camp even thousands of kilometers away from Ukraine), but most of those issues are likely individual oblast administration failures and inefficiencies.

I suspect that, in aggregate, the number of soldiers they are training and equipping will probably cause major problems with Ukraine this year.

Interestingly Afghanistan was one of the reasons so many intelligence agencies thought Ukraine would be quickly overwhelmed when Russia first attacked.

NATO spent years training the Afghan army just like they did after 2014 in Ukraine and we all saw how that turned out. And they had the same reports in Ukraine they had from Afghanistan, that their army was getting better, the training was slowly working and that they were a credible fighting force. No one is going to report that their training mission is pointless and they have made no progress so people questioned if reports on training from Ukraine were flattering to deceive as well. The difference was that the Ukranian army really was learning lessons from NATO and crucially soldiers viewed Ukraine as something they cared about and wanted to save as a nation, that didn't really exist in Afghanistan.

So the failure in Afghanistan did give people good reason to wonder at first how Ukraine would do. Ten months later of course it's obvious the parallels to Afghanistan are fairly irrelevant and now it's just a bad faith argument made by people that don't understand the situation or are just trying to spread Russian propaganda.

Even if Russia gets a million conscripts onto the front line, if Wagner / VDV / 1st Guards Tank Army are all dead by then, who the hell will organize the front lines and actually do shit on the battlefield?

A bunch of poorly equipped, poorly trained conscripts sitting around waiting to be blown up by M777 will slow down the Ukrainians, but not by much. If Russia runs out of trained soldiers / elites, the war is over. These Russian conscripts don't even have food and water, let alone the codes to call in for air support or drone strikes. The people who are actually threatening the Ukrainian army are the Wagner and VDV troops who know how to fight a war.

-----------

You're right in that 5 Russian conscripts are basically worthless on the frontlines, only serving as distractions vs the Ukrainian forces. But when we hear word that Ukraine has blown up 10 Wagner tanks on the front line? Those 10 tanks are from an increasingly diminishing stockpile of competent Russian soldiers. Russia will never get that back.

The difference between HIMARS / M777 and a Tank is that HIMARS / M777 are shooting blindly (IE: Someone else sees the target and have asked the HIMARS / M777 for artillery assistance). And even with supersonic (HIMARS) or hypersonic (M777) rounds, it can take over a minute before the shell lands.

In a complex modern environment, enemies may __move__, which is the easiest way to handle M777 / HIMARS. As long as they're moving, its much harder to hit. (M777 has BONUS rounds but those are expensive and rare).

In contrast, a Tank sees you, and shoots a shell right at you directly. One tank on the battlefield can kill more enemies, more accurately at the right time than even an entire battery of M777 guns. Yes, Artillery is amazingly accurate and powerful. But you can't get around the fundamental ""blind"" factor. They're just fundamentally shooting at targets they can't see, so their accuracy is far less than a tank.

----------

The problem of course, is that tanks are also in the line of fire. By deploying tanks to the front, we accept the fact that many tank operators will die. (In contrast, M777 and HIMARS are so far away from the front it'd be an error for them to be at risk).

So on the one hand, we know that 12 tanks on the front will be destroyed eventually. But the amount of firepower that they bring while deployed is far above what any M777 or HIMARS can do. Just because of that ""1 minute"" delay that it takes for a Mach5 M777 shell to reach its target over 20km... vs the ""instant"" that a tank fires. (Really, closer to 2-seconds at 3km or so, which is what these tanks can reliably snipe from).",False,1673455697.0,t3_108uws8,t1_j3wqz4m,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

I am by no means an admiral/general, just my .02 on the emphasis on elite troops.


Yes, trained troops are inherently more useful than conscripts. Cohesive, well-oiled units will almost always outperform a ragtag conglomeration. However, a large number of entrenched forces still provides a credible challenge. The VDV is supposedly about 45k personnel (edit in- pre war. Dunno their losses). If you put 300k mobiks (assuming more mobilization) in entrenchement vs 45k VDV, the mobiks would be harder to overcome simply due to more bodies and fingers to pull triggers.


Obviously there is some force multipliers. Armor, artillery, air, etc. A trained soldier without supply lines and bullets for his weapon is just as useless as a mobik. HIMARs is useful for that. Bradley's, and eventually tanks, are useful for direct troops in combat engagements (which, add interdiction RU supply lines and UKR infantry support vehicles and you get a good combination). Other aid given has been about softening Russian forces (anti armor, SEAD) to allow more freedom of movement. 


A lot of typing just to say I would not focus on any particularly named enemy force and pin them being ""elite"" as the singular crux. A bullet is lethal no matter how many years of training you have. Your gun can't fire without bullets, even with the best training in the world. 100 mobiks is a lot bigger of an obstacle than 10 trained troops. War isn't a video game where there are levels to be able to defeat an enemy, it's about finding the right application of force in the right spots in the right moments. Experience and training matter, but they are not the single fail point.

It is the Ukrainian will to fight and will to embrace Allied training.

And this is not so simple as just being their troops, it's cultural.

Afghanistan is highly tribal, familial and everything is rooted in that, the larger Afghanistan nationality is often secondary to their tribal or familial identity.

Ukrainians by contrast have a more modern (20th+ century) identity that is much more nationalistic and has been demonstrated for over 100 years at times. This is not to say they don't care about background or family but it changes the dynamics.

If you only care or prioritise the people of your tribe or town, you make different decisions to someone who cares much more about their whole country.

It doesn't automatically count for any battlefield or offensive. 

So, just because one side lost 2500+, does not automatically say much about losses on the other side. Although of course Ukrainians aren't immune supersoldiers, so you're right that assuming zero until we get a source is also quite useless.

What makes me consider that the numbers could be more tricky, or more ""exceptional"" and thus deviate from the average, is that already one month or so ago there was a serious concern from Russia that Kreminna would be imminently lost. And from my understanding, the way they stopped that gap was by pouring in untrained soldiers, wave after wave. just send them in trying to dig a trench, and once they die send in the next wave to continue digging. Not all that dissimilar to Bakhmut, but on the defensive rather than on the offensive.

And they *did* manage to hold the line with that effort. But part of me also wonders if the reason the offensive stalled is because Ukraine would be concerned about serious losses if they *did* push on. So them *still* not reaching Kreminna may be less of a ""russian strength"", and more of a Ukrainian carefulness. 

So while Russia pumped in sacrificial meat to build their defenisve lines, while Ukraine recognized that they had to slow down their offensive to avoid unecessary loss of life. Which together can plausibly lead to *very* lopsided losses. And, let's not forget, casualties and deaths are different numbers, and while casualties might be less lopsided, the lack of care for human lives again leads to more lopsided fatality numbers.

And yes, i fully realize that i'm explaining everything in a favorable way for UA, and that with the fog of war we will truly have a hard time figuring out how optimistic or pessimistic we should be.

M2 is flexible like that. If you just want a taxi, M2 can be a taxi. 3 trained + 6 untrained still is useful.

Deciding how many infantry to send into ""Mechanized infantry training"" is going to be a headache for some Ukraininan general somewhere.

 >The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (also known as the Treaty of Brest in Russia) was a separate peace treaty signed on 3 March 1918 between Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia's participation in World War I. The treaty was signed at German-controlled Brest-Litovsk (Polish: Brześć Litewski; since 1945, Brest, now in modern Belarus), after two months of negotiations. The treaty was agreed upon by the Russians to stop further invasion.

This is just as nonsensical as the idea Belarus would join the war. The only threat Belarus has in this war is their country being used as a staging base. Why in gods name would the west give Putin ammunition to continue his propaganda war that he’s secretly fighting NATO and not the Ukrainians by pointing to an unnecessary and nonsensical military building up on Belarus’s borders.

Your concern bears very little relevance in the battlefield with all due respect. Ukrainians are not concerned by manpower they are concerned by equipment.

In the south towards Melitpol and likely either to Donetsk City or more likely Kremmina (a further push into the city). 


It is to the advantage of Russians in your head. Russia has lost half of the territory it has captured since February. If they capture Soledar which is still disputed it would be the first win since the summer. And to contextualize that win, Soledar is a town with a prewar population of 10k.

The only alternative is spontaneous unrest, which requires a much larger percentage of the population to be outraged and willing to risk themselves, but on the other hand, it can come out of absolutely nowhere, even to the surprise of those who end up participating in it, and catch police enforcement off guard. Why spontaneous unrest is so successful is also because if it isn't shut down immediately with extreme force, it can easily explode quickly as people get emboldened by others acting. No one knows the numbers here in Russia, but there are definitely people here who would be ready to set fire to some police stations if they saw a bunch of others doing it too. 

So what's happening now I guess is that the magma chamber is slowly bubbling, building up pressure. How big is the chamber? How much magma? No one knows really, and some people argue it's a dead volcano and will never erupt, some say it might but really unlikely, but the volcanologists all agree on one thing: at the end of the day, only the volcano knows when it will erupt, and how violent it will be. 

I feel like Iran nearly ended up in this situation - they seemed to come very close to letting those spontaneous protests spiral out of control. In some ways, Russian police state is stronger because it is far larger, more technologically omnipresent in social media, and probably faster to react. However, I think that Iran is probably scarier because they're not afraid to do public executions, and their morality police are cultists on steroids - I think Iran has more ability to cause terror. Russian OMON may be intimidating, but suspect they would be less capable than Iran Revolutionary Guard in quickly fixing the crack in the dam. They are known for beating protestors with their clubs, but if Russia ever gets to the point where spontaneous unrest erupts, it only takes a small group of guys to take those batons off the omon and turn the weapon against them. Russia won't publicly execute people in the centre of Moscow. People will have a choice between dying in Ukraine or rotting in a jail for 15 years, or possibly fighting to upend the government.
