>In general, there will be no Ukrainian blitzkrieg. The statements of some experts such as “The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 30-40 minutes”, “Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in the event of a full-scale war”, “Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes” have no serious grounds.  
>  
>And finally, the most important thing. An armed conflict with Ukraine is currently fundamentally not in Russia's national interests. Therefore, it is best for some overexcited Russian experts to forget about their hatred fantasies. And in order to prevent further reputational losses, never remember again.

1. Xi has now witnessed the overwhelming global backlash to the invasion of a thriving democracy -- he knows that China would suffer immensely. The CCP is also much more afraid of economic ruin than Putin is. 

2. Invading Taiwan would be far more difficult than invading Ukraine. The Russians had easy access to multiple land routes, hell Belarus even gave them a highway straight to the capital. Taiwan would be on a completely different level of difficulty. It would require the largest amphibious invasion in history, and of an island fortress that's full of a military and population just as ready to resist.

3. The Russian army's ineptitude has highlighted how far behind other ""great power"" militaries are compared to the U.S armed forces. I'd bet that China's military has more modern equipment than the Russians, but they have almost zero experience with conducting large-scale combined arms operations.

We live in a globalized, civilized era now. 

If you were a soldier in Russia, what would your reaction be hearing that the military exercise you were on suddenly turned into an offensive war against Ukraine, a nation that shares so much of your culture, religion, history and even, to a degree, your language? Disbelief? Anger? Fear? How willing would you be to throw away your life for a cause that you don't really believe in? Russians are fearsome warriors when they need to protect their homeland, you can't deny that. All who were foolish enough to invade their country eventually perished. That same patriotism and passion now fuels Ukraine though. They are fighting themselves in a way.

Individual representatives of the Russian political class today claim that Russia is able to inflict a crushing defeat on Ukraine in a few hours (called shorter terms) if a military conflict begins. Let's see how much such statements correspond to reality.

The opinion in the expert community of Russia has recently taken root quite strongly that it will not even be necessary to introduce troops into the territory of Ukraine, as the Armed Forces of this country are in a deplorable state.

Some political scientists emphasize that almost all surveillance and communication systems, artillery and tank formations will be destroyed by a powerful fire strike of Russia. Moreover, a number of experts conclude that even one crushing blow to Russia will be enough for such a war to end.

As a cherry on the cake, individual analysts emphasize the fact that no one in Ukraine will defend the ""Kiev regime"".

THERE WILL BE NO EASY WALK

Let's start with the last one. To claim that no one in Ukraine will defend the regime means in practice complete ignorance of the military and political situation and moods of the broad masses in a neighboring state. Moreover, the degree of hatred (which is known to be the most effective fuel for the armed struggle) in the neighboring republic in relation to Moscow is frankly underestimated. No one will meet the Russian army with bread, salt and flowers in Ukraine.

It seems that the events in the south-east of Ukraine in 2014 did not teach anyone anything. Then they also expected that the entire left-bank Ukraine would turn to Novorossiya in a single impulse and in a matter of seconds. They have already drawn maps, estimated the staff of future administrations of cities and regions, developed state flags.

But even the Russian-speaking population of this part of Ukraine (including such cities as Kharkiv, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariupol) did not support such plans in its vast majority. The Novorossiya project somehow imperceptibly blew away and quietly died.

In short, the liberation campaign in 2022 according to the model and likeness of 1939 will not work. In this case, the words of the classic of Soviet literature Arkady Gaidar are more true than ever: ""You can see, we will have now not an easy fight, but a hard battle.""

""SMALL BLOOD, MIGHTY BLOW""

Now about the ""powerful fire strike of Russia"", which will allegedly destroy ""almost all surveillance and communication systems, artillery and tank formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"".

Only one expression shows that only political workers could say this. For reference: during hypothetical hostilities on the scale of the theater of operations, strikes at priority objects and massive fire strikes are carried out. Note that in the course of operational and strategic planning, epithets ""powerful"" (as well as ""medium"", ""weak"", etc.) are not used.",False,1646019604.0,t3_t35ouk,t3_t35ouk,,0,42,0,42,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

It seems like there are a very significant number of posts here hyping up nukes in various ways, from commenting on the existential terror people feel to “asking questions” about what nuclear damage might look like.

Remember that the Russian trolls who tried to convince the world to let Ukraine fall are still very active. Amping up nuclear existential dread is absolutely one of their goals, and as this is Putin’s last theoretical refuge when faced with a surprisingly united European and broader world, be wary. Unfortunately, this is also many people’s first brush with mortality, so there are plenty of people doing their work for them unwittingly.

Want to know how you live with the specter of death? By embracing what life gives you. Everything you experience in life has a temporal component; the good times and bad times are importantly both times. There is joy and pain to be found in every day, just as there was before Putin attempted to destroy another nation for his personal benefit. Embrace how sweet a lover’s hand is in yours, or the pride you feel at your child’s achievements. Live courageously; do not let a weak, hateful man rob your days of the happiness, pain, and strength that comes from overcoming challenges. Given that this will also rob him of his power is the cherry on top.

An abuser - especially a narcissist who has exulted in attacking our civil society for decades - needs you to give him permission to leave you in fear. I urge everyone here not to succumb to his need for you to let life become tainted by his  stain. If you think for a second this parallel doesn’t hold, consider this: keeping you paralyzed and fearful is his goal on a cultural and societal level. It allows him to win.

Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. The US condemned the order and said Putin was “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”.

The rouble is expect to plummet at least 25% amid panic when markets open on Monday, reflecting the unprecedented sanctions announced by the US and European Union over the weekend. The European Central Bank said on Monday morning that Sberbank Europe, a fully owned subsidiary of Sberbank Russia, which in turn is majority owned by the Russian state, is failing or likely to fail.

Belarus reportedly approved in a referendum a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the country has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. The move could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. The package of constitutional reforms also extended the rule of leader Alexander Lukashenko.

Ukraine’s interior ministry says 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. It says an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. The ministry did not give any information on casualties among Ukraine’s armed forces. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, claimed Russian forces had lost about 4,300 servicemen, a figure it was not possible to verify independently.

Satellite imagery taken on Sunday showed a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of the capital Kyiv from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away. The city remains in Ukrainian hands. The images released by Maxar Technologies showed a deployment comprising hundreds of military vehicles and extending more than 3.25 miles (5km), the company said. The convoy contained fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery, it said.

Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but “let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance”.

British prime minister Boris Johnson said he called the Ukrainian president who said he believed the next 24 hours was a “crucial period” for Ukraine. Johnson said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine.

The EU will buy weapons for Ukraine. Multiple European countries are offering military aid to Ukraine, including Sweden, which hasn’t sent weapons to a country in armed conflict since the Soviet Union’s invasion of Finland in 1939.

The EU plans to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, including the private jets of Russian oligarchs. The bloc will also ban Russian-state backed television channels RT and Sputnik.

A rare emergency special session of the UN general assembly is due to be held on Monday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the security council has made such a request.

The UN refugee agency has said more than 368,000 people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries. Up to 4 million people could become refugees if the situation continues to worsen, the UN said.

The World Health Organization warned that thousands of lives are at risk from falling Ukrainian oxygen supplies.
Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have spoken out against Putin’s invasion. Fridman said: “I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” Deripaska called for peace talks to begin “as fast as possible”.

Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken” by the war and appeared to take direct aim at Putin by condemning people who “trust in the diabolic and perverse logic of weapons”.

The UK will send an additional £40m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while the US said it is sending nearly $54m (£40m) in new humanitarian aid

Russian police detained more than 1,400 people at anti-war protests on Sunday, an independent monitoring organisation said, lifting the tally for crackdown arrests to over 4,000.

I've been following these threads for nearly a week now, and to be honest, I think it's the natural balance of extremes. Let's be honest, the thought of nuclear war is terrifying, and most people fall into one of two categories:

1) Nuclear war is impossible (Complete denial)

2) Nuclear war is imminent (Complete paranoia) 

When I started these threads, I was 100% in category 2. But now, I'm sort of in a comfortable grey area - what will be will be. I'm not saying I want a nuclear war by any means - all I want is for Ukraine to have peace again - but I'm definitely not jumping every time I hear a plane over my house (and I'm in the fucking UK). Accept that it's out of our hands and we can only hope that it ends soon, with minimal deaths as possible. 

Guess I just wanted to give some insight as someone who started out this week in a total panic.

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways.

We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances… and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways.

We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances… and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

The statements of some experts such as “The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 30-40 minutes”, “Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in the event of a full-scale war”, “Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes” have no serious grounds.

Therefore, it is best for some overexcited Russian experts to forget about their hatred fantasies. And in order to prevent further reputational losses, never remember again.

Now that the world is engaged in attempting to fully break Russia's economy and Europe talking about going so far as to supply fighter planes to Ukraine everything is a lot more global. The thing is that Putin can't really back off. He's talked himself into this and now has committed. It's an existential threat for him. Back off and look weak trying to take Ukraine of all places, which he'll view as too big a show of vulnerability to survive. Or don't and look at being forced out or killed, which it seems apparent he sees as basically the same thing.

It's clear so far that the Russians have been holding back the level of destruction that they can wreak. The fact that they haven't already started leveling Kyiv is proof of that. Russia absolutely has enough ordinance and weapons to do that if they want to. Even outside of a global nuclear exchange there's always the possibility they use tactical nukes to make a point somewhere in Ukraine. Which is a dangerous road. Strangely enough I think the only hope is that the Russians and the people surrounding him refuse such an order or remove him from power. That's far from assured though.

I think the guy is an idiot and will not link his comments because they are trash, but just in case anyone is hearing similar talking points, I'd like to address them.

First, Ukraine is corrupt. It ranks #122 in the world, only a few places ahead of Russia. That having been said, with a score of 32, that not too far from current NATO member, Turkey. I realize that's a low bar and they still haven't cleared it, but also consider their score a decade ago was a meager 26. Corruption is not something you flip a switch on and remove overnight, clearly they are moving in the right direction and that should be encouraged. Without Russian interference, imagine where they could be in another decade?

To the second point, I really hate to bring Godwin's law into this, but we've heard the ""I only want this part of the country with my ethnic people's"" line before. We're not falling for it again. End of discussion.

I ponder that that could be short sited (but obviously open to conversation about why I could be wrong). I fear that this narrative could be similar to the “oh Covid is nothing you don’t need to buy masks” idea we heard early on, or the “Trump is such a joke and afterthought, Clinton will steamroll him” ideas. 

I think the timeframe of this will be weeks to months, not days- if fought conventionally. Unless there is a major interference by other countries or class of weapons. Sure Russia is a formidable force, but Ukraine is incredibly strong as well. I sure as shit wouldn’t want to invade them. They have a hell of a military. It was always always going to be a hard fight for the Russians. 

In the world Ukraine is actually ranked #20 in active personnel and #15 in reserve personnel. #13 in Tanks, #6 in armored vehicles, #6 in artillery.  #17 in dedicated attack aircraft. Those are very good numbers. Sure they’re not #3 like Russia, but shit they’re on the verge of top 20. 

The narrative that “Russia was always going to just steamroll them” isn’t totally accurate. This could be months, not just days or weeks. At the start of Covid we were told “two weeks to stop the curve” and it’s two years later.

Regardless of any strike map or how close we are to any nuke strike or not anywhere in the world or WW3 or political Bibla bile that gets spewed around the net like the drunkard slowing down the party... 6000 Russian civilians have been detained for protesting against the attack on Ukraine in just the past several days. Not to mention the WW3 or nuclear War protests they've now added to their chants before being silenced... none the less, the protests across the globe against the attack on Ukraine.

What does that have to say about some of the Americans from all standards who were applauding Putin publicly just over a week ago not to mention the like minds of some in other countries... Putin has globally made his threat and readied those threats globally that in turn will affect us all. Got any more trash in your mouth to blast around now besides hiding in these types of thread topics. Lurking around for the rest of us that have had a give a shit about humanity (even you) from the beginning no matter what flag you fly, personal or country, to find some solace in what to do now. Yet more voices are being heard globally for the love of peace and support of Ukraine and the innocent Russian people days before Putins escalated threats.

No worries, just like the good hearted kid who breaks through the group of shitheads fueling the bully whose beating your kids ass in the school yard to stand up to all the assholes and break it up or beat several assess before the crowd scatters like roaches when the light gets flipped on, your ass... I mean your kids ass will get saved... it'll get figured out hopefully before the ignorance and hate filled people annihilate themselves taking a few of the rest of us with them. Regardless though, find peace in the fact that just like after the war on the playground... there is a long lasting quiet and peace, with or without their detention or expulsion (hopefully reform), its lasting affect is growing longer and stronger between the false fueling of strength that is in truth cowardly fear and weakness.... remember, it usually only takes one to jump into the group of assholes to make them scatter. Bullies and assholes always throw a big fit when they are losing they're ground or being forced to change.

In point, bravery and true strength is born from fear within a good heart. The true survivors who build it back better tomorrow, win the fight because they are afraid, do not think they are a/the badass, act like they live in a community even if they like being alone, live and let live, give when there's need and accept when in need. Always say the best fight they ever won was the one that never happened but have many scars on they're fist with a good asshole beat down story they could tell. Life is always better the more the inhumane destroy themselves and leave lessons for those in their aftermath to grow from. We are one people, we are all human, our neighborhood is the earth.

History.... everything will be ok, we have been growing better, we are evolving. Even the pope rides in a vehicle, far from the first campfire much less the wheel. 
Stand up, stand beside your neighbor, your fellow human and them beside you. 

We can be ok

Change Together

The same, Human

The official Russian military arms distributor is approached one day by a black market dealer.

""Hey,"" he says, ""sell me your AKs, I'll give you a great price for them, way more than they're worth.""

""How can I do that?"" asks the military distributor. ""What if war breaks out?""

""It's peaceful, why would war break out? If it does, just give everyone broomsticks. In the heat of battle, no one will even notice.""

The arms distributor is poor, and it's peaceful, and this seems reasonable.

Later, war breaks out. The distributor gives all his men broomsticks and takes one himself. They run through the woods yelling, ""Pew, pew! Pew pew pew!""

The arms distributor comes over a hill, and sees a member of the opposition.

He points his broomstick and ""Bang!"" he shouts. ""You're dead!""

The opposing member shakes his head. ""Naw dude,"" he says, ""can't you see I'm in a tank?""

The official Russian military arms distributor is approached one day by a black market dealer.

""Hey,"" he says, ""sell me your AKs, I'll give you a great price for them, way more than they're worth.""

""How can I do that?"" asks the military distributor. ""What if war breaks out?""

""It's peaceful, why would war break out? If it does, just give everyone broomsticks. In the heat of battle, no one will even notice.""

The arms distributor is poor, and it's peaceful, and this seems reasonable.

Later, war breaks out. The distributor gives all his men broomsticks and takes one himself. They run through the woods yelling, ""Pew, pew! Pew pew pew!""

The arms distributor comes over a hill, and sees a member of the opposition.

He points his broomstick and ""Bang!"" he shouts. ""You're dead!""

The opposing member shakes his head. ""Naw dude,"" he says, ""can't you see I'm in a tank?""

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era in three dimensions. And of course, in the fourth, domestic Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system – but this should be discussed separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity – the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the actual civil war, because now brothers are still shooting at each other, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies – but Ukraine as an anti-Russia will no longer exist.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together – in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, we would not only have betrayed the memory of our ancestors, but we would have been cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a drop of historical responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia – for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of an anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the pressure of the West on us, is only the second most important among them.",False,1646020291.0,t3_t35ouk,t1_hyqel1r,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

d71bd387ef218e12266ea0b1ab6cbafa,t35ouk,hyqfqwz,"Military science emphasizes that strikes can be strategic (this mostly applies to strategic nuclear forces), operational and tactical. According to the number of participating forces and objects hit, strikes can be massive, group and single. And other concepts, even in politically symbeitical works, it is still better not to introduce or use them.

Strikes on priority objects and massive fire strikes can be carried out within the front (fronts on the western borders of Russia have not yet been formed) or the main command of the armed forces in the theater of operations (so far it has not been created in the South-West strategic direction either). Anything less than that is no longer a massive blow.

And what is, for example, a massive fire strike (MEU) of the front? To begin with, we note that the maximum number of combat-ready forces and means of aviation, missile troops and artillery, EW facilities at the disposal of the commander of the front troops (operational and strategic association) is involved in MOU. MOU is one massive flight of aviation, two or three launches of OTR and TR missile systems, several artillery fire raids. It is good if the degree of fire defeat of the enemy is 60-70%.

What is the most important thing in this matter in relation to the conflict with Ukraine? Of course, MOU will cause heavy losses to the likely enemy. But to expect only one such blow to crush the armed forces of an entire state means to show simply unbridled optimism in the planning and conduct of hostilities. Such MOUs in the course of hypothetical strategic actions will have to be applied to the theater not one or two, but much more.

To this it must be added that the stocks of promising and high-precision weapons in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are not of any limitless nature. Zircon-type hypersonic missiles are not yet in service. And the number of ""Calibers"" (sea-based cruise missiles), ""Daggers"", X-101 (air-based cruise missiles) and missiles to ""Iskanders"" at best is measured in hundreds (tens in the case of ""Daggers""). This arsenal is not enough to erase a state the size of France and with a population of more than 40 million people from the face of the Earth. Namely, these are the parameters that Ukraine is characterized.

ABOUT DOMINATION IN THE AIR

Sometimes the Russian expert community states (by fans of the Douai doctrine) that since hypothetical hostilities in Ukraine will take place under the complete dominance of Russian aviation in the air, the war will be extremely short and will end in the shortest possible time.

At the same time, it is somehow forgotten that the armed forces of the Afghan opposition did not have a single aircraft or a single combat helicopter during the conflict of 1979-1989. And the war in this country dragged on for as long as 10 years. Chechen militants did not have a single aircraft either. And the fight against them lasted several years and cost the federal forces a lot of blood and sacrifice.

And the Armed Forces of Ukraine still have any combat aviation. As well as air defense equipment.

By the way, Ukrainian crews of anti-aircraft missile troops (not Georgian) significantly tingleed the Russian Air Force during the 2008 conflict. After the first day of hostilities, the leadership of the Russian Air Force was in outright shock from the losses suffered. And don't forget about it.

PRE-CRYING

Now about the thesis ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are in a deplorable state."" Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine has problems with aviation and modern air defense systems. But we must admit the following. If until 2014 the Armed Forces of Ukraine was a fragment of the Soviet army, over the past seven years a qualitatively different army has been created in Ukraine, on a completely different ideological basis and largely on NATO standards. And very modern weapons and equipment today receive and continue to come to Ukraine from many countries of the North Atlantic Alliance.

As for the weakest point of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the Air Force. It cannot be ruled out that the collective West may supply Kiev with fighters in a fairly short time, as they say, from the presence of armed forces - in other words, used. However, this second-hand in its tactical and technical characteristics will be quite comparable to most aircraft of the Russian fleet.

Of course, today the Armed Forces of Ukraine is significantly inferior to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in terms of combat and operational capabilities. No one has any doubts about this - neither in the East nor in the West.

But you can't treat this army lightly either. In this regard, it is always necessary to remember Alexander Suvorov's covenant: ""Never despise your enemy, do not consider him stupider and weaker than you.""

Now as for the claim that Western countries will not send a single soldier to die for Ukraine.

It should be noted that most likely it will be so. However, this does not exclude in the event of Russia's invasion of massive assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the collective West with a variety of samples of weapons and military equipment and extensive supplies of all kinds of material means. In this regard, the West has already shown an unprecedented consolidated position, which does not seem to have been predicted in Moscow.

There is no doubt that some reincarnation of Lend-Lease on the model and likeness of World War II will begin on the part of the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance countries. There is also an influx of volunteers from the West, of which there can be a lot.

GUERRILLAS AND UNDERGROUND FIGHTERS

Finally, about the duration of the hypothetical campaign. In the Russian expert community, several hours, sometimes even several tens of minutes are called. At the same time, it is somehow forgotten that we have already gone through all this. The phrase ""to take the city with one parachute regiment in two hours"" has already become a classic of the genre.

It is also worth recalling that the mighty Stalinist NKVD and the multimillion-dollar Soviet army have been fighting the nationalist underground in Western Ukraine for more than 10 years. And now there is an option that the whole of Ukraine can easily become a partisan. In addition, these formations can easily start operating already on the territory of Russia.

Armed struggle in large Ukrainian cities is generally difficult to predict. It is well known that a big city is the best battlefield for a weak and less technically advanced side of the armed conflict.

Serious experts emphasize that in the metropolis you can not only concentrate the group into thousands and even tens of thousands of fighters, but also hide it from the superior firepower of the enemy. And also to supply it with material means for a long time and compensate for losses in people and equipment. Neither mountains, nor forests, nor jungle provide such an opportunity today.

Experts are convinced that the urban environment helps the defenders, slows down the movement of attackers, allows you to place a record number of fighters per unit area, compensates for the backlog in strength and technology. And in Ukraine, there are more than enough large cities, including those with a million people. So the Russian army during a hypothetical war with Ukraine can meet more than one Stalingrad and Grozny.

CONCLUSIONS

In general, there will be no Ukrainian blitzkrieg. The statements of some experts such as ""The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 30-40 minutes"", ""Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in case of a full-scale war"", ""Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes"" have no serious basis.

And finally, the most important thing. The armed conflict with Ukraine currently fundamentally does not meet Russia's national interests. Therefore, some overexcited Russian experts should best forget about their hat fantasies.

This is a situation of one force having significantly more resources, presumably better supplied and better equipped; vs a significantly smaller force, with presumably under supplied and lesser equipment. 

Here is the catch. In Fallujah, they did not have a coallition of countries resupplying them with modern weaponry to fight back the incoming force. Additionly, the fighting spirit was different. As much as people like to show time as distance, people still were very much in a period of vengence for 9/11 with Fallujah; here the attacking soldiers are conscripts some with families in the place they are invading. Meanwhile, although the politicians are dragging their feet to play games, the outpour of support from people towards the defending people is crazy high.

These facts above barely begin to scratch the topic as they do not cover the details of force disposition, command control aspects, resupply, political and socio aspects, allied responses, geological terrain and proximity, etc. 

The closest conflict you might be able to compare are the 6 Days War and that conflict do not reflect the same situation.

Nuclear weapons are not actually the end of the world in themselves, they're just very ~~big~~ **powerful**, very deadly explosives that generate exponentially more damage and cleanup requirements than regular explosives. Humans have detonated *hundreds* of nuclear weapons on this planet in tests - but only **two** in combat. We're not glassed yet. Nuclear weapons **≠** scorched planet, that's just the end result of the *policy* of MAD. MAD depends on *every* nuclear weapon state launching *all* the nukes at *everything* they can target... but crucially, there are *other policies* besides MAD. MAD is a naive assumption that your enemies will throw everything at you to totally annihilate you in one fell swoop, so you throw *everything* back. Instead, we get to *choose* our reply to the use of nuclear weapons, be they used individually or en masse.            

So, what if Putin *does* nuke Ukraine?\* Let's say he just lays a fat egg on Kyiv because he's out of his gourd and the ruble is scrap. What happens next is *not* automatically launching all our nukes at Russia while they launch all their nukes at everyone else, and so on. There is no Big Red Launch All Nukes™ button. We have the choice of what our response is to nuclear weapon deployment - if it's not automatic, like Russia's Dead Hand (we'll come to that). So, do we lob one at Moscow? Do we target Putin's bunker instead? The silos? The subs?         

I believe it's better we *not* nuke anything in retaliation, not only to avoid triggering the Dead Hand system (which, grimly, *automated* Russia's MAD protocol response, which is, in itself, *batshit insane*), but to simply display the crater of Kyiv to the world and show Russian citizens that their leader is a madman, with rhetoric built of lies, who was willing to mass-murder the people of Kyiv and (potentially) his own men, in cold blood. We could then put a bounty on his head while we work with Russia to dismantle their nuclear triad, because I think most Russians could get on-board cooperating with that. Those who support the absolute lie that the ""Ukrainian separatists"" are the enemy have no means to rationalize the fact that the ""separatists"" would have *no way* to get ahold of a nuke, *no reason* to destroy their homeland, and *no reason* not to lob that nuke at Russia or Belarus instead. Nationalists wouldn't suicide-bomb their *entire nation* at once... you can't wax on about your national identity if your nation is ash and cinders and you are dust.            

Edit: minor formatting, and to add:      

\*In case the point is lost, the only target that Russia could nuke without triggering some form of MAD by default is, achingly, Ukraine. I don't want it to happen, ever (Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🌻), but if the madman at the top were to exercise the option, it's the only one that won't realistically, immediately result in glassing the majority of the planet. It's the only one for which Russia has a (**clearly fraudulent**) casus belli.

Russian soldiers weren’t getting paid much in the first place - the equivalent of between $250 and $500 for the grunts. But within a few days that will be down to less than $200. 

Morale wasn’t high to begin with, and the apparently significant Russian losses won’t help. When it dawns on them that their paychecks are quickly becoming worthless, they may start deserting. 

Even more significant will be the homefront pressure. Many Russian citizens have made it clear they already don’t support the war for personal and ideological reasons. At market open, if the Ruble collapses as expected, you can add economic reasons to that list. The average Russian citizen was never particularly wealthy in the first place, and if the economic sanctions thrust them deep into poverty, then they will be ready to riot.

Russia is already facing a tough battle against Ukraine. It won’t easily weather a military fiscal meltdown or a revolt on the home front on top of that.

Say they work for a company that is involved in let’s just say manufacturing.  Typically this company is able to buy materials from abroad and sell the items they make around the globe.  A key part of this system is being able to send and receive funds to buy materials at a decent rate, and being able to have steady income to pay for those materials and your employees paychecks.  When payments can’t be made easily materials costs either increase, or the supplier decides to sell somewhere else.  Another result would be for customers to buy items from another company rather than deal with a company dealing with sanctions.

Joking aside, my anxiety is high but not out of control. My 10 year old son asked me today what I thought the odds were of WWIII. I first said, somewhat flippantly, ""about 50:50"" but then after reflecting adjusted my estimate to ""less than 20%, but higher than at any other time in my lifetime"" (I was born after 62).

Given the interconnectedness of the world, the ready availability of information, and the change in perspectives and ideology over the last 80 years, a WWIII scenario or even a greater European war (Nuclear Armageddon notwithstanding) would require everyone to rewrite the rules of how we understand armed conflict, even compared to recent theaters in the Middle East and South Asia, just like we did the first two times. All the same, just like the first two times, however it ends, it ends badly. And I think as we're already seeing--it doesn't end quickly.

Putin also didn't invade Ukraine expecting the entire world to just collectively kick his teeth, pretty certain he expected another Crimea situation where everyone turned a blind eye.

To me they are not equivalent.

Trump/right framed it as Biden protecting his son but he was there to have iirc their AG removed for corruption.

In 2014, Russia invaded Crimea because it was a vital strategic interest and was majority Russian speaking. Donbas, however, was initially a fascist riot (the leader, Pavel Gubarev, began his career as a fascist, which there are a lot of in Ukraine), that Putin realized could help his cause and he opportunistically supported them.

All that changed in 2019 with the election of Zelensky. Zelensky actually tried to reform a lot of institutions and fired a lot of local governors he saw as corrupt, as well as reforming and opening up the media. This really paved the way to start the NATO/EU integration process and instead of declaring neutrality, he said he would put this up for a vote.

This is my understanding of the situation: Putin’s been in power for something like 20 years, having made himself President for Life a few years ago. Hitler, by contrast, rose to power *on the back of the economic hardship* German was under after WWI by running on a platform of finger pointing and blame. The sanctions were already in place when he ran, the people desperate and angry, and he knew he could exploit that desperation and anger to achieve his own personal ends. 

Putin’s power is self given, while Hitler’s power depended on the people’s bitterness and sense of resentment. It was easier for Hitler to sell war to the people who elected him on grounds that were already somewhat primed for conflict, as opposed to Putin who is spearheading these efforts regardless of how the people feel about it. Unlike the German public, Putin had to convince the people that this war was necessary, much less good or justified. The Russian people weren’t clamoring for war against Ukraine, Putin had to shove the idea into their heads over and over again.

What Putin fears is retribution from his own people. COVID ravaged through Russia and the economy wasn’t looking good. He needed a diversion, something to take Russia’s eyes off him. He thought this war would be an easy win and would create a sense of nationalistic pride that would gloss over his horrific mismanagement of the country. What Putin stands to lose, what he fears losing, is Russia.

The point of that sort of thing is to make the other people in the room uncomfortable imo.  Putin sits at the head of the table.  The generals sit together awkwardly to one side.  The table is long to make them feel insignificant.  This is meant to intimidate them.  

The trouble is that you are supposed to be more subtle about that sort of thing.  He is doing it to an exaggerated degree.  It would be comedic if he didn’t have the power to start a nuclear war.  Instead it’s quite disturbing.  It almost kind of seems like an obsession with Putin to have comically large furniture.

In medieval and early modern Europe these sorts of ostentatious displays of dominance were a lot more normal.  It’s very strange to us in the free world because most of us have never lived in a true autocracy.  We don’t go around kissing rings or apologizing three times before approaching the king, we go up to our most powerful leaders and scream at them that they are jerks.

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways.

We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances… and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds”

>It was designed to lie semi-dormant until switched on by a high official in a crisis. Then it would begin monitoring a network of seismic, radiation, and air pressure sensors for signs of nuclear explosions. Before launching any retaliatory strike, the system had to check off four if/then propositions: If it was turned on, then it would try to determine that a nuclear weapon had hit Soviet soil. If it seemed that one had, the system would check to see if any communication links to the war room of the Soviet General Staff remained. If they did, and if some amount of time—likely ranging from 15 minutes to an hour—passed without further indications of attack, the machine would assume officials were still living who could order the counterattack and shut down. But if the line to the General Staff went dead, then Perimeter would infer that apocalypse had arrived. It would immediately transfer launch authority to whoever was manning the system at that moment deep inside a protected bunker—bypassing layers and layers of normal command authority.

This is the explanation of the system by one of the developers.

As an American, I'm obviously mostly familiar with the US foundational mythos. And I don't want to go HURR DURR EVERYTHING IS ABOUT AMERICA WE ARE #1!!!!! but at the same time it's crazy that these American mythoses were created 200 years ago... yet you can just change the words a bit to make them relevant in the modern day.

2 examples that come to mind:

* [Hamilton has a great example of the myth behind George Washington.](https://youtu.be/DcD9ADx_Rh4) Replace America in that song with Ukraine, Britain with Russia, and Washington with Zelenskyy and you can easily see comparisons. (Admittedly, Hamilton himself doesn't quite fit in - but my point is more about the legends around George Washington fighting a superior army more than anything else.)

* Famously, the Star-Spangled Banner is a real flag that was waving over Fort McHenry as the British tried to take the fort. As dawn broke and the British were retreating, the flag was still waving above the fort. This inspired the song that would become the American national anthem. Just a couple days ago, Kyiv saw similar overnight battles, with a huge sigh of relief when Kyiv held and the Ukrainian flag kept waving.

Again, I don't want to come off as an Ugly American stereotype, but I find it _so_ weird that we can draw connections like this between the modern day and wars that happened 2 centuries ago. You can easily see why these events inspired people to create songs and plays and poetry.",1646021272.0,1646021084.0,t3_t35ouk,t1_hyqg1tp,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

The offensive of Russia and the new world
View of the center of Kyiv. February 25, 2022

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.
The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to fight for it with the Atlantic bloc.

Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations
Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

Russia formed a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine
Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself.

Oil extraction is dirty work that makes a lot of emissions, depending on the method of extraction 15-40% of emissions come from extraction, not from actual use of oil and gas products. 

This is in a similar vein to Western countries offshoring their dirty, environmentally unfriendly manufacturing/heavy industry largely to other countries.

The funny part of course being, that using liquid natural gas in particular, for electricity generation instead of coal, and exporting that to Third World countries from stable wealthy countries is how you would reduce emissions globally the most in the immediate term, while being able to use those funds to get yourself onto green energy (when discussing emissions from an energy perspective). Of course, other really big factors are actually land use/management, increasing albedo in warm places, and designing cities for public or active transit.

Having national targets for all of this stuff is sort of silly, and there should be collaboration between states to collectively reduce emissions through joint actions/efficiencies instead of everyone doing their own thing, which is also going to favour countries who are willing to lie and cheat",False,1646020572.0,t3_t35ouk,t1_hyqfw53,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

&#x200B;

>The Russian military has likely recognized that its initial expectations that limited Russian attacks would cause the collapse of Ukrainian resistance have failed and is recalibrating accordingly. The Russian military is moving additional combat resources toward Ukraine and establishing more reliable and effective logistics arrangements to support what is likely a larger, harder, and more protracted conflict than it had originally prepared for. The tide of the war could change rapidly in Russia’s favor if the Russian military has correctly identified its failings and addresses them promptly, given the overwhelming advantage in net combat power Moscow that enjoys. Ukrainian morale and combat effectiveness remain extremely high, however, and Russian forces confront the challenge of likely intense urban warfare in the coming days.Russian forces largely conducted an operational pause on February 26-27 but will likely resume offensive operations and begin using greater air and artillery support in the coming days. Russian airborne and special forces troops are engaged in urban warfare in northwestern Kyiv, but Russian mechanized forces are not yet in the capital. Russian forces conducted limited attacks on the direct approaches to Kyiv on both banks of the Dnipro River, but largely paused offensive operations in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces likely paused to recalibrate their – to date largely unsuccessful – approach to offensive operations in northern Ukraine and deploy additional reinforcements and air assets to the front lines.",False,1646022615.0,t3_t35ouk,t1_hyql67o,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

I said that comment was stupid because you're comparing us getting hit by an asteroid to a nukes being launched by Russia. The asteroid that is closest to hitting the world is 300 years away.. there are massive projects going on that are working on preventing that from happening. Have you not heard about the DART mission? It's literally underway RIGHT NOW. Nothing can stop Putin launching nukes unless those closest to him physically prevent him from doing it which with the way things are going is really unlikely.
