Day 257 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was also mostly quiet, there were no missile strikes but about an hour ago, at 8:30pm, some missile launches from Belgorod did happen. They fired 4 missiles but we don’t really know where they went. Some people speculated that those missiles went somewhere to the eastern front, but they could have also gone to Kupiansk, and we won’t know if explosions happen there until later, because there are no people living there that could report it to our telegram channels, they all fled long ago.

Surprisingly there were no new massive missile strikes on our infrastructure today, it was actually pretty unexpected. We even had the scheduled rolling blackouts in Kharkiv today, and they didn’t go over the promised 3 hours, so for us it was from 9am to 12pm with no extensions. Apparently if no new attacks on our energy infrastructure happen, then rolling blackouts will only go on for another 2 weeks, but I doubt Russians will stop.

Good news is that NASAMS finally arrived to us just as I was hoping yesterday, and they are most likely already operational. This should boost our air defense considerably; it will be interesting to see just how effective they are in real combat situations, hopefully much fewer Russian missiles will be able to avoid our AA now. I wonder where those will be stationed, we probably won’t (and honestly shouldn’t) know about it, unless some people find spent missiles on the ground and then post them on the internet like it happened with Iris-T previously.

The longer Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, the more prominent the party of war becomes at home. Hardly a day goes by without a headline-making statement by the most outspoken ultrapatriotic, anti-Western hawks, such as Kadyrov, Prigozhin, and Medvedev.

All three men have used their vocal support for the war to raise their public profile, but have they actually gained any more influence as a result? They are trying to push Putin down a narrow corridor of escalation, but there are no signs that the president is actually listening to them.

https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/88334

See also: **Who Are Russia’s War Hawks, and Do They Matter?**

It’s not right to assume that any of these figures or factions has an independent power base that allows them to advance their own policy agendas or to challenge Putin frontally. All of them are major beneficiaries of his patronage. At the moment, their belligerent talk could even help Putin by demonstrating that his actions reflect a consensus within the political class, not just a response to his own failed policies.

The evolving views of Moscow hawks are worth watching for another reason: they could also provide early signs of interest in de-escalation. If any portion of Putin’s circle of advisors comes to favor cutting their losses and winding down the war, that preference too could be previewed and tested through the attitudes of media personalities,¹ or even in the statements² of people such as Prigozhin and Girkin. In facing defeat, Putin will need others to share the blame.

Year: 1812. French army.  
1. 610,000 soldiers.  
2. Attack before winter.  
3. ???  
4. 500,000 casualties and it was a great disaster (for the French).  
  
Year: 1941. German army.  
1. 3,800,000 soldiers.  
2. Attack before winter.  
3. ???  
4. 1,000,000 casualties and it was a great disaster (for the Germans).  
  
Year: 2022. Russian army.  
1. 320,000+ mobiks.  
2. Attack before winter.  
3. ???  
4. GUESS WHAT COULD HAPPEN - with that masterful strategy.  
  
So, this made me ponder, please bear with me for a bit. How come the very russians are falling to the same trap they made other armies fall for centuries? What came to their heads? What happened in master strategist's Putin mind?  
I know, I know, the Russian Empire, manifest destiny, etc., etc.  
But also, a concept went to my mind.  
The concept is: hubris.  
It's summed up in the old saying, ""Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad"". Quoting the wiki: ""Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities."" Aristotles said this: ""(Hubris is) to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification.""  
And that's exactly what we're witnessing right now. Drunk with power, and thinking they're above the wheel of fortune, Putin (and part of his camarilla) went drawn by hubris into their own destruction. This has happened lots of times before. And will keep on happening.  
  
Just some passing thoughts.

**Edit:**

good lord, an exchange near the end echoes exactly what i've been thinking for six months...

https://youtu.be/x3X8X-HTzi8?t=631

**Ben:** Is it accurate to say we have deterred ourselves, that we have overestimated the risk of a Russian escalation of some sort? and so as a result of that we continue to stop just short of saying we want Ukraine to win, or providing certain capabilities that would accelerate Ukrainian victory, but there's this cloud of 'we don't want WW3' or 'we don't want them to escalate'.

**Edward:** That's absolutely right, this fear of escalation is this kind of mental prison that we've put ourselves into, locked ourselves -- we've gone into this cage, padlocked it and swallowed the key and that was really stupid, and we are now doing far more than we thought was possible in February - if we'd done in February what we're doing now, there wouldn't be a war, so we are always making things too little too late, and we're doing it because we're scared of so-called 'provoking the Russians' - and yet we end up doing it, we just have to wait until another thousand -- another ten-thousand Ukrainians have died, until there's been a bit more destruction, and then we think 'oh yes, okay, we need to send them this weapon system after all, we need to do this extra thing'.  *So the Ukrainians are washing away with their blood the marks, these lines in the sand that Russia's trying to draw.  And in the end, the lines don't exist, the blood's there, and we go ahead and do what we should have done anyway.*

(1) The vast majority of Americans believe that the budget can be balanced by reducing ""waste, fraud and abuse"" + foreign aid.

Most actual analysis of the US budget believe that cutting foreign aid to 0 and eliminating 100% of ""waste, fraud and abuse"" would save the US, at most, $50-$100 billion per year.  On a budget of $6.27 trillion; and a deficit of $1.38 trillion.

But voters believe this, so the Republicans as the party opposed to government utilize it as a rhetorical tool.

(2) The Republican Party has been on a 90 year mission to roll back the New Deal and Great Society.  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  The problem is that these programs are incredibly popular, as exampled when Bill Clinton shut down the Gov. to save Medicare and was re-elected.

So, the solution to this political problem has been a two step Republican Strategy.  (1) When in the White House, pass the largest possible tax cuts without cutting spending, because tax cuts are popular and deficits are not; and (2) When out of the White House, demand that deficits be fixed by cutting spending.  So, that any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid can be blamed on a Democratic President.

So, Republicans use the Foreign Aid + ""Waste, Fraud, and Abuse"" argument to attack government spending when Democrats are in power to build political power to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while there is a Democratic President.

Flexing power to hurt people. Where have we seen that lately? 

But the wild card in this is that Republicans love funneling money to defense contractors. Also, the billions of lend-lease money is already locked in. So they will very publicly claim to have shut off ""wasteful, un-American""  money to Ukraine, and not talk about the actual aid still being delivered. It's all theater for these guys, and not just spin but outright fiction and lies — whatever is necessary for whatever message they want to spread, which is always ""democrats are evil and ruining the country"".

Bullshit.  Russia has not said they're willing to discuss withdrawal.

>Is the Russian hardware in Ukraine now property of Ukraine's armed forces? 

This doesn't have to be difficult. Russia, and Russia alone, has made this difficult with their illegal invasion.
No. It is the property of Ukrainian farmers.

>DPR soldiers are Ukrainian. Do they get treason charges or are they now units employed in Ukraine's army? 

No, they are DPR.  If there is such a thing.
If they aren't I'd say they have the option of going home to Russia, or if they have documentation proving Ukrainian birth, they could stay in Ukraine and submit to investigation for treason and war crimes. 

>If you give Russia the military equipment on what timeline do they make the withdraw? 

Russia has given this equipment to Ukraine. If Russia wanted to keep it they should have left it in Russia.

None.

Anything left is now Ukraine's. Anything that is driven out remains Russian.

>DPR soldiers are Ukrainian. Do they get treason charges or are they now units employed in Ukraine's army?

Any that don't go to Russia are tried on a case by case basis. Gang pressed into service? Probably no charges. Joined in 2013/2014? Treason/sedition. Punishment to be determined.


>If you give Russia the military equipment on what timeline do they make the withdraw?

They actively drive, drag, tow, or otherwise get it out immediately. Any stopping for more than eight hours of sleep a day opens them up to be shot and the vehicle destroyed or captured. A two day ceasefire could be negotiated to load equipment on trains out IF all troops leave immediately and only a token logistics force remains.

>How much loot can Russian soldiers pillage without breaking the cease-fire?

None. Troops looting are subject to arrest and may be fired up on. Any troops not on a road moving to Russia may be arrested or shot. Sleep on the road, from 10pm to 6am.

>If Russian soldiers run out of gas while attempting to withdraw does Ukraine give them fuel?

No. Abandon the vehicle and start walking. You may catch a ride on another vehicle on the way out, get fuel from another vehicle on the way out, walk, surrender, or die.

The post-1918 German nationalists were allowed to keep their weapons and propaganda machines intact. Their reentry into power was predictable. 

There was no difference between WW1 and WW2 Germany, except after WW2 the Allies were willing to occupy and enforce the demilitarization of Germany in both deeds and words. If we actually want Russia to reform, we have to actually enforce some norms of political behavior as a condition for reentry into the Western economic market. 

My 'radical' opinion: we really should do our utmost to get rid of Putin. There is no real chance of peace with Putin still in power, or the Kaiser or the Fuhrer or Stalin for that matter. People knew this back in the 20th Century, but seem to want easy answers in the 21st when dealing with imperialists. But even short of overthrow, as with Stalin, sometimes the only 'easy' answer for global peace was the path chosen, geopolitical containment.

Reality is disappointing. Peace requires sacrifice and democracies prepared against tyrants.",1667850909.0,1667836630.0,t3_yoc4en,t1_ivesmrz,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Wrong, that was the Democrats.

Before we bothsides the issue of political parties and Ukraine, I'd just like to remind people here that the Democratic party actually allows dissention in their ranks, and criticisms of the President's policies. You and I may disagree strongly that any talks should occur without Ukraine being present, there are others that would ask that at least a diplomatic line of dialogue be open in case of the possibility that war spills out beyond Russia's borders, or an actual nuclear threat appears and escalates. To that end many spins of this article don't actually do a good job of conveying what was actually in these liberal Democrats letter; they're not all ""cowards"" or far left ""Putin enablers"". To call them such is disingenuous and only creates divisions that do not exist while empowering those that actually threaten democracy and discussion like this.

* As a signing member to that letter, anyone calling Jamie Raskin a coward has obviously not watched any of the Jan 6 committee hearings.

* There were also members of this same progressive group of the Democrat party that asked for *even more* weapons and humanitarian aide to Ukraine than is being provided.

>“We are under no illusions regarding the difficulties involved in engaging Russia given its outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine,” the Democrats’ letter states. “If there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America’s responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.”",False,1667867500.0,t3_yoc4en,t1_ivhgall,,2,14,0,14,0,0,

I think he bought into his BS or atleast listened too closely to his advisors who were too blind or afraid to report the true state of the military and Ukraine's internal situation leading up to the war. 

Once it started, he obviously trusted too much in the military to get it done. The constant replacement of military commanders shows that they're not really trying to fix the problem but instead just keep throwing expendable scapegoats out into the field in the hopes that one of them will get it done. 

The mobilization was obviously a desperate move to keep what they're currently occupying and trying to overwhelm defenses to grab more.

First of all, change of control of one or both Houses of congress won't 'put the Republicans in charge' any more than the Democrats were 'in charge' these last two years. The ability of the minority party to stalemate legislation is high on its own, and that's without the additional threat of a Presidential veto. Congress may not approve large funding bills, but that's about as much as they can do (and they can already do that now; instead, the funding Bills passed with massive partisan support).

The other half of it is that the one place the President has absolute unitary power is in the matter of military stuff. Commander in Chief is not a fancy title, it's literal. The National Security Council (these are the people you're looking at when you see images from the 'Situation Room') is where political-level military decisions are discussed, and everyone on it is a presidential appointee. Since we don't actually declare wars any more (a power of Congress that hasn't been used since WWII), nearly all military action is exercised via this body. And the leeway there is quite wide to include a lot of indirect aid and assistance.

There are some greater complexities when it comes to NATO involvement, but ultimately, I don't think its likely you will see much change as of *this* election. You may see Republicans begin to seriously run on stopping 'wasteful spending' on 'foreign involvement' or what have you in the lead up to the next election, but even that's a very complicated campaign platform to adopt without looking like you're actually cheering on Russia publicly, which only the most pure insane Qanon portion of the party is really happy to do.",False,1667858925.0,t3_yoc4en,t1_ivgszxk,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Most of them aren’t from the US and feel very strongly about American Imperialism because they’ve experienced it firsthand. A lot of Latin Americans for example feel this way. 

Some are authoritarians but the majority romanticize the Soviet Union because are they were geopolitically and ideologically opposed to America. 

The vast majority Russian sympathizers are on the right. I mean our last Republican president was impeached for jeopardizing Ukraine’s security. Trump attempted to coerce Zelensky by withholding Ukraines military aid, because Trump wanted him to lie about Biden. They majority of Republicans were more than happy to support Trump even after he was impeached. 

Some of the far right are isolationists tired of decades of war in the Middle East, but most are  fascists that look up to a “strongman” standing up for conservative values. 

They’re not Tankies but a small minority of the left are reluctant to support Ukraine because they fear Putin will launch a nuke if the US puts him in a corner. While I strongly disagree with this position and feel it’s hurtful, it’s not malicious.

Noam Chomsky for example is probably the most mainstream voice on the left that feels this way.  He still supported US military aid to Ukraine until the Russians were driven out of the north. His position changed because he felt the US was more interested in weakening Russia than ending the conflict.

I live in a swing state so I'm very used to the loud noise surrounding election cycles. There is definitely a group of house Republicans that want to stop funding Ukraine under the premise of cutting spending and rallying against Biden's policies in general. That said, that group of people is a loudly vocal minority of the party. The Senate is pretty much solid bipartisan support. With the Lend-Lease bill smartly in effect now, Biden has the power to ""loan"" whatever military equipment to Ukraine he wants and he does not need to secure funding for it. The bill itself is actually a republican sponsored bill by Sen. John Cornyn \[R-TX\].

Nearly all the commotion on both sides of this is just that, noise to draw out voters. There's definitely a danger to international relations in the future if Trumpism keeps on winning on the Republican side, but most Republicans today are not actually Trump-minded. Democrats are pushing the Ukraine issue hard to scare people into voting blue, and Republican trumpers are pushing the anti-Ukraine funding issue hard to enrage people to vote red.

“Support favors Ukraine against Russia at 69 percent to 5 percent, with Democrats at 81 percent support. Republicans and independents are at 64 percent and 63 percent respectively, but that does not translate as greater support for Russia, which is at 8 percent and 3 percent, respectively.”

None of us are political experts here (and the odds between a fully controlled congress and a house/senate split are still within the margin of error), but my take is that it's somewhat strange to imagine the Republicans essentially being 100% on board with the war for X amount of time and then flipping to being 100% against it and lighting everything on fire to sabotage it specifically because they're all Putin's slaves. It also plays up the 'Putin Mastermind' side more than I think is realistic. 

I think it's much more the kind of thing that will vary as public sentiment does; the reality is that *public* support for the war is less now than it was at the start, and will be less each month. In the rubric of Republicans as amoral self-serving monsters, I imagine they will echo this trend.

I think a discussion of the logistics vice an arbitrary date would have been massive. Just curious what people think is the right, actionable move instead of talking about it. Like WHEN would the withdrawal have been.

It was literally the right’s contribution to state-provided healthcare. It was developed as an idea by the conservative Heritage Foundation. MA governor Mitt Romney demanded it before signing the bill.

That bill became a blueprint for federal healthcare reform, but the right wing tea party rose in opposition. We lost any chance at public coverage options because of a special election won by a conservative dickhead in Massachusetts. Opposition to the mandate has become the core of republican attempts to repeal Obamacare - and block funding for it - scores of times.
