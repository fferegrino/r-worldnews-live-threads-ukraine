“The enemy's task is to stop our advance and they are putting a lot of effort into this. Our enemy is strong. Therefore, our troops have to move in an extremely difficult situation,” Maliar said on Ukrainian national television Tuesday. “In addition, we need to create certain conditions for further advancement.”

“Remember the liberation of Kherson — it also took more than one day,” she added.

Her comments were supported by the Commander of the Tavria Joint Forces Operation, Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who said Ukraine was making gains along the southern front.

“Fighting continues in the Tavria sector, with the Ukrainian Defence Forces gaining ground in some areas and the enemy retreating,” he wrote in Telegram.

“Over the last day, the enemy's losses in killed and wounded amounted to more than three companies. 41 units of enemy military equipment were destroyed,” he added. “Four enemy ammunition depots were also destroyed.”

Ukraine also claimed gains in the east, around Bakhmut, and said it had stopped Russia’s push near Kupyansk.

“The enemy's offensive in the Kupyansk sector is currently unsuccessful.

""The Ukrainian counteroffensive is “far from a failure” despite moving slower than anticipated, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said Tuesday.

“It started about five or six weeks ago, and the various war games that were done ahead of time that predicted certain levels of advance and that has slowed down. Why? Because that's the difference between war on paper and real war,” Milley said during a press briefing. “These are real people in real machines that are out there really clearing real minefields and they're really dying. So when that happens, units tend to slow down, and that's rightly so, in order to survive in order to get through these minefields.”

“It is far from a failure,” he added. “In my view, I think that it's way too early to make that kind of call. I think there’s a lot of fighting left to go.""

Milley also said that Ukraine has a “significant amount of combat power not yet committed” to the counteroffensive.

“I will not say what's going to happen in the future, because that's going to be a Ukrainian decision as to where and when they commit their reserve, etc,” he said. “Right now they are preserving their combat power, and they are slowly and deliberately and steadily working their way through all these minefields.”",False,1689721048.0,t3_152nork,t3_152nork,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-18-23/index.html

""Gov. Ron DeSantis downplayed the conflict in Ukraine in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.

Some Republicans have grilled the Republican presidential candidate over his dismissal of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine as a “territorial dispute” not of “vital” national interest. During the interview, DeSantis doubled down, calling the war a “secondary or tertiary interest,” though he said he would be “willing to be helpful to bring it to a conclusion.”

“The goal should be a sustainable, enduring peace in Europe, but one that does not reward aggression,” the Florida governor said.

Asked if he would stop arming Ukraine or sending financial support, DeSantis wouldn’t say. Instead, he advocated for turning the focus of the US military away from Europe and toward Asia and China.

“I am not gonna diminish our stocks and not send (them) to Taiwan. I’m not gonna make us less capable to respond to exigencies,” DeSantis told Tapper, calling the island’s future a “significant interest.”""",False,1689719975.0,t3_152nork,t3_152nork,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

In remarks published on the Russian Foreign Ministry Telegram channel Tuesday in response to a question from Reuters, Gatilov accused the deal of deviating away from its ""intended humanitarian purposes.""

""Implementation of one of the two components of the Istanbul Agreements - the Russia-UN Memorandum - has failed to make any meaningful progress due to the disruptive stance of the Western countries,"" Gatilov said. ""They continued to increase their sanctions pressure on our country, which constrained Russian agricultural exports by completely blocking bank transactions, insurance, logistics, foreign assets and supplies of spare parts.""

Gatilov did say the UN ""tried on its part to urge the Western governments and business structures to implement the Russian-UN Memorandum.""

""However, despite the efforts, the leadership of the UN Secretariat could not overcome the resistance of the Western countries and private companies, on which depended the fulfillment of our demands,"" he said.

The thing is that everyone currently in power is *both* capable *and* responsible.  It's just their capabilities and responsibilities are optimized for an autocratic society and those by their very nature require undermining military capability.

Take the CEO of Rostec since 2007, [Sergey Chemezov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Chemezov), a guy never criticized by Girkin and was personally appointed head of Rostec by Putin.

Rostec had a 2021 revenue of ~28B USD.  Lockheed Martin had a 2021 revenue of ~68B.

That's not unusual, Lockheed usually has 2-3 times Rostec's revenue.

However Chemezov had a [yacht](https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/meridian-a-superyacht-seized.php) worth about the same as the total net worth (not just from Lockheed stock/compensation, but total net worth overall) of roughly the past *three* CEOs of Lockheed Martin.  Combined.

Girkin likes to complain about the Plywood Marshal Shoigu quite often but Shoigu's nothing special or different.  The entire system of government breeds these kinds of incentives, *no one* wants to rock the boat.  The last defense minister who tried to force companies to actually deliver the contracts they promised lasted five years before being accused of corruption himself.

Replacing Putin doesn't fix the system of government.  It doesn't fix the perverse incentives.  It just means a different ring to kiss.

Getting ""capable and responsible people"" the way ""Western"" countries expect would require mass democratization of Russia.

Which is something Girkin would be very much against.

The Russians have been finding a measure of success due to sheer size of force in a region that has a fairly intact supply network thanks to its proximity to Russian borders shielding many of the supply nodes.  It's an optimal situation for their forces.  But that's not to say that condition will last.

Remember that the Ukrainians have been well-practiced in defense in depth doctrines.   The Ukrainians might be trading back territory to keep Russian forces engaged and burning through equipment and troops through gradual force corrosion. They've done it before successfully, and it's probably a likely compromise - especially if the Ukrainians are out to increase the overall Russian supply, manpower and equipment burn and add more pressure to the deepening situations for the Russians developing across the front.  The fact that they are increasingly drawing the Russians away from their supply lines as they fall back will diminish any advantages in location, especially if the Russians commit more forces to the salient and thus overload a stretching logistical route even more.

> By employing LIDAR systems that detect polarization changes in the backscatterede nergy obtained after illuminating the target with linearly polarized light, surface landmines can be detected due to their smooth nature in comparison with the surrounding natural backgrounds. This technique is safe and can scan large areas. It is capable of detecting both metallic and nonmetallic objects in a wide variety of climatic conditions during the day or night. It involves the use of extremely sensitive sensor equipments to provide near real-time data and rapid spatial scans in three dimensions. Unfortunately, this method is not capable of imaging below the ground surface. It does not work well in moderately to highly vegetated areas. The low return signal strength of the LIDAR limits its range and sensitivity

Nor will they seize one, as the product will be unsellable (India and China aren’t buying pirated grain).  Nor do I think it’s the point to threaten either of these.  They may turn a vessel back, or lay mines to close shipping lanes out of Ukraine.

The point is to reduce the flow of goods out of Ukraine to a trickle, and this they’ve already achieved.  Insurance policies on ships are written with a term of Days now, so it’s gotten very expensive to ship at all.  Shipping over land is even more expensive.  And with the reduced access to energy and fertilizer, it’s gotten very expensive to farm in the first place, so harvests are smaller anyway.

The result is that even under the grain deal, output was like 1/10 of what it was prewar.  No grain deal will make it even smaller.  And all the while, Russia benefits from the peak in food futures, which is something they actually export quite a lot of.

So I think the US not participating is an acknowledgment that getting involved with this would be a purely symbolic move.  And there’s no point in beating that hornets nest for a symbolic reason.

Yes. You literally are going against every statistic on the matter. You can't just call up 90% of your able bodied in the nation and support said 90% as combatants. Please go back to Warthunder, you have no clue what you're talking about.

Hahaha, let me use it again, cope more. Nothing you said changes the fact it still is an offensive war. Russia isn't at risk of losing their nation, their family, their friends by discontinuing the war, but Ukraine is. Funny bit is, Russia is at risk of losing all three of those by continuing the war. Let that sink in.

You over-estimate the amount of people who would rather die for their country than live under Russian rule, of course Russia doesn't help itself, because their actions are increasing amount of people who would do precisely that, but without resources, it would be fight of impossible odds, but we can clearly see that it would be one hell of a fight even without western support.

&#x200B;

Do you genuinely believe Russia is at danger of imminent collapse? The only one who is at danger is perhaps Putin, that's it.  Western companies still  do business in Russia, even if some of them are doing it incognito, but western parts don't just magically appear there.  Russia has it's allies in Middle East that are vehemently anti-west, it has India which cannot afford to abandon Russia, it has China who might not like Russia at all, but they see potential in using Russia as a balance to West, same way USA is using Ukraine(Ukraine are doing it voluntarily, mind you, I am not implying in any way that they are coerced), there's also South America too. 

&#x200B;

Yeah, I think people did in fact have forgotten all of these things. Propaganda efforts? La Pen has genuine chance of winning next election, Slovakia has genuine chance of electing pro-russia leader, Hungary has pro-russia leader.

Brexit influence and poisoning, I give you that. There's a reason that UK are so active in supporting Ukraine, and unlike USA who seem to play way too carefully, they're not afraid of crossing any so called 'red lines' of russia and I love UK for that. 

Trump election? Lol, dude there's 50-50 chance Americans would elect Trump again at this very moment.

I put serious doubt in how much you truly have been following it then. Here's a funny thought; How long has the west been around in Iraq and Afghanistan, at much more cost per year? That's about as long as you can expect Russia to need to last at minimum.

I don't think I overestimate it at all. They're not blind to what horrors has been exacted on the Donbass, during the previous incursion, the intermediate period and the mass forced usage of them to fight against their own countrymen now. This stands to happen (and in some cases already is) to every newly conquered territory. They haven't forgotten the deportations, the Holodomor, the Russian migrating to displace majority of ethnic citizens, etcetera. And yes, the current actions of Russia aren't helping it in any way to make that situation any better.

&#x200B;

>Do you genuinely believe Russia is at danger of imminent collapse? The only one who is at danger is perhaps Putin, that's it.

Yes. It has a couple breakaway regions that would definitely get out if Russia's hold over them isn't strong enough. Whether more collapse than that happens remains to be seen. It's you in the 1988s arguing that the Soviet Union won't collapse.

&#x200B;

>Western companies still do business in Russia, even if some of them are doing it incognito, but western parts don't just magically appear there.

Depends on what business. Food, medicine, clothes etcetera do not fall under sanctions. The western parts you're talking about that are relevant to military manufacturing are under sanctions, and they only get to Russia through black market traffick. That's more expensive, less volume and quality.

&#x200B;

>Russia has it's allies in Middle East that are vehemently anti-west, it has India which cannot afford to abandon Russia, it has China who might not like Russia at all,

Pretty much only Iran is actively supporting Russia, the other two are very much neutral on the issue. You should compare their early comments in the war, like the first month, to what they're saying now. It's a pretty enlightening read to where it's going.

&#x200B;

>there's also South America too.

There's actually a very recent condemnation by CELAC and EU combined on Russia about the war. Only Nicaragua and Cuba are on the sidelines.

&#x200B;

>Yeah, I think people did in fact have forgotten all of these things. Propaganda efforts? La Pen has genuine chance of winning next election, Slovakia has genuine chance of electing pro-russia leader, Hungary has pro-russia leader.

I see you've yourself fallen for the propaganda efforts then. **Le** Pen has been tauted as potential winner in the previous elections too by the propagandists, she lost by a landslide (a landslide in a two party system). Meloni was argued to be pro-Russia's stance by the propagandists when she got elected, see how that turned out. Slovakia is a multi-party coalition system, his party is polling at 19% of the votes, he may be the largest (still very much up in the air, it's close), but he has nowhere close to majority. Most other parties are pro-Ukraine. Again, you've lost yourself in the propaganda.

&#x200B;

>Trump election? Lol, dude there's 50-50 chance Americans would elect Trump again at this very moment.

Not really, but even if (and if he's not in jail by that point), that's besides the point. They've interfered and that's been proven. Biden is polling low for very much other reasons.

&#x200B;

>Ironic that you're telling me to get my head out of my sources while all you consume is positivity without any dose of skepticism.

Oh, I'm very much skeptic about lots of things I read. There's just nothing to be skeptic about on the outcome of the Russian invasion. Time it takes is the uncertainty.

It's just very clear to me you've a very selective knowledge on the subject and are missing a lot of critical information. Which are always left out in the propagandaists points.",1689707647.0,1689707154.0,t3_152nork,t1_jshipj7,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
