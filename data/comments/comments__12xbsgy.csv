When you have extreme power within your own system it’s hard to fully grasp what are the limits of that power and the fact that a person has risen so high can lead them to “trust their instincts” far more than they should. Putin has also quarantined himself extensively since Covid and he doesn’t have a phone or watch TV so all his info comes from his aids and those around him. He also notoriously keeps information from them and pushes back against anyone who tried to tell him “no.” 

Putin reads history and he thinks he has a place in history like Peter the Great. He seems to believe it was the Russians who won WWII on their own and that democracies are weak and don’t actually believe in things like self determination, market forces or shared values. Vladimir Putin is an isolated, narcissist who doesn’t understand history or how the West operates. He is dangerous and he is delusional but his delusions also make Russia weak and prone to serious errors. In the west there is often a common misconception that Russia is far stronger than they are. People will look at Russia’s current assets and strategic capabilities, assume rationality and then extrapolate Russian strength but this is fundamentally flawed. The lies, distortions and delusions have crept into every level of the Russian chain to the point where rationality is impossible which leads to continued Russian underperformance and Ukraine continually scoring victories that should be impossible.

ISW is an OSINT source who’s entire methodology consists of verifying Russian Millblogger statements and cross referencing Ukrainian **public** statements. This is intentional to not reveal anything that might give insights into what Ukraine is doing that isn’t already public knowledge. 

The media has been throwing the term “bridgehead” and irresponsibly citing ISW as the source and folks have been seizing on that as well as complaints of OpSec violation by ISW. This is **false**. 

This was the report in question (April 22 2023):

>	**Russian milbloggers have provided enough geolocated footage and textual reports to confirm that Ukrainian forces have established positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast as of April 22 though not at what scale or with what intentions.** Geolocated footage published by a Russian milblogger on April 22 shows that Ukrainian forces have established positions on the Dnipro River bank north of Oleshky (7km southwest of Kherson City) and advanced up to the northern outskirts of the settlement on the E97 highway, as well as west of Dachi (10km south of Kherson City).[1] This footage also indicates that Russian forces may not control islands in the Kinka and Chaika rivers less than half a kilometer north of the geolocated Ukrainian positions near the Antonivsky Bridge. **Russian milbloggers claimed on April 20 and 22 that Ukrainian forces have maintained positions in east bank Kherson Oblast** for weeks, established stable supply lines to these positions, and regularly conduct sorties in the area—all indicating a lack of Russian control over the area.[2] Another milblogger’s battle map claimed that Russian forces do not control some Dnipro River delta islands southwest of Kherson City as of April 22, suggesting possible Ukrainian advances on these islands.[3] Some milbloggers complained that the slow rate of Russian artillery fire due to the over-centralization of the Russian military command allowed Ukrainian forces to land on the east bank.[4] Russian forces may be prioritizing maintaining defenses in urban areas such as Oleshky and Nova Kakhovka, leaving the islands in the Dnipro River delta unmanned. The extent and intent of these Ukrainian positions remain unclear, as does Ukraine’s ability and willingness to maintain sustained positions in this area. **ISW is recoding territory on the east bank of the Dnipro River to Ukrainian-held only now because this is the first time ISW has observed reliable geolocated imagery of Ukrainian positions on the east bank along with multi-sourced Russian reports of an enduring Ukrainian presence there.***

Take note that not a single sentence contained the term “bridge head” .

Take note that ISW cited were they got this information from (Russian millbloggers)

Take note that ISW geolocated the footage to confirm the contents. 

Take note that ISW had *delayed* the report as clearly indicated by the fact they claim the Russian millbloggers have been talking about this for **days**.",1682391279.0,1682390024.0,t3_12xbsgy,t3_12xbsgy,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Ukraine had far-reaching plans to attack Moscow on the anniversary of the war but backed down at the request of the United States. This was reported by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/04/24/discord-leaks-moscow-strikes-ukraine/), based on leaked Pentagon documents.

The intentions made the authorities in Washington, who were secretly monitoring the Ukrainian plans, bite their nails. For some time now, Budanov has been hinting at attacks deep into Russian territory to make the war of Russian President Vladimir Putin more palpable in Russia. However, the United States is concerned about the repercussions of such audacity.

> According to the population of the occupied villages of Donetsk and Zaporozhye regions, Russian troops got a good punch in the teeth a couple of days ago and retreated from their positions, ie, they **retreated from the front**. Against the background of the enormous pressure by Russian troops pushing Bakhmut and Avdiivka, this news cannot make us rejoice. 

> Most of the Russian troops around there are deployed in the rear villages, live in the homes of rural residents, stay [with equipment] at administrative institutions, like thee village council buildings, schools, houses of culture, kindergartens, industrial buildings. But in order to eat, Russians go to shops and directly to the villagers. There, the men are heard chatting amongst themselves, and the locals have learned the Russian command ordered them to storm the positions in one of the sections near Velika Novosilka. But something went wrong with the attack—the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled their attack and **drove them back so that they had to flee, even further than their previously-occupied positions**. And although there were not too many losses, the **equipment was abandoned.** 

> Now, **Russian command** has arrived to the unit and there is a **major confrontation**—why did they leave their positions? Did they know what commands were given by the unit commanders? and where were the company and platoon commanders? 

> The first day after the unsuccessful offensive, the Russian invaders were angry. For almost a day, screams, swearing, drinking could be heard from their places of residence. Then everything was quiet. Now they say that the inspectors demand that they return / **recapture their positions in order to avoid reporting to Moscow about abandonment of their positions**, loss of artillery, since then many commanders would have bad marks on their records, removed, even lose rank.

> We hope that when the Armed Forces of Ukraine begin a full-scale offensive, there will be more such news. In the meantime, the Russians continue to equip additional defense lines in this direction, in particular along the Orlinskoye - Georgievka - Novopetrikovka line. Are they hoping to block the APU from advancing along the highway leading directly to Mariupol? But they are unlikely to succeed.

^(Sidenote, honestly, there’s someone else who actually holds the *most* power here, and that’s the House Appropriations Committee chair, Kay Granger of Texas.  And someone with review power, also from Texas, the Budget Cmte chair, Jodey Arrington. Rep Granger definitely aligns  with her fellow Texan, Rep McCaul.  Rep Granger visited Kyiv early in the war with the Mikes, indicating support. All her public stances has been in sponsoring bills or supporting more aid. Conversely, Rep Arrington has made several public statements that seem to imply he’s suspicious of where the funds go and wants accountability—this *could be* a cause for concern. To put it in context, it’s important to note that a suspicious eye towards spending is literally *his job*—he chairs the committee tasked with oversight of this money—his whole job is “monitoring programs funded outside of regular budget.”  So it’s difficult for me to distinguish whether this is the regular fastidious miserliness of the job, or an actual suspiciousness of prudence due to Carlson-inspired misinformation.

*For background*, some days ago, one of the UA milbloggers was looking at RF drone footage, he then rather recklessly geolocated the buildings, disclosing that RF seems to have left or at least thinned out around there, so UA could easily move in, due to its location and cover afforded there.  Russia is following these new UA milbloggers...  Well, UA *had* moved in.  And he was right, Russia had moved out of there, and had even moved their artillery out of the region.  They then sent RF guys to check it out, see if it was properly mined etc—they report back saying that UA is there on Left Bank, in a modestly large number, but was the same clump of buildings the UA milblogger put on blast.  Artillery comes back up closer, and fight is on.  UA had been operating quietly prior to this.  Doing island hopping, quietly bringing over equipment for later use. Then,  I S W puts it on blast that UA is on left bank, sorta tanking the operation before it has gotten off the ground, because command structure of RF is now looking at it.  If UA can get everyone to be quiet, feign pulling back, then Russian will move that artillery back, too, and UA could carry on their mission.",1682381509.0,1682376739.0,t3_12xbsgy,t3_12xbsgy,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

They later expanded to any Russian who wants to resist, showing how to sabotage military equipment, and then they PAY YOU if you send in video that have [which is why I’m pretty sure it’s the GUR, not actually Crimeans, who frankly, don’t have that kind of money—it’s the only channel that pays, everyone else asks for donations].  They’ve paid folks still in the military districts back in Russia.  But they’ve posted numerous sabotage videos, the vast majority is in Crimea or Kherson, but I’ve seen a few other places.  They show how to disable tank, sabotage your armored truck, etc.  Anything that can do to sabotage—poisoning the rations to give the men intestinal issues, knocking them out of play a couple of days, will even get you a financial transfer.  Locals also participate, but their ability is limited and it appears, from videos, to be teenage boys, and apparently, they like train tracks...

They also have bounties on the heads of Russians, and especially, on collaborators heads.  When have had success, they boldly post the names of those killed (had success in poisoning soldiers in hospitals in Crimea), their rank, unit, when and where killed.  Occasionally, their photos, also.

But most important is the collaborators.  They’ve taken credit for multiple ones killed in Kherson.  Most high profile was that Dep Gauleiter was killed in Genichesk, in what was a road accident, then shot, after been after him for months.  They taunt their targets, publishing their plate number or last known location, (then a few days later, something like, “we see you’ve changed cars, you’re now in *new plate number*)
reminding readers of the bounty.  They do this to occupation ‘authorities,’ tease repeatedly that targeting them, tease that some in their sphere are part of Atesh, that their days are numbered.  They’ve also been after Saldo for months, constantly constantly trying to target him, but he has thus far alluded them.  

(So basically, Atesh is a how-to channel, with random warnings and bravado, cryptic humblebrags mixed with evidence audacious sabotage, intel for the AFU to check out certain columns, and lots and lots of taunting of Saldo.  They have several secured alternative platforms that they require folks to use for interaction, sending evidence, getting funds, etc.  Again, it’s the GUR, I’m sure.)

I think that after the fall of the Soviet Union, the world SHOULD have coalesced around the USA and Europe as the dominant influences, but Putin, once he solidified power at home and put all his friends in place, making money and beholden to him and only him...was ready to really get to work.

I think Putin has been a very large part in stoking the culture wars in the US. I think that if it wasn't for Putin and his army of trolls on the internet, bribes to the right people (James Comey, November 2016 is my prime suspect here...making that announcement) Trump doesn't get elected President and in a similar way, he helped make Brexit happen.

Biden visited last month, astonishing everyone.  Then Putin visited right at edge. 

The Russians have spent several months creating massive defenses, in preparation for an upcoming counteroffensive.  Steady flows of incoming transport, equipment, men have been recorded along about six routes. We haven’t seen the Russians in that posture yet, but it expected that they learned from previously mistakes and are prepared for a fierce fight.  (They way they corrected their Kharkiv rout, to be an orderly Kherson retreat—we know they can improve on the defense front...just don’t know how much...)

In the meantime, they’ve toned down the drone attacks on random infrastructure, but turned up attacks at other places.  They’ve gained ground in the Kremmina-Svatove area.  The last week, Ukraine has pushed Russians in Kreminna back a bit, to their previous fortifications. 

The Russians poured absolutely massive efforts in Bakhmut, and as a result, have made progress there, with CNN estimating its 80% controlled by Russians, (other sources say 90%, one said 65%).  Wagner had to eventually be propped up with other formations.  Who’ve had more success, but still, they greatly outnumber Ukraine forces but have neither encircled nor completely control city.

A disgusting video came out with the beheading of a still-alive UA soldier.  Even RF seemed disturbed tbh.  Wagner didn’t want to take credit, and the Kremlin said would investigate.  This was after another video showed the murder of a POW.  UA says there’s other, not yet publicly disclosed, such videos.  These are war crimes.  Russia is a tiny tiny bit more nervous over war crimes, since Putin was charged by ICC—which rattled the Kremlin.  Their only posture was to pretend to be perplexed by it. And say ICC has no jurisdiction (that part is accurate).

Massive leaks by a naive narcissist in USA called into question some of the allied support.

China has, in the meantime, found various ways to position itself on Russia’s side.

Down at Avdiivka, the Russians have had less success than Bakhmut.  They’ve put enormous efforts there, as well, to little effect.

Southwest of that, Makiivka, which was 100% emptied months ago and has been a contested spot ever since, has recently become a hotspot again. 

The Russians took an extended pause from Vulgedar, reequipped, and are expected to restart that front.  

Down in Mariupol, there were a couple of weeks where there’d be incoming.  It’s not entirely clear what targets were and levels of success, as the residents are not able to freely move about to observe and report.  But it was concluded that air defenses were taken out, because by week two, jets had to be scrambled from Rostov, repeatedly.  Since then, the Russians have bragged about reopening the port and transferring military equipment through there.

Over in Zaporizhye, there has been continued missions to hit behind enemy lines and UA have pushed the Russians back, there, somewhat.  

The Russians are anticipating that UA will start counteroffensive there, as its sparsely defended, and have made lines of defense down in rear regions.  They’ve fortified ZNPP even further, and are trying to send the civilians away from adjoining town, commandeering their apartments.

Over in Kherson, the Russians have thinned out a bit, which is allowing UA recon and sabatoge groups to gain a foothold.

In last few months, UA has acquired or been promised artillery, transport and equipment that will be game-changers.  That part isn’t my area of expertise, so someone else will have to fill you in there.",1682360265.0,1682359874.0,t3_12xbsgy,t1_jhjkc9b,,1,65,0,65,0,0,

As long as western political will holds (and hopefully it should), then Ukraine is better to drag this out and start this later rather than rush into it.

* Ukraine has closed the gap on the artillery war with Russia by using precision western weapons
* Ukraine is getting more troops trained up by NATO standards

Serious answer now: No one outside of Ukraine’s high command really knows. There is so much uncertainty in war and for obvious reasons the counter offensive is perhaps Ukraine’s most closely guarded secrets. Western military experts generally think it’s at least one to two months away but those experts also aren’t aware of the training timelines, the delivery of key weapons or what the Russian forces will look like in the future so even they can only make educated guesses.

And then that’s exactly what didn’t actually happen.

It actually is exactly what happened. Ukraine did not have the ability to assault Kharkiv and Kherson at the same time, so they made the important decision to attack them one at a time. They initiated probing attacks at Kherson but had to wait for the Kharkiv counteroffensive to conclude before they take it on for real. The US intelligence assessments where they recommended scaling back Ukraine's ambitions for the scope of their summer/fall 2022 counteroffensive were completely real.

The deception was in the place of the counterattack. Or probably more realistically, the deception was in getting Russia to think that Ukraine would commit to any particular place at all. In reality, Ukraine was keeping a small but highly mobile, fiercely armed mechanized and SOF group transferable to deploy to virtually anywhere they detected a crack along 2,000 kilometers of front. That was the true genius of what they pulled off, because it enabled them to attack Kharkiv when nobody thought they could even a force into that poorly manned area so quickly.

But that's all kind of beside the point. Deception is always going to be a part of this. Where civilian observers make mistakes is in their attempt to draw patterns from one act of deception to another. US and Ukrainian intelligence did certain things to trick audiences. They are not doing the same techniques to do it again. If civilians like you and me can reliably figure it out, then it is definitionally a *terrible* act of deception.

By and large, if you think you can tell what's about to happen based on news coverage, then that means you almost certainly are not exposed to the information you would need to have in order to know what's going to happen.
