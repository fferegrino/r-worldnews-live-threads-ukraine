Day 121 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling and missile strikes still continue, and for the second day in a row they started their shelling/missile strikes earlier than usual. Again they started at 10pm, instead of their usual 11pm, and they shell us more than usual like this. First shelling started at 10pm, then a missile strike at 11:30pm, and then some more shelling at 11:58pm.

This time all of the explosions sounded pretty close to us. Shelling from yesterday destroyed some university‚Äôs sports complex, it‚Äôs a military target according to Russia. We even got the photos from right after the shelling occurred too, as usual, not a single military object in sight, just some big empty halls with broken walls and roof.

This time they said that ‚Äú**Kyiv decided to raise the dead from their graves, and test the plague on Odesa residents.**‚Äù They are saying that we want to test a plague from 19th century on the residents of Odesa. Who even comes up with this?

I‚Äôm not even joking, this is literally what they said, how can government officials even say stuff like this?

Russian troops in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia were left wounded after a goat set off a boobytrap of grenades they had planted.

Ukraine's chief intelligence directorate said the Kremlin forces had installed pinned grenades around a local hospital in village of Kinski Rozdory when an escaped goat from a nearby farm wandered towards the area.

The animal¬†triggered tripwires set up by the soldiers and instigated a chain reaction.

At least 40 soldiers were injured due to the explosion.

In a statement, Ukraine's chief intelligence directorate said: ""As a result of the goat's 'chaotic' movements, the animal 'disposed of' several grenades.

""As a result of a chain reaction, several (Russians) sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity.""

The fate of the goat is not known.

Russia‚Äôs power grid told Litgrid, its counterpart in Lithuania, that it has canceled the planned isolation operation test of the electricity network of the Kaliningrad exclave, Litgrid has said.

The test, which was due to begin on Saturday, would have involved Kaliningrad region disconnecting from the common grid of Baltic states, Russia and Poland for eight hours to test its capacity to operate independently, Litgrid said. Three similar tests were conducted in 2019-2021, it said.

Baltic states expect to decouple from the common grid in 2025, necessitating Kaliningrad, sandwiched between NATO members Poland and¬†Lithuania, to operate on its own.

Lithuania‚Äôs president told Reuters on Wednesday his country is ready for Russia to try to kick it off the grid imminently, as a punishment for blocking cargo sanctioned by the European Union from traveling from mainland Russia to the exclave.

Bulgaria's parliament has lifted a veto that has blocked European Union membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania.¬†

The move was approved by politicians on Friday and raises fresh hope that the EU can press on with its expansion plans in the Western Balkans amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.¬†

France made the proposal this week to resolve an ethnic and cultural dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia that was the source of the veto.¬†

Under the proposal, North Macedonia would have to recognise in its constitution that Bulgarians are one of the country's constitutive ethnicities.¬†

North Macedonia said Friday that several topics need clarification before it will agree to the deal.¬†

On Thursday, Ukraine's ambition to join the bloc passed the first major hurdle as¬†EU leaders approved¬†it as a candidate for membership.

* To the north, in the Kharkiv area, the war remains stalemated. russia takes a barn, Ukraine take it back the next day.  The russian actions here are just to threaten Kharkiv and keep Ukraine troops occupied. 

* In the Donbas area, russia took several important small towns which allows them to threaten the Ukrainian supply lines into Lysychans'k and Severodonetsk.  It is a possibility that within the next few hours or days Ukraine will begin a retreat from these cities.  

As russia takes control over their new supply of washing machines, war-crime opportunities, and goats, Ukraine has extracted a heavy toll in blood and equipment which is, and always has been the Ukrainian strategy in the Donbas.  

Do expect the trolls to be insufferable on this, but they haven't had anything to celebrate in such a long time that they will embrace even a pyrrhic victory.

* In the Kherson area to the south most twitter sources are enforcing a blackout on discussing movements as Ukraine attempts to position itself to retake Kherson. Before the blackout Ukraine was making slow, steady advances that put pressure on russia's supply lines.  Some twitter accounts still report heavy fighting in the area with Ukraine continuing to liberate small towns on the road to isolating Kherson.

That‚Äôs according to the¬†Prosecutor General's Office, Ukrinform reports.

Prosecutors with the Kyiv region‚Äôs office filed an indictment within a special pre-trial inquiry of a serviceman with the Russian armed forces for violating the laws and customs of war (Part 2, Article 28, Part 1, Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

The investigation established that in March 2022, the accused, operating as part of the 234th assault regiment of the Russian armed forces, entered the town of Irpin, Kyiv region. Together with other Russian servicemen, he placed military hardware in the backyard of a local household.

While in Irpin, the invaders searched for Ukrainian servicemen, territorial defense volunteers, and law enforcement officers. The suspect, along with other Russian servicemen, took nine local men hostage.

""The prisoners were beaten with rifle butts and deprived of food and water. They were threatened with murder and imitated execution,"" the PGO said.

As Ukrinform reported earlier, another Russian serviceman was charged in absentia with torture of a civilian family and looting in the village of Lukashivka, Chernihiv region.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 June 2022
 
- Ukrainian forces have announced that the pilot of a Russian Su-25 FROGFOOT ground attack aircraft shot down on 17 June was captured shortly afterwards. The pilot has confessed to being a former Russian air force Major, who had taken employment as a Wagner military contractor and had flown several missions during the conflict.


- The use of retired personnel, now working as Wagner contractors, to conduct close air support missions indicates that the Russian air force likely is struggling to support the invasion of Ukraine with sufficient aircrew. This is likely due to a combination of Russia's insufficient numbers of suitably trained personnel and its combat losses.


- Whilst conducting his missions, the Russian pilot reportedly used commercial GPS devices rather than Russian military navigation equipment. This likely indicates that Wagner aircraft are older models of the Su-25 and that the Russian air force is not providing Wagner with up-to-date avionics equipment.

In the coming weeks, Russian offensive operations are likely to stall, whether or not Russian forces capture the Sievierodonetsk-Lysychansk area.

The relevant statement was made by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in the Russian offensive campaign¬†assessment¬†of June 23, 2022, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

According to the ISW, this will grant Ukrainian forces the opportunity to launch ‚Äúprudent counteroffensives‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Kremlin‚Äôs ideological fixation on the capture of Sievierodonetsk, much like the earlier siege of Azovstal, will likely be to the ultimate detriment of Russian capabilities in future advances in Ukraine,‚Äù the ISW experts noted.

Based on their estimates, the loss of Sievierodonetsk is a loss for Ukraine in the sense that any terrain captured by Russian forces is a loss, but the battle of Sievierodonetsk will not be a decisive Russian victory.

Russian troops have made substantial gains in the Sievierodonetsk-Lysychansk area in recent days. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have fundamentally accomplished their objective in the battle by slowing down and degrading Russian forces.

Ukrainian troops have succeeded for weeks in drawing substantial quantities of Russian personnel, weapons, and equipment into the area and have likely degraded Russian forces‚Äô overall capabilities while preventing Russian forces from focusing on more advantageous axes of advance.

A reminder that, in the Sievierodonetsk direction, Russian troops seized such settlements as Loskutivka and Rai-Oleksandrivka. The enemy continues assault operations to gain control over Syrotyne and is preparing to force a crossing over the Siverskyi Donets.

 EU summit resolutionThe Heads of States and Governments of EU countries, who started a high-level meeting in Brussels on June 23, 2022, recognized Russia as a country attempting to weaponize food in its war against Ukraine and solely responsible for the global food security crisis.

The relevant¬†statement¬†was made in the EU summit resolution published on the website of the European Council, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
‚ÄúRussia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked. The European Council urges Russia to immediately stop targeting agricultural facilities and removing cereals, and to unblock the Black Sea, in particular the port of Odesa, so as to allow the export of grain and commercial shipping operations,‚Äù the document reads.

The European Council expressed support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in this regard. EU leaders stressed that sanctions against Russia allow the free flow of agricultural and food products and the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

In addition, the European Council expressed support for the efforts on the Solidarity Lanes to facilitate food exports from Ukraine via different land routes and EU ports.

EU leaders called on the Commission and the Member States, building in particular on the FARM initiative as well as UN and G7 initiatives, to step up their efforts, namely to support developing countries to reorient their supply chains; to develop sustainable food production, strengthen agricultural productivity and agri-business capacity on the African continent; to work on initiatives together with international partners to support the development of manufacturing capacity of inputs in developing countries, in particular sustainable fertilizers.

A reminder that over 20 million tonnes of grain has been blocked at Ukrainian sea ports due to the Russian armed aggression.

Ukraine Army stifles enemy offensive near Borivske ‚Äì General Staff

Russian invaders were conducting the offensive near Myrna Dolyna, and relevant battles are underway. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military successfully stifled Russia‚Äôs offensive operations near Borivske.
The relevant statement was made by General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook as of 06:00 a.m., June 24, 2022, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Russian troops continue offensive operations in the Eastern operational zone in order to gain full control over Donetsk Region and Luhansk Region, maintain a land corridor to the temporarily occupied Crimea, block Ukraine‚Äôs shipping routes in the north-western part of the Black Sea, hold a grip on the occupied areas of Kherson Region and Zaporizhzhia Region, and attempt to create favorable conditions for the resumption of the offensive on Mykolaiv Region.

The Russian military continue to launch missile strikes on Ukraine‚Äôs critical civil infrastructure facilities.

In the Volyn and Polissia directions, the situation remained unchanged. Belarusian forces are expanding engineering and fortification structures within the defense lines at the border with Ukraine and EU countries.

In the Siverskyi direction, Russian troops opened fire on civil and military infrastructure near Sumy Region‚Äôs settlements, such as Tovstodubove, Bachivsk, Hlukhiv and Manukhivka.

In the Kharkiv direction, Russian invaders launched artillery strikes on the city of Kharkiv, Staryi Saltiv, Korobochkine, Pechenihy, Dementiivka and Zolochiv. Enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups intensified activities.

In the Sloviansk direction, Russian troops fired at civil infrastructure facilities near such settlements as Bohorodychne, Krasnopillia, Kurulka, Chervone, Ridne and Chervona Poliana with artillery.

In the Sievierodonetsk direction, the enemy used tanks, mortars, cannon and rocket artillery near such settlements as Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk, Bila Hora, Vovchoiarivka, Spirne and Berestove. Russian troops launched air strikes on Lysychansk and Borivske. Battles for Sievierodonetsk are underway.

In the Bakhmut direction, Russian invaders opened fire on Ukrainian positions near Mykolaivka, Berestove and Novoluhanske. The enemy is attempting to improve its tactical position and put the available connection routes under fire control.

In the Novopavlivka direction, Russian occupiers opened fire near such settlements as Antonivka, Vuhledar and Zolota Nyva.

The Ukrainian military revealed and eliminated enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups. The remaining Russian personnel ran away in panic.

In the Avdiivka, Kurakhove and Zaporizhzhia directions, Russian troops did not take active actions. In order to prevent Ukrainian forces from sending reserve units to other directions, the enemy opened fire on Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, Umanske, Vesele, Novobakhmutivka, Huliaipilske, Bilohiria and Staroukrainka.

Russian occupiers are attempting to demine the area of Berdiansk Port as part of logistic support efforts.

In the Southern Bug direction, Russian troops did not take active actions. The enemy is keeping the defense and attempting to conduct counterbattery activities. The Russian military launched an air strike on Ukrainian positions near Bila Krynytsia. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian aviation struck enemy clusters in response in certain areas.

A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that London will be the first city to be bombed in the event of another world war.

Speaking on Russia's Channel 1 television, Andrey Gurulyov, a State Duma politician, said the UK capital would be hit first if the blockade of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad led to war.

‚ÄúWe'll destroy the entire group of enemy's space satellites during the first air operation,"" he said.

""No-one will care if they are American or British, we would see them all as NATO.

""Second, we'll mitigate the entire system of anti-missile defence, everywhere and 100%.

""Third, we certainly won't start from Warsaw, Paris or Berlin.

""The first to be hit will be London.

""It's crystal clear that the threat to the world comes from the Anglo-Saxons.""

That's true in most contexts, but something to keep in mind is that artillery-based attrition warfare is a different animal that does not expose the attackers to the same disproportionate losses.

The most analogous battle I can think of is the WW1 Battle of Verdun. In 1915, a year and a half of warfare had ground down orthodox maneuver operations into the slogging quagmire of trenches, artillery and machine guns. The Germans had spent their maneuvering capabilities and decided to try to beat the Entente by exhausting their manpower and industrial resources. The target they choose to initiate this new attritional strategy was the fortified town of Verdun, the sight of historic French-German battles in decades past, which the German General Staff predicted France would reinforce at all costs if it was attacked.

Germany did not truly intend to conquer the area of Verdun. Instead, they wanted to deliberately suck as many French troops into this morale-significant target zone and bomb it with artillery for months on end, in order to degrade the overall quality of the French Army. And, to an extent, this strategy actually worked. It was deeply unpopular with most of the German generals, but the top dude who came up with the plan, General Falkenhyn, actually did produce a greater number of French casualties than German, even though they were regularly attacking very well fortified French forts. German casualties throughout the 10 months of fighting at Verdun were 150,000 dead and another 100,000 non-dead casualties. French casualties were 160,000 dead and another 215,000 non-dead casualties. 

Was it overall a good strategy for Germany? LOL, no. It was not at all worth the cost to their own material and manpower. But it heavily battered the French Army, to the point where they were on the verge of breaking by late 1916. The even worse casualty battle, the Battle of Somme, was prosecuted primarily by the British in Summer 1916, and the reason the British agreed to initiate that massive offensive was specifically to relieve pressure on the French.

Before anyone leaps to point out the many differences between Seversdonetsk and Verdun, please let me concede right here that there are a ton of differences. For one, it was a much, much larger and longer battle -- it went from February to December 1916, and it involved millions of troops. Two, leadership quality back then was obviously much less informed. Both Ukraine and Russia's generals are well aware of historical battles like Verdun and Stalingrad, and they are smart enough to understand what the enemy's overall grand strategic vision is within a matter of weeks. 

I am also not saying that Russia's attempt to turn Seversdonetsk into a miniature Verdun *worked*, OK? But I think Russia's overall strategy in the Donbass for the last two months clearly mirrors the German General Staff's strategy at Verdun in 1916. They were clearly hoping that Ukraine would reinforce the Donbass sector of the fighting and refuse to withdraw, giving Russia a chance to destroy some of Ukraine's best equipped and trained troops through artillery pot-shooting.  

With that said, when we talk about the narrow, specific question of which side took more casualties in the Donbass, I think battles like Verdun can inform the guesswork. Ukraine reported for about a week that they were taking 300 dead per day and about 700 additional wounded, while inflicting an estimated 150 dead and another 200 or so estimated wounded on the Russians. They also reported that Russia was bombarding them with an estimated 10 artillery tubes and launchers for every tube or launcher that the Ukrainians could fire back with. They also reported that Russia was attacking with smaller recon forces instead of massed armored convoys, and that the small Russian squad and platoon-sized forces would fall back as soon as they encountered resistance so that artillery could saturate the zone of resistance. With those reported numbers, those reported tactics, and those reported artillery figures, it is not out of the realm of belief that Russia was inflicting greater manpower losses on the Ukrainians than they were taking, at least for limited periods of intense artillery fire.",False,1656086320.0,t3_vjfcyr,t1_idkexs5,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

* A delay is when a force under pressure trades space for time by slowing down the enemy‚Äôs
momentum and inflicting maximum damage on enemy forces without becoming decisively
engaged. In delays, units yield ground to gain time while retaining flexibility and freedom of
action to inflict the maximum damage on enemy forces.
* Withdraw is to disengage from an enemy force and move in a direction away from the enemy.

force to preserve the withdrawing force or release it for a new mission.

It's not so much being strong on defense as pro intervention in order to push the interests of America and American corporations.

And while autonomous systems have come a long way they are still no substitute for the human ability to make decisions like whether to attack, retreat or simply wait for a better opportunity to strike. Humans still need to be in the loop for complex decision making.

Also everyone seems to forget that military technology is always a game of punch, counter punch where one advancement that's successful means everyone looks how to counter it. Just like naval weapon systems such as the [Phalanx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS) and the [rolling airframe missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile) were designed to counter the danger from anti ship missiles.

Right now militaries around the world are looking into not only how to better jam communications with drones but also to destroy the smaller ones we've seen used more extensively in this war. Right now the only reason small drones aren't being shot out of the air en masse is because air defense systems are looking for much larger targets, their radars or infrared sensors are not calibrated to find them and their missiles are not designed to target them. There is nothing stopping anyone from putting together a radar and optical system specially designed for close range location of small drones and then using much smaller missiles, or maybe even just ammunition from a gun, to destroy them without costing what it takes to destroy an airplane.

There will be counters to these small drones, we'll have to wait to see how effective they are but they are no doubt being developed as we speak. Yes war will see increasing use of new technology, it always has, but we're still a long way from seeing a battlefield without people on it.

people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and   
preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but   
one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the   
bill‚Äìbroking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance   
in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher   
bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss‚Äîfor  
 as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market   
then‚Äîand ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in   
our part of the country, to fifty members at half‚Äìa‚Äìcrown a head, the   
winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to   
have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being   
disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady   
with a hand‚Äìbasket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the   
stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny   
short‚Äîas it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to   
endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will be  
 long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,   
but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety‚Äìtwo. I have understood that it   
was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the   
water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which  
 she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation   
at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go   
'meandering' about the world. It was in vain to represent to her that   
some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this   
objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and   
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us

https://news.lockheedmartin.com/lockheed-martin-awarded-1-billion-contract-for-precision-fires-all-weather-rocket

1-billion contract for 11000 rockets (9000 actual rockets, 2000 practice rockets), so yeah, 100k-ish for this contract.

This is an underestimate, because it includes 2000 practice rockets (which are far cheaper). Also, you need the ""pods"" (rockets can't be used by themselves, they're reloaded / unloaded in steel pods 6-at-a-time). The pods can be reused however (but need to be sent to the factory IIRC for reloading, not in the field.)

So the true cost is somewhere above $150k and under $600k per rocket, depending on how much supporting infrastructure you want to count as ""part of the rocket"".",False,1656128666.0,t3_vjfcyr,t1_idnc5xf,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

According to the Former Deputy Commander (Operations) at RAF Air Command:

https://www.aerosociety.com/news/ukraine-time-to-fast-track-front-line-fighter-pilot-training/

>A: Conversion to a front line combat aircraft for a new pilot would usually take about six months to become limited combat ready. However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks. If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-

>A: The more familiar the type the easier the conversion. However, Western types are fairly user-friendly (especially the F- series) and relatively simple to grasp the basics. The stick, throttle and handling basics are simple transferable skills. Using the radar, avionics, weapons and defensive aids is the area of focus and teaching the basics of employment of those shouldn't take too long to achieve a level capable of matching or even overmatching the apparent poor Russian proficiency.",False,1656123340.0,t3_vjfcyr,t1_idn1kk9,,3,2,0,2,0,0,
