Day 204 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It look like today was an actual quiet day, we had no shelling, and there were no missiles fired at us, or at least no missiles fired at us *yet*. If they don’t do a missile strike, then this will be a first quiet day in I don’t even know how long, we had missiles fired at us every day for months with no pauses at this point. There weren’t even that many air raid alerts today, a couple did happen, and they were caused by enemy aviation activity across the border and in Crimea.

Those explosions at 11:30pm yesterday were indeed missiles, and they happened with no prior notice, with no air raid alert before they already landed in Kharkiv. Thankfully their missiles are garbage, so this time they hit a forest, a small one, near residential buildings, there were no casualties and only some limited damage to cars/buildings.

Those past few days Russians were very happy with destruction of our critical infrastructure, they were saying “take them to the Stone Age!” Well, now they are the ones being taken to the Stone Age, just a couple of hours ago Valuyki in Belgrod oblast was shelled, and had their substation hit, so now they are with no electricity or water. Now they are in Stone Age just like they wanted, congrats.
 
It’s laughable that they think that they can hit our infrastructure and not get their hit anything in return. Though this one town in particular might have been hit because they use it as a firing position, Russians were posting videos with their town being shelled, but those videos also caught their own MLRS firing in our direction, and it was being fired *extremely close* to civilian infrastructure, like within a hundred meters from apartment buildings, so it’s no wonder they got return fire. 

There’s quite a lot of fire on their side of the border, in general, in the past few days, like that Russian border checkpoint that was destroyed today, and there’s much more stuff that is only posted in Russian local telegram groups. It’s nice seeing them finally get shelled in return, after they were so happy about shelling Kharkiv all this time.",False,1663286465.0,t3_xemjbz,t3_xemjbz,,0,228,0,228,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 September 2022

- Ukrainian forces continue to consolidate their control of newly liberated areas of Kharkiv Oblast. Russian forces have largely withdrawn from the area west of the Oskil River.

- The way in which Russian forces have withdrawn in the last week has varied. Some units retreated in relatively good order and under control, while others fled in apparent panic.

- High-value equipment abandoned by retreating Russian forces included capabilities essential to enable Russia's artillery-centric style of warfare. Amongst these are at least one ZOOPARK counter-battery radar and at least one IV14 artillery command and control vehicle. Such abandonment highlights the disorganised retreat of some Russian units and likely localised breakdowns in command and control.",False,1663223772.0,t3_xemjbz,t3_xemjbz,,0,104,0,104,1,0,

**Pyotr Akopov: ""The Offensive of Russia and the New World""**

""A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kyiv), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to fight for it with the Atlantic bloc.

Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is morally ready for them""",False,1663264314.0,t3_xemjbz,t3_xemjbz,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

Everyone says it's Putin consolidating power, but every one of these people I hear about is a Putin ally, most on the sanctions list, so is it attacks meant to send Putin a message?

The methods sound so Russian - fell out of a window, or healthy one minute, having a stroke the next (which sounds like poison). 

So the methods certainly feel top-down, but the targets seem like bottom-up, like they're aiming for Putin.

Is there a third faction? An anti-Putin force near the top, that could be responsible for this? A Game of Thrones is going on perhaps? It would delight me to no end (well, I don't like murder, but you feel me) if there are people at the top who are chipping away at Putin and barely disguising that it's a targeted attack of his allies and this is a sort of silent coup.

I buy this over the idea that this is Putin himself wiping out his allies to somehow consolidate power.

Not to mention that these are all supposedly 'Putin Buds' so this is making him look weak. Dugin's daughter, taken out in a way that was almost certainly intended to take out Dugin as well if he didn't catch another ride that night. 

I'm having a hard time buying any of this is 'top down' stuff that is typical from Russia, because of the scenarios, unless I'm missing something, but the MO's are VERY typical Russian, so I think it IS Russians carrying out these assassinations. I'm just perplexed as to which ones.

I think that expresses how fucked up Russian politics are, because you can't even tell who is targeting who. Often an assassination is meant to 'send a message', but everyone here kills everyone all the time because it's mafia politics, so we're all sitting here speculating on what exact reason dude X had for having a stroke or falling out of a window or whatever, very suddenly.",1663220478.0,1663219364.0,t3_xemjbz,t3_xemjbz,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Thank you for contacting me regarding the aid package for Ukraine. Input from fellow Texans significantly informs my decision-making and empowers me to better represent the state.

On May 19, 2022, I, along with a majority of my Senate Republican colleagues, voted in favor of the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, which subsequently became law. (P.L. 117-128).

I believe that it is vital to the United States' national security for our Ukrainian allies to counter Putin's aggression. It is Vladimir Putin's objective to reassemble the USSR, and his further invasion of Ukraine is a significant component of his plan. A reconstituted Soviet Union would prove catastrophic to American security and would undermine global stability. Our adversaries would become stronger, as America becomes weaker. Our enemies have already become emboldened by President Biden's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I believe that as Putin saw that withdrawal, he decided that he could invade Ukraine without consequences. I believe that Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has also reached a similar decision in terms of Taiwan.

The impact of a successful Russian takeover of Ukraine will be felt on a domestic scale, and I believed that voting for this package was imperative to America's best interest. If Putin prevails, Americans filling up their cars with gas or trying to heat their homes in the winter, will suffer. This package also included almost $9.0 billion to replenish U.S. stockpiles, which accounted for nearly a quarter of the bill. A successful Ukrainian invasion by Putin will embolden Xi to invade Taiwan. As a result, China would seize control of the global supply of semiconductors, which would be catastrophic for domestic supply chains and American national security.

President Biden has failed on issues here at home that Texans and Americans rightly care about and we should fix. Right now we have a raging border crisis, skyrocketing inflation, gas prices at record highs, and a baby formula shortage that has left parents all over the country scrambling to try to feed their babies. We can't let the fact that Biden has created massive domestic and economic failures cause us to ignore threats to the United States' national security posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

citizens employed in production with  
a significant share in the already weak  
Russian economy will only lead to her  
weakening.  
The employer will be obliged to leave the  
persons pulled out of enterprises / commercial  
organizations with the preservation  
of wages, moreover, as practice with  
the coronovirus has shown, out of their  
own  
pocket. - Enterprises will either lay off  
employees or simply go bankrupt and close.  
Also, the vast majority of people who  
have undergone mobilization will not create  
the effect that is assigned to it. These  
persons lack two main factors for the infantry  
\- experience and motivation. And in society,  
due to the decrease in approval for the  
conduct of hostilities in Ukraine, the  
already high protest activity will increase.  
All this together can lead to irreparable  
consequences. Citizens walking, eating  
and drinking in the peaceful cities of  
Russia are now generally indifferent to  
what is happening in Ukraine, but when it  
affects them, coupled with the complication of  
the financial situation of the latter,  
there will be a very nuclear mixture.  
In addition, mobilized persons, not from  
among the reserve, will not strengthen the front  
one iota, even put a million people under  
bayonets. Only the experience and motivation  
of personnel, framed by competent command, can  
change something.

Tucker Carlson just stopped pretending and became a Russian propagandist.    
And we made a video about it… 😎

https://twitter.com/VsimPohuy/status/1570063998506176515

This is a production by [Ukrainian Toronto Television](https://www.youtube.com/c/UkrainianTorontoTelevision) who have had at least one other video featured in these threads. They highlight how Carlson is taking a perverse delight in being a contrarian and how how is both echoing and being echoed by Russian TV channels. 

My personal opinion is that the video is let down by the presenter (Mark Kaplan) talking at a frantic pace without letup for nearly 16 minutes and they don't adequately refute the deliberate ambiguities, specious speculations, dubious deductions, bullshit bloviations, falsehoods, fabrications, and confabulations of Carlson. For example, when addressing Carlson's faux bemusement and contrived concern of the claims around Ukrainian bio-labs they could have assembled an array of fact checks from other sources such as the BBC ([Ukraine war: Fact-checking Russia's biological weapons claims](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60711705)) that would substantially reveal the reality distortions that Carlson trades in.

I also disagree with the thesis that Carlson is a Russian asset. It is the advertisers who are paying him to attract the demographic that convince themselves that all misfortune is the design and responsibility of others. 

If I have piqued your curiosity about this video and the channel behind it you can find it here: [TUCKER CARLSON AND PUTIN ARE LOSING THE WAR IN UKRAINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARlYgR1S7jU). Don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE 😀",False,1663237276.0,t3_xemjbz,t3_xemjbz,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

From the point they approached   Balakliia on 6 September until they took Izium on 10 September the Ukrainians had the Russians totally wrong-footed, they simply didn't have forces capable of opposing armor and didn't at any point during that time mount any sort of meaningful delaying action or defence.  The clever choice to just keep rolling around settlements that might be defended and penetrate further and further meant the russian defenders of settlements were repeatedly cut off and the spearhead of the advance kept way outperforming expectations and overrunning the obvious russian rallying points before they could bring up reinforcements and get them organised.

Seriously it was almost ridiculous..there was a point from 9-10 September, the news went from 'Ukraine is approaching Kupiansk and there's heavy fighting, the ISW are predicting they may take Kupiansk in 72 hours, if they successfully take Kupiansk they will be able to cut off the supply line to the major Russian base in Izium' to 'Ukraine has surrounded  *Izium* and is pursuing russians fleeing east', in the space of 12 hours! That was stunning to even read, for the russian defenders it must have been nightmarish, they went from being in a quiet sector 70-80km behind the front line to having to organise a retreat under heavy fire in the space of a day..
 

For people who are into military history it was a fucking jizz session, it was a textbook, brilliantly executed example of what armor and mechanised infantry can do and are meant to do when they are properly coordinated and well led. Rather than using it as a sledgehammer against strong points or getting bogged down, they kept moving  so aggressively that they were constantly inside the russian lines of defence before they could form and just went further and further until the defenders were and strategic and psychological mess and totally collapsed.

When that strategy works as flawlessly as it did, it causes incredibly lopsided results, because there is never really a pitched battle, just a series of half formed defensive lines that get overrun and destroyed before they can get dug in, infantry who are totally cut off and captured without a fight and psychologically destroyed, panicked troops who are obliterated in the process of trying to flee or redeploy- if you're the attacker in that sort of campaign the last thing you want to do is stop and fight, the point is to avoid the pitched battle and the strongpoints and anything which might delay your advance and keep penetrating until the defenders brains melt.

They're OK vehicles, not fantastic but OK. The model in those pictures is getting a bit old though, the ones we used were leased from Finland I believe and were rather worn already. We actually served alongside some BTR- equipped Ukrainians back then, so I had a chance to compare the vehicles a bit.

The Sisu (or PASI) has advantages in reliability, speed, ease of handling, and crew comfort. You don't arrive cramped and exhausted from sitting poorly like you might with a BTR. 
Easy to drive, with automatic transmission and good power steering. Very powerful brakes too. The BTR is more of a clunky beast to drive, more work for the driver which causes crew fatigue.

They're also magical in off road conditions, the permanent 6 wheel drive and relatively light weight (in the 180/185 versions shown, some newer ones are way heavier) makes them very offroad capable. Being amphibious is also a big plus, however they're only really amphib capable if the rubber door seals have been maintained. The ones we had in the late 90's, let's just say I'm glad we had no need to ford any rivers...

Negatives, compared to the BTR: The gunner is very exposed in that open turret. This can be improved somewhat by welding together an armour ""bathtub"" that rotates with the MG mount, but I see nothing of the sort in those pics. Should be a simple retrofit though, we had such turret armour on the same base vehicle back in the day.
Furthermore, Sisus are way taller than a BTR so they make a bigger target and are harder to conceal hull down behind terrain features. This is a consequence of having more headroom inside for better comfort; the BTR is very low prioritising stealth and being a small target over comfort.",False,1663242317.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_ioidwvp,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

Kherson region is heavily reinforced despite troops there not receiving supply. The Donbass front actually has Russians still attacking - so obviously they have experienced troops there.

That leaves the giant Zaporizhye front - we know Russians are really worried about it and have reinforced it heavily - but given the size of the front - is it heavy enough? Seems like Ukraine has a lot of troops there too - but pushing now will likely lead to a large battle when Ukrainians roll around the defense and run into Russian mobile reserve.

This would be a classic divide and conquer approach, so I am sure that the Russians will reinforce the path to Berdyansk.  However, they've performed so poorly that this wouldn't surprise me.

The other option is to continue east through seiverodonetsk, which would also disrupt Russian resupply routes, but would lead to a much harder fight for the south once Russia shifts troops knowing that Ukraine won't enter their territory.  Ukraine would then need to build long defense lines without major geographic features (like the river in Kharkiv).  So, it doesn't make sense to continue pushing back to a synthetic border along the east, when a hard border can be created to the south.

It would seem to me that Ukraine would want to take advantage of the chaos created by retreating and surrendering forces in Kherson by cutting off the rout on its way east, knowing that Kherson region will be secured sooner if the supply line is cut even further back.",1663254171.0,1663253882.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_ioj0s8p,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Ukraine got the time on their side. The Russia's supply lines are disrupted. The Russian's shelling in Kherson has decreased. The Russia has once again started to use air strikes in Kherson, with the result of multiple jets and helicopters shot down daily. Ukraine has fire control over most Kherson region. Ukraine has liberated a lot ground lately. The Russia is under constant pressure.

The Russian's moral is low after months of living in dumpster ditches with minimal supply.

With the good intel, Ukraine will liberate Kherson when it is suitable.

The Russia is lost, and their option is die or surrender. None is coming to their rescue, and they know it.

Objectively speaking America absolutely should provide Ukraine with heavy IFVs (Bradleys) battle tanks (Abrams), fighter/strike/ground attack jets (F16s/F15Es) and ATACMs). The sooner that's done, the sooner this war ends. It would save lives and in the long run save money.

None of the arguments against supplying those  (but escalation!/but ww3!/that wouldn't really help Ukraine even though they think it would because something something logistics!/but the soviets will find out about our 80s/90s era tech that we sell to multiple unreliable countries already!) hold any water whatsoever.

We know those arguments are bullshit because they are the same arguments why Ukraine couldn't get javelins, stingers, mid range AA, western artillery, APCs and HIMARS, all of which were ultimately supplied and are being used to great effect.

 Bluntly I think the major reason there are still any restriction on types of military aid being made available is because removing all restrictions would require the stupid, timid advisors who have been obstructing these shipments to finally admit they were totally wrong and have needlessly prolonged this war when a more robust approach could have permitted Ukraine to get on the offensive earlier. So they keep drawing arbitrary, imaginary lines in the sand and pretend that there's some sort of logic to it when the truth is just that they're fucking cowards who are afraid to do the right thing.

Don't get me wrong, it''s great that America has done what it has done so far. I doubt Ukraine would continue to exist without the help they have given. Biden deserves major credit for the steps he has taken, the aid he has authorised and his efforts to build an international coalition to support them. But there is no rational justification for half measures anymore, it's a fucking idiotic position which is costing lives and delaying the Ukrainian victory.

1 - China is generally building instead of sustaining. China probably won't be taking mothballed equipment out and hoping that it works (or in Russia's case, not working due to a lack of maintenance).

2 - China has a massive internal industry and a resource supply chain they effectively control. There are some key parts they are missing but the government has done a really good job of securing vital resources to allow continuity of industry.

3 - Population. China has nearly 10x the population of Russia. While that might not matter as much versus an opponent such as a fully mobilized USA or Europe. Most singular countries would easily get overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.

It literally means nothing for anyone outside russia. (Maybe Syria, NK, whatevs' ). The point is to give russia the occasion to come out and say:
 *""Because they gave ATACMS, they are participating in the conflict! OMG OMG! No, we can't actually do anything about it, because we are constantly crapping our pants, but see, it's not Ukraine, it's evil US, they are directly involved, we told you, is NATO and now we have proof.""*

The key word here is *supplying*. It's not a matter of Ukraine even using those missiles. The red line is crossed when they are given out.

Getting punched in the face by whatever weapon makes no practical difference, and not even russia in is infinite stupidity could mistake the US ""take it slowly approach"" for weakness.

Keep in mind that the US official position was ""we send the weapons the Ukrainians need *when* they need them"", and not of outright refusal for any particular weapon systems. 

Betting *something* on a uncertain/unenforceable red line is beyond stupid, and in this case is something that can't stand up to any scrutiny.

That's basically the facts.

You can put 'well they didn't lose more' or 'they managed to hold in Kherson' but the simple fact is that is actually, nothing.

They are in a defensive posture now and there is absolutely no sign they can change this.

If you want real indicators, look what is going on in CSTO and Georgia.

If they're willing to play hardball, they are doing so because Russia's position geopolitically is weakening and they think they can get away with this in the medium term.

One of the best things to do when analysing a conflict or situation, even when you are biased is to objectively analyse what the enemy or opposition can do.

I've been doing this over and over, looking at medium-term trends.

There's literally nothing Russia can do. The whole thing is the biggest geopolitical and military clusterfuck in the 21st century and is up there in the 20th century as well.

Their international reputation and goals are sunk or will be given time, their economy the same, their military, even worse.

There simply is no salvaging this. The Allies can easily out-supply and out-produce Russia, while keeping their economies mostly out of recession, Ukraine has the will and purpose to win.

In the last week 'we managed to hold and not collapse in most areas' is about as positive as it gets for them. You could make some argument around the dam, but that's a temporary tactical thing, and we're yet to see if it will actually impact the situation on the ground.

Overall, it's a matter of time and cost but Russia has already lost. And the tragic thing is that so many more people will die before victory for Ukraine is achieved...

I've been doing analysis on this since the start of the war, and the moment that the Russian Donbass offensive was a crawl and Ukraine demonstrated excellent defence and retreat, it was a done deal, time being the primary question. This is not wholly unexpected, peer to near-peer invasions have trended towards the 'peer' getting their arse handed to them, eventually.

The action would have to be done in a way that no one would know it was the US, because otherwise Orban's successor could *accurately* claim the US killed Orban to manipulate Hungary into a different posture **and** it would risk fracturing the NATO alliance and perhaps even mess with the pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia alliances.

Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens (DTs). Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink, are worst at 24 to 72 hours, and improve by seven days.

Too many 'analysts' with big fancy positions have been wrong for Russia (and the USSR) for so long they are all completely and utterly screwed by this war.  They have been desperately trying to save face to explain why they have been telling people for 70 years to be afraid of the reds.

(nearly) Every SINGLE threat that Russia or the USSR 'posed to the west' has been proven to be nothing once the real data came out.  Russia (and the USSR) are good at one thing, bluffing.  Once we admit there is nothing behind the bluff, the lose all their power.

China is the new boogey man that we will all have to hide under the bed over.

And just to note, this isn't to say that Russia and/or China don't have the ability to cause problems.  They absolutely do.  But, if we are totally honest with ourselves there is **literally** only one country on the face of the earth that can truly do anything they want (if we limit the discussion to conventional forces).

Uh, comparing Russia's dumb missiles fired at civilian targets with poor targeting to actual precision-guided munitions doesn't really make sense. Getting through air defense is one thing, but e.g. long-range missiles with large warheads could immediately put the Kerch bridge in play, or allow Ukraine to target command posts or key installations/logistic hubs deep behind front lines. Or, alternatively, Russia has MLRS that are nominally comparable in range to Ukraine's, but Ukraine has made vastly superior use of them. Why wouldn't they do the same with ATACMS?

Beyond that, targeting Russia doesn't really make much sense as a counterargument - on some fronts, Ukraine can target Russia as-is using existing munitions (of all makes, including American). On others, there are key sites/bridges/choke points/etc. that Ukraine can't target for lack of range - ATACMS would provide an obvious tactical benefit there, despite the air defense barrier.",1663254971.0,1663254178.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_iojauz2,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

I have to admit one of the things that's puzzled me is how willing Russia has been to waste their precision ordinance on striking civilian targets.  Aside from history showing that such attacks usually improve the resolve of defenders, they should have learned pretty quickly that Ukraine certainly wasn't buckling under the attacks.  And honestly, as bad as they are, Russia's missile strikes are like a minor irritant compared to the German bombing campaign against London.    


Perhaps it's just the authoritarian mindset that assumes that terror and violence will always achieve its goals.  


That doesn't mean I'm settled on the notion that the US should supply these weapons to Ukraine now or in the future.

Maybe. The one commonality these Russian high-profile deaths have in common are these 'plausible deniability' type deaths. Fell out of a window while smoking, fell off a boat, etc. Very sad. But it's a signature, one we associate with Russia. 

So just as a thought experiment, let's assume it IS Russia in some way, because it fits the pattern. Now we ask whether it comes from the top or not.

Is this Putin aiming down at 'allies', or is this some faction using the same technique to aim at Putin through his allies?

Russian Mafia-style politics are so hard to discern that it could go either way.  Like you say, the people behind the Dugin bombing might be entirely other people than the latest 'suddenly had a stroke' tabloid guy. You're not even allowed to criticize policy openly, so working in secret is the only way to get shit done.

I assume you reffer to my comment below in which i linked definitions from the UN war crimes list.

Attacking a dam and causing so much damage instead of attacking the pontoons themselves is a war crime. If you wish to support a different view please provide some supporting arguments as to why the damage caused by the dam being damaged/destroyed is justifiable in place of direct atacks on the pontoons themselves.

>I also don't think targeting dams is a war crime, as they are not inherently civilian targets. 

No building is *inherently civilian* during a conflict if it can be used by the military. The difference is made by the intent of the attack, and the effects on non-combatants. 

Military instalations on civilian buildings are valid targets. That doesn't justify a disproportionate use of force. A sniper on top of a school is a valid target. Carpet bombing the entire neighborhood is not justifiable use of force.

Hiting a military column driving over a dam is not justifiable if the wapons used cause widespread damage to the area by damaging/destroying the dam. 

Damaging/destroying a dam to damage some pontoons *instead of attacking the pontoons themselves*, which are valid targets is disproportionate.

The fact the US and other commited such acts is in no way justification for this action. Just as Ukraine retaliating in kind would not be *legal* justification (we could argue ad infinitum about a moral one).",1663245635.0,1663232737.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_ioi8uod,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Antifa was not always seen as centrist. Historically, into the 1930s many self-identified centrists or moderates, did not see fascism as a danger. They saw it as a vital counterweight to communism, or even as the Continent's inevitable response to decadent English democracy.

They tend to avoid politics and, when they do engage, not to put much thought into it.

There was simply too little time to prepare for an invasion. Instead, they used FSB, both from Russia and those in Ukraine already, both to try to make Euromaidan fail, and to prepare for contingencies. The one real plan Putin had prepared was to take Crimea. That operation started in February.

I think the first Novorossiya operations were somewhat opportunist and improvised. As I remember it, Russia expected Ukraine to be completely paralyzed. Their top admiral defected. The Party of Regions, that had control of the East, was being dissolved. The real activities in Donetsk and Luhansk did not start until April 12th (Girkin led that one).

Of course, Russia prepared for a military confrontation, but the response to ATO was still not all that fast. I think Russia expected something very half-hearted. But ATO was at least determined and had early successes.

When they intervened, they still wanted to pretend that they didn't. That's why they didn't use air support or cruise missiles.

That's why they keep supporting these breakaway provinces in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. The EU or NATO aren't going to want to take on countries that come with preexisting headaches, after all.

I'm not sure what the inflection point was, though, that changed Russia's calculus from just propping up these pseudo-states to recognizing them as independent, but there are many to choose from.

 >The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (Ukrainian: ДніпроГЕС, romanized: DniproHES; Russian: ДнепроГЭС, romanized: DneproGES), also known as Dneprostroi Dam, in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, is the largest hydroelectric power station on the Dnieper river. It is the fifth step of the Dnieper cascade of hydroelectric stations that provides electric power for the Donets–Kryvyi Rih Industrial region. The Dnieper Reservoir stretches 129 km upstream to near Dnipro city. The station was built by the Soviet Union in two stages.

1) These are all estimates and 2) you’re assuming no foreign resupply (China) or domestic/foreign manufacturing.

In WW2, Russia produced 85K T-34’s in three years. The Sherman produced 55K. The Panzer was limited, but still managed 6K. In a long war, resupply from and mobilization of factories is a very real thing.

We don’t know *what* Russia is manufacturing right now. They could replace tank losses relatively well and even basic T-72’s would be easy to pump out. They don’t need to produce solely T90’s. High end machinery could very well be limited by sanctions and foreign influence but you don’t need high end microchips to pump a T72 out.


>They've lost 2100 tanks. Maybe they repaired 500 of those max.

Orix has only estimated 1K, and many of those aren’t “lost” so much as damaged. Many of them are likely to be recovered.

They really don’t need the machinery they’re using in Ukraine, against a country of 40M, to the degree they would against Finland a country of 5M. Nor would they need the forces.

> They can't attack Finland with artillery and human waves.

Uhh, yes they can. See WW2. Their entire strategy was just throwing a wave of bodies at the wall. It was an absolutely atrocious military strategy and they won solely because of weather and sheer numbers. Soldiers routinely grabbed clothing and weapons off dead bodies, that’s how they were supplied upon arrival at the front.

The Finnish military itself is only 180K max in wartime. Russia can conscript millions. If Russia had invaded Finland it would’ve been an entirely different situation but Finland was party to defense agreements (EU) that Ukraine was not.

Now *will Russia open a second front?* Highly doubtful, they don’t have an incentive to start WW3 and China doesn’t either. They’re also aware of nuclear capability and likely don’t want to even rock that boat with actual usage for fear of it being tipped over.

Unfortunately for them, once the Nazi soldiers were gone, and the allies took over, the resistance members in those countries took a very negative view of their actions, and initiated fairly violent reprisals against them.

Now someone inexperienced might say that Ukraine is already employing tanks and other armored fighting vehicles so it should translate but the real fact is that it doesn’t. To fully train just a driver it takes 22 weeks, we aren’t even talking about the gunner or vehicle commander which also is a long process and that’s just the M1s.

The real reason why is maintenance, anyone with passing knowledge knows that maintenance is the lifeflow or an armored battalion. In 2021 I spent the year in the amazing country of Lithuania, we partied hard but trained even harder. The amount of maintenance is almost tripled, the terrain is honestly a fight in itself.

Nobody knows what is going to happen. We are all just speculating, and revising as things progress. 

What we want to happen is an immediate and complete withdrawal from Ukraine by the Russians. And then the NATO gates must close on the Russian border.  Putin doesn't want NATO expansion, but he has forced and ensured it. 

Putin  has destabilised an entire region of the globe directly. And indirectly, well the entire world is affected, to varying degrees. So there is going to be alot more fighting, alot more heartache and loss, and even more economic fallout worldwide. 

 Even when Putin is finally put of office, by whatever means, there will be significant repercussions due to the immense Russian interference in alot of countries' politics. Then comes the reshuffle, individuals, groups and countries shifting to scoop up the remains, and jockey for best position in the new situation. 

Alot also depends on what else happens with current political seesaws, Iran, China, etc. Also remember the global politics is trending towards the right wing in alot of countries. There is a ton of movement happening, and while we can speculate, we cannot know for sure.

It wasn't seen as a necessity because next to nobody imagined that a european country would attack another european country in the future and that someone even wished that Germany would have a strong army again. So the Bundeswehr sold most of its equipment after the reunion to other countries and after further budget cuts has only a comparable small working arsenal left. Many things that are now delivered to Ukraine from other countries came from Germany after the end of the Cold War.

That Germany has good weapon manufacturers doesn't help because they usually deliver to foreign countries instead of increasing the military capacities of the german army (nobody wants a fight with german bureucracy) – so there are simply not many weapon systems in stock in Germany.  Things like the modern air defense system Iris T-SLM (which Germany doesn't have) or hundred additional PzH 2000 (which is more than the german army even has at the moment) have to be manufactured first which takes months or years.

But you could even work with the small stock left if the army hadn't readiness issues which are known very well in Germany since over ten years. The army is a laughing stock in any international maneuvers because of this – it had to use broomstick instead of machine guns (2015) or had no radio system for exercises (2021). The latest army report got a average material readiness of only 68 percent for so-called legacy systems. In the case of seven systems, it is even less than 50 percent i.e. Sea King multipurpose helicopter, the Marder IFV and the Tornado fighter jet. It is especially bad with the only (!) attack helicopter the german army has: Only nine of a total of 51 Eurocopter Tiger could fly – at least in May 2022.",1663239004.0,1663236268.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_ioi5ocq,,4,8,0,8,0,0,

I asked how long 40000 rounds would last in battle. He told me a few hours, for a single cannon, and only because they had to cool the barrel after firing.  


A similar thing happened with the Turkish made Bayraktar drones. The UK company, who was selling a critical piece of Bayraktars stopped sales of the parts (but not the sale of actual drones) because they just(!) found out that the drones were used in a military setting with the news from Ukraine.

I don't know how common is this, but parts of military stuff being imported from elsewhere in Europe, and the actual producer ammunition/parts blocking sales/reexport may be quite common.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/ujx4ez/this_is_a_leaked_report_on_the_readiness_status/

Take it with a grain of salt - apparently the Moskva's last readiness report, dated two weeks before the invasion started, was linked to VK (Russian social media) and very quickly deleted, but it made its way to Twitter. If it's somehow not legit, then someone went to a great deal of trouble to make a very detailed fake readiness report that comes across as pretty damn legit, as it jives with what is known about the ship, how it's armed and powered, etc. And details like fire extinguishers not being present/being locked up give it a sort of ring of truth. 

It all also just falls in line with what we know about Russian maintenance of their equipment in general. 

I think the thing that gives it the most credibility is that there's kind of a built-in motivation to leak it - probably some official/admiral/whatever who is getting blamed for the loss, who wanted to make it known that it wasn't a tactical or strategic blunder, but that it was the shoddy equipment and maintenance negligence that was at fault. Or it emerged during the investigation that followed after its sinking and someone felt like it needed to get out there.

I can't really see any reason for any party outside Russia to fabricate such a report, with that detail. It would actually benefit Ukraine and the West in general for people to believe the Moskva was operating perfectly, but Ukraine *still* managed overcome its defenses to sink it. 

It's like that one now famous quote by that Ukrainian soldier... 'we're lucky we're fighting idiots'. Because if Russia was as strong and capable as they've always postured themselves to be, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago, and that leaked report feels totally in line with the state of the Russian military in general.

Bucha is directly south of Hostomel air force base and en route to Kyiv from the north.  This is why there was such heavy fighting in Bucha/Irpin.  This was the furthest Russia made it before being forced back.  The goal was to take Kyiv, not Bucha. 

Ivankiv was taken on the 24th and Irpin Bucha was experiencing fighting just a day or two later.  Everything was disorganized.  There were no defense lines.  UA was firing with rifles and anti tank weaponry from apartment windows while civilians sheltered next door.  Civilians were fighting back as well.  Russians were firing somewhat blindly back into the apartments and did not know who were combatants and who were civilians.  Russians were taking heavy losses and had no combat experience. 

No doubt Russian troops had more animosity to those closer to Kyiv (who are likely politically aligned with western ideology).  But the main reason was the heavy fighting before evacuation due to Russia attempting a blitzkrieg on Kyiv.  The ideological difference is another reason why I would expect less torture in eastern cities where the majority of civilians may be closer to the Russian mindset, but also the lack of resistance on the level of Bucha/Irpin/Borodyanka. 

As the war went on, both sides stabilized and became more organized. 

I do not want to downplay civilian deaths.  It is tragic whether they happened due to random shelling or torture during occupation.  However, not every reclaimed city will be a copy of Bucha.  That was an insane and desperate time during this conflict.

Edit: I do want to recognize what you said, as many seemed to believe that they were on a mission to extradite or otherwise remove certain people.  Many occupied towns had their city officials disappeared.  One mayor told us that they made him dig his own grave in the woods while they stood over him with a pistol before deciding they couldn't do it. But these removals of western friendly authority or thought leader also fits the bill of any occupation/colonization.

No they didn't.  The Russians spent less on defense (in total) than the US spends to maintain **just their nuclear weapons**.  Despite the fact Russia has larger stockpiles of just about everything.  Despite the fact their stock piles are older and hence need more maintenance to function.

The writing was on the wall for anyone who **wanted** to read it.

&#x200B;

>I don't think that's true. The soviet union was significantly more powerful than this current joke that is Russia. They were more on par technologically, and they always had a massive standing army.

Absolutely and utterly incorrect and another flight of popular fantasy (and I don't mean that in a condescending way, I just don't know how else to say it):

[https://www.wearethemighty.com/lists/4-russian-weapons-overhyped/](https://www.wearethemighty.com/lists/4-russian-weapons-overhyped/)

I link that so you can get a quick list.  If you actually research into what the west thought about each of those 4 pieces of equipment, and the panic they induced in the circle of the 'big brains' vs. the reality of those weapon systems, you will see Russia and the Soviets were never the threat they were portrayed as (again setting aside the nuclear arsenal, which I am intentionally avoiding because that is a different debate, we can discuss privately, but this thread has enough trolls rolling through with nuclear concern to touch on it anymore).

Russia has **never** been on par with the west technologically.  They may have achieved brief moments of parity in the space program and perhaps with their nuclear program, but those were a result not of superior technology but a superior disregard for human life to achieve a specific goal (largest nuke ever, first man in space, etc.)  TLDR:  Russia never matched the west except when they were willing to kill far more people to do it.

As for their massive standing army; it has ALWAYS been shit tactically and logistically.  The only reason they managed to not be beaten by Germany during WW2 was the **massive** support of the lend-lease program that gave them not only the equipment, but the actual food so they didn't all die of starvation.

>Keep in mind that most of the equipment Russia fields now is 40 years old, and it was probably quite decent for the time it was developed.

Again respectfully, and with a few notable exceptions here and there, just not true.  We **thought** it was because we were **told** it was.  But it very very rarely has been.

This isn't to say that Russia and the Soviets didn't build some neat tech and weapons, but where they may have competed on raw specs they would fail on reliability and maintainability or usability, etc.  If the Soviets were as good as we thought they were they would have won the cold war.

(also expressed as ""troublesome priest"" or ""meddlesome priest"") is a quote attributed to Henry II of England preceding the death of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1170. While the quote was not expressed as an order, it prompted four knights to travel from Normandy to Canterbury, where they killed Becket. The phrase is commonly used in modern-day contexts to express that a ruler's wish may be interpreted as a command by his or her subordinates.

They are probably trying to think of new leverage points against the west now the gas is gone. 

At the very least, even if it is completely lost for them, its not rational to just cut all losses and run...atleast for certain people in power (for the Russian state it might be) 

It also may involve a reworking of objectives. Keeping the donbass a war zone indefinately ensures Ukraine can't develop the fossil fuel resources in the area, and therefore secures Russias margins. That alone could be  worth trillions to them. And yes they have lost revenue but it may be their best way of preventing the loss of further revenue.

If you had 10 people voting from the kitchen and 2 people voting from the living room, you wouldn't say that the ""living room gets to decide household policy"" and insist that living room as a whole has equal voting rights compared to the kitchen because that'd be idiotic. 

At the micro scale you immediately realize its absurd to consider that where people are voting from should affect the strength of their vote. 

If you fail to recognize the absurdity of it then I ask you at what point should a state no longer be given two senators? When they have 1 citizen? 10? 100? Where is the line that you decide ""Whoa, thats a bit crazy that this # of people gets 2 votes versus the millions over there also getting 2 votes""",1663270682.0,1663268981.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_iokd52g,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Also, it's flat out wrong that only those most populated states would decide policy. Under any system where 1 person=1 vote is kept proportional at a representative level, all people would have an equal say across the country.  What you are defending is actually places like Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa, and the Dakotas getting to decide federal policy by getting massive extra federal power simply on the basis of no one actually wanting to live there. 

Of course, if you are going to argue that people who live in less populated areas are minority groups that deserve an outsized say because their interests could be steamrolled by the majority, I'd expect you to also support the addition a constitutional amendment that creates senate seats for all minority groups, such as racial, religious, and sexual orientation? Or is it conveniently just empty land, where people happen to be a very specific demographic and voting block, that you think deserves special extra voting power? 

The system you're defending is explicitly not representative, and the excuses always used to defend it are either factually wrong: ""California will decide everything"", or utterly hypocritical: ""Dakotans as a minority group need special protection in the form of four senators but actual oppressed minority groups don't"". Or the classic ""That's how the constitution is written"" as the fallback of someone who has no actual argument for why it should be that way, but for some reason is still actively defending the status quo. There's nothing in the constitution that forces anyone to jump into this conversations with bullshit arguments to try and keep things the way they are. So either advocate for an actually representative system, or shut up when other people point out how miserably the current one is failing.",1663271932.0,1663269660.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_iokd52g,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Project 100,000 was initiated by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in October 1966 to meet the escalating manpower requirements of the American government's involvement in the Vietnam War.

In 1970 they tested about two dozen weapons. That's just tests, not the arsenal. When you consider the Satan was launched mid 70s as a MIRV with ten war heads of 18+ MT then they were far beyond not capable by the end of the 60s.",False,1663261082.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_iojt83a,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

The Soviet Union did not. The Soviets had a massive manpower advantage sitting on the border with the west, to the point where it was considered likely that they could achieve breakthrough in just days after a surprise attack. This is why the United States never took a ""no first strike"" nuclear policy - it was determined that only the prospect of a nuclear exchange could properly deter a Soviet conventional attack. The West did not obtain conventional parity until the 1970s. Even just equipment alone, the T-62 was considered superior to the West's offerings until the development of the Abrams tank. It took time to catch up because the West was largely focused on rebuilding a shattered continent.

It is absurd to say that they were never what we thought it was. The Soviet military of the 1940s and 1950s had just defeated the modern era's most formidable land army, sacrificing millions of lives to do so. They were correctly feared, and even once they began to lose their edge as the Soviet system collapsed it still remained extremely formidable.

As far as modern Russia goes, yes I agree that they obviously were not as strong as many believed. I don't think anyone ever thought they were on par with the West or even close outside of tankies and Russian pundits. But military analysts largely drew on the few lessons we had, the most important of which was the competently executed intervention in Georgia. Analysts also over-learned the lessons of the first Russian intervention in Ukraine, in which Ukrainian military units were easily crushed in the outset of the conflict. But these lessons were inadequate because Russia's capability of sustaining a war of this size for nearly a year while under harsh sanctions was not tested in Georgia, nor was Ukraine's efforts to revitalize and restore its military between 2014 and 2022 correctly assessed.

I cannot find them. Any terms I come up with return hundreds of results or almost none. 

If you look at sullivan’s public remarks they focus a lot on the risk of escalation. Sullivan is brilliant, but narrowly cares about the direct US interest. 

He sees a long war that depletes Russia as superior to a short war Russia can bounce back from. He also views even minute risk of escalation worth avoiding if the costs are borne by Ukraine because the costs of escalation are borne by the US.

2. Even that aside, your historical analysis is absurd. First, you cannot discuss the Soviet military without talking about what time period you mean. The Soviets were absolutely overestimated in 1985, but that doesn't mean they were overestimated in 1955. They West correctly assessed the military threat posed by the Russians at that point, they were indeed likely capable of winning a conventional conflict against their foes that were still struggling to rebuild after the war. This was certainly a period where they did not have the intelligence apparatus we might see today and no doubt there was some exaggeration, but the bottom line that the West was not remotely prepared for a conventional conflict with Russia was true.

3. The Soviet Union fought 80% of the German military. All of the largest battles were fought on the Eastern Front. They took more casualties and killed more Germans than the rest of the Allies combined. You can say, sure, but who armed them? I agree - without lend lease they would have lost. But without the Russian military, Germany would not likely have ever been comprehensively defeated in the field. Someone had to shoot the guns and drive the tanks. A relevant comparison would be today's conflict - Ukraine might not have the ammunition it needs to fight the Russians without the West's economic might, but that doesn't mean they're ""only helping."" The fighting is the hard part.

4. Why would I talk about the Soviets allying with the Nazis? I didn't say they were fucking good guys, I said they defeated the German army. Stalin fucking sucked but that doesn't change what happened in the war.",1663282566.0,1663281393.0,t3_xemjbz,t1_iola220,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
