Day 162 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had the biggest shelling of the city in the past couple of months. It started at around 9:50pm and continued for close to 20 minutes. Only the residential districts were targeted, Pavlove Pole, Saltivka and Industrialny districts. It was 10 minutes before the start of the curfew, so there weren’t too many civilians on the streets. So far 3 people are confirmed injured.

They fired many MLRS salvos, [the footage that was posted is honestly insane](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1555278881418100737), there were dozens of explosions happening almost simultaneously, you could literally see rockets fly in front of the security cam that was recording. My district wasn’t targeted directly but we heard the rockets flying overhead, the ones aimed at Pavlove Pole, and they were loud, even though we didn’t hear the explosions themselves as it is about 3-4km away from us.

They also didn’t forget their missile strike, and they changed the time again. This time missiles were fired at 1:15am, four of them, and they were aimed at Chuhuiv as far as we can tell. The fact that they fired them so early makes us worry more, because that means they could do another round of missiles closer to 4am, but it is already almost 3:30am, and it didn’t happen yet, so we hope it won’t happen.",False,1659659365.0,t3_wfr7d9,t3_wfr7d9,,0,96,0,96,1,0,

- we’ve been maligned, only because we were open with you

- AI distorts the picture—the aggression, the conditions, the defense abilities, and our precautions—the whole must be examined to understand why in some situations we’ve been near populations

- their analysis failed to consider: Russians use the tactics of capturing and holding populated areas, not permitting to leave.  Is Ukrainian military not to defend their homes? To wait in fields for Russians to show up?

- So yes, the Ukrainian cities and villages are strengthened and defended against the international criminal, and air defense units cover the sky over populated areas.

- We ask civilians to leave, often assist. Those who remain do so by own choice.

- Despicable to investigate the victims actions alone.  We were open and you smeared us with a distorted characterization, ignored the perpetrator of this aggression",False,1659667879.0,t3_wfr7d9,t3_wfr7d9,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

🍄 It’s been a while since we’ve had some nice big boomers.  Probably a mix of bad luck with people being able to film/post and russians just not concentrating their munitions as dense.  But there were some nice ones posted on Wednesday.   Here’s [Ebeishy](https://twitter.com/den_kazansky/status/1554897375168192513) Kherson and the Antonovsky [railway bridge](https://twitter.com/DemeryUK/status/1554961574657400834) Kherson.

🍄 In other boomer news, we got a late, [high quality video](https://twitter.com/_tredecim_/status/1554855939286646784) of that Ukrainian train strike over the weekend that killed an estimated 80 russians and wounded 200.  The UK Ministry of Defense says that it’s going to take [a few days](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554726872491114496) to repair the damage, but even afterwards, that stretch of the railroad is [going to remain vulnerable](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554025026822803456.html) to future attacks.

🚧 We got some [good photos](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1554758077836050435) of russian pontoon ferries around Kherson.   There are several reports russia is mixing civilian and military traffic (using civilians as shields), but also that its using civilian cars to transport military men and equipment.  Regardless, even with ferries, russia can’t logistically supply everything it needs to on the west side of the river.  russia is trying to repair the bridges however and believes it can re-open the [Antonivka bridge next week](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1554980441194565632).

Meanwhile the red-cross wants to remind everyone it [never promised](https://twitter.com/uawarinfo/status/1554945207644340225) to ensure the safety of the prisoners, only a “safe exit from the Avozstal steel plant”.

👉 The Soviet army was used to help farmers plant and harvest their crops.  Belarus still employs their army the same way.  So for all the bluster and head-fakes of Belarus opening a northern front on Ukraine, it apparently isn’t going to happen because the [Belarusian army is busy harvesting](https://twitter.com/TadeuszGiczan/status/1554819013569421313).

👉 Only 30% of Ukrainian schools [will open](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554932587642191872) in September.   russia is also not going to open its schools if they are [near the border](https://twitter.com/MoscowTimes/status/1554953506574012416) of Ukraine.

He has some interesting insights into Putin's character as well and believes Putin's personality was largely shaped by a former Russian gangster who was the head coach at the sambo/judo facility Putin attended as a weak, bullied youth (this was before Putin ended up in the KGB).

Putin is all about mafia code and 'standing up to the bully' and nowadays that bully (in Putin's view) is the USA. Sweeney has been trying to make Western leaders 'wake up' to the true nature of Putin since the second Czechen war (with details of some of the war crimes he personally witnessed) and is happy to see it finally happening now.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 4 August 2022
 

- Ukraine's missile and artillery units continue to target Russian military strongholds, personnel clusters, logistical support bases and ammunition depots which will highly likely impact Russian military logistical resupply and put pressure on Russian military combat support elements.

- On 03 August 2022, the first vessel with Ukrainian grain arrived at the Bosphorus Strait having transited the Black Sea from Odesa. It is almost certain the success of this transit will result in more frequent transits in both directions. Clearing the backlog caused by the blockade that has been in place since February 2022 will remain a logistical challenge.

- Russian forces have almost certainly positioned pyramidal radar reflectors in the water near the recently damaged Antonivskiy Bridge and by the recently damaged nearby rail bridge, both of which cross over the Dnipro River in Kherson, southern Ukraine. The radar reflectors are likely being used to hide the bridge from synthetic aperture radar imagery and possible missile targeting equipment. This highlights the threat Russia feels from the increased range and precision of Western-supplied systems.

- Anti-tank weapons: These are surprisingly inefficient against civilian targets because of the highly directed shaped charges. In the 90s some Danish bikers used an anti-tank rocket against a competing biker group's HQ where a huge party was happening. The rocket only killed two women who were directly hit by the rocket. In 2011 a modern Russian anti-tank missile was used against an Israeli school bus. The missile hit close to where the only passenger, a 16-year-old boy, was sitting and he was hit by secondary shrapnel that entered his brain. The bus driver was only lightly injured and was able to stop the bus and lift the 16-year-old boy out of the bus. The boy died from his brain injuries 10 days later.

- Man-portable air-defense systems  (MANPADS): Sri Lanka claims one of their civilian planes was downed by a rebel group they were fighting against using a MANPAD but this has not been independenty verified. No other civilian airliners have ever been downed by MANPADS even though every rebel and terrorist group had Strelas/Stingers in the 80s and 90s. Probably because their small 300-500 gram warheads are not that efficient against big civilian airliners.

Most other types of weapons the West has given to Ukraine are either too big to transport secretly out of Ukraine (HIMARS etc.) or are something that already exist on the black market (guns, rifles etc.)",1659642161.0,1659641943.0,t3_wfr7d9,t3_wfr7d9,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

I can only throw guesses here what this means.

1. russia can shell the town from urban Donetsk in relative safety. Ukraine doesn't want to shell civilians so counter-battery is nonexistant. Ukraine may also have reduced their military presence in Donbas in favor of the Southern offensive.

2. The shelling takes place in much smaller pockets than before. Possibly very close to supply lines where ammo dumps aren't as needed. 

I don't see how this will help russia in the long run. They may get the ruins of Pisky but once they need to move further from Donetsk to keep going, their shellrate will take a massive hit.

Ive been watching a fair bit of Russian TV to get an understanding of how the ~~war~~ special military operation is being portrayed, and i can see how the average Russian supports it.

You have the hardliners like Solovyov dehumanizing the Ukrainians which makes it easy to not feel sorry for them. The moderate channels show the Russian army giving aid and cleaning up the towns. There's plenty of interviews of people who are in places like Donbas that support Russia, and they show what the Ukrainians supposedly destroyed. Tucker, Chomsky, Trump, Corbyn and anyone that is pro Russia often gets airtime to show that the west is divided with support. There is not much shown of the atrocities the Russians are doing, and if it gets a mention, it is to prove its fake news, then often followed up by reports such as petal mines in Donbas being dropped by Ukrainians.

Its quite interesting watching from afar and i can see how the average Russian buys into it all, and the few that bother to get western news through VPN's have to figure out if its true or not, as the comment sections are populated by bots and trolls that try to tell a different story.

Several reasons:

* Historically, Soviet and Russian planners figured NATO had such a massive edge in airpower that trying would be pointless, so they focused on denying the enemy control of the air instead of achieving air superiority or air supremacy themselves. This means Russia wasn’t doctrinally prepared to mount an offensive air campaign.

* Ukrainian aircraft survived the initial wave of strikes, possibly due to advance warning from the United States and outdated intelligence leading Russia to strike the wrong targets. 

* Ukraine has strong ground-based air defenses centered around Soviet surface-to-air missile systems. These make it very dangerous to operate at higher altitudes, forcing enemy aircraft to come in low.

* Russia underestimated Ukraine more than anyone else and walked right into air defense expecting no resistance

* Poor intel and navigation kept them from effectively locating and eliminating Ukrainian air defense in unknown territory (especially with aforementioned lack of precision weapons), though they did manage to destroy at least a handful of S300s

* Ukraine is well equipped with Stinger MANDPADS from the West, so any helicopters or attack jets were liable to be attacked from practically anywhere, and without effectively removing long-ranged SAMs they can't use their high-altitude strategic bombers for anything other than lobbing cruise missiles from long range

It is worth noting though that basically neither side can effectively eliminate each others air force or air defenses so they're both basically relegated to defending their own territory or occasional strikes along the front lines.",False,1659653187.0,t3_wfr7d9,t1_iiz8cxi,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

The Russians simply can't afford to pull deep interdiction strikes like on the border crossings where western supplies are crossing or on the airfields where cargo planes are landing.

>“The pattern of crimes committed by Russian forces that we have documented includes both unlawful attacks and wilful killings of civilians,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

>“We have met families whose loved ones were killed in horrific attacks, and whose lives have changed forever because of the Russian invasion. We support their demands for justice, and call on the Ukrainian authorities, the International Criminal Court and others to ensure evidence is preserved that could support future war crime prosecutions.  
>  
>“It is vital that all those responsible, including up the chain of command, are brought to justice.”

Almost all of it is extremely critical and focused on the bad shit Russia's done. Nowhere do I get the sense that they hold a both-sides view and equally blame Ukraine for Russia's behavior.

>“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is grave, severe and defined by one characteristic only: aggression. Russia is invading into the heart of Ukraine, seeking to depose its lawfully elected government, with a real and potential massive impact on civilians’ lives, safety and well-being; its acts cannot remotely be justified on any of the grounds that Russia has offered. Yet all of this is being committed by a permanent member of the UN Security Council,” said Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International.  
>  
>“Russia is in clear breach of its international obligations. Its actions are blatantly against the rules and principles on which the United Nations was founded. All members of the United Nations should condemn that conduct unequivocally. Russia’s flagrant disregard cannot be allowed to embolden others to follow suit and nor should the UN’s ability to contain such behaviour be undermined.”

>Since the Russia invasion began on 24 February, Amnesty has been documenting the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure.

For Ukraine, the reason is clear. Russia is on the backfoot and they believe that it is quite possible to reclaim occupied land. Anything short of Russia giving the land back would be unacceptable at the negotiating table.

For Russia, they are dealing with a massive sunk cost fallacy. Russia has sunk too many resources and lives into Ukraine to call for a cease fire, with the little gains they have made. Stopping the war now would only show that Russia is even weaker than it appears to be.

I am sure that according to these people from AI, Ukraine army should go out from the city they try to defend, and right in to an open field, to be slaughtered. 

Then everything will be according to their own twisted views on ""how to wage a war"".  

I oppose this report, because it is built on lies. I lived thru siege of Kiev, and saw our military evacuating people (trying to) from towns nearby when they could. I have friends living in Kharkiv, and they will confirm that this report is a fat big fucking lie. Same can be heard from refugees from the east, that fled from russian army. We try to get people out, but many flat out refuse! Why? Because they do not care, they want to be left alone. 
This report is made by people who are not in touch with reality, and were NEVER on the ground in Ukraine, or do not understand the severity and hardship of situation we are in. 

Besides, this bs about military bases being near civilians is just a joke. They were there since the Soviet fucking Union. Some of them got moved, some of them are now hiding. 

As a citizen of Ukraine, i am fully 100% in favor of our military using EVERY fucking trick in the book, hiding as good as they can, hiding supplies and military hardware as good as they can,  because they longer they fight, the longer we stay free from Russia. 


One of my most potent memories from the month of staying in Kiev (aside from bombs exploding, and shelling by russians), is the sound of our AA guns working nearby. At first we were  weary and scared of that sound, not realizing what that was, but then we understood that this was our military working on Russia forces and keeping us save. I learned that this was a good sound, because while we hear that sound we know that our military is nearby. That means that we are safe. 
Because we all saw what Russia does when they take an area. Rapes, kidnapping, murders, torture. 
Its like these people do not fucking care that we fight against nuclear state 10 times our size, with long range missiles, drones, and spies who try to destroy all logistics, weapons, and ammunition we have 24/7.

Russia will target civilian structure in Ukraine anyway. They have proven it times and times, by targeting sites when there were ZERO military targest nearby. They targeted military bases, that were closed 20 years ago, and now are just warehouses, or stores for fuck sake. 

What do they propose? That all of our military and weapons go in to the fields to get slaughered? That all weapons and ammo must be transported in to forest, or some far away building to be blown up by Russia?  Oh, and all military personal MUST wait inside barracks that are visible on Google Maps, and wait until they are blown up by another fucking russian missile.

Ukrainians are very familiar with the Russian army organisation, they know its weak spots, and in theory, they know how to break them. They had tremendous success using their knowledge in the first part of the war, where they maneuvered around the exposed columns, attacked the command and logistics, and slowly eroded the combat effectiveness of the entire army ~~until Russians collapsed and ragequitted~~ until Russians decided that this was just a feint and their plan was to be somewhere else.

The second phase of the war allowed Russians to establish a solid frontline, protect the vulnerable rear and dragged the Ukrainians to fight them in the grinding fight. This was favourable to Russia.

New long ranged western artillery and MLRS/HIMARS missiles allowed Ukrainians to go back to the successes from the early stage of the war, just with different means. They can now kill the desired targets from distance, without trying to find a way for mobile teams to penetrate Russian lines.

Russians managed to counter the first phase by regrouping and tightening the frontlines, but they have no conventional answer to this kind of long range superiority - even the total mobilization might not be enough - that would just make it worse.

It's a knee-capping move tailor-made to counter Russian army structure.

>By mid-May 1965, a total of 27 North Vietnamese bridges had been attacked and 26 had been destroyed

The 27th bridge was of course Thanh Hóa Bridge.

edit:

And for some comparisons:

>In 1957, the North Vietnamese, with the assistance of Chinese technicians, undertook the task of again spanning the swift-flowing Song Ma. Using construction methods that were crude by western standards, the project moved along ponderously until 1961 when the regime in Hanoi, needing the bridge to facilitate the movement of supplies to the insurgents in the south, put on the pressure. By working 24-hours a day, the builders completed the bridge in 1964, and Ho Chi Minh himself presided at the dedication.

>The new bridge at Thanh Hoa was called the Ham Rung (or Dragon's Jaw) by the Vietnamese. **It was 540 feet long, 56 feet wide, and about 50 feet above the river. The Dragon's Jaw had two steel thru-truss spans which rested in the center on a massive reinforced concrete pier, 16 feet in diameter, and on concrete abutments at the other ends. Hills on both sides of the river provided solid bracing for the structure. Between 1965 and 1972, eight concrete piers were added near the approaches to give additional resistance to bomb damage. A one-meter gauge single railway track ran down the 12 foot wide center and 22-foot wide concrete highways were cantilevered on each side.**

There have been [Airborne Early Warning and Control System \(AWACS\) planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_early_warning_and_control) like this  flying 24/7 along the western Ukrainian border since the war began, they are essentially large airborne radars that can look hundreds of kilometers into Ukrainian airspace. This means that in Western Ukraine at least they don't have to leave their own ground based air defense radars turned on. So the AWACS could detect an incoming Russian plane, give it's location and vector to a Ukrainian anti air unit, they turn on their radar only when the plane is in the engagement range, fire missiles, then as soon as the intercept is over switch off their radar. Since turning on your own radar is like turning on a flashlight in a dark room that gives the Russians very little time to pinpoint where Ukrainian air defenses are, let alone launch an anti radiation homing missile to attack the air defense site. And the AWACS plane does all this while totally safe from Russian attack because it's not even in the country and Russia wouldn't dare shoot it down while it was in a NATO countries airspace.

How far these planes radar's can see targets into Ukraine isn't really known, one would assume hundreds of kilometers but of course at some point the radar can no longer cover Ukrainian airspace, I would assume it would not be enough to reach the front lines in Donbass. But I think being able to offer this kind of coverage to western Ukraine is a huge reason why both the Ukrainian air force and so many of their air defense systems survived the early stages of the war and a huge part of why Russia can't achieve air superiority.

I think there is a point in Ukraine as you head west from Russia at which NATO planes can offer real time information to Ukrainian air defenses that allow them to remain hidden with their radars off until the last moment before they need to fire. For vectoring in Ukrainian airplanes the same would apply, they could be vectored in to intercept Russian fighters or even cruise missiles and only need to broadcast their position at the last moment when they need to use lock their weapons on the target. Both of those abilities combined would make it much harder for the Russians to destroy Ukrainian fighters and air defense systems in Western Ukraine which has had a knock on effect making it impossible for the Russians to achieve air superiority in the country anywhere.",False,1659666340.0,t3_wfr7d9,t1_iizck1s,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

I know now that those end days were more civil war oriented as the west just watched it fall apart, well, Im sure we helped, but the ""almost hot"" moments happened before that, the Cuban missile crisis etc, from my parents time.

The difference was that the US and USSR had a rivalry, but also a MAD mutual respect for each other, with that phoneline to be used if one team was going to push the button.

So there was discussion of foriegn policy, movements etc.

This time? There is no MAD. Nato is the superior combatant, Putin himself has admitted it. Russia is getting its ass kicked by the west via proxy. There is no telephone, no respect.

>You and these fucking Amenesty clowns need to get a reality check. There is no BoTh SiDeS or ""grey area"", there is only Russian aggression.

I think it's better if people are aware of these factors. Personally I think it's been justified for Ukraine and that they are showing efforts to minimize civilians being dragged into while Russia acts in a way that also discourages caring about it (Russia is already bombing civilian buildings so why avoid using them when it doesn't lead to any discouragement from Russia to shoot at everything close to the front?) but I think it's better if people are aware of these factors and the motivations / justifications rather than we just ignore talking about any of it just because Russia's imperial invasion and genocidal plans are enough to go on because I think it creates a knowledge gap and makes people less able to combat some of the bullshit Russian narratives.

As an example a popular and frustratingly effective propaganda line by pro-Russians is shit about how ""Ukraine bombed civilians in the Donbas for 8 years"" and here's a [good video by Starsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-YKRc_b7CE) shedding light on that bullshit using OHCHR reports which Russia often cites wrongly. Basically Russia instigated conflicts, did a lot of bad shit but there was also collateral from Ukraine fighting back. I think that just because some civilians did die when Ukraine fought back the information doesn't get promoted in the same way which creates this gap for pro-Russians to spread their own narrative and people just aren't that exposed to the information so they can't really counter it that strongly.

As well they have hit bridges, supply depots, command and control centers, railways and other targets using HIMARS and artillery all over the region. It seems like they are trying to isolate Russian forces, including those in Kherson city itself, in a pocket north of the Dnieper river so Russia would have a hard time keeping them supplied. It's impossible to know if that means Ukraine might be preparing for a long siege hoping the Russian defenders surrender or retreat across the river to the south which with the bridges being damaged probably means leaving a lot of their heavy equipment behind.

So the campaign to retake Kherson has started but they haven't actually tried to mount an offensive on the ground into the city itself and if they're planning to try and let the Russians run low on supplies it could be a while before they attack the city proper.

It might be wishful thinking that Russian forces surrender or leave without much of a fight but Russian morale isn't exactly great to start with, it's probably not the worst idea to test their will to fight with at least trying to seal off most routes of resupply and wait a bit to see if their resolve crumbles.

 >A glide bomb or stand-off bomb is a standoff weapon with flight control surfaces to give it a flatter, gliding flight path than that of a conventional bomb without such surfaces. This allows it to be released at a distance from the target rather than right over it, allowing a successful attack without the aircraft needing to survive until reaching the target. World War II-era glide bombs like the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 pioneered the use of remote control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target as a pioneering form of precision-guided munition.

First, no one wanted to actually build this bridge. The competition for the kerch-bridge-building was quite weird, and forced (the reason you cited, the one responsible is in the spotlight and could end his life very quickly if falling out of favor, mightve been one of the reasons);  
But as Putin and his whole elite is stealing and demanding bribes all the time, this is the new normal, and understood to be done in all levels of the hierarchy. If youre one step under Shoigu, you have to pay him to keep your job. How will you do that? By stealing and taking bribes yourself. And the guy below you, how will he pay you? He will do the same, and all the way down.

(and no western companies built this thing, because any western corporation involved in the process would be banned from everything everywhere, outside of Russia - thats not a good choice, economically, for the ""best western engineers"")Also, if your idea of ""i dont want to die, so i will do my very best"" worked, then the Russian military would not be as dire, and the Russian spy network in Ukraine would maybe actually done its work, etc.

Also, to reiterate, construction is one of the best ways I know to hide corruption/theft, because once the concrete is poured, no one can find out what exactly you used, and how much money you stole, so youre pretty safe after the first couple months, which is one of the best propositions for corruption there is..",False,1659646970.0,t3_wfr7d9,t1_iiwfg8p,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

One last point I want to make though: Their credibility comes from stating things that are unpopular, even if they can serve as ammo for people who twist the meaning of their statements. Amnesty is not the arbiter of what choices they had and whether or not they were justified. That comes at the international criminal court, and they need to know what actually happened in order to make that judgment. If it weren't for the work that Amnesty International did in the Balkans, then the Srebrenica genocide might never have been prosecuted. If it wasn't for their work in Kosovo in 1998, we never would have been able to know how many Albanians were murdered by Serbian soldiers, and how many people were killed during the NATO bombing campaign. What they do is to document the situation on the ground, and offer their analysis on what the consequences are for the civilian population.",False,1659614244.0,t3_wfr7d9,t1_iiwi61v,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

Seriously, dude. You don’t use MOABs in territory you don’t have air dominance over because they’re *huge*. The aircraft that can carry them have to be so big as to be totally helpless against air defences. The US drop them from C-130s, for God’s sake.

Sure, Ukraine can possibly destroy these with a MOAB but that’s about as likely, and would require the same unlikely set of circumstances, as them destroying them with a nuke. The idea is stupid on its face, and you can feel free to ping me when Ukraine ever has a single MOAB in their inventory.
