Day 135 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was relatively quiet today, until the usual missile strike that is. They launched their missiles at a new time again, this time it was 9:40pm. We heard at least 5 explosions, but there might have been as much as 8, most of those missiles landed somewhere in oblast and caused fires. I don’t think any fires started in the city, but the burning smell was very strong here anyway.

Apparently yesterday not a single missile managed to get to Kharkiv, which is pretty weird, as we did hear at least 2 fairly loud explosions not that far away from us, it probably means that all of them landed somewhere in oblast. This is a first time a couple of weeks that we didn’t get hit by missiles.

And while Russians continue to fire their missiles at civilian infrastructure, their ammo depots continue to blow up. Just in the past day 5 of them were destroyed, and it looks like 2 more are currently exploding. The rate at which they are being destroyed is ramping up rapidly these past couple of days, it’s now multiple ammo dumps destroyed per day.

👉 Yesterday, despite russia declaring an ""operational pause"", NASA's fire observation satellite reported [notable fires](https://twitter.com/PhillipsPOBrien/status/1545121886228692994) all along the front lines from Kherson to Kharkiv indicating heavy shelling by both sides. Despite the unexpected flurry of activity, **no substantial territory changed hands**. 

👉 After seeing the activity reports today I've concluded that if there is indeed an ""operational pause"", the orders have not yet reached the front.  Or, more likely,  russia's definition of an ""operational pause"" is like their definition of a ""humanitarian corridor"".

👉 The big news of the day was that Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the UK, resigned his position.  While this is [not expected](
https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1545160678490644488) to affect the UK's relationship with Ukraine, the news was met with some sadness by Ukrainians who viewed Mr. Johnson as a staunch ally and friend.   Conversely, the news was met with joy by partisan russians, though one commenter noted it was akin to the joy of the condemned celebrating the death of the hangman before the new one is appointed.

👉 ""President"" putin made a few remarks of little import or consequence today, although he did say that ""we don't reject peace talks. But those who reject them should know that the further it goes, the harder it will be for them to negotiate with us"".  President Zelensky later [responded](https://twitter.com/RamCNN/status/1545155133855698944) that ""Ukraine will not give up territory for peace."" which is diplomatic speak for ""russian president go..."" well you know.

👉 Because this war has made me a logistics nerd, I'd like to mention that [the railway bridge in Kup'yans'k has been hit dead center today and is inoperable](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1545150511384608774). Kup'yans'k is an important railway town about a 90 minute drive NE of Izyum.  Because russia's army can't really operate without railway lines, this kind of news is just all kinds of wonderful.

👉 While Ukraine is busy blowing up russia's supply railroads, Ukraine and Romania [opened an old soviet-era rail line](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1545231696852910082).  This will give Ukraine a valuable route to begin exporting its grain. 

👉 While we were all under the impression Ukraine had 4 HIMARS systems, they [actually have nine](https://twitter.com/mattia_n/status/1545045981992914945).  Also remember that HIMARS gets all the press, but other countries are donating compatible MLRS systems as well.

👉 It's a bit of a formality, but Ukraine [planted its flag](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1544939786518949888.html) on Snake Island (also known as Ziminy Island).

👉 Today's interesting read is this interview with [retired Commander, US Army Europe, Ben Hodges](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1545079370611671042)

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has no clear war objectives and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: a draw that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

>As [Erna Petri, a German homemaker and mother of two,](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/world/europe/18holocaust.html) was driving home after grocery shopping, she saw six disheveled and seemingly scared children huddling together on the side of the road.1 It was the summer of 1943. And through word of mouth, Erna knew that a group of Jewish children had escaped from a train headed to a Nazi extermination center. It occurred to her that these children may have been a part of that group. She approached them and kindly invited them to come home with her. Once at her house, she gave them something to eat and reassured them that they would be safe. Then she asked them to go outside with her. In a wooded area by her house, she stood them one next to the other. Then she placed herself behind them, pulled out a gun, and shot each one of them in the back of the head.2 After the war, when asked how she could have engaged in such an incomprehensible act of cruelty against innocents, she replied:  
>  
>*I am unable to grasp at this time how in those days that I was in such a state as to conduct myself so brutally and reprehensibly—shooting Jewish children. However earlier... I had been so conditioned to fascism and the racial laws, which established a view towards the Jewish people. As was told to me, I had to destroy the Jews. It was from this mindset that I came to commit such a brutal act.3*  
>  
>Erna Petri’s crime reminds us that instances of mass atrocity have always been accompanied by communications campaigns designed to demonize the intended victims and inflame the passions/kill the conscience of would-be perpetrators.4 Erna Petri had done Adolf Hitler’s bidding. After seizing power in 1933, the Nazi dictator created theReichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda (Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) headed by Joseph Goebbels.5 The Ministry exercised strict control over all communications media in the Third Reich, including art, music, theater, films, books, radio, educational materials, and the press. The Nazis used this absolute power to bombard the German public with messages dehumanizing Jews and arousing hatred against them. Long before implementation of the Final Solution, anti-Semitic eliminationist rhetoric permeated National Socialist newspapers and figured prominently in official speeches, documentary films and leaflets.6 These materials depicted Jews as disease-carrying insects or vermin, tumors or tuberculosis that were infecting healthy Germans and thus had to be exterminated.

e61e3fa1c93925ba758ad08281b58b4b,vu1lgb,ifcguqb,"The tipping-point in the energy-technology battles happened just a few years ago. 



From the earliest days of the petroleum industry, up until just about 20 years ago, we humans got better and better at pulling oil out of the ground for less and less money. Every year, for decades, extraction costs went down, down, down. This was despite the fact that the easiest to extract oil was targeted first, and depleted. 



But the size of supertankers eventually hit their practical limit. The depths that we could drill to finally passed even the deepest deposits. The depth of ocean that we can drill from now covers practically everywhere. And always emptying the easy stuff first. The ever-downward trend in extraction costs turned around, and from here on out, barring some magical new invention, extraction costs for crude oil are only ever going to go up.


Meanwhile, the competition isn’t using up a finite resource. Sunshine and wind are as good as infinite. Harvesting solar power and wind power doesn’t make it harder to harvest them tomorrow. Every improvement in technology only improves competitiveness, forever.



Today, if you’re an energy investor, and you like money, the best way to spend your money is on PV-solar. Here, the rate of technological improvement is almost too fast. Investors are shy about sinking money in to something that has a life-cycle of decades when they might make even more money if they hold off for a couple of years. But the flood-gates have started to really open.




Russia knows all this. Oil is and always will be a money-maker. It’s usefulness for so many products, it’s usefulness for transportation energy, means that the demise of the fossil-fuel industry is not even on the horizon. But it’s not indispensable any more. Electric cars, electric trains, biologically derived polymers, etc. etc. etc., combined with alternative energy, have turned oil in to just another product that has to compete, just another product that we can live without if we have to, and Russia in to a country that we can live without if we have to.



For 100 years, the Soviet Union, and then Russia, and include OPEC in there as well, held a gun to the world’s head. Of course, they became accustomed to the money it made, so it became more of a Mexican standoff. But when solar-PV passed oil as the most lucrative energy investment, the Russian gun started leaking water, revealing it to be a squirt-gun.




After 100 years, the days of easy money and easy threats are over. Even just 10 years ago there would be no discussions about where Central Europe might find energy to replace Russian supplies, that option literally did not exist at any price. Most of the LNG infrastructure that could step in in an emergency didn’t exist. 


As we’re seeing, the threat is still very much alive, but it is becoming less and less for every passing day. It is my opinion that Vladimir Putin saw the writing on the wall. He saw that if there was any chance of his country wielding the weapon of energy extortion effectively, that chance was slipping away, and it was use-it or lose-it time for them.



I guess just becoming a normal country that does normal business and doesn’t try to extort and bully never crossed his mind. Nobody wanted to stop doing business with Russia, we just don’t want to do it with a gun to our head.",1657289742.0,1657289558.0,t3_vu1lgb,t3_vu1lgb,,0,54,0,54,0,0,

The market is never kind to a product with a fixed or rising cost when a competing product's prices is dropping, crossing the point of energy parity for equal cost pretty much dooms fossil fuels, not because they can't be used, but because it will cost more to use them then the alternatives.  It'll only be used in the rare cases where renewables can't bridge the gap, and that will be a quickly collapsing space as well.  


For now, that covers things like emergency energy for power grids and things like jet fuel, since planes aren't so easy to convert to electric power, yet.  But even those cases are fleeing.  Mega-batteries ( both chemical and mechanical ) can balance power grids, and solar energy can be used to make jet fuel.  The reality is the remaining lifespan of significant fossil fuel used is based entirely on how much we invest in new energy production and how quickly the old facilities go out of commission.  This can be done quickly or slowly, but with prices ever dropping for renewables, the incentive to make more gas/coal fired plants is dropping as well.  It's also an accelerating trend, as the more of something gets made there is usually a big upswing in production efficiency as there is incentive to do it and the money available to work out the details.  


Which will have a big effect on petro states and soon.  There will still be a market for petroleum products, that's for certain, but it won't be anything like the massive money bomb of the current fossil fuel industry.

You're right about the ""double-barrel HIMARS"", but that's only a real advantage if Ukraine is loading them up with M31A2 vs M30A2 weapons and switching between targets (one ""barrel"" is M31A2 and the other ""barrel"" is M30A2).

3. HIMARS has incredibly long range, hesitation in the beginning of the war could've been justified by the prospect of ukraine using them offensively to strike targets deep in russian territory that may or may not be linked to russia's war effort. The allies don't mind helping the little guy defend his home, but they do get squeemish about the prospect of them going on the offense.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog

> In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25 °C.

[snip]

> Modern scientific sources report that the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Douglas Melton, a biologist at Harvard University, said, ""If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you."" George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that ""If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out.""[3] In 2002 Victor H. Hutchison, a retired zoologist at the University of Oklahoma with a research interest in thermal relations of amphibians, said that ""The legend is entirely incorrect!"" He described how a critical thermal maximum for many frog species has been determined by contemporary research experiments: as the water is heated by about 2 °F (about 1 °C), per minute, the frog becomes increasingly active as it tries to escape, and eventually jumps out if it can.[4]",False,1657311708.0,t3_vu1lgb,t1_ifduoja,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

For about a month in the Donbass, the fighting was just atrocious for the Ukrainians -- they had little they could do to actually fight back because almost all of the ""combat"" was sitting in a foxhole, trench or bunker praying you didn't get hit with shrapnel. Ukraine was losing a lot of manpower for several weeks in June -- as many as 300 dead and another 700 wounded per day, according to UA leadership. Many of these dead were older people in their 40s and 50s who were recruited and conscripted into the Territorial Defense Force (reserves). Ukraine's military leadership does a very good job tightly controlling press about their losses. For a few weeks in June, though, they were conceding some fairly serious casualty rates that were markedly higher than the months prior in the war.

Now that Russia has culminated its forces and taken the initial Donbass territory it expended everything to capture, I think the tide will probably turn back to Ukraine for the next month or two. They have newer Western artillery weapons that are farther-range, and unlike the 90% of their artillery that is Soviet-produced, the Western stuff also has ammunition. But nobody knows for certain how well this will all hold up over time. Ukraine is still outnumbered 10 to 1 in artillery shots fired per day.

At this point I'm not sure whether Moscow even knows how much manpower it has, or what equipment works and what doesn't, and the over reliance on older weapons is coming across as a military that has so little faith in its own innovations, 

that they'd rather roll out a tank that was reliable 50 years ago, than risk rolling out the newest models in strength just to find mice in the electricals or drivers doing donuts when they try to turn around.

Hell, they had to cut back the Moscow parade and not even try for an air show, and that was a safe environment.

.
.
.

It's not that Russia is holding back before wiping the floor with Ukraine, it's more that Russia for whatever reason, started with bad tech, and quickly regressed backwards from there.

Artillery being the one thing that is actually being kept up to date, but still being built around 200 year old ideas such as building the army around cannons, rather than cannons supporting cavalry and infantry.

 Meanwhile, We've got Ukranians training on Salisbury Plain, and playing around with some of the better equipment we have on offer, albeit I'm not happy with the supply situation.

155s have so far been almost a cheat code, against fixed Russian positions, when you can keep them firing, and I'm hoping that we can get the thing with the Leopards sorted, while Slovakia are confident enough to be offering up MIG 29s.

YuunofYork narrowed the topic down to only Donbas. Neither your answer to him nor my answer to you deviated from that. You including the rest of UA two posts later is changing the topic by widening the definition of ""culmination"" from ""in Donbas"" to ""across all of UA"".

-> Your ""it"" has to mean Y. If it means X, you're asking a question *(""why is X wrong"")* which YuunofYork had just answered you *(""because Y is a counterexample to it"")*, which doesn't make any sense.
