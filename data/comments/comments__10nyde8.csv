Day 339-340 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday it was a mostly quiet day, but there were some missile launches from Belgorod aimed at Kupiansk, and by this point it‚Äôs a daily occurrence, they are just obsessed with shelling it for some reason. Today was a much less quiet day for us, as just recently, at 11pm, Russians fired yet another missile from Belgorod and this time they aimed at the center of Kharkiv, apparently there was also a second missile fired, but that one landed in Russia.

Those fucking bastards aimed at a 4-story apartment building in the center of the city, there are no military targets anywhere around, they specifically targeted civilians as usual. It was a direct hit with an S-300 missile, it destroyed the roof and half of the apartment on the last floor. As of now one person, an old woman, is confirmed dead and 3 more people are injured, some people might still be under the rubble and the rescue operation is ongoing.

Will Russians say that this apartment building was a valid military target because the old woman they killed was an undercover NATO general, like that hotel in Kyiv which they targeted and said it was a NATO military base? Well, Russians are already posting in their channels saying that we are the ones that hit our own apartment building with AA missiles because ‚ÄúS-300 can‚Äôt hit ground targets‚Äù despite them using those S-300 missiles to hit our cities daily for the past 8 months, which they started using after they ran out of their Iskanders while trying to destroy Kharkiv with them.

It's a tragedy that there are casualties from this strike, but at least it‚Äôs only 4 people and not more, like what happened in Dnipro recently. Good thing the S-300 is a pretty weak missile, it only has a 125-150kg warhead so it can‚Äôt level an entire building, unlike the Kh-22 which was used in Dnipro, which has a 1-ton warhead and can easily destroy an entire building. It also didn‚Äôt help that the apartment building that it hit was a panel building, which made it fold like a house of cards.

Quite apart from the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea in 2014 and the war in eastern Ukraine. What did the West do in response to the attacks on Ukraine? A few penalties.

And reconnected with reality at the right moments. Putin, on the other hand, has meanwhile completely lost his way. He thought his army was close to the strongest in the world. The Ukrainian armed forces have sufficiently demonstrated what to make of this. Putin also assumed that Russian-speaking Ukrainians would welcome his troops. It didn't happen that way.

In the civil war after the October Revolution of 1917, the Red Army, i.e., the Bolsheviks, fought against the White Army, which in turn were anti-communists, then there was the so-called Green Army, and there were also armed forces from various ethnic groups. To put it succinctly. It was a big mess.  
>

Aircraft are more flexible.

There is no reason to hold back ATACMS if F-16s are on the table. Otherwise all the West will do is create an incentive for Ukraine to do daring suicide-missions with the F-16 to destroy ammo depots deep into enemy territory. Those ammo depots simply need to go before the offensive in the South.

Putin is a master intimidator, a machiavellian villain whose particular specialty is creating a vague threat that he expertly uses to blackmail others. He honed that skill as the shrimpy street kid in post-war Leningrad where thrashings were just as common as black-out-drunk vets mumbling by the roadside. 

He rode that wave hard for 20 years, intimidating other countries into doing his bidding, intimidating his elites into unquestioning support, and intimidating his citizens into feeble obedience. In that reality a tiny application of force could have an outsided effect. He applied it ruthlessly and expertly. 

All that got shattered as soon as he revealed his hand on February 23, 2022. He is not and has never been a military strategists. His political skill does not translate to the battlefield. 

And that's why Russia's defeat is inevitable. Putin is still using his playground scares in Ukraine, desperate to believe that blowing up power plants and sending endless human waves to their deaths will somehow intimidate Ukraine to surrender. 

But the war that he stupidly plunged his country into can only be won by good commanders. It doesn't matter how a T-72 compares to a Leopard on paper. Individual bravery does not matter. Russia makes decent equipment and Russian individuals are just like anyone else. Sure their military has traditions. So what?

Their military has idiots for generals and one of history's biggest cases of Dunning-Kruger for commander-in-chief. USSR turned defeat into victory in WWII because they learned from their mistakes, innovated, did not shy away from discussing their failures, swapped out commanders, promoted based on merit, and had the entire Allied industrial juggernaut pumping lifeblood into their army.

Then they do so.  

The protest movement in Iran is unfortunately not a centralized one.  Neither around specific individuals or even specific demands.  It's basically BLM.  There is no office to send drones to or to coordinate attacks against the Rev Guard with.  These attacks are third party.  Maybe in a small way they're on the protesters' behalf, but not at their behest.  It's also uncertain how it helps them.

Germany learned all the wrong lessons from that, pretended this math did not exist or apply to them in WWII, and hence they ended up fighting longer, losing millions more men, and seeing their entire country turned into ruin.

This is just coming from an internet general but it looks like to me that they are fighting this way to grind down Russia's only advantage which is being willing to send men in and let them die over and over. This is the same way that Ukraine fought from about March through early September of 2022. Russia's troop numbers got so low that Ukraine went on an offensive and took huge chunks of land back. Russia had to do a mobilization to fill in their ranks so Ukraine went back to how they fought before their offensive.

It looks like Ukraine expects this to happen again so they are preparing for an offensive. To do that they want tanks, which they are getting, to break Russia's lines and to take heavily defended towns. They are also getting stuff like Bradleys, M113s, Bushmasters, Senators, BMP-1s, etc. Those would be what Ukraine needs to take ground after lines are broken.

I'm just going to guess here but I would expect Ukraine to continue doing exactly what they are doing now until they get all of that stuff in country. So I would expect Bakhmut to be lost by then but Ukraine wants Russia to fight for it.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,10nyde8,j6ge38z,"Honestly, it's hard to draw conclusions at this point. The Russians have been attacking the area in force for only about a week -- a length of time that totally pales in comparison to Bakhmut or any of their earlier offensives on Seversdonetsk, Izyum, Poposna, or Kharkiv/Sumy/Chernihiv/Kyiv.

While they did announce an ""offensive"" on the area, Western military experts did not observe a buildup of forces in that area consistent with that announcement. It's more likely that they are testing Ukrainian defenses to see if there are sizeable buildups of forces in the south. Russia wants to see if their pressure tactics at Bakhmut and Soledar are have a deletrious impact on the rest of the Ukrainian front line.

I think it's more likely that this was a probing operation to test Ukraine response time and defensive capability. A related goal could be to add more distractions to Ukraine's buildup of counter-offensive forces -- get them out of formation, scatter them along a longer length of the front line, and force Ukraine to commit more of them to defensive positions so that they can't gather into offensive formations.

The fact that they've already apparently abandoned this offensive is rather telling. They've taken way, way more losses at the Bakhmut area but never really stopped putting pressure on that area. If this truly was a grand offensive operation, they'd continue chucking a lot more men and tanks into that front.",False,1675048593.0,t3_10nyde8,t1_j6g9nav,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

This game Putin plays of saying Wagner has nothing to do with him is such an obvious lie. It couldn't exist without his permission. We know Wagner gets its orders direct from the GRU and supplies from the Russian military. They've even been seen mixed in with the regular troops.  

It's just a game to Putin, a game of plausible deniability. In his ultra paranoid KGB mind he thinks if it appears there's no direct link then he's OK. It does mean that Wagner troops will be left to be massacred if things go wrong.  

That happened once when some Wagner men came too close to an American camp. The Americans contacted their Russian counterpart and told them to pull back but they denied they even knew what they were talking about. The Wagner troops continued to encroach on the American camp so the Americans opened fire with everything they had. They picked up the radio chatter from that group as they panicked like hell upon realising that the Russian military had left them to die rather than to admit there was any link between them.  

Plausible deniability is also how the Kremlin power structure works. Putin makes a ""suggestion"" to a subordinate and they in turn ""suggest"" to their subordinate. Each layer down adds on a little more to impress their boss. It's like a kids game of whispers or telephone where the message at the top of the chain doesn't always match the final ""suggestion"" at the end of the chain.  

For example, Putin may ""suggest"" it would be good if he won an election with 85% of the votes. By the time everyone has interpreted the ""suggestion"" and added their bit extra to suck up to the boss, Putin may ""win"" with 95%.  

When the Soviet Union fell the only part of the government which survived mostly intact was the KGB which seized even more power and became the FSB. It's hardly surprising that you need links to the KGB or FSB to amount to anything in Russia.  

Ioffe said that the FSB are very unhappy with the current arrangements though. They're paranoid control freaks by nature and they've been told by Putin to leave Wagner alone. To make it worse, in their eyes, Wagner are linked to the GRU which are seen as rivals by the FSB.  

That's part of the reason why some people are very sceptical of Wagner being able to seize power from Putin as some are theorising. Putin also has many other loyal factions besides the FSB. Wagner only exists because Putin wills it to. He must see them as loyal or he'd never reward their boss with political power. That too is granted only by Putin. Putin has done the same with loyal bodyguards and even a loyal chef. I think Putin made one of them a mayor.",False,1675013684.0,t3_10nyde8,t1_j6cb0mo,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Yet here we are. Funny thing is that in this ""mainstream"" report we do, as you say, have very little in the way of named and defined sources, and they use the familiar euphemisms to label them. However some guy on Twitter, claiming to be close to the story, will often present a more fixed picture. Sounds good, but the guy on Twitter is, conversely, also much more likely to be some combination of overconfident, overstating, incompetent or just wrong this time, having no big news organization with standards to be accountable to. The Twitter source may also be actually compromised in some way, either directly insincere or manipulated by an insincere actor feeding them misinformation. 

It's a dilemma. Do we take in a vaguer, less specific source with less overall information or a source with more specific claims that is more likely to be incorrect? I think the lure to have secret information to set oneself apart and make ones analysis therefore special is a powerful pull, resulting in motivated thinking.

It's also possible that the Abrams announcement from the US was made to provide cover for training soldiers on Abrams tanks that will be acquired elsewhere.

Just as a thought experiment, suppose that Egypt, say, has agreed to sell some Abrams tanks to UA, but they don't want Russia to know about it right now. They also don't have the ability to train the Ukrainians. So, the US announces the ""combined arms training"" development, then they announce the Abrams being provided. Journalists and spies can report that they've seen Ukrainians training on Abrams, and everyone will say ""So what? Of course they are.""

That they have. But that appears to be because they believe the tactics at Bakhmut are working.

Across all three main fronts (Luhansk, Donetsk/Bakhmut, and Zaporozhne) they appear to be shifting their tactics from squad and artillery reconnaissance to mass wave rushes.

These tactics do have at least somewhat of a noticeable effect on Ukraine because it is forcing Ukrainian artillery and infantry emplacements to expose themselves in order to kill the mass advance. It's also highly costly on Ukraine's ammunition. Western leaders are going to become increasingly alarmed with that second point in particular. It's going to be years before the US and other Western military producers can replace the donated ammunition we are doling out, and it'll take even longer to get production to a point where we can keep the Ukrainians healthily stocked.

The Korean war never actually ended.

When they kicked the Russians out of the ""mainland"" back across the river, the worst case part of me thought ""ok, so Russia claims the east side of the river, and Ukraine hacks away at it to take it back""

Or maybe they just say, fine, keep the rubble, and we will fortify the western portions with NATO gear so this will never happen again.

I think it depends on a) how much tolerance for war the Ukranians have (so far it seems like a lot)

b) if the west really is just bleeding Russia dry, or if they will step it up to ""shut it down""

c) Russia see's the above, declares ""victory"" by taking the Donbass, and withdraws to regroup.

Watching those Russian propaganda video's, the narrative has shifted from a) freeing our Ukranian brothers from Nazi's, to now a complete holy war against the West, who is trying to destroy Russia.

This was the situation in Kherson for four straight months, and the Russians still destroyed dozens of Ukrainian tanks, hundreds of Ukrainian IFVs and APCs, hundreds of trucks and jeeps, and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers -- primarily with pre-sighted artillery kill zones when the Ukrainians attacked in armored and mechanized platoons. You can watch videos of 10+ Ukrainian tanks and IFVs blowing up in seconds when pre-sighted grad rockets land on their positions. This happened many times over the course of Ukraine's slow, grinding push through the Kherson salient. You could have replaced all those Soviet vehicles with Abrams and Bradleys, and the losses for Ukraine would still have been very high.

This war has been incredibly bloody for the Ukrainians, and it will be even bloodier for them in 2023, even with the additional Western aid.

It's a difficult thing to look for because when you type in any variation of ""Ukrainian tank losses,"" 99% of the Google returns are about how many tanks Russia has lost in Ukraine.

The only good source I could find that is kept up to date through January 2023 is the Oryx site. Here is their page for [Ukrainian vehicle losses](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html).

They have photographic evidence confirming 454 Ukrainian tank losses, and 261 ""armored fighting vehicles,"" 471 ""infantry fighting vehicles,"" and 225 ""armored personnel carriers.""

Of those losses, the losses from destruction (as opposed to capture or damage) are: 270 tanks, 175 AFVs, 333 IFVs, and 122 APCs.

So it probably is under 1,000 tanks. We can't know exactly how many tanks were bombed or knocked out in storage, but I wouldn't argue we should count those anyway since we're talking about the ease with which Ukraine could or could not lose tanks on the battlefield itself.

Still, I would encourage people to view these losses soberly. 300 destroyed BMPs and 260 destroyed T-62, T-64s and T-72s is not a laughing matter. And those are only confirmed photographs of destroyed Ukrainian armored vehicles.
