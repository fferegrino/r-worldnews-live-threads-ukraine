Day 303 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a mostly quiet day, but around 11:30pm some explosions were reported, though we don’t know what they were, because there were no missile launches from Belgorod today and air raid alert was not active at the time. Some people said that it sounded more like outgoing artillery shots, which could be the case, but we rarely hear those here, because most of our artillery is stationed closer to the border.

There is a really high chance of a new big missile strike happening in the next couple of days, maybe even tomorrow, because they will obviously want to bomb us on Christmas so that we would have no electricity during it. Hopefully our air defense is ready for it, it definitely does better every new missile strike that happens, so eventually there will be a time when over 90% of missiles will be getting shot down.

Russian propagandists on their TV channels are already openly threatening Kazakhstan, saying that conflict with them is inevitable. And of course, they are using their favorite reason for why they have to invade them, because they have “American biolabs”, the same ones we apparently have, so they have to invade Kazakhstan to destroy them. It’s funny that they think starting another war will help them not lose this one, and I don’t think China will ever let them attack Kazakhstan, though that might not stop Russia from trying anyway.

The accreditation of Danish journalist Mathilde Kimer was canceled due to violation of the requirements of the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 73 of March 3, 2022. This was reported by a source in the Security Service of Ukraine.

According to an employee of the Security Service of Ukraine, who asked not to be named for security reasons, the reason for the deprivation of accreditation was the arrival of the journalist in Mykolaiv in July 2022. ""There she found herself in a place where she should not have been and tried to shoot a report about weapons, which cannot even be talked about,"" the source said. The military themselves asked the SBU to check the journalist after the incident, the officer said. After the check, the SBU recommended to the Army Public Relations Department to strip Kimer of her accreditation.

""We also have information that she was in the occupied parts of Ukraine, in particular in Crimea and Donetsk/Luhansk regions, in violation of Ukrainian legislation,"" the source said.

Roughly 100k troops, 3k tanks, 6k APCs

On average Russia has lost roughly 300 troops, 10 tanks and 20 APCs a day for the last 303 days.

What is interesting are the trends.

We usually see much less than 10 tanks and 20 APCs being lost in a day now. I assume this is because they are running out.

While for the last month we’ve seen over 500 Russian troops lost per day. This is more than 60% than the long term average. 

I interpret these trends as a sign of Russia’s desperation. 

The equipment losses aren’t going down because Russia is getting smarter or taking less risks. If that were the case troop losses would be going down.

Instead, troop losses are increasing. If anything, Russia is taking MORE risks and becoming MORE aggressive.

The equipment losses are going down because the troops who are dying aren’t as well equipped. The most likely reason for this is Russia is starting to run out of tanks and APCs.

No one knows how big Russia’s equipment reserves are, but we are now seeing clear signals they are starting to run low. It’s hard to say how bad this problem is for Russia right now, but it safe to say it will be disastrous for them in another 300 days.

Ukraine is winning this war.

But never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.

Context why I'm writing this:

Igor ""Strelkov"" Girkin warns that this would end badly for Russian forces (he is right).
Moreover to what he said, I see the Belarus Army as an additional Achilles heel. They will not fight for Putin and might quickly turn their guns around.

For those claiming that the activities in Belarus might force Ukrainian troops to be allocated there. AFU never put their guard down. The entire 5th Army is positioned there. It is certainly not the strongest part of AFU but their job is to delay and obstruct until help arrives.

> The main strike is planned in the Lutsk direction. The **first targets are the cities of Sarny and Kovel.** According to information from army officers in Belarus, due to the terrain (swamps, forests, small non-freezing rivers, narrow semi-flooded roads), the infantry will advance almost without the support of equipment at the first stage.

> “The technology just won't work there. The border area is all pitted with ditches, part of the territory is flooded, roads are torn down. That's why they caught up with assault units from everywhere. The solution will be infantry offensives with light armored vehicles and under the cover of aviation and artillery. Ammunition is enough. It was accumulated. The DPR has been complaining about the lack of shells since October, it's not a famine, they just brought it here, and Belarusian stocks from warehouses are also used,” says an army officer stationed in the Brest region.

> The equipment, according to sources, is planned to be transferred after Sarny is captured. This is a **major railway junction**. There is a branch road from Brest to the city. According to the plan described by our interlocutors in the RF Armed Forces, after the capture of Sarny and the repair of the railway, tanks and self-propelled guns will be transported in trains from Brest in order to further advance on Lutsk, already with the support of heavy combat vehicles.

> There is no railway line from Belarus to Kovel, but there are local lines on which diesel trains run, therefore, for several infantry formations, the village of Zabolotye, where there is a station of such a small branch, is designated as a target.

Russia seems genuinely unable to settle on a political tactic.

It might be due to infighting, but it looks more like panic.

In their haste they are losing their cohesion.

This is leading to a large number of disparate messages coming from different agencies that end up conflicting and cutting across each other.

The recruiting guys are putting out videos saying mobilisation is the only way out of poverty as the finance guys are saying the economy is stable.

This is only news to the world that gets their news from Russia second- and third-hand, after it has been filtered and translated.

This has been a prevailing view of the Russian elites for decades. Putin might have been careful not to say it outright but he's certainly been wolf-whistling it throughout his presidency.

> and elevate him into a pantheon of conquering czarist leaders such as Peter the Great.

Also not entirely new. Previously Putin would just have Zhirinovsky say this shit for him.

The situation seemed quite tense at the end of October (the flurry of diplomatic activity around Russia’s claim that Ukraine was about to deploy a dirty bomb), and then again in mid November with the uncertainty around the Russian missile that was first thought to have landed on NATO territory in Poland - just because something that was forecast to happen with 10% probability in the end didn’t happen in no way invalidates the initial forecast.

The specter of nuclear annihilation today looms larger than it has in half a century, perhaps larger than it has ever - this is what Joe Biden, the US military and everyone tasked with keeping this specter at bay has confirmed multiple times, and claiming otherwise is simply in bad faith. 

This is the true price of our continued support of Ukraine, and for now the powers that be seem to have decided that this price is worth being paid - but it is a delicate balance that we should never forget and continuously reassess, anyone who claims otherwise and aims to belittle this threat is most certainly not acting in the best interest of the Western world.",1671850380.0,1671849627.0,t3_zt5vi3,t1_j1g6o3c,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Losses in general are less when your troops are in pre-made defensive positions. We see lots of drone dropped grenade videos, but I’m assuming they don’t represent the bulk of Russian losses.

I also agree with you that tanks are used mostly for offensive pushes.

However, the increasing numbers of Russian troops being killed every day is not a sign of more defensive posturing from Russia. 

If Russians were staying in their trenches more, there would be less troop losses, and in that case, I’d agree with you, the increased ratio of troops vs tank losses would indeed reflect the conflict moving to trench warfare.

But that is not what is happening. Instead, Russia’s increased troop losses suggest it is continuing to constantly launch attacks. 

The majority of Russias losses is continuing to be in offensives and the RATIO of men to tank losses has increased as well.

Rather, it seems that Russia has changed the make up of its offensive pushes. With more men and less tanks.

Why? It might be because they hate mobliks and the Russian leaders want them to die, but that seems farfetched (except possibly with regard to penal companies). Despite the rhetoric, I don’t believe Russian generals see huge troop losses as a desirable outcome.

No, the far more likely scenario is Russia is not willing to let up the pace of attacks for political reasons (read: Putin is panicking), but they don’t have the resources to equip them as well (read: the Russians are running out of equipment).

The current deaths seem to be more a reflection of them attacking with less well equipped units.

Russian losses have varied previously in this war. They were greater in the start of the war, and reduced over the first 6 months, but the RATIO of lost tanks vs men has been relatively stable.

This ratio has changed significantly now, and it seems to be due to the Russian army being less well equiped.",1671835103.0,1671831532.0,t3_zt5vi3,t1_j1f4iu9,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

On December 7, 1939, the Soviet 163rd Rifle Division captured Suomussalmi, but found itself trapped deep inside Finnish territory, and the Soviet 44th Rifle Division was sent to aid the 163rd. Over the next week, Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo's outnumbered 9th Division stopped and decisively defeated the Soviet forces on the Raate-Suomussalmi road.

Unlikely. It's standard practice for any telco to have a certain amount of replacement parts on hand, but nobody is ""stockpiling"", as this represents expensive inventory that isn't doing much normally speaking. I wouldn't be surprised that as the threat of sanctions loomed, additional orders would have been made, but even then they'd only be able to get whatever the manufacturer would have in inventory themselves.

> and will manage to smuggle them through other countries.

More likely, but also risky. Generally speaking entities dealing with this type of telecom equipment are heavily regulated and audited. Nokia for example can't *knowingly* sell parts to someone they think might resell to Russia. So if their books suddenly show a 500% increase of shipments to a new customer in Turkey, there will be questions from external auditors that they have to answer. Same goes for any established Telco in the US/Europe. 

> Software updates will be relatively trivial to steal/copy from a legitimate customer elsewhere.

Absolutely ludicrous. These backend systems aren't an appliance you update an app on. Such updates need to be planned out months in advance and often require support from a manufacturer. If you are a large telecom operator, it's very possible you even have custom firmware for certain types of devices.
