China’s embassy in Ukraine has told its citizens and companies to refrain from travelling to “areas where the situation remains uncertain”, the Guardian’s Vincent Ni reports.

The embassy also advised Ukraine-based Chinese citizens to stock up on daily necessities such as food and drinking water.

In the short warning posted on the Chinese embassy in Kyiv’s website and its Wechat account, the embassy did not mention the latest development. Rather, it said the situation in eastern Ukraine “has had significant changes”.

The rare warning comes as Russia recognised the Russian-controlled territories in southeast Ukraine as independent states.

The countries below are officially within NATO (30)

Not even Putin is brave (or dumb) enough to hit a nato country, if he does that he declares war on 30 nations standing as one, including US. Not even China aiding russia would win that war (without nuclear means)

Can WW3 be ruled out? Nope, war has a way of getting out of hand really really quickly. But I think if the war would start to spill into nato borders, there would be swift diplomatic resolutions in that situation.

The only real thing they'll respond to is a show of strength, that apparently no one seems to want to take the first step towards because it means a possible escalation and yes, possibly war, which no one wants except Russia.  Clearly Russia believes that the doorstep to their country is a good place for a conflict, really think about why they would risk this incursion, they know sanctions will be imposed they're not stupid, and they still press on.  Conflict is the only way this ends, because that's what Russia wants, to stir a new generation of brainwashed countrymen and build a foundation on hate for the west, its a cycle that was doomed to repeat ever since the end of the cold war.  Putin has been consolidating power for decades and he has every chess piece positioned tight to cover all angles, the world won't talk their way out of this conflict.

The important question is are we all willing to endure higher energy prices for a decade to stop international law from being violated?

I'm not saying I have the answer or that the spirit of what you and the folks you know are saying isn't in the right place. But when push comes to shove, most folks probably will be more upset if gas hits $5 USD/gal. And then you have politicians running on promising to drop the price at the pump. How does that happen? Either by drilling more at home, currying more favor with OPEC nations, or easing sanctions on Russia and allowing them to be competitive globally again.

None of those things help prevent the current situation from repeating next time Putin wants to copy/paste his narrative. None of those things help the world work towards ending its reliance on fossil fuels.

It sucks that everything has so many consequences and that there is more at play than the actual invasion. It really does. I wish it were simpler. The decisions of a few affect the lives of the many. And often those few cloak themselves in righteous impunity, to the pain and suffering of the many.

He wants the international community to escape from the legacy of those empires, which is to say work together cooperatively rather than war with one another for individual benefit.

It’s a half step to full on invasion.,False,1645507206.0,t3_sya4x3,t1_hxxhbe5,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
f20c7007bd53b927cf7ed5c08059c72a,sya4x3,hxxk6ve,"Even the Ukrainians know that they are not popular in the separatist areas among the general population. Soldiers have reported many people on the Ukrainian side of the frontline either don't like to talk to them or support their presence in public, or just straight up inform on their positions/equipment/numbers to the enemy, or even steal resources from them. 

Like it or not, if the Ukrainian government was actually popular in these neglected areas, the revolution would not have created successful states and the Ukrainian Army would have crushed the tiny opposition. Refugees would have fled the area in droves if they thought their livelihoods were going to be worse off as independents or under Russia
They don't have animosity to the Ukrainian people, but they seek independence. 
Nothing about what has happened makes the Ukraine government entitled to govern these people if the people do not wish it. At the very least, Russia will grant them autonomy and material support in exchange for operating military bases there. 

Previously, Putin was actually hesitant to recognise the republics as independent territories under law and in diplomacy. If you hear what the Russian officials said in the theatrical security council meeting, they said that Ukraine had no solution for the republics, and no course of action under the Minsk agreement to improve the situation of people there - they simply wanted the territory back because they thought the land and the people there were intrinsically theirs. 

Russia argued that Russia should not be the ones to develop solutions to the livelihoods and future of the region, of which Ukraine will always disagree anyway, and always turn back to Russia to ""make the solution"" to the problem Russia supposedly caused... Ukraine government's own corruption and systemic problems notwithstanding. What Ukraine really just repeated was ""give us permission to go and arrest all the terrorists there - there are no social problems to address and if there are, they're not our fault."". 

All peoples in the world are entitled to their self-determination and independence whether outsiders personally agree, are they not? 
This is why the U.S has pulled back on the rhetoric now, as reality is settling in, and countries must also leave some sanctions on the table in case Russia goes for a full invasion and occupation as the U.S has been saying all week that they would. 

Look at the Chinese point of view which is neutral on the particular issue of Ukraine and Russia (and don't read into this regarding China's domestic separatism) - they affirmed their belief that all people are entitled to their self-determination and to form their own governments. In terms of domestic issues, even fully developed Western countries will never allow parts of their nation to become separated and independent by popular vote.

Nothing was invaded because Ukraine didn't control these areas, and was incapable of stopping the revolution in the first place. Ukraine was NEVER going to control these separatist areas again without committing human rights violations and mass arrests.",1645509052.0,1645508756.0,t3_sya4x3,t1_hxxhbe5,,1,-2,0,-2,0,0,

I really don't think it was ultimately feasible. Everybody was pretty war-weary, and the US was dropping atom bombs to prevent further US casualties. 

If anything it would have just bred further resentment, death, and destruction. But, if the USSR was coaxed into terms, (though I doubt it would have been a total defeat or unconditional surrender), I think we'd just see a united Germany and maybe some other free bloc countries like Poland. 

But it would be a total escalation, there wouldn't be much good will or trust left, the remaining USSR controlled areas (and most likely inevitable collapse into Russia) would have a VERY lasting memory of the Allies betraying them and using the Germans against them. If anything, the situations we are facing today would be much worse with guns pointed everywhere, but instead of the Cold War where fingers were off the triggers, people would be slowly squeezing them in anticipation. 

That's not even taking into account the actual military feasibility of it. The Germans were absolutely spent. Not much reliable manpower to resort to, Nazi hardliners would take it as justification for their actions and would vie for political/military power, not to mention the whole holocaust hanging over everyone, and the US would actively be arming those same people and sending them back into combat. Any morality would be gone in the US's favor. Nuking Japan, rearming the Wehrmacht, betraying an 'ally', probably nuking them too, yeah not great. 

Wehraboo dream though, wet dream of guys like Guderian and Manstein as well, and those aren't quite the guys I'd like to be pleasing. Stalin was also a madman himself, and giving him more fuel to stoke the fires of his paranoia wouldn't be great. 

That's just my armchair historian 2 cents. The only people who would be sorta happy in that situation is Nazi hardliners and guys like Patton and MacArthur. Patton probably was better off dying when he did to be remembered fondly (despite his own pretty shit views on race) and MacArthur still wanted to go drop some bombs on China and we still deal with the fallout (hah) of that in China/North Korea relations today.",False,1645506721.0,t3_sya4x3,t1_hxxe8sx,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

NATO is approaching this as a proxy war.  Nobody wants to put their neck out, and it's showing issues in the alliance.

What changes that?  If Russia strikes at Kiev, we could see some major escalation.  Russia also knows that.  It becomes a no-win conflict, emboldens NATO, and gaurantees more eastern bloc members.


Neither Russia or NATO wants that full clash.  It's concessions and posturing all the way down.

So think through how Putin wins.  Russia's win here is: they claim the regions, and NATO has cracks exposed via the response.  He wins by playing this slowly and letting media, and individual countries eat at each other.  

They win by us having shitty discord here.  Literally.  A part of the polarization here, or anywhere, leads to a Russian win.  It shakes confidence in our established partnerships.  Then they slow walk it again later.

For instance, my family and some friends all live in Eastern Ukraine and they are all staying put, prepared to fight with whatever they have. My uncle volunteered to join the army back in 2014 and is now a veteran. My family and friends have been working on humanitarian outreach to the war-torn areas for the past 7 or so years. As we speak a family friend is literally in the war zone with a group of volunteers(drove there in their own van with no military entourage or anything) helping move some orphaned kids to western Ukraine by way of my hometown of Kharkiv. The Ukrainian diaspora of which i am part of has been copllecting and sending money and supplies to the troops for the past 8 years.

Russia mass rocket-artillery is a different story of course. The rocket-trucks will be long gone by the time the counter-artillery starts shooting back (much faster at shoot/scoot). But rocket-artillery is a lot more expensive, Russia won't be able to sustainably afford a push like that.

Look at Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow and his obsession with Guinness world records. Or his bogus attempt to organise his own “Olympic games”. Same national pride can be found in other countries of repressive regimes. Look at China and their need to organise olympics. These dictators use sports as cement for national pride in their population. Sochi and Russian attempt to be the best in everything thanks to doping is another example. People in Russia are poor, soviet era taught them to survive on scraps. I am from Slovakia and people there are poor as well and no one is doing anything about it, because our pilot Ian’s are running on national pride and defeating our adversaries in what ever is possible. No economic sanctions will deter them from their national pride. 

In reality no international actor really cares about Turkmenistan. But if we hit these other big countries in their pride and they’ll be pushed to compete just against each other and not against their “enemies”, I believe we could manage some results.

Of course port blockade could work as well, I just believe that we live in world where Russia could do well even without European ports and economic. China is there always to help. And once they manage to finish gas pipeline to China, they wouldn’t have issues with europe at all

 >The Phoney War (French: Drôle de guerre; German: Sitzkrieg) was an eight-month period at the start of World War II, during which there was only one limited military land operation on the Western Front, when French troops invaded Germany's Saar district. Nazi Germany carried out the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939; the Phoney period began with the declaration of war by the United Kingdom and France against Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, after which little actual warfare occurred, and ended with the German invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940.

If an advanced air defense system—such as the U.S. Patriot, Israeli David’s Sling, or British Sky Saber—was provided immediately as part of a lend-lease program, Ukraine could significantly increase its air defense capabilities. These systems could be accompanied by civilian contractors hired by the Ukrainian government to man and maintain these systems.""

80766093aaa61f8ec582626f273bad96,sya4x3,hxxjwgu,"I get that - but you are thinking like an American would, not a Russian.  As an American, our wars have always been at a distance (at least since the Civil War), far off affairs that saw a lot of our people killed, but the homeland rarely being touched.  To the Russians, that devastation came right up to their front door, and saw death and destruction dished out on a scale we can hardly comprehend in the West.

That innate urge to push borders West from Russia's perspective is due to historical experience.  Does nuclear war change the game?  Perhaps.  So far, MAD has worked in deterring a nuclear exchange, but at some point in time, somewhere, we're going to see a conventional war develop to the point where a side being invaded will need to use tactical nuclear weapons to hold the line.  Either they will, in which case escalation is all but assured, in which case everyone loses... or they won't, and the invaded may live to fight another day while living under the boot of the invader for some period of time.

We need to realize something else here - MAD has never been tested in a live-fire war between nuclear powers.  US-China in the Korean War only saw the US side with nuclear weapons, and since then we've avoided butting heads with China/Russia directly.  Nuclear weapons are only effective deterrents if they're used, and if they're used, then they're no longer deterrents.

TLDR - Nuclear weapons may have changed the game, or they might be a bluff that neither side wants to risk using.  We're probably going to find out in the next 10-20 years which way the (hopefully not radioactive) wind is blowing.

 >Operation Unthinkable was the name given to two related possible future war plans by the British Chiefs of Staff against the Soviet Union in 1945. The plans were never approved nor implemented. The creation of the plans was ordered by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in May 1945 and developed by the British Armed Forces' Joint Planning Staff in May 1945 at the end of World War II in Europe. One plan assumed a surprise attack on the Soviet forces stationed in Germany to ""impose the will of the Western Allies"" on the Soviets.

The west suffers momentarily because their gas and oil supplies will be at higher demand, creating a more ""limited supply""(not really, US reserves alone are massive) and driving the price up. Other things, such as neon essential for semiconductors, will also be almost completely within Russias control and therefore of limited supply to the west, driving prices of those up farther. There's a few other things that go along those lines. 

But Russia has very few total monopolies on anything in the world of global trade, as long as their is a buyer their will be a seller. So the buyers will be buying more expensive for a bit but will still be able to buy and thrive, and the price will stabilize once the global supply chain resettles. 

Meanwhile, if the rest of the world is cut off from Russia and works it out (which they will) Russia will have lost all western buyers for the foreseeable future, which can't be easily or realistically replaced.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

It would be suicide to use them because nukes cant effectively destroy an enemy, ive made the calculation many times, but its simply impossible to destroy NATO by using all of Russian nukes. Something like city of Los Angeles would take around 90 nukes to destroy. Russia has 2000. It has to target many thousands of locations around the world, not just in the US. (you can do the math yourself, Land on Earth is 200 million square miles. Nuke affects area of 400 square miles, of total land on Earth 0.4% would be affected if every nuke is launched, land will be habitable within 100 years).

So nukes are simply not effective to wage war. They are great for threat through. But using them will only ensure your country loses its military for 100 years, is splintered like post WW2 Germany.

As for the ""steps"", I guess the only thing I can say about that is, we simply don't want another European War and are doing everything we can to avoid it, but I do not believe the West will allow Russia to roll its tanks throughout Eastern Europe without there being a direct NATO conflict with Russia.
