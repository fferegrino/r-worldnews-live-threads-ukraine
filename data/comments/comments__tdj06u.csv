Day 18 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Most of the day was pretty quiet, other than constant air raid alerts, but starting at around 10-11 pm sound of explosions became constant. For us they were distant, but apparently around the same time Saltivka district was under heavy shelling again, most likely that is where the sound was coming from. There were reports of intense fighting around Kharkiv when shelling was happening.

Just 10 minutes ago we heard what sounded like mortar or something bigger being fired extremely close to us couple of times and the sound was moving between shots, actually we’ve been hearing that exact sound for the past couple of days, every time from different places. 

Most likely that was our army’s doing, but the sound itself is still very startling each time it happens, the echo it creates with each shot is intense. Right now it’s quiet again, hopefully for a long time.

If it is true Putin won’t negotiate, I’d say that’s a good indication as any that he’s well aware that his domestic situation is precarious — he’s fighting a losing battle. Prolonging this weakens his position each day. 

He either wins this war or he’s deposed. 

I also think this is a very strong indication that despite his threats, nuclear war is off the table, as his attempts to negotiate with China means that the use of nuclear arms with scuttle any deal, back channel or otherwise between the two countries. 

The issue, however, is now civilian lives. He cannot go to the negotiation table without enough of a bargaining position to make demands. So until he has that position or flat out loses, civilian lives will continue to be in the middle of this war and their suffering will be more pronounced and total.

Several of them are maybe not ""pro Putin""; but clearly have absorbed some of the Duginist anti-Ukraine propaganda.  (Likely FoxNews). 

When they started talking about ""Ukrainian extremists"" or how ""the Ukraine was never really it's own country"" - all I really had to do was tell them to crack open a history book: that Ukraine and Russia ALWAYS had different languages, but no WRITTEN language, (or pretty incomplete and fragmented languages), and that it was the Greek; Cyril, who created an alphabet for them to use.  (didn't make it to Finland, obviously).  

When Russian propaganda talks about a ""made up language difference"" - this is what they mean.  While those regions were geographically close, and there was always trade and exchange, and the religions were shared, and language origins were reasonably closely related (barring the dozens of different groups that settled or invaded over the centuries) - they're definitely distinct and separate languages.  This is literally why Ukraine had come to be a separate nation, prior to World War I, even if it had fallen under Russian Imperial control. 

Even more recently, I shared what is very common historical knowledge of what the Soviets did to Ukraine in the last century. The holodomor genocide, the mass-deportations, and theft of property by Russians. 

This seemed to elicit facial expressions of . . . ""hmmmm?"" and some thoughtful questions.  But no real response that remained in defense of the Russian invasion.

It's relatively trivial to de-fuse the current propaganda, for most Americans.  I'm not even remotely sure how the Putin propaganda even slightly works on people who live there, and who have been educated in their own countries' histories; or who have relatives or friends across the border.

No one will be able to say ""we didn't know"" this time. The villages are being burned now, not buried. The concentration camps are being built, not demolished. The war you say you don't want is already here.

Some two years after Grozny 2 and two years before Grozny 3, an article appeared in the authoritative Russian military journal Military Thought.

Titled ""New Views on Urban Combat,"" the article addressed several key considerations for MOUT operations. In hindsight, the article offered an incisive look into future Russian MOUT strategy and tactics.

The article highlighted the requirement first to block a city and concentrate around it a large force with the assets to impose psychological intimidation. These included the use of ultimatums.

The Russians issued a number of ultimatums via leaflets during the 2000 battle for Grozny.

Second, if a peaceful settlement appears impossible, the article called for a special operation to capture the city after civilians have left.

This operation would require both MVD and armed forces special detachments, such as OMON, GRU, and SOBR forces. These forces served as the advance guard, and were supplemented by the Chechen force of former Grozny Mayor Bislan Gantamirov.

Third, it would be necessary to supply the force with non-lethal weapons. Obviously, this was not done. ***The potential use of chemical weapons or chlorine bombs was continuously threatened, but no significant use of these weapons was made by either side.***

Fourth, it would be necessary to identify precisely the lines of contact between friendly troops and enemy forces in any future MOUT operation. Pagers were suggested for this process, but it was more successfully accomplished through the use of radar signatures.

Fifth, it was recommended to use the full potential of army aviation. Helicopter use and aviation assets of the air force were deployed much more widely in the 2000 battle for Grozny than earlier.

Finally, advancing troops must understand the basics of working with radio cables, water and gas mains, seismic sensors, and other devices in the city. This meant much more preparatory work in mock towns and participation in tactical exercises than in the past.

The Russians did conduct several exercises in preparation for entering Chechnya, but it is unknown just how thorough their preparation was for MOUT.",False,1647249475.0,t3_tdj06u,t3_tdj06u,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

But according to 60 minutes he is likely to run again in 2024 when the United States has new elections and if he wins could have major influences on the types of aid that Ukraine does or does not get, and the types of sanctions that do or do not land on Russia. The prospect of him running is really scary because I think it could cause so much division in and of itself, but especially in light of an ongoing and protracted war in Ukraine. He is exactly the worst person to run in any party, and I don't even know all the other parties.",False,1647214311.0,t3_tdj06u,t3_tdj06u,,0,74,0,74,0,0,

>In Perm, OMON fighters who died during the special operation in Donbass were buried, and hundreds of people came to pay their last respects.

Eternal memory and glory to our heroes.”

[…]

> Police Major General Boris Borodavin, Head of the Federal Guard Service of the Perm Territory also addressed the audience. “Today we bid our comrades farewell. **They were true professionals, patriots of their country, honest and decent officers who remained true to their oaths, and at the cost of their lives fulfilled their duty to the end.** We have suffered grievous and irreparable losses . . . **By presidential decree our young men have been posthumously awarded the Order of Courage for their courage and self-sacrifice.** I express my sincere condolences to their families and friends…”

What China says to the international audience isn't the same as what they're telling the domestic audience at home. The words from their foreign minister that we see translated into English are leaning towards Russia's side or neutral at best, that are borderline acceptable to the global community. So even if sometimes on the surface they appear to be
playing peacemaker, behind the scenes they are driving the information war in Russia's favor.

The disinformation they spread to their own people is pro-Russia. On CCTV state media when they discuss the origin of the 'conflict' it's always about how The West started the whole thing, and never stating the obvious that RUSSIA THE AGGRESSOR INVADED another sovereign country. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg, it gets even crazier than that.

China is explicitly anti-imperialist and anti-warmongering. They have consistently said this for several generations. Venezuela, Cuba, Syria, Iran have also maintained this position. Yet they are all in support of Russia and say that the Ukrainians are the imperialists. 

Russia's motivation is one of the most straightforward, old fashioned, 1800s style imperial motivations the world has seen in a long time. Russia doesn't recognize Ukraine's statehood, it is not treaty-worthy, and the land now belongs to Russia. This should trigger Chinese PTSD but it doesn't. 

Communist and former communist countries have railed against this mindset for generations, because they were all victims of it. Yet here we are, in 2022, and these countries support Russia and say that Ukraine, victim of the most obvious and explicitly stated imperial attack of this century, is the imperialist.

Also non interventionism and appeasement contrary to popular belief only push humanity forward to nuclear war and ww3 instead of preventing it like the non interventionists and appeasers suggest. We know that from the example of Hitler.

When Hitler starting rearming Germany and taking the sudenttenland he was surprised at the non interventionism and appeasement of European powers. He took this as a sign of weakness and then invaded Poland and France and started ww2. Why did Europeans back then show appeasement and non interventionism? Because they were afraid of another ww1 and they didn't want another 100 million dead. Similar to how the putinist non interventionists and appeasers are saying right now ""dude do you want ww3 and nuclear war"" people back them were saying ""dude do you want another ww1 or ww2"". And Hitler took that as a sign of weakness and people got what they feared the most ww2.

The reality is that if the free world clapped hard on Putin when he took Crimea or even before when he started falsifying elections and killing political opponents none of this would have happened. What happened is that the free world (especially the Germans) continues to shower him with  trade deals and natural resources contracts and now we are closer to ww3 and nuclear war than ever before just because of our appeasement and non interventionism.

And btw the more weakness we show the more Putin gets emboldened to go after the Baltics and after Finland thus bringing humanity closer to nukes and ww3. If NATO would go into Ukraine united today and drive out the Russians Putin would take it as a sign of strenght and back out. Yeah he would moan a bit but he would back out.

Israel acting sus is not out of character either, considering they basically want the same thing.

If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Putin has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressures of liberal democracy, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and politically. 

He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for ""peace at any price"" or ""why Ukraine and not Russia,"" or as one commentator put it, he'd rather ""live on his knees than die on his feet.""

Being a nuclear armed nation has its privileges, one of the most privilege is that nations that may criticise and disapproved what you doing, that maybe appalled and sickened and outraged by actions you’re taking, have to stop there. They can’t go to war with Russia because it’s suicidal to do so.

Mutual assured destruction is still a doctrine that kind of works and it’s a fact of our lives. So I think he learned that he can sort of push it to the limit and then beyond, because in the end, the united states is not going to go to war against Russia.

France and Great Britain are not going to go to war against Russia. Nobody is going to go to war against Russia, because if you do that, you are signing your own death warrant and that of millions of innocent people. You’re killing your own country as well as his. And so, since that can’t happen, he can push as far as he wants.

b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,tdj06u,i0k0v46,"For what it's worth, the Russian logistical supply strategy is the same as it was in the Soviet era. Extremely heavily reliant upon trains.

They are the only nation with rail battalions still, basically engineering groups responsible for rapidly building new track and repairing bombed out track, specifically for the purpose of bringing up supplies.

Their doctrine, which Ukraine has beautifully abused, has been ""Lead forces charge forward until they meet heavy resistance, then they halt and establish a battle line. While logistics elements catch up, the rail battalions 'rapidly' build trains up to the front such that no battle line is more than about 90 minutes away from a train track by truck."". And boy golly has Russia's military played that to the letter.

And by that I mean when the Ukrainian military refuses to put up significant resistance for the lead units, they advanced so far into Ukrainian territory that when they finally encountered resistance they were literally out of radio range to call for help. And they just...kept doing this...for over a week...

Even worse for Russia, their mixture of infantry to equipment (tanks, anti-air vehicles, artillery, etc) is actually VERY heavily oriented to equipment. Even more so than Western militaries. On the pro side, this actually makes those units extremely capable, as long as they are in supply. On the con side...jesus their supply needs are huge. Worse, because Russia's doctrine insists that units should never remain more than a couple hours away from rail supply, they have always operated with LESS trucks attached to a unit than an equivalent western unit.

Now, to be fair to Russia here (not that I want to be), this strategy is actually extremely good on the defense, or in situations where fixed battle lines develop (see: WW2) and they can just pile up supplies till they overwhelm their opponent on the line. The strategy is proving to be terrible on the offensive in the modern age. In less than 48 hours after the beginning of hostilities, Ukraine had absolutely trashed all the rail links they could that might be utilized by Russia. As such their rail battalions have had to either make new track or spend time repairing old track. And all this is happening in contested territory. This is a problem when all you have to do to take a rail line out of service for a few hours is to just grab a sledgehammer and a crowbar, then pull out some pins keeping the rails on the ties.

>And now, what troubles officials is that **Mr. Putin may double down and expand the fight beyond Ukraine.**  
In private, officials express concern that **Mr. Putin might seek to take Moldova**, another former Soviet republic that has never joined NATO and is considered particularly vulnerable. 

*Really*?! JFC, yeah, he admitted that years ago! Boris comments in a Sky News interview a few days ago that the West's policy towards Russia has reminded the same for decades and I think that's a massive problem. For whatever reason, we've been very slow to understand that Putin is a murderous narcissistic psychopath. The West's approach the dealing with Russia needed to changed based on its leadership, but we're still acting like Putin is a normal leader, bound by some rules of normal behavior. Negotiating won't work. His idea of negotiating is ""give me what I want"" and that's it. 

&#x200B;

>Another senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments, said **it could take up to two weeks for Russian forces to encircle Kyiv and then at least another month to seize it.** That would require a combination of relentless bombardment and what could be weeks or months of door-to-door street fighting.

This is going to be awful. 

&#x200B;

>**Senior Pentagon officials said the key issue now is maintaining extreme pressure on Russia in hopes that Mr. Putin will cut his losses and settle for the Russian-speaking south and east.**  
Yet the Russian attacks in western Ukraine over the past two days underscore Mr. Putin’s continued determination to control the entire country, starting with Kyiv.   
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>**“The most probable endgame, sadly, is a partition of Ukraine,” said Mr. Stavridis,** pointing to the outcome of the Balkan wars in the 1990s as a model. “Putin would take the southeast of the country, and the ethnic Russians would gravitate there. The rest of the nation, overwhelmingly Ukrainian, would continue as a sovereign state.”

Fuck no. First off he invaded Ukraine because he doesn't think they should be a country, he shouldn't be given any of it. Second, that's just mean he'll be able to move troops closer and will eventually try to take the rest of it. Giving up any land is an idiotic idea. He can fuck off back to Russia. That's it. No land. No sacrificing Ukrainians so he can get something. 

I find the idea that the Pentagon is willing to sacrifice half of a sovereign country because Putin has nukes horrifying. Putin is the school bully, you don't give up half your lunch hoping he'll be happy, you punch the shit out of him so he never comes back. The West really needs to get over this idea of face-saving and appeasement, he won't stop until he's stopped.

>And finally, there are cyberattacks, which have been strangely missing from the conflict so far. They may be Mr. Putin’s most effective way of retaliating against the United States for grievous harm to the Russian economy.

Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed. Much of the reason for the recovery is that world oil prices increased rapidly during 1999–2000 and Russia ran a large trade surplus in 1999 and 2000. Another reason is that domestic industries, such as food processing, had benefited from the devaluation, which caused a steep increase in the prices of imported goods.

Also, since Russia's economy was operating to such a large extent on barter and other non-monetary instruments of exchange, the financial collapse had far less of an impact on many producers than it would had the economy been dependent on a banking system. Finally, the economy was helped by an infusion of cash. As enterprises were able to pay off debts in back wages and taxes, in turn consumer demand for goods and services produced by Russian industry began to rise.",False,1647237179.0,t3_tdj06u,t1_i0l37z8,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Applying logic based from pro-western ideas from areas outside of where Russian aggression has taken place, lacks understanding on what works and what doesn’t.  These people have been lied to, then killed or displaced or made to live under aggressive rule that attempts to erase their own heritage.  From all the people from that area of the world or that have family there, is that the only thing that really thwarts attacks from regimes like this is military force.

Ask the people of Syria, in Georgia those displaced by Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the protestors in Kazakhstan and now the Ukrainian people.  They have lived with the lies and the violence.  If they think that peace is achievable by forcing the Russians out and having allies step in, then so do I.  They exhausted numerous attempts at talks both before and after the invasion began, and even put up with attacks during talks.  The Ukrainians have asserted many times that World War 3 has already begun but the rest of the world is failing to acknowledge it, and that if we don’t deal with this now, then we’ll be dealing with it later, after many thousands more have died.

So do nothing now and let many more die, or wait until the eventual intentional or miscalculated attack that draws in another non-NATO country like Moldova or Georgia again later with many more thousands that will die.  Maybe we wait until a NATO country is attacked, because Russia will use their “escalate to de-escalate” technique of negotiations.  Maybe he hangs up his gloves tomorrow, but according to those I know who are from that area of the world, he won’t.  Right now, we’re all white-knuckling the steering wheel as we go down the road trying not crash.

For Putin, and people like him, the bar can always go lower.  Expect them to be the most self-interested, sadistic, egotistical, amoral trash and you will never be disappointed.  

I have known some people who follow Putin’s patterns. 

Edit of my guess:

Putin loves tools, in the most genuine meaning of the word as it applies to humans.  People mean nothing to him.  In some ways, he rose to power as a tool. 

He’s made the mistake of thinking tools alone can build.  Without artisans, they usually destroy.  He’s a tool, he thinks like a tool, and he wants others to be tools.  Fit in his little toolbox?  Great!  No?  Destroy.

Use of the article was standard before Ukrainian independence, but has decreased since the 1990s. For example, the Associated Press dropped the article ""the"" on 3 December 1991. Use of the definite article was criticised as suggesting a non-sovereign territory, much like ""the Lebanon"" referred to the region before its independence, or as one might refer to ""the Midwest"", a region of the United States.

> In 1993, the Ukrainian government explicitly requested that, in linguistic agreement with countries and not regions, the Russian preposition в be used instead of на, and in 2012, the Ukrainian embassy in London further stated that it is politically and grammatically incorrect to use a definite article with Ukraine.

Remember the claims that two IL-76's were shot down two days in a row? We've yet to see a single photograph of even one single downed IL-76. US intel sources say it's confirmed, but I dunno. The story's changed between one to two to four IL-76s, supposedly all of them filled with Russian paratroopers.

We're getting *plenty* of photos of downed Russian bombers and fighters, but not even one photo of a ginormous transport plane, after four went down near Kyiv? Fishy.

That's just a mild example in the grand scheme, too. Two hundred vehicles destroyed in a single artillery bombardment? Eh. Maybe. Seems dubious without photos. That's an entire BTG's worth of vehicles, and between 500 and a thousand troops.

I'm sure we'll find out years later that a lot of these crazy accounts are true, and maybe even downplayed.

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechens! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are.

Only technically true. Our anti-ICBM systems are only really meant for dealing with someone like North Korea that will be totally spent after only a dozen warheads or so. Our full capabilities wouldn't even dent the sort of strike Russia or China could toss.

Cruise missile based attacks we're much better at, but that's very much a ""We can't kill what we can't see."" situation and low flying cruise missiles with terrain-hugging capabilities are fairly hard to spot even for something like an AWACS.

> “Poorly programmed? Drone flies across 3 nato countries and crashes with a bomb on board when it runs out of fuel”

Given the age of that drone's design (somewhere in the 60's-80's was its first adoption), I can easily believe it still operates on a loopless control system. Meaning, you feed it the coordinates/waypoints/etc for what you want it to do then launch it. The expectation is that it's going to eventually swing back into radio range at the end for you to give final commands to (stall and pop a parachute for recovery) or you just know where it's going to do such a thing.

So the programming can be fine and someone just fat-fingered in a bad coordinate for it to go to. As I recall, one of the leading theories was they were told ""Send it to XYZ city!"" and it's one of those city names that is reused several times across Europe (we humans are SOO original with names...) and when they consulted their tables for coordinates, they didn't realize they were looking at the wrong city.

I could easily believe the software was like ""Uh...my guy, this drone DEFINITELY doesn't have the fuel to do that. Are you sure?"" and the operator, still not realizing what they'd done, just eye rolled and used the ""Yes, do it anyway."" override.

Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', ""Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area"" cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.

And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.

And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

There's no shiny red 'nuke' button in Putin's office. If Putin decides to give the 'nuke' order, it's gotta flow through a chain of command. There are several points along that chain of command where someone can undermine Putin's order to nuke. If Putin had done a better job with rallying his military leadership, this wouldn't be an issue for him. It's one thing to invade a sovereign nation who you feel is inferior, but it's another beast to threaten the entire world with nukes, and the reality is that for a lot of Russia's military leaders, the red line is somewhere between the current conflict in Ukraine and actual nuclear warfare.

Something else to consider is United States intel. The US has THE best intel in the world. They're constantly monitoring Russia's posture for any changes. The thing is, while either sides' nukes are probably ready to go at a moments' notice,  there's still this sort of level-of-readiness that each side is at. In the United States, that's the DEFCON system. Russia has something similar. Changing to a higher level of readiness means that personnel move - and the US is constantly monitoring Russia for any signs of that movement. We would be tipped off that something is going on before the order to launch nukes even goes through. While the United States tends to keep their own intel under wraps, they won't keep us (the public) completely in the dark. Also, we have an advanced early warning system. If nukes get launched, we will know instantly. If Russia tries to jam our warning system beforehand, we will know exactly what they're doing. Nukes won't hit without us knowing they're on the way. So, it's not like they will strike without warning.

Lastly, NATO is doing everything it can to prevent nuclear war. That involves taking all the intel it has - again, the best intel in the world - and making decisions that best support Ukraine without escalating the conflict.

I hope this helps. I know, firsthand, that sometimes it's hard to reason with anxiety using logic, but hang in there. You aren't alone.",False,1647222153.0,t3_tdj06u,t1_i0kal5q,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

There does seem to be a glimer of hope though that Putin might finally see that even if he does take it eventually that it will weaken his position and that crossing certain lines will make it more difficult to return to normal relations. 

He might realize that he has to accept terms that are less than his complete goals of taking Ukraine into some new version of the USSR. 

I've read that talks have improved, which might just mean that Russia is actually taking them seriously. 

This combined with Zelinskyy saying he has ""cooled"" on the idea of joining NATO. 

Best case scenario that we can hope for that's realistic is that Russia gets Ukraine to acknowledge the Eastern territories and Crimea while Ukraine does not disarm and agrees not to join NATO or the EU for 10 years.

The next best scenario is that Putin grinds his military down to a nub in Ukraine until he has no option of pulling back because he still needs what's left to defend against an unlikely invasion from China or even a coup.

One day you get a call saying you have to fire the missiles. You know that the enemy has not yet launched any missiles with nuclear warheads. This means that when you start the launch it will get detected by NATO countries and they will fire enough of their arsenal towards your country to completely pulverize it - no one will survive. Your mother, your father, everyone you grew up with - everyone you care about will be dead within the next few hours. You will die as well even though you are deep underground in a bunker. You will not be able to evacuate as radiation levels are too high. If everyone in your country decided to fire the missiles in the same way as you did, that would mean that the other country got nuked to oblivion as well. Now the side effect of that would mean that most likely the whole of the earth will not be habitable anymore. Humankind will die. Would you really give the go ahead to launch the missiles?  


Do you really believe that officers at nuclear launch facilities are suicidal, that hate their own family enough to be able to live with killing them? That they can bear the conscience of being one of the few to end human life on earth? I do not think so, because if that was the case we would already have had a nuclear war. Remember the Russian submarine officer that got a green light to launch nuclear warheads at USA. He choose not to.   


There will not be a nuclear war unless a country with nuclear warheads at their disposal fear that within a short time frame that their nation and people will falter and die.

I recommend googling the basic principles of war propaganda...everyone of the 10 points has been hit.

There are a lot of truths being stretched or exaggerated, ex: Russian losses are unsustainable and they have zero morale.

A lot of truths are being omitted, ex: Ukranian losses, how many Ukranian troops are volunteers or were conscripted.

And a lot of questions just aren’t being asked, ex: Are Ukranian defense forces occupying the civilian buildings being hit.

Take the good vs evil narrative out and it’s just a conflict between two nations. I think a lot of people see the Russian forces taking a slower/methodical approach as a sign of weakness. However, if their plan is to choke the cities into submission and cut off supplies, that’s their strategy. It’s a safer play than trying to rush into a city head on in an urban setting and allowing supplies to flow in freely.

All this means is that they need to be a bit more patient. The Russian investment turned out unexpectedly.

However, it didn't turn out poorly.

While Russia's misrepresentation of their strength means that a direct move on Taiwan isn't really in the cards at the moment, it doesn't prevent it forever. Also, Russia's evisceration by the West makes them vulnerable to exploitation... sorry... I meant predatory... oops... ""trade""... It provides ""favorable trade opportunities"" for the forseeable future.

They don't even have to be especially nice to Russia. Globally speaking, Russia is now the equivalent of a lot lizard scratching at their truck door. They can use and abuse them as they see fit and do it for chump change. 

Not the glorious alliance they might have envisioned, but a cheap blowjob, gold, uranium, titanium, and oil isn't the worst thing to happen to them by a long shot. 

For them to ""deprive themselves of their only friendly source of resources"" they would have to truly go beyond the pale. All they have to do is tell the scabby little whore that they are pretty while they are fucking her up the ass.

Pro-Russian propaganda serves their own interests and costs them absolutely *nothing*. They say some nice words and then grab Russia by the hair and shove her face wherever they please. 

In fact, they can play both ends of this deal. They give lip service to Russia for ""lip service"" (nudge nudge wink wink) and still deal with the West as long as they don't cross a very clearly defined line.

For example, they say everything they are saying in the media and online, but you will notice that they are NOT selling Russia spare parts for those seized planes...

This trend will likely continue. They can use Russia as a cheap source of much needed natural resources, turn that into a profit dealing with the west, and give Russia whatever they feel like giving her (which won't be a whole lot). 

They will ""save"" Russia from the West by replacing it. Russia will use their bank cards, their financial networks, and sell to them and, from the way things are looking, only them. (Which will NOT be in Russia's favor)

China is a master of manipulation and soft power. They will get away with this WHILE still dealing with the West.

Oh, the oligarchs will still make money and plenty of it, but Russia will get screwed and screwed hard. Life for the average Russian is going to go right into the shitter, the same oligarchs who have been robbing them this whole time will continue to take an even bigger slice of a much smaller pie, and the Russian people will be spoon-fed a constant stream of propaganda telling them that this is all the West's fault while the oligarchs and the Chinese laugh at them while they *starve*.

China isn't ""next"". Don't delude yourself. What the West is doing to Russia is *expensive* and *inconvenient*. The West will be in no hurry to deprive *themselves* of China (and Russia's whitewashed resources). Renewables won't eliminate the need for titanium anytime soon.

China will be ""next"" in one regard, though. They will be the next true superpower and will be the one that the West will be waging a very polite mutually profitable cold war with. 

Most if not all of Eastern Europe will eventually become part of the EU. Russia will become Western China, and the world will keep on ticking...

Until China completes fully modernizing their army and then we will see what happens next. 

However, Russia's time as a global anything is nearing its end. They will be teaching Mandarin in Moscow and all the kids who want real jobs that pay real money (yuan) will be lining up to learn it. 

Oh, I'm not happy about this. China is smarter and far more dangerous than Russia and this only serves them in the end.

It will, however, be a good thing for Europe. China's ambitions are focused on Asia and will be for *years*. 

It's going to be a pissing contest over on the Pacific side, though. That's not going to be fun but we've done Cold Wars before without blowing up the planet and that was against Russia.

For what it's worth, I think Putin is a deeply evil fascist dictator, and that Russia in its current form MUST cease to exist. There is no way back.

Right, with that disclaimer out of the way: I would not overstate the 'Putin's regime is in immediate danger of total collapse on the battlefield and at home'. On the battlefield, they seem to have at least slowed the bleeding, and  are showing early signs of slight greater sophistication in how they approach this. They're still a shambles, but I think we will not see as many total, catastrophic blunders as in the first 10 days or so of the war. They will definitely be able to drag this out, gradually consolidate certain areas, and continue to degrade Ukrainian capabilities. If they begin to use their asymmetric weapons at scale (chemical and thermobaric), they can probably make major progress even in the cities. Obviously this would be a humanitarian catastrophe of yet-unseen proportions in this war, and we must hope it does not happen, but if they DO go down that road, there is really very little the Ukrainian military can do to resist.

At home, Russian repression and propaganda are astonishingly powerful tools, which Putin is highly adept at using to his advantage. I personally don't see how Putin survives this long term, but in the short-medium term (i.e. the period concerning the immediate future of this war) I would not bet on the regime falling.

There have been 2,056 nuclear tests since 1945, the majority much larger than a MIRV warhead, some incredibly larger. The Earth wasn't even slightly inconvenienced.

The USA wouldn't deliberately target Russian population centers, we aren't in total war yet and civilians contribute nothing to the war effort, so it's contrary to western values to massacre civilians for no reason, only a counter-force strike is likely.

And that strike is more likely to be done with hypersonic and cruise missiles while the ICBMs and mobile launchers are fuelling up and preparing to launch, and conventional bunker busters, which is probably why there are B-1's and B-52s loitering around Poland 24/7 lately. Russian command seems to be infested with western informants so we can assume there will be a significant amount of notice of intent to strike.

Even worst case, there are loads of anti ballistic missile systems at the ready, and maybe even some we don't know about yet.

War industries are burning the midnight oil churning out resources, many of which are getting handed over to Ukraine. That is not an inconsiderate item.

People can scream ""sanctions don't work"" all they want, but the world has never seen sanctions like this before. Removing Iran from SWIFT made a decade them 180 and get with the nuclear-deal. What we've done to Russia is crippling, in a very real sense the damage is beyond repair. Even if EVERYTHING goes perfectly for Russia from this point forth, they have not only lost all the recovery they've made since 2008, but have lost out on all future growth they could have expected to have made over the next 30 years.

And on top of what WE'VE done, in their desperation to keep the ghost of their economy going a bit longer, they are taking actions that are salting the earth of their own economy so that nothing will grow again. Major industries that left Russia will not return if Russia begins seizing their property. It'll be like the ending to ""Lord Of War"" when Nic Cage's character walks out of custody, is handed a suitcase of money, and sent on his way ""Most people are just happy enough to get out of prison. Me? I expect to be paid to leave prison."". These companies will NOT come back to Russia without vast economic incentives, which since Russia can't pay them squat, can only mean that in addition to a return of their property, the Russian government gives them immense tax-breaks. This will vastly limit the economic recovery these businesses will be helping with.

Nothing Russia stands to take will fix this.

b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,tdj06u,i0laupd,"Rail is MUCH cheaper than planes when it comes to high volume and/or high mass across long distances.

One way to think about it is this, a plane has a very hard maximum weight/volume limit. Trains are a bit more flexible. They still have their own limits, yes, but those limits are just insanely huge.

A Boeing 747 has a maximum payload mass of 247,100 pounds. It is not uncommon for a single train to carry on the order of 27 MILLION pounds. That's two orders of magnitude more capacity.

A brand new 747-8 will run you on the order $386.8 million. A new EMD SD70 series locomotive will run you $2.5 million if you get AC traction motors. So for the price of a single 747-8 you could get nearly 155 locomotives.

A 747 flies at ~675 mph, whereas those SD70's run at ~70 mph. So the 747 has an order of magnitude more speed over a train, but this isn't enough. The 747 can get somewhere 10 times faster, but the train can get there with 100 times more cargo. From a price perspective, if you maxed out that 155 locomotive arrangement (somehow) then it gets even more ridiculous. 

Planes are best primarily for speed. You want next-day delivery? You're using a plane to get anywhere appreciably far away. You want bulk and cost efficiency? It's trains all the way baby!

Now I haven't done the math on trains vs cargo ships, but I suspect in general the same holds true, if possibly on a better scale than train/plane does.

It is worth noting that the US military's logistics system is pretty much designed entirely for fighting wars cross-ocean. One example of this is the C-130 Hercules. It's used by nearly every nation with an air force. The second largest I've seen (these charts are not well organized) is Algeria with 19 aircraft. The US operates over 100. The US has larger aircraft. The C-5 Galaxy, the US has 52 of those. The C-17 Globemaster for example, the US has 222 of those.

It is without exaggeration that I say that the US military is capable of establishing a Berlin Airlift scale supply campaign anywhere in the world with less than a few days notice.",False,1647242681.0,t3_tdj06u,t1_i0l95ye,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

While I agree with your sentiment the reality is that we're only a few steps away from that. With the most watched news station in America openly neo nazi. January 6 showed us how close we came from the death of liberal democracy in America. Also immigrants like myself tend to have a critical eye on society and America generally doesn't talk or teach about the times when the government pretends that we are not like a liberal society and openly chooses to go Putin and does whatever it wants. Like the Wen Ho Lee where the Clinton DOJ legally claimed in court the Bill of Rights can be ignored at the government's discretion.

And my reply wasn't saying that Russia will launch nukes but to a comment which suggests that America can swing his massive dick around. Also this varies by Nuclear doctrine of the countries. Russia's current doctrine is to prevent Nuclear exchange by the threat of Nuclear weapons. France's cold war Nuclear doctrine was to nuke the shit out of West Germany to prevent the Soviets from reaching the Rhine. Not sure about current doctrine though. Similarly Pakistan has a tactical Nukes doctrine where they will target troops concentration. India's is No first strike policy. China's doctrine is also similar as with no First use policy. America Nuclear doctrine is actually similar to Russia's with premptive strikes if necessary policy. And the destruction of earth won't happen in a nuclear exchange. My statement was meant in the way that if you combine the Nuclear payload capacities of the total nukes available to US and Russia it is much more than the energy required to destroy earth.

The US does this. Israel does as well because Hamas shoots rockets and mortars from civilian centers.

but individual opinion is not state policy. state policy is governed by a whole host of other issues, none of which most Americans will like being confronted with. the India Pakistan history is long, it's painful, and the generational trauma is impossible to explain.

a short personal story: my material grandmother was a babe in arms at the time of Partition. her mother was so terrified for her child's safety that while moving from Pakistan to India, she was kept hidden in a basket of fruits so that she wouldn't be targeted if their train was attacked. 

if the US wants the indian state's forgiveness, it needs to back away from any aid to Pakistan (which it still hasn't done mind you) and figure out how to replace Russian arms and weaponry at a comparable price. 

It will never happen. 

So, on a state level, India will side with the US in many ways - until it comes to siding with them v/s Russia.

as an aside: Ukraine, in UN meetings, has frequently taken the non-India position. It makes the state less willing to side with them.

I mean, that's what they have been trying since the start. :D

> Or can some country , maybe not a nato one send planes and do a no fly zone ?

Technically yes, but in reality no. Anybody with enough gear to actually keep Russia out of Ukraine's airspace is either NATO-aligned or Russia-aligned, or so far away they couldn't do it anyway. So actually stepping in and trying that wouldn't go well.

Furthermore, one of the items that's useful to consider is that a no-fly-zone isn't ONLY hurting Russia. The point of NFZs is that they are a neutral 3rd party stepping in to try and minimize problems (IE: anti-civilian effects). The way that entity stays neutral is that NOBODY gets to fly. So those Turkish drones that Ukraine is using to great effect against Russian vehicles? Anyone establishing an NFZ is obligated to shoot those down in addition to shooting down Russian planes.

In all honesty, and with the caveat that I'm not a military professional (I just play one on the internet), as much as it sucks that Russia is just lobbing these long ranged missiles into Ukraine (mainly in the form of civilian casualties), I think losing the drones would hurt Ukraine more than Russia being denied the skies would help when it comes to a strict military analysis.

Whoever tries to set up an NFZ will also have to have the tech to blast away Russian cruise missiles, which isn't as easy as going after planes. It's also usually accepted that the NFZ-enforcer is also going to have to bomb some ground targets, namely because it's expected that the side that REALLY benefits from air power is going to disagree with the NFZ in the form of surface to air missiles.",False,1647217712.0,t3_tdj06u,t1_i0k2591,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

I disagree that the 10 commands represent a good way to live overall. There are a couple of good points. But they aren’t groundbreaking. Pretty much every civil society agrees on the ones that are genuinely good. There’s no need to cite a religious authority to tell somebody not to murder, for example.

While we’re here, let’s quickly look at each one and see what’s good and what’s not.

1 You shall have no other gods before Me.

Irrelevant

2 You shall make no idols.

Irrelevant

3 You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.

Irrelevant

4 Keep the Sabbath day holy.

Irrelevant

5 Honor your father and your mother.

Not an absolute. Shitty parents do not deserve to be honored. This commandment has enabled abusers.

6 You shall not murder.

Good. But we didn’t need Yahweh to tell us that.

7 You shall not commit adultery.

I don’t care what consenting adults do with each other. And the definition of adultery this is referring to includes some marriages after the death of a spouse.

8 You shall not steal.

Generally agree but there was a pretty good musical (Les Miserables) about why this isn’t an absolute.

9 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

Generally agree. But again, lying can be the moral choice so it’s not absolute.

10 You shall not covet.

It’s probably not psychologically healthy to covet but this is a thought crime. I don’t really care if somebody covets something as long as they aren’t acting on that desire.

So one unambiguously good idea (don’t murder). But it’s pretty universally acknowledged and not unique to the 10 commandments. A couple that are decent ideas, but not absolute.  And the rest are irrelevant.

Putin takes too many actions to suppress unrest to infer it has no value, he actively fears it.

It is free to say that protest is useless, and all Russians are bad, and it is free to encourage Russians to protest and champion those who do.

Mothers, for instance, sacrifice themselves for their children in the right circumstances. 

Our brains are left to rationalize these behaviors after the fact, and are capable of producing such conclusions, however the act comes from a deeper part of consciousness than the self-perception. The act comes first and the brain is left to make sense of it. 

As such we may conclude to be acting selfishly but the brain's central purpose is to find patterns so it can predict the future, and it errs on the side of caution, as its better to run and live than misperceive and get eaten. Running when unnecessary still means you're alive, but not running can be fatal. 

So the pattern matching engine is often wrong, and this can be demonstrated. The pattern matching engine cannot always properly diagnose the purpose of behavior when it is not actually responsible for the behavior. This can also be observed in persons with abnormal brain structures as it reflects on consciousness. 

I would argue the compassionate motivation predates modern consciousness and hence cannot be explained by it, and any such explanation cannot be trusted as it is a rationalization of something outside it. This can be observed in various cases of abnormal psychology. 

So just because the hyper-rational consciousness cannot properly understand non-self-motivated action this doesn't mean it does not exist. In fact, we are notoriously bad at properly attributing our own motivations, which can also be directly observed in studies.

4b954d2569080147221f33fb85c8c702,tdj06u,i0lbbvh,"Basically, the logic behind publicly stating ""no boots on the ground"":

* NATO needs to draw a ""red line"" for nuclear deterrent to be credible

* If NATO was ambiguous about whether it would deploy troops to Ukraine (and thus possibly extend their stated ""red line"" to encompass non-NATO territory), Putin could call their bluff

* If NATO had their bluff called, that means China is now free to assume there is no ""red line"" around Taiwan; the language loses credibility

* Additionally, the ""red line"" provided by Article 5 would be weakened if it's perceived that NATO has already backed down once (perception is more important than reality)

For the no-fly zone:

* A no-fly zone requires NATO to target Russian assets, even within Russia's borders

* There is no such thing as a ""limited war"" between neer-peers, every king and general who thought they could do it has been wrong

* It is impossible for Russia to know whether their assets are being targeted as part of a no-fly zone or as a prelude to full escalation

* Thus it is in Russia's interest to target NATO planes and command/control centers on NATO territory, in case it is a prelude to full invasion

* An assault on NATO territory will invoke Article 5 and lead to WWIII

Additional note:

* Ukraine is already in a ""total war"" scenario

* NATO is not

* Ukraine has nothing left to lose if WWIII were to be declared - thus it is prudent for them to call for as much escalation as possible

* NATO has a lot to lose by escalating, thus they must avoid crossing Putin's ""red line"" no matter what Ukraine asks

* NATO does not know where Putin's ""red line"" is, the article speculates that giving UA fighter jets would potentially be the first step past it",1647243443.0,1647243089.0,t3_tdj06u,t1_i0lai03,,6,3,0,3,0,0,

It’s not an accident that chattel slavery has been justified by citing the Bible.

There are several other mentions of slavery in the Bible. And not a single condemnation of owning other human beings.

It’s a pretty shitty God that can’t be bothered to tell his believers to not own other human beings, even when he’s in the rule-giving mood like he was for the 10 commandments. It’s reprehensible that such evil was never explicitly and thoroughly condemned in the Bible.

And you calling human slaves “the help” is equally reprehensible.

> The logic of deterrence – in particular the fact that it is both very high stakes and also based entirely on perception – explains why NATO and especially the United States took any direct military action off of the table quite loudly well before the conflict began. Saying that ‘all options are on the table’ – as the United States routinely does with Taiwan – would have been a fairly obvious bluff. When Putin called that obvious bluff, it would have damaged the credibility and thus the deterrence value of that same statement when applied to NATO members or Taiwan, weakening the effect of US deterrence, and thus potentially encouraging another state (like China) to try to call an American bluff elsewhere (essentially inviting a piecemeal maneuver). And of course the danger to that is two-fold: on the one hand if the United States and NATO folds, it calls into question even more of its security arrangements, but if it doesn’t fold, the result is likely to be a major war which in turn could (and frankly probably would) lead to an escalatory spiral ending in the use of nuclear weapons.

The US cannot act unilaterally, as it must use bases in Europe to act. Any base the US uses would be seen as participating in the war and thus a valid military target for Moscow.

So if a US helicopter takes off from Poland, Moscow _must_ see it as Poland using its assets for war - and thus Poland is now a belligerent and a valid target. This means Moscow can attack Poland, Poland can trigger Article 5 (as from Poland's perspective it is a defensive war), and all of NATO gets involved.

Even if that isn't true, the idea that is _could_ be true is enough. Perception matters more than anything else, and Russia has successfully given a perception that using NATO airbases to support Ukraine is beyond the red line (this is why fighters can't be given from Poland to Ukraine). That perception must be treated as reality, as ""calling their bluff"" leads to millions of deaths.
