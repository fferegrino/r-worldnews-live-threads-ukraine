- For the first time in three weeks, there have been reports of attacks by Iranian-provided one-way attack (OWA) uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These events remain to be verified, but it is likely that Russia exhausted its previous stock of several hundred Shahed-131s and 136s and has now received a resupply.

- On 06 December 2022, the Ukrainian General Staff reported shooting down 17 UAVs, including 14 Shahed-136s. On 07 December 2022, Ukrainian officials reported the use of Iranian-provided OWA UAVs targeting Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro oblasts.

- The last previously reported shooting down of Iranian Shahed-136s in Ukraine was on 17 November 2022. If verified, it is likely that Russia has recommenced attacks with newly delivered OWA UAV systems.",False,1670569846.0,t3_zgm9se,t3_zgm9se,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

In March when Russia was making substantial gains, there was no reason to make nuclear threats, and none were made. You can see pretty clearly when the threats were made by checking Google trends.  
https://i.imgur.com/ru5OueH.png

Once things started turning around, the threats began again.

NATO also adjusts it's messaging, but without nukes because NATO does not need nukes. That is why Stoltenberg and Blinken remind Putin every time with plain, unbuttered claims like ""war is possible"" to propose a quick, conventional solution to the threat, which is realistic as well because NATO is not just USA; it's Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States + allies who will definitely want street cred like Finland, Sweden, South Korea, Japan etc.

Say Russia decides: ""so many of our soldiers are being killed, we're facing a war of attrition that's going to result in the loss of so many lives"". ""Let's nuke Kyiv into submission""  
Russia attacks Ukraine with nuclear weapon.

A lot of computer systems were built on the premise that *the year 2000 would never happen.* You may say this is BS but it is an absolute fact. They only allowed so many bits for the year. It became clear that certain critical systems would fail, such as air traffic control, maybe aircraft autopilots, banking systems, etc when 1999 ended. There was a furious activity to update the operating systems here there and everywhere. One of the lessons that we learned was: in writing a date, put the year as 4 digits, the month in letters, and the day in 1 or 2 digits. Then the order doesn't matter. You have 09.12 - that could be a dozen or more different dates in the 2000s or 1900s.

>One person was killed, state-run news agencies reported, citing emergency officials. Moscow region prosecutors later identified the victim as a Mega Khimki employee, while other news outlets said he was likely a security guard.

>News agencies that spoke with emergency services in the northern Moscow suburb of Khimki said possible causes ranged from a short-circuit to arson. 

>Arson was later ruled out in favor of welding work.

>OBI announced its exit from Russia this spring over the invasion of Ukraine. Russian media reported at the time that OBI’s Russian and German managers had a dispute over reopening stores.

North of Svatove there's a Russian border town called Valuyki, with a fairly major rail depot. That directly connects to the occupied Ukrainian town of Troitsky, which in turn has a road running due south to Svatove. And the rail line continues from Troitsky down to the eastern Luhansk area. Farther east of that there's mostly nothing but rural communities, the next Russian rail line doesn't enter Ukraine until way farther east and south.

So right now Ukraine can interdict traffic trying to come south from Troitsky in support of Svatove and Kreminna. If they take Svatove, they can not only stop that traffic, but threaten the rail line east of there.

And on the flip side, Ukraine has a large rail connection at Kupyans'k. Which has both a rail and a highway connection southeast to near Svatove, and from there south to Kreminna and Lysychansk. Once they control Svatove, they have a clear shot to Lysychansk. Which is the major regional objective.

I think the thing you're missing is that the area east of the Svatove-Kreminna line is mostly empty. Wooded hills, rural towns, etc. It's a really hard area to occupy. So Ukraine doesn't need to take that area in order to utilize the Kupyans'k to Lysychansk route. Basically Ukraine can turn south at that point, set up a static line blocking Troitsky, and then siege Lysychansk. All about supply lines.",False,1670590215.0,t3_zgm9se,t1_izijpor,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

Svatove covers one of the few rail lines going from the Moscow direction directly towards Luhansk/Donetsk. The next best line goes throug Starobilsk further to the east, which would in itself be a detour and would prolong the transit times of goods.

But the rail line through Starobilsk doesnt go directly towards Donetsk, but ends somewhere near the coast in Luhansk as far as I know.

It complicates logistics for russia.

ebfeb9bb30bf522444167d8c4b0ae268,zgm9se,izik5z2,"Based on sort of ""a priori"" ideas, one can try to estimate what the casualties should look like. 

Ukraine has less firepower in terms of artillery, tanks, aircraft, missiles, which gives Russia a significant advantage. This would suggest that Russia has less casualties. But Ukraine is the defender, who is almost always at a significant advantage for various reasons, which would support Ukraine having less casualties. Ukraine is more motivated and has more manpower as it mobilized early with seemingly a fair amount of success, whereas Russia mobilized late and inefficiently.  This could go either way, was more people available also means more that the side can afford to lose. 

Then we can try to guess based on how the war itself is going. Russia had a lot of success at first, but after April, it has made minimal progress in some places and has had massive retreats elsewhere. Generally, the one with more casualties will be the one to retreat, but that isn't necessarily the case if the retreating side has far less soldiers in general. For example, if you have 15k and the enemy has 30k, and you lose 10k and the enemy loses 15k, you have less casualties, but you may have to retreat as you started with 1 soldier for 2 enemies and dropped down to 1 for 3. 

All things considered, equal casualties on both sides doesn't sound too implausible, although based on the Russian retreats, the state of their equipment (and what we know about the equipment casualties based on lists like Oryx's) and Ukrainian morale, it does seem likely that Ukraine has had lower casualties. 

My personal guess would be that Ukraine has 2/3 of the casualties, (something like 100k Ukrainian vs 150k Russian) but a significantly smaller share of the casualties are dead (e.g. 30k vs 70k), which is to say that I think Russia is absolutely abysmal at recovering and saving wounded and cares little for the lives of its soldiers, whereas Ukraine is making every effort to save everyone and probably has more options for getting its wounded treated with western aid.",1670583968.0,1670583382.0,t3_zgm9se,t1_izihndu,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

The US were the first to have 'the bomb' for one, so there was no risk of retaliation, it was a strike to end the war from their view. 

This was also part of trying to end the war against Japan, whose atrocities across Asia throughout the war had led many to lack sympathy for them. 

Finally, any such strike would only end poorly for Russia, and they know it. One Nuke would see the US immediately end them as a threat by conventional means, and further use of Nukes against the US in response would end Russia's existence. 

Russia won't use Nukes, this is just part of their wedge tactic.

 - The support is a waste of money. 
 - The support is ineffective.

It's because nuclear saber rattling is one of the remaining tools of influence that Putin has that he's leaning on; and the more people treat his threat seriously, the harder he will lean on it.

The series portrays the exploits of Maxim Isaev, a Soviet spy operating in Nazi Germany under the name Max Otto von Stierlitz, portrayed by Vyacheslav Tikhonov. Stierlitz is planted in 1927, well before the Nazi takeover of pre-war Germany. He then enlists in the NSDAP and rises through the ranks, becoming an important Nazi counterintelligence officer.

First, lets be clear: Putin/Russia is morally responsible for every single death in this war on both sides. Ukraine has every right to keep fighting to defend itself from this entirely unprovoked war of conquest from Russia.

But that said, our support for Ukraine causes us to talk a ton/cheer the death toll on the Russian side, and downplay/largely ignore the toll on the Ukrainian side. And its understandable that we want to create the narrative that emphasizes the good guys (Ukraine) winning, and the bad guys (Russia) losing.

We get hate from everyone. Republicans hate us because we are for fiscal conservatism, but are pro-choice. 

Democrats hate us, because we are pro-choice but for right to work, and against welfare states.

As our government is very kleptocratic, as demonstrated by the number of congresspeople, and senators, who's parents were also congresspeople or senators. We dislike this. Government shouldn't a means to profit.

There is no way Russia can compete on an extended war with the kinds of weapons the West is providing Ukraine on a steady pace, even accelerating.

Why—because it’s still wrong.

It’s a rather mixed bag of why kids have left—the groups I’ve seen referenced in Ukrainian press—largest percentages seem to be ones that were either *with* parents or sent *by* parents^1, and then the ones who were in some type of institutions (like disabled kids, kids with Down syndrome, kids with developmental disorders, etc)—and were at least partially in the care of a facility.  These kids’ caretakers were not permitted to take to Ukrainian-held territory, but rather were forceably removed by orders of Russian command which claims it was for kids protection, but more likely, it was bc such places require a steady flow of supplies (medical, etc), and they did not want anything coming in from Ukraine, and not coordinated enough/honest enough to have simply in Russian-held territory.  The third group is kids of indifferent parents who recklessly allowed the kids to go to summer camp down at the various shores (Azov, Black Sea).  Those summer camps were then emptied, became military posts, kids moved. These are Russian-speaking kids, and they’ve tended to be still in their clumps from their original summer camp, but in Crimea or SW Russia.

The final group is another group that can be considered kidnapped—kids in orphanages or under some type of child protective service.  Also where parents/custodian were separated from their kids at checkpoints (like the parents were suspected and thrown in basement, kids were then seized, thrown in with the orphanage kids).  This would’ve been a mix of Ukrainian and Russian-speaking children. The unattended kids and orphans are the most concerning group—not only because their parents were pro-Ukraine, and it’s understood that they’ve been subjected to intense propoganda/re-education/RussianMeasure, but also because they’ve been adopted and scattered across Russia, separated not only from their families, but from other deportees.  

Ukraine says they do not know the true number of this last amount of kids.

Avdiivka’s head of military-civil administration [recently said that even in that town, was at 40% pro-Russia support at start of war](https://glavcom-ua.translate.goog/interviews/hlava-avdijivki-vitalij-barabash-tsja-vijna-zrobila-90-nashikh-meshkantsiv-proukrajinskimi-894005.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp) (had been higher prior to 2014) and just like those who’ve fled Mariupol, blamed it entirely on Russian tv exposure, although he notes that support shrunk to 10% nowadays, noting that yes, it still exists.  He points out that Russian tv is free (airwaves), and only people with money get a cable box or satellite (Ukrainian tv), leading to the residents brainwashed. Note that folks from Mariupol have said same situation there, but estimated support at 55-60%, but now near 100%, likely due to [the Big Lie that Azov destroyed the city](https://www-0629-com-ua.translate.goog/news/3508104/ak-rosianam-vdalos-perekonati-mariupolciv-so-misto-zrujnuvav-azov-foto-video?_x_tr_sl=uk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp).*",1670618298.0,1670617327.0,t3_zgm9se,t1_izk8mry,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Not really, that was a joke. Have you ever heard a libertarian joke? 

We honestly just believe in personal freedom and liberty for everyone, and freedom from government intervention in personal lives, and commerce.

We pay taxes, so that the government can pay farmers not to grow food, so corporate entities can keep their prices higher. That shouldn't be a thing. 

We buy corn and convert it to ethanol to put in gasoline to subsidize farmers who don't need subsidies and the oil industry, who doesn't need to cut their product with subsidized ethanol to be profitable.

Corn ethanol is by far the least efficient means of generating ethanol, especially in a world where food shortages exists, and excess growth can be donated. A reasonable subsidy.

Is that an unreasonable position? That the government as the norm, wastes our tax dollars keeping food prices higher, instead of spending them on things that are reasonable like providing aid to Ukraine, or food aid to places that need it? Instead of subsidizing its inefficient conversion into ethanol to be mixed at a 10% to 15% by volume ratio with gasoline depending on season?

The polls show support for Ukraine by both parties, the worst case is not that Republicans don't support Ukraine, just a question of how much they will sacrifice. I don't agree with them, but the conclusion says it all:

>**Conclusion**  
>  
>**While Americans are divided on supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes, support for the current US policies of assisting Kyiv economically and militarily is still solid.** The influence of perceptions of which side is being successful on the battlefield illustrates the important role that media spin can play in affecting public views about the situation on the ground and, in turn, on continued backing for US support to Ukraine.

I note this contradicts what most of the replies to me have been on this. Their suggestion is that Republicans are pro-Russian, and this contradicts that. It also says it is a small sample size.  I strongly disagree with anyone that has any qualms about spending whatever it takes, and this and, I believe that both parties will come through. Blanket statements are inaccurate on this.

Long term, Republican have always been pro-defense, and I read many post in progressive subs on here that say we spend way too much on military. There is some trouble in both parties on this. Without our high military budget, we would not have been able to help Ukraine as we have, and many Dems would be for a smaller military budget.

I do realize there are nuances, just that it is not as cut and dry as is suggested in this sub. Republicans in general are very supportive. A blanket statement saying Ukraine would be in trouble with Republicans in power is not correct.

Besides the obvious difference in quality and effectiveness between NATO gear and what Russia (still) has available, Russia's economy is utterly incapable of outspending the entire Western world on sustaining this war.

Absolutely true. I don't disagree at all. But the reason I mentioned parity was because it is relevant in regard to casualties *up to now*. In the future I believe Russia will only be able to maintain parity in terms of manpower. 

>Gen. Milley is not the only one who has access to relevant information. He is just among a minority of informed people who, for whatever reason, is overestimating Russia's capabilities. Military analysts have been doing this since the beginning of this war and even before that.

If I had to make a guess, it's because the military doesn't have the luxury of underestimating a potential enemy. Western analysts were wrong, even wildly wrong, in what they thought Ukraine could do. I too thought of the Russian army was a mighty colossus.

But cohort studies across multiple countries, have show that people are efficient, and getting money for not working, is very efficient, and the behavior is expected in a market economy. If people are given money for doing nothing, they will generally prefer to do nothing, especially when it takes less effort than doing something.

This also creates barriers to re-entry into the market economy, as subsidies tend to provide accommodation at rates far below market, and the jump from subsidized living to not, is large.

This is an artifact of the structure of welfare programs, as they are designed not to help people, but to keep voters loyal to those who keep the programs going.

Shockingly, taking money out of businesses in the form not just taxes, but payroll taxes, results in only the most ruthless exploitative businesses having the resources to compete, and makes it expensive to employ people, encouraging automation over hiring new people.

Damn that government efficiency.

Here's the most recent I could find : To be included in the 2016 debates, candidates must be constitutionally eligible to become president and their names must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College. They also must be supported by 15 percent of the electorate, as determined by the average of five national public opinion polls selected by the CPD. Johnson is currently slightly below 10 percent in the polls the CPD is using this year.[2]

Any candidate should be able to meet the petition requirements and deadline for each state so that leaves the 15% polling as the problem. In the 2020 election 25 states were won by someone by 20% or more. Any of those state major party conventions could work to lift a third party in hopes of siphoning that state away from the other party eventually.
