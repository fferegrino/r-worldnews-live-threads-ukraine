Posted at 4:41  
https://thehill.com/policy/international/595635-live-coverage-russia-launches-attack-on-ukraine  
Nearly 200 elected Russian officials issued an open letter to their constituents on Thursday, condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  
In a letter titled “Against the war,” the officials said they “unequivocally condemn” what they referred to as an “unparalleled atrocity” that “cannot be justified.”  
""The decision to attack was made personally by Russian President Vladimir Putin. We are convinced that Russian citizens did not give him such a mandate,"" they said in the letter, which has been translated from Russian to English.  
They warned that a war with Ukraine will result in ""disastrous consequences"" and thousands of people will be ""killed, injured and maimed.""  
""Our country will face condemnation by the international community, isolation, rising prices, and poverty. Hopes for a good life in Russia are crumbling before our eyes,"" they continued. ""We urge you not to participate in the aggression and not to approve of it. Please do not remain silent: only mass popular condemnation can stop the war.""....",1645741827.0,1645741376.0,t3_t0llt8,t3_t0llt8,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

Key Takeaways:

Ukrainian forces are successfully slowing Russian offensives on all axes of advance other than a Russian breakout from the Crimean Peninsula. Russian failure to ground the Ukrainian air force or cripple Ukrainian command and control is likely enabling these initial Ukrainian successes.

Ukrainian forces are contesting the Hostomel military airport, 20 km northwest of Kyiv, as of 9:30 pm local time. Russian VDV (Airborne) troops landed at Hostomel and have also failed to capture the Boryspil airport southeast of Kyiv. Ukraine’s contestation of the airport deprives Russian forces of any location to airlift forces onto Kyiv’s western flank overnight.

Russian forces are rapidly advancing north from Crimea, securing Kherson city. Their deepest penetration to date is about 60 kilometers.

Russian forces are advancing on Kyiv from Belarus on both sides of the Dnipro River.

Russian forces secured the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (on the west bank) at 7:30 pm local time, but Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances east of the Dnipro at Chernihiv.

Russian forces likely seek to cut off Ukrainian troops on the line of contact in Donbas using an envelopment behind the Ukrainian front lines through Luhansk Oblast. Russian frontal assaults have taken little territory in Donetsk and Luhansk at this time.",1645738493.0,1645738373.0,t3_t0llt8,t3_t0llt8,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

Here we also see them making efforts to exaggerate Russian victories over Ukraine to demoralize and reduce support for Ukraine’s position.

A new day will come.
And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.

I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t.

Is there any validity to this take? That Russia isn't sending its troops en masse because it's been spinning bald faced lies to its troops and public and knows that most of its army will defect or a coup will be initiated when it realizes it's being asked to wage a war of aggression.

We've already heard reports of deserters realizing they'd been lied to, and reports of large protests in major cities, so we know the reaction that some Russians seem to be having when confronted with the knowledge of Putin's deceit.

I believe Putin's veiled threats to interventionists would play into this same take: such a harsh reaction to NATO intervention would play right into the **fiction** (bolded for clarity, I am not sympathetic to Putin) of him being some great Soviet unifying chosen one, mercilessly lashing out at the world who is ganging up on him and persecuting his oppressed people.",False,1645740944.0,t3_t0llt8,t3_t0llt8,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

The simple fact is Russia's Ruble is currently worth 0.011 US. They couldn't fight a sustained war even if there was a miracle. Today Biden and other world leaders talked about sanctions which will cripple Russian finance but more importantly stuff like their aerospace industry. Translation: Russia will no longer be able to build new planes or missiles to attack countries with if they can't afford to import stuff like computer chips or microprocessors.

Someone here keeps arguing with me about what a ""wartime economy"" means. I just laugh at have this to say: America's ""wartime economy"" in 1941 meant that a 1941 US dollar is worth 19 US dollars today from inflation, there's a lot to be said about this, primarily though in WW2, America was the richest country on earth. By comparison right now, Russia's GDP is lower than Canada's despite there being 100 million more people living in Russia. Their money is worthless. They're not an economic or industrial powerhouse like some people seem to think. 

Russia will be able to go hard here for maybe a year, by next February, they'll either be a full-on failed state, or people in Russia feeling the pinch will demand Putin's resignation by the millions. The Soviet Union who were in far better shape than Russia is today were bankrupted by their war in Afghanistan. By contrast, the ruble is worth EVEN LESS right now, and the resistance in Ukraine is far more numerous and well equipped. 

Have at it Russia, the west will covertly supply the Ukraine resistance with what it needs while we bleed you dry with sanctions. Point being, the Ukraine will rise again, even after Russia has reverted to it's mid-90s wild west days.",1645740874.0,1645740774.0,t3_t0llt8,t3_t0llt8,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

24.02.2022 23:19
The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reports that due to the imposition of martial law in Ukraine, the departure of a certain category of citizens from Ukraine is temporarily restricted.

In particular, male citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine. 

Such a rule will apply for the period of martial law.

We ask citizens to take this information into account.

Or even simpler, use american munition and intelligence data, fly the airplanes over the border country, shoot the cruise missiles from Ukrainian airspace and return to ammunition in Poland. Rinse and repeat. 

No breach of borders or airspace at all. Also no NATO country is involved as all operations are executed by Ukraine forces from Ukraine towards Ukraine. We remember, NATO is allowed to deliver ammunition like last weeks.

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies. Made sense in my mind as I used Belarus as ""accepted example"". Seems they fucked us over there as well.

The naval advantage would be far too great to get an immediate response from NATO. At the same time soldiers couldn't be flown in because the Baltics wouldn't have aerial supremacy.

Last resort is then to send soldiers by ground which would take way too long and the Baltics would fall in probably 12 hours considering 2 of the capitals are coastal cities.

My timeframe is based off of the invasion of Ukraine and how effective that unfortunately has been.

That's my take. If Putin takes Gotland then the Baltics could fall since NATO wouldn't be able to immediately respond.

>Key Takeaways:
>
>Ukrainian forces are successfully slowing Russian offensives on all axes of advance other than a Russian breakout from the Crimean Peninsula. Russian failure to ground the Ukrainian air force or cripple Ukrainian command and control is likely enabling these initial Ukrainian successes.
>
>Ukrainian forces are contesting the Hostomel military airport, 20 km northwest of Kyiv, as of 9:30 pm local time. Russian VDV (Airborne) troops landed at Hostomel and have also failed to capture the Boryspil airport southeast of Kyiv. Ukraine’s contestation of the airport deprives Russian forces of any location to airlift forces onto Kyiv’s western flank overnight.
>
>Russian forces are rapidly advancing north from Crimea, securing Kherson city. Their deepest penetration to date is about 60 kilometers.
>
>Russian forces are advancing on Kyiv from Belarus on both sides of the Dnipro River.
>
>Russian forces secured the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (on the west bank) at 7:30 pm local time, but Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances east of the Dnipro at Chernihiv.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

The United States has informed the United Nations it has credible information showing that Moscow is compiling lists of Ukrainians “to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation,” according to a letter to the U.N. human rights chief obtained by The Washington Post on Sunday night.  
  
The letter alleges that Moscow’s post-invasion planning would involve torture, forced disappearances and “widespread human suffering.” It does not describe the nature of the intelligence that undergirds its assessment.  
  
Read: U.S. letter to the U.N. alleging Russia is planning human rights abuses in Ukraine  
  
The new warning comes after the Biden administration, amid weeks of speculation about President Vladimir Putin’s intentions in Ukraine, said late last week that the Russian leader had decided to launch an invasion.  
  
Speaking to journalists on a daily call Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the letter’s claims. “Do you realize that this is an absolute canard, a lie? It is absolute fiction. There is no such list. It’s a fake,” Peskov said.  
  
The letter, written by Bathsheba Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva, said, “I would like to bring to your attention disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned.”  
  
“These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions,” said the letter addressed to Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.  
  
Crocker says the Russian military’s targets would include Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and “vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons.”  
  
“Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation,” the letter said, adding that the Biden administration also had information indicating Russian forces would likely use “lethal measures” to subdue peaceful protests or other “peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations.”  
  
The letter was transmitted Sunday night to the U.N. human rights office, OHCHR, in Switzerland.  
  
The Kremlin has denied that it plans to invade Ukraine and has accused the United States and Western governments of disseminating misinformation to destabilize the region.  
  
Russia has amassed about 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s border while demanding that the United States provide guarantees that Ukraine will never become a NATO member, a request Washington has refused.  
  
For civilians in eastern Ukraine, war is already at their doorstep  
After years of peace, villagers in Ukraine's Donbas region are enduring a sharp increase in shelling from separatists and fear a Russian invasion could be next. (Whitney Leaming, Erin Patrick O'Connor, Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)  
Ukrainian diaspora in the U.S. grieves, pleads for peace as conflict escalates in their homeland  
  
The U.S. letter says it is addressing the U.N. human rights office because of its mandate and reporting presence in Ukraine.  
  
On Friday, Foreign Policy reported about U.S. intelligence that Russia had plans for a post-invasion arrest and assassination campaign, citing unnamed U.S. officials.  
  
In 2014, the United Nations established a human rights monitoring mission for Ukraine, with a special focus on the disputed areas of the country’s east. The mission has offices in the capital Kyiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and other cities.  
  
In a report covering August through October 2021, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights cited increased civilian deaths and forced conscription, along with tighter restrictions of freedom of movement by authorities in Luhansk.  
  
U.N. monitors also reported complaints of torture and arbitrary detention in separatist-controlled areas, along with a lack of access to detention sites for independent monitors.  
  
The governments of both Russia and Ukraine have come under criticism for the treatment of LGBTQ individuals in their respective countries.  
  
While LGBTQ advocates have credited Ukraine’s progress in improving the status of LGBTQ individuals in recent years, they say it has more work to do.  
  
The letter says the U.N. human rights office has a global “leadership role” when it comes to monitoring abuses.

Your gonna be in for a rude awakening when the fog of war (propaganda) clears and Russia got what it wanted relatively easily. Ukraine simply does not have the equipment or the military brass to combat Russia in any meaningful way if Russia truly decides to fully invade.

In case you haven't read the speech:

Ukrainian President Zelensky's speech before the attack:

""I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.

That is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.

You are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.

You are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.

You are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?

Donetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.

Artema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.

Donbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.

Shcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost

Lugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.

Note that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?

Many of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.

But, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.

War is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.

Who is going to suffer from this the most? The people.

Who does not want this more than anyone? The people.

Who can prevent all this from happening? The people.

If these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.

I know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.

Do the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation.""",False,1645739770.0,t3_t0llt8,t1_hyarpta,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Nato is like the country version of the United States of America. Each state in America is actually somewhat like its own little country.

I think most western peoples exposure to war is through media like movies and video games, which often portrays it as a heroic struggle of good vs evil and the main characters are wearing plot armor. I think right now you’re seeing a lot of people who have this sanitized view of it as a sport event who are cheering on the “good guys” because in their exposure to the subject, the good guys and the underdogs usually win. 

Russia has shown that they intend to practice total war during this invasion and spare no civilian casualties. This war will kill thousands.

No one has a strategic interest in protecting Russia, and no nation has a defensive alliance with Russia (let alone one that would be triggered by Russia acting as an aggressor.)

They probably dropped off 2-3 companies of Russian paratroopers who were shown on video fully kitted out. Ukranians were shocked and it took several hours for them to realize that it was an air assault and not just an airstrike by attack choppers. They spent most of the air raining artillery on it to try and retake it but were thwarted by Russian Su-25s providing CAS. Ukrainians claim the Ivans retreated to the towns and wooded areas nearby.

The situation around Chernihiv is bad, UA held the city so the Ivans bypassed it and pushed SW along the road to Kiev. Reports are that they are only **45km NE of Kiev**.

In Kharkiv where there was heavy fighting, the Ivans bypassed Kharkiv and tried to flank it from the East. UA blew a bridge/damn over a lake/river to the South East of Kharkiv like 2 hours ago to avoid being outflanked.

In Sumi a smaller Russian force rolled through but the UA successfully ambushed several sections of the armored columns with Javelins and other ATGMs and images surfaced of blown up tanks, armor, and even a Tor M-1. Russkies appeared to be hunkered down here due to their losses from the hit and run tactics.

The Kherson region just north of Crimea was a major F\*\*\* Up by the UA. UA retreated with a highway traffic camera showing a Russian armored convoy just 4 minutes behind the Ukrainian column that was retreating. A Ukrainian S300 launcher was shown on fire in the stowed transport position in the middle of a field. By the time the UA responded the Russians have crossed the Dnieper River under RPG fire but so far been contained to 2 bridgeheads for tongiht.

The major issue is Crimean force went NW and NE. The NE prong captured a strategic city of Melitopol which opens up Eastern Ukraine. It's 60 miles West of Mauripol. If Russians go east, they could force UA to retreat from Mauriopol tomorrow to prevent encirclement. If they go NE they could within days cut off all UA force in East Ukraine by taking Dnipro.

The Dniepr River bisects Ukraine and there are only a few big bridges that can handle armored columns and Putin controls the southern ones. Over the next few days even if the Eastern UA forces hold against the line of contact, their fate will be decided by the Russian elements heading up from Melitopol. If they go north they can force a collapse of everything East of the Dnieper by threatening their rear and eventual encirclement.",1645741121.0,1645740803.0,t3_t0llt8,t1_hyas4rt,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

As for USA land invasion? We talking about ignoring reaching the land and having the starting point being the beach? Large portion of coastal USA would not be ideal for land invasion. You would be left with California coast, And very small strips of coast along side the eastern coast. Traveling Eastward from the west coast would be a nightmare and would be a literal death march. Traveling west from the east coast would be a battle against nature. Alaska would be an easy capture sadly.


Now this is all before the human element comes in. USA is massive! How massive? A single state nuked itself so much it became a tourist attraction. It was done for funsies. 


Human element: USA the manufacturing backbone for WW2. It literally supplied many countries war cache by itself. It is still producing so many tanks and shit that the army is begging for it to stop. You will have to combat the infinite spawn point of weapons, ammo, and vehicles, while you need to ship your replacements by boat. Did i mention USA is massive? So your supply lines will be danger all the time.


Civilians: we have this weird thing with Violence. We want peace, we want love. But when it comes to violence, holy fuck do we Americans get massive boners over it. See the twin towers incident. We wanted blood. Lots if it. And we got what we wanted. How much violence is too much? Just look at what we allow children to watch. So you will have to fight against violence loving civilians would will not hesitate to get armed, the smart ones building homebrew chemical weapons, and those who want to very literally skull fuck you. As in sticking their dong in your skull and making brain jelly.

USA would have to have some super advanced tech to knock down any ICBMs that got launched. Black project shit that we wouldn't know about for another half century. ICBM missiles are extremely fast and are very difficult to take out with missiles. It's like trying to strike a bullet out of the sky with another bullet.

ISW incorrectly forecasted that any Russian offensive would begin with a concentrated air and missile campaign to cripple Ukrainian command and control and infrastructure.

The Ukrainian military has shot down seven Russian aircraft and seven helicopters as of 8:00 pm local time, February 24.

You're assuming NATO would back down, I'm assuming they wouldn't. No way to know one way or another until it happens. 

But to take the next step to say that NATO should take the initiative and insert themselves into what in reality is a regional conflict is asinine.

NATO was not created to protect the world, that's SUPPOSED to be the job of the United Nations. NATO was created to protect its member nations, of which Ukraine does not belong. It's tragic to be sure, but the answer is not to make things exponentially worse by pigheadedly rushing the rest of the world to war. 

Further to that point, if any NATO member provokes or undertakes an offensive war then all bets are off and the other NATO members are not required to come to their aid. So if the United States or any other member nations engage in this conflict directly and then are subsequently attacked back by Russian forces it will not trigger Article 5, thereby actually taking the teeth away from the entire alliance.

Paratroopers are more costly and are often represent your best soldiers. They will have less equipment and fight at a disadvantage vs their opposition. 

So the loss of a paratrooper platoon / battalion / whatever Russia dedicated to that area is a significant loss to the Russians. These weren't some dumbass kids or conscripts, they were highly trained best-of-the-best soldiers.

-----

Still though, you won't expect paratroopers to stand up vs the regular military / ground forces. Its like telling your quarterback to engage against a lineman in football. No matter how well trained and ""elite"" a quarterback is, they just aren't built like a linebacker. The quarterback has an important and ""elite"" job to do, but you can't expect them to win in a brute-force match against the brutes.

That being said, for Russia to lose paratroopers like this suggests that they were overly optimistic about the advances they could make in day#1.",1645739815.0,1645739621.0,t3_t0llt8,t1_hyar5aj,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes, absolutely nothing untoward has been done by either America or Russia to one another since then.

🙃


Duck and cover ended, sure, but ""American's"" have slowly eroded their education system (and intelligence) to the point Donald Trump was able to be elected, America is not what it once was.  Meanwhile, Russia is like ""Hmm, yeah I think I want that -yoink-."". While we all clutch our pearls.

If America wants the credit for how it is today, by all means, take it.  I choose to believe they didn't do this to themselves, that Russia and China have been pulling the strings with puppets and cyber attacks. 

Don't get me wrong, what is happening is wrong.  Beyond wrong.
