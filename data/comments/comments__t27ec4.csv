d4be0b0808fe1cbdeeef06bdd804f717,t27ec4,hykiog7,"Because ive seen many people going on about the ""some banks"" part of the sanctions: 

It is only some banks because some might either be too small and insignificant or simply too big to fail for western markets.

But you have to understand, disconnecting one major bank from swift is a very major sanction, disconnecting multiple is crippling and to freeze the assets of the central bank is absolutely brutal for an economy that was already struggling. Especially with the sanctions that were already in place/been announced.

In other words: Russia can import key materials for their most important sectors, many banks have been disconnected from the global finance market and their central bank cant even try to stimulate the economy because its assets have been frozen. 

So if your bank is not able to conduct financial transactions and your central bank cant counteract, panic and run on banks will follow. In a post covid world economy that was already facing inflation as it is, this is absolutely lethal for the russian economy. These are the best options, that wont drag us down the drain with Putin

Swift is the world’s main international payments network. Several countries have already expressed support for locking Russia out of the platform, and Germany, which had previously oppose the measure, leant its support earlier today.

In regards to ""Some Banks"", rumors are its aimed at the Big russian banks and those that have been sanctioned in the past.  Basically they are allowing smaller banks to operate, so as not to disrupt small russian businesses.  The idea appears to be: they did not want to destroy and harm russian people and small businesses.

The 2nd is big as well.  They are basically locking out Russias $650b war chest made up of foreign currency, gold, etc.  Now, Russians can still deal with China and India directly, but it hurts their ability to liquidate, which drops the liquidity of their assets.

One of the better assessment's of what is going on. 

* Russia has failed to encircle and isolate Kyiv with the combination of mechanized and airborne attacks as it had clearly planned to do. Russian forces are now engaging in more straightforward mechanized drives into the capital along a narrow front along the west bank of the Dnipro River and toward Kyiv from a broad front to the northeast.
* Russian forces have temporarily abandoned failed efforts to seize Chernihiv and Kharkiv to the northeast and east of Kyiv and are bypassing those cities to continue their drive on Kyiv.  Russian attacks against both cities appear to have been poorly designed and executed and to have encountered more determined and effective Ukrainian resistance than they expected.
* Russian movements in eastern Ukraine remain primarily focused on pinning the large concentration of Ukrainian conventional forces arrayed along the former line of contact in the east, likely to prevent them from interfering with Russian drives on Kyiv and to facilitate their encirclement and destruction.
* Russian forces coming north from Crimea halted their drive westward toward Odesa, and Ukrainian forces have retaken the critical city of Kherson. Some Russian troops remain west of the Dnipro River and are advancing on Mikolayiv, but the main axes of advance have shifted to the north and east toward Zaporizhie and Mariupol respectively.
* Russian forces have taken the critical city of Berdyansk from the west, threatening to encircle Mariupol even as Russian forces based in occupied Donbas attack Mariupol from the east, likely to pin defenders in the city as they are encircled.
* Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.
* Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.

 The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) is a United States–based think tank founded in 2007 by Kimberly Kagan. ISW describes itself as a non-partisan think tank providing research and analysis regarding issues of defense and foreign affairs. Others have described ISW as ""a hawkish Washington"" group[1] favoring an ""aggressive foreign policy"".[2] It has produced reports on the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, ""focusing on military operations, enemy threats, and political trends in diverse conflict zones"".[3] The non-profit organization is supported by grants and contributions from large defense contractors,[2] including Raytheon, General Dynamics, DynCorp and others.[4] It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.[5]",False,1645911043.0,t3_t27ec4,t3_t27ec4,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

> **Exclusive: Opponents of Vladimir Putin flying to Mexico with the hope of crossing the border to claim political asylum**

> Thousands of Russians are trying to reach the United States to claim political asylum and avoid being drafted to the army, the Telegraph can reveal.

> Immigration lawyers in America have been inundated with inquiries from Russian men and their families asking if the US will grant them political protection amid fears of conscription, following Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

> In recent months, record numbers of Russian citizens have been apprehended on the US border with Mexico, as an easy path to the US offers opponents of Vladimir Putin’s government an escape.

> The Telegraph has spoken to bank managers, engineers and fashion designers who have all left their homes in search of a new life in the US after being targeted by police in Russia.

> But now, immigration lawyers say the numbers will “skyrocket” amid fears that military-age men will be called up to fight in the war with Ukraine - which has already called up conscripts and reservists aged between 18 and 60.

> In 2020, just 467 Russians were detained at America's southern border. Last year, that number soared to 9,376 - a result of the Russian crackdown on dissent following widespread protests spearheaded by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, experts say.

> But the numbers are still increasing. Last month, 1,028 Russians and 248 Ukrainians made their way across the border, mostly crossing from Tijuana to San Diego.

> “We have never been so busy,” said Ekaterina Mouratova, a Russian-American immigration lawyer based in Miami. “But the number is going to skyrocket. I have got tons of emails in the last few days - hundreds. They are mostly men between 20 and 55 who are asking if they can get protection from the US if Russia does a mandatory military draft. These people do not want to go to war.

> “Conditions in Russia are becoming harsher and harsher and there is a lot of political instability around the region. More and more people are looking for a way out.”

>In cities across Russia on Thursday night, thousands of people protested against the invasion and more than 1,500 were arrested.

The UAE, China and India abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Germany, which has the EU's biggest trade flows with Russia, was initially reluctant to get on board with cutting off Russia from the world's main international payments network, saying it must first weigh the economic consequences of such move.

Italy and Hungary also opposed this.

The 5,000 helmets Germany committed to sending to Ukraine last month are finally on their way to the Eastern European country on the second day of Russia’s invasion.

Then the good news:

President Joe Biden instructed the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks to Ukraine on Friday as it struggles to repulse a Russian invasion.

The United States drew from U.S. weapons stocks to supply Ukraine in the fall of 2021 and then again in December. Over the past year the United States has committed more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.

The Netherlands will supply 200 Stinger air defense rockets to Ukraine as quickly as possible, the Dutch government said in a letter to parliament on Saturday.

Belgium has pledged 2,000 machine guns and 3,800 tons of fuel.

Germany, which had a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, approved the delivery of 400 rocket propelled grenades from the Netherlands to Ukraine, the defense ministry in Berlin said, confirming a shift in policy after it faced criticism for refusing to send weapons to Kyiv, unlike other Western allies.

The Ukrainian military appears to be holding well overall (at likely great cost) with a key exception: The south, where it seems to have struggled far more. Notable Russian advances made today, despite Ukrainian reinforcements.

Berdyansk airport (defunct) in southern Ukraine has been captured by Russian forces according to local city council

One of these tactical developments that may sound like nothing but could actually mean a lot, as it has effectively reduced distance between the (initially) Crimea-based offensive and the frontline near Mariupol to around 90 km.

Not posting them, but there are multiple videos of destroyed Ukrainian columns in the south, where the fighting is the most difficult for Ukrainian forces. Russian forces have made significant progress there, despite Ukrainian resistance.

I want to caution that, although Ukrainian forces are holding far better than I think Putin expected, Moscow is still making progress in the south, and could link up Donbass with Crimea soon, and push deeper inside central Ukraine

They may not celebrate but I hope both sides adopt the Forgiveness Sunday mentality this coming week and all parties can work towards a common goal, one of peace, unification (not politically) and acceptance.

I know its an unpopular opinion and no one is thinking about this right now exactly but i hope for the best.

Russia says there were 82 people there not 13 and all of them got captured alive: https://youtu.be/T1nnqECp__E Did the Ukraine comment on this report?

I doubt that any side would outright lie as it will inevitably get clear what really happened once the conflict ends. But I am sure that both sides are being creative and selectively present information (for instance I'm sure Russians are omitting something because they didn't show interview with the soldiers). My guesses:

1. 13 Ukrainians died when the island got captured, later Ukrainians sent larger platoon, Russians sent more ships / paratroopers causing Ukrainians to surrender.
2. 13 Ukrainians soldiers did die defending the island, but there were 82 more people present there (maybe scientists, civilians) who got captured.

> Similarly, the move to target Russia’s central bank comes with little precedent, as they could attempt to freeze the foreign reserves of a country with nuclear weapons. Some experts believe such a step could carry risks if Moscow felt like its money was being held ransom.

> Russia’s central bank has more than $640 billion in foreign exchange reserves, much of it held in the computers of western central banks in cities such as New York, London, and Frankfurt. The effort to freeze or quarantine that money is likely to put tremendous pressure on Russia, one of the world’s largest economies.

> “When people saw the luxurious lifestyle politicians had and that they weren’t doing anything for the people, lots of us took to the streets,” he said, speaking on the phone from Florida. “But the protests became violent. I was beaten up and thrown in jail to teach me a lesson.”

> Yevgeniy believes he made himself a target after filing an official complaint about his mistreatment.

> “People started threatening my mother and I saw that police were arresting people on false charges saying they were extremists.

> “One day they came to my apartment to seize my computer and electronics. I told them there was nothing on there, but they said they would for sure find extremist material. This was not an empty threat so I went to a friend's apartment and started to research where I could go.”

> At that point, he found a video by a man named Dmitry Politov that had just a few hundred views. The 29-year-old Muscovite who also marched with Navalny supporters feared for his freedom and worried that he could still be targeted in Europe.

> In a 33-minute video, he explains and then carries out his plan. Politov travelled to Cancun because in Mexico, Russians need only an electronic visa to enter, rather than having to visit a consulate.

> He then cancelled his return flight and headed for Tijuana, on the border with San Diego. There, he went up to US border officials and claimed political asylum.

> Yevgeniy’s mind was made up and within 48 hours, without telling anyone, he and his wife were on a flight to Cancun.

Indeed, in every war, the average soldier is no different from any other average citizen. Even if they believe they are fighting a righteous cause, that is because the political apparatus controlling them has told them so.

To be clear in the OTHER direction, this does not give the average soldier carte blanche. This is why, specifically, we have actual rules for war. A soldier told to shoot other soldiers is not committing murder. A soldier shooting at clearly unarmed civilians is. Soldiers are still responsible to their own consciences, and if they receive illegal orders, they must weigh the decision of following them - and committing such an offense - or refusing, and probably facing execution unless the unit as a whole is able to rebel.

If Putin is truly crazy enough to sling nukes over Ukraine, then he's going to attack NATO countries at some point.  There's no doubt about it.  And it's quite possible that after a series of events to boost confidence of his army and generals that he gets more support than he likely has right now.  Though this seems to be going bad enough that we may not have to do anything for it to resolve Russia's regime issues.

People need to remember, that Nazi Germany leadership utterly SHOCKED and went into despair when France and the UK declared war after the invasion of Poland.  The policy of appeasement had built up their confidence enough to believe that they could now take the West in a war, but they were utterly afraid of the costs.  If that declaration had come in 1937, Germany is very likely to immediately sue for piece and withdraw from any territorial gains.  Unlike Germany in the 30's Putin doesn't have widespread internal support from his country, standing up to him is more likely to cause a regime change than a nuclear war.

If he's not crazy enough to sling nukes over Ukraine and this is all bluster, then he's not going to sling nukes.

This has been a thing since war has been written about, and is just another thing in the ""fog of war"". 


His other reasons though make no sense. Yea, the U.S and the EU are not at war with Russia, and sanctions are not currently hitting their energy sector. How is that relevant. 
And he thinks that Ukraine and Russia aren't really at war?? He's saying that the entire conflict is ""manufactured""??

If it was only a ground war, China could have a nice numerical advantage if they could even mobilize the force. Russia can't mobilize its entire force right now. It takes practice, experience and equipment to mobilize an entire force.

They don't have modern combat experience at all. It's one thing for equipment to work on a staged, regulated training field and another to work against actual targets. I do think China may be inflating all of its numbers, resources and technology to stay strong in public view. It's hard to take seriously any nation that has state-sponsored media. People thought Russia had a modern military before this, it was tested and test came back ""poor performing""

They do have some technology advantages for sure, but the best handling car in the world can still be crashed by a bad driver. I don't think China's military doctrine is properly tested.

Russia using a favorite soviet strategy. They barrell in deep using armoured tanks and artillery to surround a capture key infrastructure like airports, bridges etc. Then bring in support lines from the rear. It is risky because the armoured units are exposed.

This was a well known soviet tactic. People forget that the Ukrainian army was soviet too and would be trained in such. They know the weaknesses. 

Many of the russian casualties will be from exposed support lines behind the mainline. They wait for the tanks to pass and attack the exposed support lines, cutting off the armoured front, leaving them even more exposed. 

It was a risky tactic by the Russians, which may not have worked, because it was what was expected. Don't let that fool anyone into thinking Russian is not overwhelmingly superior militarily.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

We've shot down Russian planes before, and declared no-fly zones in places they wanted to send warplanes before.  They're not going to launch nukes because of it.  Putin may be a ""strong man"" type character but he's not insane, and cares about money and his croneys enough to not end the world.
