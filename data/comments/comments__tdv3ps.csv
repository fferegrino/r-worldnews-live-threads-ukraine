""The occupiers are aiming at agricultural machinery and undermining food security in Ukraine and the world

March 14, 2022
The occupiers are deliberately destroying agricultural machinery in Ukraine. Systematic cases of such actions have been recorded in Brovary district (Kyiv region), Melitopol district (Zaporizhia region), Pryluky, Nizhyn, Novgorod-Siversky districts (Chernihiv region). In a number of districts of Kherson and Kharkiv regions.
Also, agricultural machinery is requisitioned en masse by the invaders for engineering work, construction of fortifications and for use as tractors for armored vehicles. The local population in the occupied settlements is forcibly involved in these works.
According to the latest reports: on the night of March 13 in the settlements of Chupakhivka and Olenynske of Okhtyrka district (Sumy region) a targeted air-bomb attack was carried out on the places of storage of agricultural machinery. As a result of the strike, all equipment, more than 30 units, was destroyed.
Such actions of the enemy indicate the following:

There is a deliberate destruction of agricultural machinery by the enemy. This will jeopardize the sowing campaign in the spring. Which could lead to a humanitarian crisis in some regions of our country.
 Not only Ukraine's food security is under threat. Our country is one of the main suppliers of many types of crops to the markets of Europe and China.
The occupiers continue the practice of striking at civilian objects. This grossly violates the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.""

> China cannot be tied to Putin and needs to be cut off as soon as possible. In the sense that an escalation of conflict between Russia and the West helps divert U.S. attention from China, China should rejoice with and even support Putin, but only if Russia does not fall. Being in the same boat with Putin will impact China should he lose power. Unless Putin can secure victory with China’s backing, a prospect which looks bleak at the moment, China does not have the clout to back Russia. The law of international politics says that there are “no eternal allies nor perpetual enemies,” but “our interests are eternal and perpetual.” Under current international circumstances, China can only proceed by safeguarding its own best interests, choosing the lesser of two evils, and unloading the burden of Russia as soon as possible.

""Ukrainian authorities accused Russian troops on Monday of detonating ammunition at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

In a statement, Ukraine's communications center alleged that Russian forces blew up explosives next to the nuclear plant and that authorities were waiting for a response from the International Atomic Energy Agency.  

Ukrainian officials also alleged that Russian forces plan to continue with explosions at the plant, and that staff had fled. 

Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear energy company, said in a Telegram statement that 11 representatives of Rosatom, Russia's state atomic energy corporation, were at the nuclear plant when the explosions were reported. 

""It is obvious that the detonation of ammunition on the site of the station is carried out with their direct participation,"" Energoatom wrote in the statement. ""So it turns out that Rosatom is also involved in this terrorism.""

Energoatom added: ""All established international rules and requirements for nuclear and radiation safety are violated by this company.""

Ukraine's parliament tweeted earlier on Monday that Russia planned ""to begin 'disposal' of ammunition right on the site of the station near the ruins of the [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] training center.""

The nuclear plant, which is Europe's largest, was seized by the Russian military on March 4 after a battle with Ukrainian forces. Civilians had previously tried to deny Russia from accessing the plant by blocking nearby roads. 

During the fighting, a fire broke out at the plant, but officials concluded that radiation levels remained stable. 

On Saturday, energy officials from Rosatom arrived at the plant to take control of operations. 

Meanwhile, Russian forces have closed in on a nuclear plant in Yuzhnoukrainsk, south of Ukraine's capital city Kyiv. 

As Russia continues its assault on Ukraine, the IAEA warned last week of an ""unprecedented danger"" that a nuclear disaster could occur in Ukraine as its nuclear facilities are attacked. ""

Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world, epitomizing the horror of an attack on humanity’s most innocent.  
In video and photos shot Wednesday by AP journalists after the attack on the hospital, the woman was seen stroking her bloodied lower abdomen as rescuers rushed her through the rubble in the besieged city of Mariupol, her blanched face mirroring her shock at what had just happened. It was among the most brutal moments so far in Russia’s now 19-day-old war on Ukraine.  
The woman was rushed to another hospital, yet closer to the frontline, where doctors labored to keep her alive. Realizing she was losing her baby, medics said, she cried out to them, “Kill me now!”  
Surgeon Timur Marin found the woman’s pelvis crushed and hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon said.  
Then, they focused on the mother.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian military is not ruling out taking ""complete control"" over the already encircled cities. In such a case, there will be humanitarian corridors to protect civilians, Peskov said. He justified this by saying that ""nationalist formations"" had allegedly placed ""military equipment"" in residential areas. Russian forces are currently advancing on several major cities in Ukraine. The main fear is an encirclement of the capital Kyiv.

I mean it’s not so big news according to the combat footage but it’s the first time they announced it officially I guess?

It's absolutely an escalation yes, but international politics is a whole ball game of ""I'm not touching you"" War doesn't **actually** happen until one side shoots the other or enters their territory (this is why everyone said the no-fly zone is not doable). 

This is why Putin can say ""The West giving arms to Ukraine is war/Sanctions is the US waging war"" but none of this strong talk of his has led to actual war. He talks shit but is absolutely 100% afraid of a direct military conflict with NATO. He says the arms shipments are ""valid targets"" but refuses to actually shoot at them since they're organized in poland. 

The turkish straights is technically international waters but in practical terms goes through Turkish territory (same for danish straights). Closing the waters effectively activates the 'no touching' rule. Turkey has not actually attacked Russia, so Putin has effectively three choices to deal with it. 1) Back down and accept status quo 2) Cease invasion to regain access to the sea 3) Force the straights and start WW3.

Also worth noting, this would not completely cut off Russian access to shipping since they have arctic and pacific ports.

Ultimately, closing the straights is a massive escalation but it is not equivalent to a NATO DOW. Putin would need to make that choice and everyone knows he cannot afford a shooting conflict with NATO. 

That said, I don't think it's probable that the west actually closes the straights as its been avoiding escalation tactics for the moment. I think this latest announcement was them testing the waters publicly.",1647280898.0,1647280796.0,t3_tdv3ps,t3_tdv3ps,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

""These weapons are extremely inaccurate, regularly missing their targets by half a kilometre or more and should never be used in populated areas.""

Cant say who fired the 9M79-1 with 9N123k warhead that landed in Donetsk. But I can say they're inaccurate. Russia made wide use of them in Syria, and they have been shown to have used them in this conflict too - specifically the cluster variant. Russia has accused Ukraine of using them (via TASS) too.

I will note that at least some of Ukraine's tochka-u are painted grey with bands of black and white with darker grey tips. The donetsk missile is standard soviet green

Missile fragments: (48.0090301, 37.8040842)

Explosion site: (48.0071114, 37.7989692)

34e2f2ea5168bc4be792c9cf9d073953,tdv3ps,i0n8272,"For those wondering why China would help RU as per that FT report, this is my assessment as to why. 

China is facing real economic issues at home just from their real estate sector alone. Their views towards finance differ from that of the West. They see RE as a savings account, in an economy that allows them very little investment alternatives. It's the main vehicle for economic/wealth creation in China. So, their RE market be wobbly over the last few months is not great and stabilizing it is a prime concern for the govt. They're seeing a growing ""lay flat"" movement, a type of protest against socioeconomic conditions. Layer on top of that their obsession with their zero covid policy, you have these bizarre rolling economic ""lock downs"" when major hubs get put on lockdown. 

So how does that relate to RU? Well, with the invasion, commodity prices have skyrocketed, and energy was been bouncing around all over the place. Ultimately, there is a lot of risk to the global economy. This is what China ultimately fears, a slowdown in the global economy from these exogenous shocks. You're seeing central banks trying to clamp down on inflation, with recession fears in more than one significant economy.  A slowdown in the global economy would directly threaten their attempts to stabilize their economy at home. They need social stability. 

So why help RU? Well, the hard line that NATO has drawn is a guidepost for China. To them, they most likely see the outcome in UKR as a foregone conclusion in favor of RU without NATO intervention. The problem is the speed of how you offramp this mass mobilization. The longer this goes on, the bigger a problem it becomes for everyone affected, directly or indirectly. There is a real risk that these exogenous economic shocks keep ramping up the longer this goes on. From China's perpective, it would be the high reward low risk move to help RU win this faster. This isn't a win by conventional means, and RU won't be able to hold UKR in the conventional sense, but every other country wants this to deescalate and move onto a post-conflict scenario, even if it means a prolonged insurgency. People just don't want the mass mobilization. 

What about sanctions? Well, we're still seeing some resistance against full energy sanctions on RU from other NATO members, and to be honest, I think China knows that sanctions against them would probably be less palatable to these countries. I believe the US would be serious about it, but the rest of the globe probably wouldn't be in support. Reason being, all these economies are embattled on the home front already with high energy costs and inflation. Sanctions on China would layer on even more inflation on goods, and would be tantamount to political suicide at home for many economies.  This is why I believed China would be all for RU assistance. It's such a high reward move that directly serves their primary  interests domestically. 

How would China help? For now I imagine it would be mostly in the form of ISR capabilities to force multiply the RU ground troops at first, to test the waters for Western tolerance of such support. Direct munitions and attack assistance might still be a stretch. But it's not impossible that aid in those forms would follow.",False,1647280833.0,t3_tdv3ps,t3_tdv3ps,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

“If one side uses force without compunction, undeterred by the bloodshed it involves, while the other side refrains, the first will gain the upper hand.” 

Some meaningful points: 

> The American fear of escalation has been a repeated note throughout this conflict. But to the extent American leaders express that sentiment, or spread such notions to receptive reporters, they make matters worse, giving the Russians a psychological edge. The Russians can (and do) threaten to ratchet things up, knowing that the West will respond with increased anxiety rather than reciprocal menace. We have yet to see, for example, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin telling the world what a wretched hand the Russians are playing militarily, and how much superior ours is—a message he is particularly fit to deliver.

...

> We are dealing with an enemy that is vicious but weak, menacing but deeply fearful, and that is likely to crack long before our side does—if only we have the stomach for doing what needs to be done.

Got it today circulating in local area chats, dared to translate – so you can have better understanding. These especially can be useful for those who think that sending sms messages into Russia is helpful. So:

""Frolischi’s answer for western sanctions:Dear Western and European countries!

We, residents of Frolischi village, Nizhegorodskaya oblast, officially claiming that we laying \[a dick\] on your sanctions packet.  Many thanks for closing your social networks in Russia, may be now more people will spend their time on useful things. Frolischi’s don’t care about closing the H&M, Zara and other shit.  If someone have no clothes – go for our market, Wed, Sat and Sun we have everything.It is sad that IKEA have been closed – 80% of out village realized that it existed from only from news. Apple sanctions and closing of their stores also have no impact – there was no such store in Frolischi. Also there are no comments about foreign real estate assets and currencyaccounts. So our people now cant fly to Monaco and Italy for a weekends, we have to grow potatos in our dacha’s. We know about restriction for our cats to take part in international competitions and exhibitions – but our cats boycotted those events for a long time. Thanks for closing your countries for our tourists. We have 89 federal states in Russian Federation, there are a lots tosee. Karelia, Dagestan, Kazan, Irkutsk – a lot of places to go. It is said that Zewa toilet paper is also leaves Russia – but in our Frolischi we haven’t shit in such luxury way, so we will substitute your import goods with ours.

So, we want to say you that you’ll cannot comprehend Russia by the mind alone and measure it with the common measures. She has a peculiar character, in Russia, one can only believe.We have lived through an awful things, we chewed a tar instead of bubble-gum, clean our asses with burdocks, healed every sickness with plantain. Gather you belongings and go to train, go away all foreign business – or it will be nationalized.With your sanctions, you awaken our greatest strength – Patriotism. All you sanctions against Putin is futile. He is the president of Russia, which we have elected and will elect.West, fuck you!

Sincerely, Frolischi

Think about it for a moment. If you believe the West is hostile, and the only thing the West is offering is more threats, would you throw Russia under the bus just to delay the inevitable confrontation vs. the West, or would you want to ""get it over with""?

Russia is struggling to achieve anything but also Putin don't want to use his full power because THAT would be a sign of weakness. Using all his power to crush a territory that he doesn't even recognize as a indipendent nation would look absolutely desperate.

I think these demands seems more a way to push other forces in this war in order to extend the issues and generate a domino effect where he's not the only one gettin his hands dirty.

Thing is, China is all about business and this war is already a negative situation even if it could turn into a scenario where China will be able to exploit Russian resources, but that's an hypothetical scenario while the actual scenario is bad for business and they can't gamble too much guessing what's going to happen in the future.

The sign of weakness was Putin miscalculation of Ukraine reaction and even more he didn't saw NATO and EU getting all together in this mess and throwing at him the most brutal sanctions ever.

But what Russia didn't count on is that people tend to rather get mad about seeing civilians bombed in a straight-forward and poorly justified war of aggression, and that will quickly grow into open admiration of those who resist that sort of thing, and all that leads to strong political pressure on leaders to implement sanctions and take other actions.

>Now in Thucydides the philosophy of history rests on the probability, which the uniformity of human nature affords us, that the future will in the course of human things resemble the past, if not reproduce it. He appears to contemplate a recurrence of the phenomena of history as equally certain with a return of the epidemic of the Great Plaque.

>Notwithstanding what German critics have written on the subject, we must beware of regarding this conception as a mere reproduction of that cyclic theory of events which sees in the world nothing but the rotation of Strophe and Antistrophe, in the eternal choir of life and death.

>For, in his remarks on the excesses of the Corcyrean Revolution, Thucydides distinctly rests his idea of the recurrence of history on the psychological grounds of the general sameness of mankind.
""The sufferings,"" he says, ""which revolution entailed upon the cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always will occur, as long as human nature remains the same, though in severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the particular case.""

>""In peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments, because they are not confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes away the easy supply of men's wants, and so proves a hard taskmaster, which brings most men's characters to a level with their fortunes.""

>It is evident that here Thucydides is ready to admit the variety of manifestations which external causes bring about in their workings on the uniform character of the nature of man. Yet, after all is said, these are perhaps but very general statements: that ordinary effects of peace and war are dwelt on, but there is no real analysis of the immediate causes and general laws of the phenomena of life, nor does Thucydides seem to recognize **the truth that if humanity proceeds in circles, the circles are always widening**.

The original version of 

https://uscnpm.org/2022/03/12/hu-wei-russia-ukraine-war-china-choice/

 is in Chinese and is meant to guide policy in China. It is written by a geopolitics professor: 

“Hu Wei is the vice-chairman of the Public Policy Research Center of the Counselor’s Office of the State Council, the chairman of Shanghai Public Policy Research Association, the chairman of the Academic Committee of the Chahar Institute, a professor, and a doctoral supervisor. “

The advice in the document for Chinese leadership is wise and insightful. It boils down to “Putin’s is unlikely to win even if he takes Ukraine territory due to all the people that live there resisting with arms and economic sanctions support from NATO, etc. For China it is dumb to align with Putin or even stay neutral for much longer.”

——

My thoughts: 

If China drops support as this paper recommends Putin will be forced into a corner. He may try a small nuclear strike in Ukraine as a “demonstration” to scare NATO 
to improve his bargaining position else just try cut a withdrawal deal to make the best of his limited options. My guess is that a strategic loss in Ukraine in couple years will cost him his leadership position and possibly his life as that has been the pattern in Russian history.

Why a small nuke? https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t5y6eg/zelensky_if_you_cant_close_the_sky_now_then_give/hzkh9kn/ also https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/t04z1d/the_war_in_ukraine_megathread/hznmq6c/

What could help? Give Putin refuge to retire in peace (with UN protection etc) if he agrees to use what power he still has left to make Russia a genuine democracy: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/syut4k/nato_chief_sees_every_indication_russia_still/hy2nj87/ explains this idea and why may be better than revenge / “justice”

——

Highly recommend reading the full policy paper. Select quotes from the conclusion:

“Under current international circumstances, China can only proceed by safeguarding its own best interests, choosing the lesser of two evils, and unloading the burden of Russia as soon as possible.”

“China should avoid playing both sides in the same boat, give up being neutral, and choose the mainstream position in the world. At present, China has tried not to offend either side and walked a middle ground in its international statements and choices, including abstaining from the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly votes. However, this position does not meet Russia’s needs, and it has infuriated Ukraine and its supporters as well as sympathizers, putting China on the wrong side of much of the world. In some cases, apparent neutrality is a sensible choice, but it does not apply to this war, where China has nothing to gain. Given that China has always advocated respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, it can avoid further isolation only by standing with the majority of the countries in the world. This position is also conducive to the settlement of the Taiwan issue.”

“China should achieve the greatest possible strategic breakthrough and not be further isolated by the West. Cutting off from Putin and giving up neutrality will help build China’s international image and ease its relations with the U.S. and the West. Though difficult and requiring great wisdom, it is the best option for the future. “

“There are already voices in the U.S. that Europe is important, but China is more so, and the primary goal of the U.S. is to contain China from becoming the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific region. Under such circumstances, China’s top priority is to make appropriate strategic adjustments accordingly, to change the hostile American attitudes towards China, and to save itself from isolation. The bottom line is to prevent the U.S. and the West from imposing joint sanctions on China.”

“China should prevent the outbreak of world wars and nuclear wars and make irreplaceable contributions to world peace. As Putin has explicitly requested Russia’s strategic deterrent forces to enter a state of special combat readiness, the Russo-Ukrainian war may spiral out of control. A just cause attracts much support; an unjust one finds little. If Russia instigates a world war or even a nuclear war, it will surely risk the world’s turmoil. To demonstrate China’s role as a responsible major power, China not only cannot stand with Putin, but also should take concrete actions to prevent Putin’s possible adventures. China is the only country in the world with this capability, and it must give full play to this unique advantage. Putin’s departure from China’s support will most likely end the war, or at least not dare to escalate the war.”",1647279780.0,1647275425.0,t3_tdv3ps,t1_i0mbium,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Putinist ideology is dualist. The dark force of Nazism fights against force of light, Russia. Hence, anyone who objects Russia *now* is Nazi. Finns, Poles and ofc Ukrainians. Having Ukrainian identity is itself a proof of your Nazism. If were not Nazi, you'd just become Russian

That's a paradoxical twist of Putinist ideology which is not well understood abroad. Any minority culture which is regarded as a threat to the homogeneity of Russian world will be declared:

1. fake
2. treasonous
3. Nazi

Russia is the force of light, so those defying it are Nazi

In 2020 Putin introduced new amendments into Article 68 of Constitution which called the Russian language  the tongue of the ""state-forming ethnicity"".

Many minorities objected against this obvious move to make Russia a Russian ethnostate. They were immediately accused of Nazism

[According to an ex-KGB spy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)...Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years.

Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump [real estate to launder money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). 

In 1984, David Bogatin — [a convicted Russian mobster](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-04-03-9201300839-story.html) and close ally of [Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss](https://www.villagevoice.com/1998/05/26/the-most-dangerous-mobster-in-the-world/) — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. [Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html). 

[“During the ’80s and ’90s, we in the U.S. government repeatedly saw a pattern by which criminals would use condos and high-rises to launder money,” says Jonathan Winer, a deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the Clinton administration. “It didn’t matter that you paid too much, because the real estate values would rise, and it was a way of turning dirty money into clean money. It was done very systematically, and it explained why there are so many high-rises where the units were sold but no one is living in them.”](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)
 
When Trump Tower was built, [as David Cay Johnston reports in The Making of Donald Trump, it was only the second high-rise in New York that accepted anonymous buyers](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-making-of-donald-trump/).

In 1987, [the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider business prospects](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/).

[A short while later he made his first call for the dismantling of the NATO alliance](https://apnews.com/article/05133dbe63ace98766527ec7d16ede08).  Which would benefit Russia.  

At the beginning of 1990, [Donald Trump owed a combined $4 billion to more than 70 banks, with $800 million personally guaranteed by his own assets, according to Alan Pomerantz](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-bankruptcies-insig-idUSKCN0ZX0GP), a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trump’s loans. Pomerantz was hired by Citibank.

[Interview with Pomerantz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSitfTcthq8)

[Trump agreed to pay the bond lenders 14% interest, roughly 50% more than he had projected, to raise $675 million. It was the biggest gamble of his career. Trump could not keep pace with his debts. Six months later, the Taj defaulted on interest payments to bondholders as his finances went into a tailspin](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/04/09/Trump-reaches-agreement-with-bondholders-on-Taj-Mahal/7261671169600/).

In July 1991, [Trump’s Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/business/chapter-11-for-taj-mahal.html). 
 
So he bankrupted a casino?  What about Ru...

The Trump Taj Mahal casino broke anti-money laundering rules 106 times in its first year and a half of operation in the early 1990s, [according to the IRS in a 1998 settlement agreement](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3722293/FinCEN-Trump-Taj-Mahal-1998-settlement.pdf).

[The casino repeatedly failed to properly report gamblers who cashed out $10,000 or more in a single day, the government said.""The violations date back to a time when the Taj Mahal was the preferred gambling spot for Russian mobsters living in Brooklyn, according to federal investigators who tracked organized crime in New York City. They also occurred at a time when the Taj Mahal casino was short on cash and on the verge of bankruptcy.""](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/22/politics/trump-taj-mahal/index.html?sr=twCNN052217trump-taj-mahal-closed0111PMVODtopLink&linkId=37866730)

....ssia

[So by the mid 1990s Trump was then at a low point of his career. He defaulted on his debts to a number of large Wall Street banks and was overleveraged. Two of his businesses had declared bankruptcy, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City and the Plaza Hotel in New York, and the money pit that was the Trump Shuttle went out of business in 1992. Trump companies would ultimately declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy two more times](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/).

[Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-debt.html). No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through [Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank).

That bank.

[Three minute video detailing Trump's debts and relationship with Deutsche Bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7LLvSySjkQ)

In 1998, [Russia defaulted on $40 billion in debt, causing the ruble to plummet and Russian banks to close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis). The ensuing financial panic sent the country’s oligarchs and mobsters scrambling to find a safe place to put their money. That October, just two months after the Russian economy went into a tailspin, [Trump broke ground on his biggest project yet](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/nyregion/trump-starts-a-new-tower-near-the-un.html). 

Directly across the street from the United Nations building.

[Russian Linked-Deutsche Bank arranged to lend hundreds of millions of dollars to finance Trump’s construction of a skyscraper next to the United Nations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/magazine/deutsche-bank-trump.html).

Construction got underway in 1999.

Units on the tower’s priciest floors were quickly snatched up by individual buyers from the former Soviet Union, or by limited liability companies connected to Russia. [“We had big buyers from Russia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan,” sales agent Debra Stotts told Bloomberg. After Trump World Tower opened, Sotheby’s International Realty teamed up with a Russian real estate company to make a big sales push for the property in Russia. The “tower full of oligarchs,” as Bloomberg called it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs), became a model for Trump’s projects going forward. All he needed to do, it seemed, was slap the Trump name on a big building, and high-dollar customers from Russia and the former Soviet republics were guaranteed to come rushing in.

Depending on what was destroyed (troop carriers, fuel, ammo), the remainder of the convoy may no longer be fully combat effective and will have to withdraw back to Crimea (they'll have enough ammo and fuel for a day, and be stranded). 

Also reported that command structure was taken out. If true, this means that the remaining troops will withdraw as they won't know what else to do. 

Also if all of the above is true, with no further information about current forces in the area, this potentially leaves  Russian elements west of Mariupol vulnerable and they may have to abandon the encirclement.

Ukrainians are Europeans. They share our values, I know many. When refugees started to pour in almost half were children. There is already considerable minority of Ukrainians in my country. Those longer then one year here already started to learn our language (much harder then English) and work very hard. They do not form Ukrainian communities and actually blend in. To us, Ukrainians are like brothers. 

If European thinks about for example Palestinian conflict. He simply does not care. We do not share the same values. Sometimes not even basic ones. A lot of Europeans (not me) view middle east people more like barbarians. In the last migration crisis a lot of nations were not willing to accept refuges from Africa and Middle East. Those 'refuges' were mostly man in their 20s. They form their own communities, they do not learn the language and refuse to accept the 'western values' (for example women rights).

Ruling party lost the election in Spain as a result of their support. I think the anti-war protest in UK was the largest they've seen. Look back at other wars and you can see that lots of people *definitely* cared.   


It also makes sense why this conflict draws a strong emotional reaction in the West. Because it's happening at our doorstep (I'm European). I'd expect you to mourn your family's death more than a total stranger in a far-away country. Does that make you immoral? I expect Pakistanis to be more affected by an invasion in Bangladesh than, say, Iceland. And that's completely normal. The problem is when some Western countries tout the whole ""universal human rights"" thing while clearly having bias on some humans over another.

This offensive is being conducted with a much smaller number of troops - perhaps 100,000 Russian troops currently in the field in Ukraine - compared to WWII.

The Normandy landings were tiny in comparison to the massive battles fought between Germany and the USSR on the Eastern front; the allies landed about 150,000 troops, while the German defenders numbered around 50,000.

When looking at the way the Soviets behaved after WWII, it's important to remember the absolutely massive losses they took during the war and how it coloured their world view.

Theoretically, circumstances could arise when you would see it again. But, it requires the defense to force the offense into a stalemate along a wide front, which happened in WWI.

One of the essential advantages that everyone thought the Russians would have in this war was air superiority.   Basically, bomb everywhere and everything with impunity.

However, unlike the Western military, the use of precision weaponry is limited for Russia.   Had the Russians more smart bombs, actual multi-role aircraft and proper guidance equipment, there wouldn't be any worries about low-level bombing - they could have been well outside the range of the air defenses, and still put bombs on the precise spots they would need to help the army.  But they're leaning more and more on dumb munitions to get the job done, which are terribly imprecise.   So the Russians have to choose whether to bomb from high and hope for the best, or go low and put your planes at risk every time.  That's why the MANPADS approach is being favored - you're basically forcing the Russian air force to stay at distance by making every km of territory a possible operational hazard.

The Russians also have to be hurting on the number of cruise missiles in stock, at this point.  As to the artillery, the Russian shift to establishing firebases are making it easier to find the command and control elements to aim the cannons.   With Russian secure communications in such a trainwreck state (15 km range, at best?!), you can knock out a unit of artillery support by blowing up the command vehicle.

Edit with more reasoning.
Russias armed forces are in a really bad state now and for the foreseeable future, so mobilizing quality personnel and equipment would be really difficult. Politically, there is turmoil in russia, it would be a total farce if they decided to go for another invasion. It would be the end of Putin. Last but not least on russia.

It's unlikely though, because he couldn't win that war. It would enlarge the conflict, and unless China and/or India joined in as his ally he'd be facing the world by himself.


People worrying about a stray bomb or airstrike are panicking needlessly. Russia and NATO have ways to de-escalate after an accident. An isolated missile or artillery fire hitting Poland is unlikely to escalate into full-blown war.


A nuclear conflict is also incredibly unlikely right now. Putin still has plenty of conventional weapons to use to destroy Ukrainian cities and people, and then he can still develop the land afterward.


A strategic nuclear exchange (apocalyptic style) is the least likely thing to happen. Putin has a lot to lose still. A tactical nuclear weapon is slightly less unlikely, but still very unlikely.

As far as a nuclear war, there's always a chance someone (i.e. Putin) does something off the wall and starts something terrible. But so far that seems extremely unlikely. Russia may have more nukes than anyone, but the US and its allies have more than enough to level Russia. So the calculus that has been known as mutually assured destruction is the same as it's been for half a century. No real reason for Russia to change their stance there, even if they lose in Ukraine.

While Russia has very good aircrafts, they don't know how to conduct complex mixed planes operations. They never conduct this kind of operations or exercises with a mixture of bombers, anti-aa, support and fighters so they don't know how to use them, they don't have experience.

Most training Russian pilots get is in solo flights or they fly in pair with another fighter, that's it. They don't know how to conduct this kind of operations so they don't know how to conduct them versus Ukraine. Nato has this kind of exercises multiple times a year in multiple places in the world, so they are very well prepared for air superiority combat.

Ukraine inherits from the Soviet Union excellent anti aircraft capabilities for high altitude aircraft, and low aircraft too now with western manpads.

Russia's military doctrine has never been about having air superiority, they know that in a nato war Nato would have it, it's a lost cause, so in a rock-paper-scissor scenario they specialized in anti aircraft where they are the technological leaders, shooting down Nato airplanes and fighting on the ground.

Now that they desperately need this aircraft superiority as aggressors, they don't have it.

This is also the reason why ukraine isn't using their aircrafts either. They would mostly get shoot down by Russia so there is really no point into using the air force much for none of the two parties.

But then you have mechanized units advancing without proper infantry or proper air support, and they just stall and get easily ambushed by Ukrainian forces.

This war is a disaster for Russia, I believe they will eventually win it, they have a lot to throw at Ukraine still, but it's absolutely showing how inefficient they are at attacking other forces.",False,1647269625.0,t3_tdv3ps,t1_i0md6g9,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Putin as nukes on airplanes, on land and in nuclear subs. The nuclear triad.

(2) We know about and track every Russian airplane and fighter jet and we sure as hell know about ones who have the capability to carry nuclear weapons and if they have recently been to a nuclear holding facility. Again, in this scenario there is infrastructure to immediately intercept any jet that takes off which we believe to be a nuclear threat.  (3) Nuclear submarines are the most insidious threat as they create their own power (not reliant on ports for fuel) and can dive deep into the ocean for months. They also can get so close to their target that interception after launch becomes almost impossible. Well, guess what the US military's 700 billion dollar a year war machine does? We fucking track and tail every single one of those subs with our own nuclear sub, and we \*still\* have some to extra subs to spare. We have access to intel and move countries through a series of threat levels that change how we respond to movement by military weapons: If Putin was becoming increasingly unhinged we would have chatter about it and the military would start to curtail where we allowed these subs to navigate.

 For three point five reasons.

Climate change is real.  China is saying they are expecting their worst winter wheat harvest ever.  We are seeing insane swings of weather and temperature that are devastating crops.  Crops need consistent weather.

We are near peak oil and with that comes fertilizer shortages causing fertilizer spices to spike.  Abundance of food is only a recent(~80ish years) thing due to oil based fertilizer.


Covid has weakened countries abilities to help.  ""According to the USDA, more than 38 million people, including 12 million children, in the United States are food insecure. ""

Already our food banks in a ""1st world country"" are struggling due to the pandemic and we haven't even seen a crop crisis yet.

It comprises Turkey (both Anatolia and East Thrace), and Egypt (mostly located in North Africa, with the Sinai Peninsula being in Asia). Despite having varying definitions within different academic circles, the term was originally applied to the maximum extent of the Ottoman Empire.

You would have to seed it in the ground and grow it, and there are more optimal times than now to do it. It would likely be very disruptive for the agricultural sector since growing seasons and harvests are (to my knowledge) pretty well planned and scheduled in advance.

 It would require all the soybean producers to pretty much drop everything and start seeding to day in order to meet capacity for the fall, so there would still be a lag in the short term, but I have a hard time thinking that farmers would be convinced to swap out soy for wheat. In some cases, it would probably require farmers to rotate or clear their crops since I’m sure the soy growing season has already started in some spots of the country.

Also I'm pretty sure at least some of those fallow fields are left to rest so as to replenish their nutrients and hold their ability to grow stuff. Don't have specific numbers though.

You have to keep in mind that prosecuting a military campaign is just like running about other kind of project. Before this invasion occurred years were spent figuring out how to do this, how much of the army could be reasonably drawed upon, and what equipment was going to be used. Things we can not see were grossly under done if at all. To say that this project is overdue and over budget would be the understatement of the century, and throwing even more Russian troops would be even more of a mess.

The Russians have moved the rest of the invasion force in country since last week, but the damage is already done. 25% of their combat teams are finished, supply lines are constantly harassed and annihilated, artillery is primarily being used to attack civilian targets for intimidation purposes when it should be used on military targets, and most importantly Putin thought he'd get foreign help from Belarus and Kazakhstan. Both of who outright refused to send their troops into the conflict.  Also it's worth noting that the vast majority of the troops on country aren't combat troops. Chances are the support guys will get moved into combat units and it'll drive their casualties up even more forcing them into meat grinders.

You are fixated on morals, nation states run like a business yet you think the US runs like a charity, you are wrong. Like the US - China, India, Russia, UK, France, Pakistan, Brazil etc. they will always care about the bottom line (interests)

Vietnam is another example - no morals here, just the US not wanting another communist state in SE Asia.

Gronzy is an example for Russia - no morals here, just not wanting an independant Chechnya.

Endorsing Pol Pot is a good one for China - no morals, just not wanting USSR backed Vietnam to hold power in SE Asia.

UK and France - Suez Canal - No morals, just wanted to control international shipping.

This state power, however, is always also utilised (even primarily so) by capital. The more capital gets into crisis due to the falling rate of profit, the more authoritarian measures get to stem this tide, making it a descent where those basic rights and needs get more and more curtailed, ultimately always aiming for the subsistence level. (Only as much resources, freedom, education etc. to reproduce the labour power to be exploited for profit).

The scenario of giving people what they need to live in dignity and fulfilment needs societal production to be coordinated for the sake of needs and availability instead of for exchange, with an ever expanding sphere of freedom, i.e. time and resources for the working population to have for themselves. That is the one goal of communism, and the thing that hasn't changed is that it needs coordination of production to happen through the producers themselves, i.e. the working class.

Just because the state capitalist ""socialist"" experiment in the Soviet Union and China, which began as attempts to industrialise quickly from a feudal state, failed does not mean there aren't any other perspectives on communism possible. 

Nations practicing ""really existing socialism"" in the end only achieved what capitalism had in other nations: quick industrialisation, creation of an urban working class, imperialist ambitions for bigger reach of their exploitation and resources, concentration and accumulation of national capital and creating an ideological foundation for increased productivity for the accumulation of capital (sacrifice yourself and others and be a good subject and worker, if you do that one day communism will arrive, it is the will of history).

Based on what, exactly, is this 'probably?'  
You know what an ICBM is (decades old, or no)?  
Very simply put, it's a space rocket. It goes up into space, then back down to its target.   
They are some of the fastest things ever invented. They go up (very straightly), travel in space, and come down (very straightly).    
  
Do you comprehend the physical world realities that prevent this from being an easy task?   
Don't take my word for it... Check out what the United States' [Missile Defense Agency website](https://mda.mil/system/elements.html) has to say about it.  
  
You can see the same [MDA's milestones](https://www.mda.mil/news/gallery_gmd.html) toward ground-based interdiction online as well. It's not full of promising news. After untold dollars in funding, and years working on this, there have been a few successful interdiction tests. But that's after many many many failures, and that's also with test missiles that we know are being fired, when and where under controllable circumstances.   
  
I'm just saying, it is a fantasy to think that anyone has figured out a way to interdict an acceptable amount of nuclear ICBM threats. It's not the sort of thing that a government would keep secret anyway. Because it would fundamentally change that country's nuclear posture. MAD would be history. You would want a country like Russia to know that their most threatening weapon was impotent.   
  
I'm not trying to come at you, but it's frustrating to hear people confidently stating (or assuming, or saying things like 'probably') without showing an understanding of the tall order they're expecting. It's simply not a thing.

Absolutely not. Do not put words in my mouth. 

What I'm saying is that allowing Ukraine to be reduced to a puppet state is not the ""better"" option you're imagining it to be. The people are still going to suffer, many of them AREN'T going to be physically able to leave. A country where you're afraid of being shot in the face for disagreeing with your dictator is trading one evil for another and doesn't actually address the fact that Russia literally just fucked up their neighbour for political gain. What you're suggesting is that we continue performing appeasement politics, ""You can't have that - ooohhh, grrr, fine, you can have that, but no more!"" Rinse and repeat. This has been happening now for over a decade when it comes to Putin - Georgia's invasion in 2008? Slap on the wrist, don't do that. Crimea's invasion in 2014? Slap on the wrist, will you promise not to do that if Ukraine surrenders their nukes? Thank you. Syria's invasion? Ohhh, how dare you do that. Don't do that. 

Let's be real, this is the equivalent of Hitler invading Poland now. We've already done the whole appeasement thing for the past decade. It didn't work, and it will continue to become a larger problem the longer we continue to appease. 

Having a puppet regime installed isn't going to magically make the people of Ukraine suffer less. It's just going to make it easier for the Russian army to pass through the rest of Ukraine and invade Moldova & do the EXACT SAME THING they're doing to Ukraine with little issue. Are we saying Moldova should also be sacrificed and have a puppet regime installed too?

Zelenskyy personally addressed the EU via video link and it was so moving that they immediately took action. His selfie videos captivated the world (their constituents) and pressured them to act. 

If we were using technology from 1942 to spread information, he could not have communicated that way and would not have had the same result. 

Furthermore, the rapid spread of information from Ukraine’s government and Zelenskyy greatly increased monetary donations to the Ukrainian government from both governments, ngos, and people. More than 20,000 foreign fighters were able to travel there immediately. 

Finally, I’m not sure you appreciate the speed of video information in 1942. A cameraman films a newsreel (also, much harder to do *with sound* back then. There’s a reason they had voiceovers), ships the film to a newspaper/news org somewhere, and then they develop it. Let’s hope it arrives before deadline and they can print for the next day if it’s a still image. 

If it’s a newsreel, it has to be developed, printed, and mass-produced. Then shipped to theaters. Then you have to hope enough people actually go to those theaters and see it.

 >A name that is commonly linked to the concept of the end of history in contemporary discourse is Francis Fukuyama. Fukuyama brought the term back to the forefront with his essay The End of History? that was published months before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In this essay, which he later expanded upon in his book The End of History and the Last Man in 1992, Fukuyama builds on the knowledge of Hegel, Marx and Kojève.

I vaguely agree that their likely to next assault and take Mariupol. But they're not coming in with any fundamentally new capability. Just like previous offenses, it will cost them dearly. At the end of it, you'll be able to summarize the action like this:

* Land area occupied: net positive for Russia
* Soldiers and equipment: net negative for Russia
* Civilian lives: net positive for Russia
* Financial / economic position: net negative for Russia

None of these categories have some sort of linear transformation into an single dimension of victory.

And when it comes to their vast equipment reserves, there's a few key points:

* Not 100% of what they own is operational (this goes for every military)
* It is a time-consuming logistical hurdle to move material into place. The current invasion force was gathered starting in March 2021
* Things are where they are for reasons. Ukraine is not Russia's only present military concern. If they reduce strength in other regions by a substantial amount, they are making themselves vulnerable.
* The Russian sphere of influence is prone to / defined by crisis. In the past two years, they have used their military on rebels in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Syria.
* The sanctions are both directly (e.g. computer chips, automotive parts) and indirectly (general economic capacity) diminishing their ability to renew this supply moving forward

This isn't to say, ""in a month Russia is going to run out of tanks"" or anything absurd like that. Just to explain why these equipment losses actually do matter to Putin / the Russian Federation.

Just taking all major cities in Ukraine would lead to a further immense loss of military assets for the Russian Federation, but is probably doable, and a sustained occupation, when Ukraine is full of patriotic / vengeful people with western missile launchers that can destroy an asset worth 100-10,000x more, is unambiguously doomed.

Given that, it could be that at some point Zelensky says, ""Fuck it, I can't stand the human cost of this war, I surrender to unfavorable terms,"" or Putin could say, ""This is not going well for my war machine, I'm better off cutting my losses and hoping my next invasion goes better. I'll withdraw after demanding only symbolic concessions from Ukraine."" Or it could be a complete unmitigated disaster and drag out into an Afghanistan type situation.

Strawman argument. That wasnt said. What *was* said was that America is the most influential nation of all time. Which as you point out, being only a few centuries old, is statistically improbable. Not enough time has elapsed for this to be the case. 

See my original point how America is modelled on Rome - a civilisation 2000 years ago.

>Now here you are confirming that you think rock music will be gone, and not contribute to ""centuries of influence"". 

Again, not something I said.

>You don't even have an argument. 

Why do I need one when you can just keep making them up for me so you can keep winning the game of ""who's opinion do I like more"".

My argument remains unchanged: America is *not* and *cannot* be the most influential nation of all history, as implied by the original post. Because it hasnt been around long enough. Before you had this alleged ""hegemony"", it was Britain and Spain, who sparked of the whole Globalism that the world is still reeling from today. 

Specific to music, as you are so keen to keep hammering something you think you know... 

Where do you think musicians start out?

How many people have learnt an instrument in history, and their first piece they learn is Hey Jude, or Paint it Black? Or how about something more modern than that? Who has learnt Katy Perry song as their first?

Then compare that to all the children *in history all over the world* that learnt Twinkle Twinkle Little Star  first on recorder, or flute or trumpet or keyboard... that's an 18th Century *French* composition, made famous by an ethically *German/Austrian* composer from the Holy Roman Empire, with lyrics from a 19th century *English* poet. That is influence that your culture cannot *currently* compete with. The first 50 or a hundred songs that someone will learn to perform will be so far removed of their lifetime, but America must be the biggest influence because they commercialised the art form.

 how can you claim that American music, currently, is competing for ""most influential""? When your sole claim to that is based on *African* influences, that wouldnt have been introduced or developed if it werent for internationalism and the North Atlantic slave trade? Where does ""your"" influence begin, and theirs end exactly? Or does that depend entirely on the narrative you wish to project at any given moment?

Now before you get into how ""that's not what you mean by influence"". Of course it isnt, but that's just scratching the surface. Think about it, and then realise just how ignorant your take is. Influence isnt just about today or yesterday. Theres thousands of years of intermingling of ideas, that you are ignoring to push one (to use your word) arrogant world view, bordering on jingoism. I'm not trying to push any one civilisation as ""the most"" influential, yet *i* am the arrogant one. Fucking astounding logic right there.

>""stupid""

Stupid is looking forwards to things that havent happened to justify dog shit takes that require such mental gymnastics to get off the ground.
