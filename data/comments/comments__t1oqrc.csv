At the beginning of the day, in the area of the United Forces operation, the C-300 anti-air missile complex of the Air Forces of Ukraine shot down two enemy targets - a helicopter and a Su-25 ground attack aircraft of the Russian occupation troops. Also, a Ukraine Air Force Su-27 successfully attacked a Il-76 MD of the Russian occupation forces and destroyed it. Another Russian Su-25 flying towards Vinnytsia was destroyed by a Ukrainian pilot of a Su-27 plane. Currently, heavy battles are ongoing in the city of Vasylkiv in Kyiv region, where occupying forces are trying to land paratroopers from the air. Active combat is currently taking place on the streets of Kiev. Everywhere the enemy suffers losses.

Zelensky calling out the scheduled infiltration attempt into Kiev, the bombing raids ahead of time, the attempted air drops etc. likely due to US intel intercepts. The sad part is the Kremlin to too rigid to change and still goes on committing to it when their called out.

Mistakes have been made though like the Antonov airport insertion caused miscommunication and confusion, and the Russian column coming down from Belarus making lightning progress overnight night and several bridges claimed to have been blown to stop them were obviously not, except for the one at Dymer.

The sad part is US Intel publically calling out the Russian deployment and battle readiness and how close they were to invading and their order of battle, showed to the Russians that their communication is to a certain degree being intercepted as there's only so much you can deduce from troop movements via satellite.

You would've thought they would've switch their encryption and Op Sec before the invasion began. But, obviously US intel is still to a certain degree intercepting the communication and getting some knowledge of their operational plans before hand.

Roughly a third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was positioned on Ukrainian soil, with roughly 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads and thousands of tactical nuclear weapons left in the country at independence.

Ukrainian engineers had conceived some of¬†the Soviet Union‚Äôs deadliest weapons, too. The SS-18 missile, nicknamed ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù and built to strike targets up to 16,000 kilometres away, was designed and manufactured in Yuzhmash, at the time a closed city in Ukraine.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, both the new Russian Federation and the U.S. leaned heavily on Ukraine to give up its nuclear inheritance ‚Äì Moscow because it wanted to eliminate a potential security threat on its borders, Washington out of concern about a proliferation of renegade post-Soviet states.

After years of negotiation, Ukraine ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1994, and in subsequent years returned warheads to Russia and destroyed missile silos, a process that took until 2001 to complete.

It did so with assurances secured in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum that signatories, including Russia, the U.S. and Britain, would ‚Äúrespect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine,‚Äù and that none of those countries would ever use their weapons against Ukraine ‚Äúexcept in self-defence.‚Äù

This has been a great advertisement for countries to join NATO further increasing and strengthening their adversary, the United States' grasp and sphere of influence across the world.

Putin may be evil but he is not dumb. Why is he doing this? Is he really trying to revive the Soviet Empire? Is this a megalomaniac snapping?!? It doesn't make any sense logically! What did he expect to happen? Did he not think his invasion into a large sovereign middle-income democratic European country wouldn't cause other smaller EU nations to freak the fuck out at the prospect of a 21st century Kremlin with expansionist imperialist ideals?!?

I understood the Russian line of 'security requirements', understood but did not agree, but as this goes on it seems like an extremely poor move on the part of the Russian leadership. For a country that has been so good at controlling he narrative abroad and using asymmetrical warfare once it comes down to using direct force they are really having difficulties even within their own country.

During popular threads such as this, users often create new accounts to farm karma. This is due to several reasons, some are listed below:

\- To build a reputation prior to attempting to scam others

\- To later attempt to sway conversation in a particular direction

\-  to try and bypass reddit anti-spam/anti-troll efforts

\- To overcome certain minimum karma requirements that some subreddits have.

Look at the account's age and post/comment content before you even begin to consider whether their comment is legitimate. Remember, older accounts may be subject to this as well, look for lots of posts or comments that appear to be made in an attempt to farm Karma. Lots of posts/comments with several hundred/thousand upvotes can indicate this. New accounts claiming strange or outrage things, posting unanimous 'group think' style posts, etc. also indicate this. Normal accounts will have a healthy amount of both upvoted and downvoted posts/comments, along with some posts/comments receiving few or no upvotes/downvotes.

As always, reddit, twitter, facebook, and other social media accounts are anonymous and require no verification, so please take comments from such places with a grain of salt. I can drop a comment saying your mom died from a nuclear bomb, does that mean that it happened? Sources from other social media sites such as twitter are not sources.

So if the info is correct and not fog of war, then Russ boys be getting desperate for a runway for airlift. Latest reports were that possible airborne ops going down in Uman, with footage of explosions in Uman in SW Ukraine which is well behind the front lines and not near any Russian land forces. If it's true it seems maybe 3rd times the charm? 

After attempting to secure the air base just outside of SW Kiev at Vasylkiv where the IL-76 was reported down. There was reports of fighting and possible airdrop even more SW of Vasylkiv at Bila Tserkva, where another IL-76 was claimed downed. Now you got the reports in Uman which is even more SW than Bila Tserkva. 

So it seems the order of attempted airborne drops seems to be¬†**Vasylkiv>>>Bila Tserkva>>>Uman**

These reports of attempted airborne landing seems plausible as all 3 locations possess an airport. Plus all 3 are far away from any ground forces so any prolonged explosions and gunfire is likely heliborne assault and not Russian ground forces.

I understand that the majority of people on here have no clue about anything relating to warfare and weren't born or were too young to remember how other similar wars started, but it has only been 48 hours. Russia is already pushing into Kyiv and they've only deployed a THIRD of the forces they amassed on the Ukrainian border. What exactly did you expect to have happened at the end of day two of the invasion? Total annihilation of Ukraine with zero Russian casualties? 

&#x200B;

Zelensky said the fate of Ukraine is being decided right now. He is handing out rifles to any civilian that wants one and telling people to start making molotov cocktails. The president of Ukraine has actually been seen carrying a rifle and wearing body armor saying he is planning to fight the Russians himself. The situation is bad enough that the US tried to get him to evacuate but he refused (balls of steel). Does any of that remotely sound like the behavior of a country successfully repelling an invader? 

&#x200B;

Ukraine has shown incredible resolve and is fighting bravely against a corrupt and immoral aggressor, but they are losing this war and it really isn't debatable IMO. Their only hope is, and always has been, fighting a prolonged insurgency after Russia wins the initial conventional war.

if we have seen something this last couple of days, US has too much information, way too much information, I guess some people were in awe because they can predict movement and probably intentions by watching the enemy, but one thing is clear... seems like the US had inside information, one thing is to say ""the enemy will attack in the very next few days"" and other thing is to say ""enemy will attack at 4 am"", ""enemy is going to attack at 8 am"" and turns out they are semi-right as the enemy turns to attack near that time, you can see from the sky people loading the rockets and everything but you cant say for certain ""they will attack at this given time"" so many times.

Russia expected to waltz in and take Ukraine in a matter of days and by days I mean 1 or 2 at most - yes I know I might be called ignorant to say ""omg thats too fast"" but thats the kind of defensive Putin expected, as long as the war is raging so does the world, Oligarchs didnt expect this to last and they made a terrible mistake and some of them might want to take it back, but you know? Putin wouldnt do it, so he might be overthrown sooner or later if this drags on.


the Russian elite care about both, nationalism and money, as the war rages on people sees them and go mad, now there's talks about seizing property and deporting them back to Moscow, thats not good for them.


if Putin is sane, then his ego has been struck so bad he wont send his troops home and lay down the missiles.


I expect someone close to the guy to turn the tides and become the boss himself.

maybe this guy? Sergu√©i Lavrov, seems to be close enough to Putin

So the Soviet Union (which only broke up about 30 years ago) had little to no quality mental health infrastructure even for very severe cases.

There‚Äôs still a ton of stigma and not great treatment around mental illness, disabilities, and neuro-atypicality - a lot of parents of kids with mental conditions of one sort or another are really focused on getting their kids care and education outside the country (this isn‚Äôt unique to Russia but it‚Äôs an issue in Russia).

So because mental health has been so neglected and society has been so tumultuous, Russia has huge alcohol and drug problems, a huge problem with suicide, a huge HIV problem, a huge domestic violence problem, and on top of that a million Russians just died of Covid and the only part of the economy not tanking is oil and gas.

The modern system of war reduction must naturally include a co-incentive not to blow each other up. That is the modern international economic system. That is why sanctions work, in theory. 

The issue is that there are also corrupt forces. The oligarchs outside Russia, the oligarchs in the US and UK, etc. are only going to allow unilateral harm to Russia. That is to say, direct impact of sanctions affecting the wealthy in sanctioning countries will not happen, dampening the effect. If it dampens the effect so as to make it useless, then sanctions are not effective.

From looking into the actual data, sanctions ARE generally effective, in that they impose significant growth cuts on the sanctioned economy. We're talking in a world where GDP grows maybe 3% per year, it cuts 2.5% of that. Russia's GDP grown since Crimea has been about 0.3%.

TLDR; it tooks many years of hostilities and escalation with the UN issuing and requesting many things over that time.

\--------------------------

So first it was not a sudden onset of hostilities.

During the break up of Yugoslavia in 1991 the had been open hostilities amongst many groups as individual parties arose and new territories announced independence (first was June?) - there was efforts by Europe and others to make this a peaceful process. Due to the increased violence (and petitions) the UN issued Security Council Resolution 713 (September 1991) - placing an arms embargo on the former Yugoslav. This made it harder for fighting to continue but it did not stop it.

NATO in Febraury 1992, due to hostilities amping up, called for the forces in the former Yugoslav to allow UN Peacekeepers on the ground. There was also European monitoring and other groups int the country to assess and minimise hostilities.

In May 1992, the UN adopted Security Council Resolution 757 - essentially placing further sanctions as the Croatian Army had not adhered to Resolution 713 - kinda like stuff like we are seeing on Russia now. Plus a security zone to be neforced around Sarajevo.

Naturally nothing really calmed down, there were verifiable reports of ethnic cleansing from the monitoring groups and the finally lead NATO to ... join the monitoring of the situation in July 1992.

In October 1992 the UN passed Security Council Resolution 781 - banning all military flights in the terriotry. NATO oversaw monitoring this...

Resolution 787 in November, 1992 enforced restrictions shipping - NATO was finally not monitoring but actively assisting by inspecting ships.

Resolution 816 in April 1993 had NATO move from monitoring the no fly zone to enforcing it.

From there NATO's role steadily increased in cooperation with the UN.

SO - as you can see it took years and was not NATO going rogue - they acted in concert with UN requests.

You're fundamentally correct. Iraq was a steamroll and it still took the coalition three weeks just to get to Baghdad. Ukraine is fighting an uphill battle.

But I honestly think the strategy is backfiring on Putin. He's losing the propaganda war, Ukraine is slowly building up their arsenal of foreign weapons, and his attempts to end the war quickly by taking Kyiv has become a joke. The longer Ukraine lasts the worse it gets for Russia. If Kyiv survives the week I'll be shocked.

So? Every expert in the world is agreeing that Russia's performance has been embarrasing, that they have barely achieved any of their early goals, and their troop losses compared to Ukraine's are very very high. 

We all know Russia has all the cards they need to win, but everyone, and from the looks of it, Putin, expected this to be very different by now.

Why does it matter? Because its a huge factor in making it so Russia's and Putin's image in the world gets crushed. It ruins his windows for a succesful propaganda, it makes them look weak, all bark and not enough bite.

>Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.

>Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.

>The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA‚Äôs website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity.

As for Ukraine the sooner they end the fighting the better, and stop things now they‚Äôre coming out as winning strategically by forcing a tactical draw.

44dd1466bdcbc9b64edf018a1717547d,t1oqrc,hyhcvnr,"This follows the excerpts from the Washington Post Article

- In response to questions from The Post, Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for ‚Äúplatform manipulation and spam.‚Äù Facebook also removed a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation.

- The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4,500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output.

- **The months-long effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle, said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics.**

- ‚ÄúIn 2016, there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money,‚Äù said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council‚Äôs Digital Forensic Research Lab. ‚ÄúIn this election, the troll farm is in Phoenix.‚Äù

- The effort, Brookie added, illustrates ‚Äúthat the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us.‚Äù

- Turning Point Action, whose 26-year-old leader, Charlie Kirk, delivered the opening speech at this year‚Äôs Republican National Convention, issued a statement from the group‚Äôs field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a ‚Äúgross mischaracterization.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúThis is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online, not an anonymous troll farm in Russia,‚Äù the field director, Austin Smith, said in the statement.

- He said the operation reflected an attempt by Turning Point Action to maintain its advocacy despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many traditional political events.

- ‚ÄúLike everyone else, Turning Point Action‚Äôs plans for nationwide in-person events and activities were completely disrupted by the pandemic,‚Äù Smith said. ‚Äú**Many positions TPA had planned for in field work were going to be completely cut, but TPA managed to reimagine these roles and working with our marketing partners, transitioned some to a virtual and online activist model.‚Äù**

- The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview.

- **The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts, part of a bid to reorient political conversation.**

- **The messages ‚Äî some of them false and some simply partisan ‚Äî were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort‚Äôs leaders, according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of minors carrying out the work.**

- One parent of two teenagers involved in the effort, **Robert Jason Noonan, said his 16- and 17-year-old daughters were being paid by Turning Point to push ‚Äúconservative points of view and values‚Äù on social media. He said they have been working with the group since about June, adding in an interview, ‚ÄúThe job is theirs until they want to quit or until the election.‚Äù**

- **Four years ago, the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency amplified Turning Point‚Äôs right-wing memes as part of Moscow‚Äôs sweeping interference aimed at boosting Trump, according to expert assessments prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee. One report pointed specifically to the use of Turning Point content as evidence of Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúdeep knowledge of American culture, media, and influencers.‚Äù**

- **Now, some technology industry experts contend that the effort this year by Turning Point shows how domestic groups are not just producing eye-catching online material but also increasingly using social media to spread it in disruptive or misleading ways.**

- ‚ÄúIt sounds like the Russians, but instead coming from Americans,‚Äù said Jacob Ratkiewicz, a software engineer at Google whose academic research, as a PhD student at Indiana University at Bloomington, addressed the political abuse of social media.

- To some participants, the undertaking feels very different. Notes from the recorded conversation with a 16-year-old participant ‚Äî the authenticity of which was confirmed by The Post ‚Äî indicate, ‚ÄúHe said it‚Äôs really fun and he works with his friends.‚Äù The participant, through family members, declined to comment.


- Kirk and Candace Owens, also from Turning Point USA, listen to President Trump during the 2018 Young Black Leadership Summit in the East Room of the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
The social media users active in the campaign, some of whom were using their real names, identified themselves only as Trump supporters and young Republicans. One described herself simply as a high school sophomore interested in softball and cheerleading.

- Noonan, 46, said ‚Äúsome of the comments may go too far‚Äù but cast the activity as a response to similar exaggerations by Democrats. ‚ÄúLiberals say things that are way out there, and conservatives say things that are sometimes way out there, or don‚Äôt have enough evidence.‚Äù

- **Those recruited to participate in the campaign were lifting the language from a shared online document**, according to Noonan and other people familiar with the setup. **They posted the same lines a limited number of times to avoid automated detection by the technology companies**, these people said. They also were instructed to edit the beginning and ending of each snippet to differentiate the posts slightly, according to the notes from the recorded conversation with a participant.

- **Noonan said his daughters sometimes work from an office in the Phoenix area and are classified as independent contractors, not earning ‚Äúhorrible money‚Äù but also not making minimum wage. Relatives of another person involved said the minor is paid an hourly rate and can score bonuses if his posts spur higher engagement.**

Smith, as part of written responses to The Post, deferred specific questions about the financial setup to a ‚Äúmarketing partner‚Äù called Rally Forge, which he said was running the program for Turning Point.

Some historical pointers for you:

In a series of 2015-16 interviews to the American filmmaker Oliver Stone ‚Äì a 20-hour conversation spread across two years ‚Äì Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin recalls a time he broached the subject of Russia joining Nato with Bill Clinton. The then US President‚Äôs response, Putin recounts, was ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù But the American delegation, Putin says, got very nervous at the prospect, and the idea died right there.

Russia‚Äôs plea to join Nato is not new. Mikhail Gorbachev raised the possibility at the very outset of the Soviet Union breaking up. Commentators have discussed this as recently as a month ago to forestall the invasion of Ukraine. But the idea has had few takers in the militaristic US establishment primed by Cold War thinking.
Nato was formed, in part, to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. If the principal adversary, even in the form of a legatee state, joined the party, what would be the purpose of the alliance? The Masters of War constantly in search of defence budgets and enemies could hardly countenance it.

In fact, getting Russia into an American bear hug underpins the thinking in parts of Donald Trump‚Äôs MAGA constituency to this day ‚Äì albeit for different reasons. Trump himself sought good ties with Russia ‚Äì to the extent of inviting derision as Putin‚Äôs poodle ‚Äì believing that China is the principal adversary the US has to focus on, and the Ukraine issue should be left to Europe to sort out. Much before he praised Putin as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, ‚Äúsavvy‚Äù and ‚Äúgenius‚Äù for his Ukraine grab, he left it to his acolytes to elucidate his thinking. They have done so with gusto.
JD Vance, the author of the acclaimed Hillbilly Elegy, who is running for the US Senate from Ohio, told Trump surrogate Steve Bannon in a podcast last week that he didn‚Äôt really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another. Vance wants America to please spare him the ‚Äúperformative affection for the Ukraine‚Äù that is now in full flow and instead focus on the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of illegal immigrants on the US southern border.
#
An Iraq War veteran, he also railed against warmongers in Washington, berating one former general for drinking ‚Äúfine wine at bull**** security conferences while thousands of working-class kids died on the battlefield‚Äù and asking him how much he stood to gain financially from a war with Russia.
Lauren Witzke, a Republican operative and former Senate candidate in Joe Biden‚Äôs home state Delaware, went a little further, bringing in the religious angle by referring to Russia as a ‚ÄúChristian nationalist nation‚Äù and saying she identified more with Putin‚Äôs Christian values than she did with Biden. In the Trumpian MAGA world, a White Christian Russia would have been lockstep with America ‚Äì against China and other non-white nations.

Instead, America has driven Russia into China‚Äôs arms, into a ‚Äúfriendship with no limits‚Äù, setting the stage for a new Cold War that could last a few generations. Disdained by US militarists, Putin has pounced on Ukraine, assessing ‚Äì correctly or incorrectly we will know in time ‚Äì that the West is too enfeebled and divided to stop him. The domestic dissonance on foreign policy, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the diminution of Nato, and America‚Äôs house of cards economy, has emboldened him to take the gamble to pull off a reckless Ukraine heist.
Where does this leave India? A tight spot would be an understatement. Already, calls are being made for New Delhi to get off the fence and take a stand, if not take sides. It is a tough call. If India subscribes to the freedom of choice argument that Washington and its Nato allies are advancing for Ukraine to come out of the Russian orbit, then it risks the similar outcome in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan, in its sphere of influence. If it defends Moscow‚Äôs depredations, then it risks providing China, already nibbling away at its border, with a rationale to do the same.

Fortunately, New Delhi has a few things going for it to thwart any adventurism. Nuclear cover for one thing, something Ukrainians are wishing they had retained when the Soviet Union collapsed and they briefly found themselves the third largest nuclear power in the world, only to give it up for security warranties ‚Äì from US and Russia among others.

More than at any time, India should express gratitude for Vajpayee‚Äôs decision to go nuclear in the teeth of American and world opinion. And it also needs to thank Beijing for its predatory practices that have pauperised countries such as Sri Lanka and even Pakistan (whose natural ally really ought to be India, but that‚Äôs another story).
In contrast, American munificence is underappreciated, whether it is shipping food grains to India in the 1960s or allowing thousands of Indian students to study in the US even at the height of the Cold War.

Yes, India ‚Äì and the world ‚Äì has had its moments of malice from the US (notably in 1971). The Soviet Union and its successor state has been a good friend. But Russia‚Äôs response to being cornered by Nato has been hasty, reckless and disproportionate. It also creates a dangerous precedent for India from aggressor states. So it remains to be seen if India will decide to back US in future.",False,1645857257.0,t3_t1oqrc,t1_hyhi79n,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

- Addressing the use of centralized documents to prepare the messages, Hoffman said in written responses, ‚ÄúEvery working team within my agency works out of dozens of collaborative documents every day, as is common with all dynamic marketing agencies or campaign phone banks for example.‚Äù

- The messages have appeared mainly as replies to news articles about politics and public health posted on social media. They seek to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process, asserting that Democrats are using mail balloting to steal the election ‚Äî ‚Äúthwarting the will of the American people,‚Äù they alleged.

- The posts also play down the threat from covid-19, which claimed the life of Turning Point‚Äôs co-founder Bill Montgomery in July. One post, which was spread across social media dozens of times, suggested baselessly that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is inflating the death toll from the disease. (Most experts say deaths are probably undercounted.) Another pushed for schools to reopen, reasoning, ‚ÄúPresident Trump is not worried because younger people do very well while dealing with covid.‚Äù

- Much of the blitz was aimed squarely at Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee. The former vice president, asserted one message, ‚Äúis being controlled by behind the scenes individuals who want to take America down the dangerous path towards socialism.‚Äù

- By seeking to rebut mainstream news articles, the operation illustrates the extent to which some online political activism is designed to discredit the media.

- While Facebook and Twitter have pledged to crack down on what they have labeled coordinated inauthentic behavior, in Facebook‚Äôs case, and platform manipulation and spam, as Twitter defines its rules, their efforts falter in the face of organizations willing to pay users to post on their own accounts, maintaining the appearance of independence and authenticity.

- In removing accounts Tuesday, Twitter pointed to policies specifying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.‚Äù That includes ‚Äúcoordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification, even if the people involved use only one account,‚Äù according to Twitter.

- On Twitter, the nearly verbatim language emanated from about two dozen accounts through the summer. The exact number of people posting the messages was not clear. Smith, the Turning Point field director, said, ‚ÄúThe number fluctuates and many have gone back to school.‚Äù Hoffman, in an email, said, ‚ÄúDozens of young people have been excited to share their beliefs on social media.‚Äù

- The Rally Forge leader is a city council member in Queen Creek, Ariz., and a candidate for the state legislature.

- Some of the users at points listed their location as Gilbert, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, according to screen shots reviewed by The Post. Some followed each other on Twitter, while most were following only a list of prominent politicians and media outlets.

- One was followed by a former member of Congress, Republican Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, who is on the Catholics for Trump advisory board. Huelskamp said he could not recall what led him to follow the account and was not familiar with the effort by Turning Point. But he praised the group for ‚Äúdoing a great job of messaging, particularly with younger folks.‚Äù

- Several teenagers were using their real names or variations of their names, while other accounts active in posting the pro-Trump messaging appeared to be operating under pseudonyms. The Post‚Äôs review found that some participants seem to maintain multiple accounts on Facebook, which is a violation of the company‚Äôs policies.

- Explaining why the users do not disclose that they are being paid as political activists, Hoffman said they are ‚Äúusing their own personal profiles and sharing their content that reflects their values and beliefs.‚Äù He pointed to the risk of online bullying, as well as physical harm, in explaining why ‚Äúwe‚Äôve left how much personal and professional information they wish to share up to them.‚Äù

- The accounts on Twitter alone posted 4,401 tweets with identical content, not including slight variations of the language, according to Pik-Mai Hui, a PhD student in informatics at Indiana University at Bloomington who performed an analysis of the content at the request of The Post. The analysis found characteristics strongly suggestive of bots ‚Äî such as double commas and dangling commas that often appear with automatic scripts ‚Äî though at least some of the accounts were being operated by humans.

- While the messaging appears designed to seed pro-Trump content across social media, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Annenberg School for Communication, the act of repeated posting also helps instill the ideas among those performing the activity. In addition, it familiarizes the users with the ways of online combat, she said, and makes their accounts valuable assets should different needs arise as the election nears.

- ‚ÄúThere is a logic to having an army locally situated in a battleground state, having them up and online and ready to be deployed,‚Äù Jamieson said.


- Trump shakes hands with Kirk during a panel discussion at the 2018 Generation Next Summit in Washington. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
Turning Point Action debuted as a 501(c)(4) organization last year, with more leeway in undertaking political advocacy than is afforded to the original group, which is barred from campaign activity as a 501(c)(3). Both nonprofits are required only to disclose the salaries of directors, officers and key employees, said Marc Owens, a tax attorney with Loeb & Loeb.

- Turning Point dates to 2012, when Montgomery, retired from a career in marketing, heard Kirk, then 18, deliver a speech in the Chicago suburbs at Benedictine University‚Äôs ‚ÄúYouth Government Day.‚Äù He called the address ‚Äúpractically Reaganesque,‚Äù according to a 2015 profile in Crain‚Äôs Chicago Business newspaper, and urged Kirk, a former Eagle Scout, to put off college in favor of full-time political activism. Kirk became the face of Turning Point, while Montgomery was ‚Äúthe old guy who keeps it all legal,‚Äù he told the business weekly.

- The organization amassed prominent and wealthy conservative allies, including Richard Grenell, the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, and Foster Friess, who made a fortune in mutual funds and helps bankroll conservative and Christian causes. Both men sit on Turning Point‚Äôs honorary board.

- Its standing rose significantly as Trump came to power. Turning Point USA brought in nearly $80,000 in contributions and other funds in the fiscal year ending June 2013, according to IRS filings, a fraction of the $8 million it reported for 2017 and $11 million for 2018.

- The group, which describes itself as the ‚Äúlargest and fastest-growing youth organization in America,‚Äù claims to have a presence on more than 2,000 college and high school campuses. It hosts activist conferences and runs an alumni program. It also maintains a ‚ÄúProfessor Watchlist‚Äù designed to expose instructors who ‚Äúdiscriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.‚Äù

- Kirk, the group‚Äôs president and co-founder, has been embraced and promoted by Trump and his family. Speaking at Turning Point USA‚Äôs Teen Student Action Summit last year, Trump hailed Kirk for building a ‚Äúmovement unlike anything in the history of our nation.‚Äù A quote attributed to Donald Trump Jr., who has appeared at numerous Turning Point events, features prominently on the group‚Äôs website: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America.‚Äù

- Kirk has returned the praise. In his speech at last month‚Äôs Republican nominating convention, he extolled Trump as the ‚Äúbodyguard of Western civilization.‚Äù

- Equally impassioned rhetoric marked the campaign on social media, with posts asserting that Black Lives Matter protesters were ‚Äúfascist groups . . . terrorizing American citizens‚Äù and decrying the ‚ÄúBLM Marxist agenda,‚Äù among other incendiary language.

- Noonan said his wife, a hairstylist, monitors the online activity of their daughters more closely than he does, and that their work is often a topic of conversation when the family convenes in the evening.

- ‚ÄúWe are Trump supporters, but one of the things my wife and I have been very consistent on is to always understand both sides and make decisions from there,‚Äù the father said.",1645854093.0,1645853774.0,t3_t1oqrc,t1_hyhcvnr,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Exclusion would trigger capital flight and a run on firms and banks reliant on foreign funding, but coping mechanisms would soon kick in. Russian banks and their foreign partners would use other means of communication. And transactions would migrate en masse to spfs, a Russian alternative to swift that is not nearly as ubiquitous and sophisticated, but still usable. That would cause some disruption‚Äîbut not disaster. Over time, investment in spfs would make the system speedier.

> America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar‚Äôs dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives. It already counts some big foreign banks as members.

Not what I was arguing, at all.

In addition, from the source you provided, :

>The huge volume of debris injected into the atmosphere would have far more widespread effects. This ‚Äòaerosol‚Äô of particles would reduce the amount of heat reaching the surface from the Sun, producing a so-called nuclear winter with huge environmental impact. The nuclear explosion would also unleash a pulse of electromagnetic energy that would wreck everything from national power grids to microchips around the world.

So we still have widespread nuclear winter and fallout, and I had TOTALLY forgotten about the EMP that would wipe out electronics (so no cars to drive to safety, etc).

I appreciate the source though, and the action of going through with posting it, takes cajones.

I don't want you to think that I'm trying to be a dick, but nuclear war is super fucking serious and I don't want people to have misconceptions about the nature and power involved.  It won't be a movie scenario where the ""main character"" survives.

EDIT: I thought that I had posted the original response before you had made your edit, so I will edit my thoughts on your second article.   The business insider article you posted is based around a 15-kiloton warhead identical to the bomb used at Hiroshima. And of that one bomb being the only weapon used per city.  From another article that was written by the journalist that you posted from BI:

>Drozdenko said US nukes generally had explosive yields equivalent to about 300 kilotons of TNT, while Russian nukes tended to range from 50 to 100 kilotons to 500 to 800 kilotons, though each country has more powerful nuclear weapons.

So, that whole ""simulation"" is based around Russia using warheads that are \~66% weaker than the weakest bombs in their arsenal.  Also, she maintains that the United States as a nation does not have enough ""burn beds"" in hospitals to sustain the effects of one nuclear blast in the country.",1645858934.0,1645858338.0,t3_t1oqrc,t1_hyhi53c,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
