We only fight with professionals. But if someone stands in our path, we will destroy EVERYTHING in our way.

⚡️⚡️ Caesar's address on the Prigozhin situation.

I have the honor!

Interesting events are unfolding in the expanses of our homeland and they are very reminiscent of the troubled times of a century ago. The stupid, corrupt and incompetent military-political top of Putin's Russia turns hundreds of thousands of men into mincemeat.

Evgeny Prigozhin, himself a descendant of Putin's nomenklatura, has decided that it is time for him to play his own game, thanks to his ""orchestra"" at the ready. We know that he has many supporters among the Russian population and within the security services. We know that Prigozhin has big political ambitions and that he is fed up with greasy generals in offices who can't really fight. We know that if he launches an armed insurgency, he is very likely to succeed.

But we also remember how he and his accomplices cut people's heads off, killed their own people with a hammer cynically videotaped and mocked the unarmed. We should not ascribe to him a military honor and valor that does not exist.

Prigozhin calls for a fight against the renegade generals and for a war to the bitter end. But this war is not in the interests of the peoples of Russia. Prigozhin's battle with Shoigu, Gerasimov, and their generals is simply a battle for a feeding trough and the opportunity to continue to destroy and plunder the nations. Today's Russia is a collection of jackals who are tearing each other and the entire country apart.

We, the free citizens of Russia, will not leave our people alone with uncertainty and fear. We will put an end to the war and free our homeland from the rotten system, no matter whose system it is: Putin's or Prizhin's.

Our comrades-in-arms, get ready! Russia will be free!

Text is taken from the telegram channel of Victor Alknis. Translation:

I have always been skeptical of talk about Putin's doubles. But today I found OFFICIAL INFORMATION confirming that it is quite possible.
According to Russian media, today Putin held a meeting of the Russian Security Council with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council. The meeting was held via videoconference. Since one of the main questions at the Security Council meeting was the situation at the front, I decided to read its transcript and went to the official site of the President of Russia.

And I was amazed to find out that the meeting of the Council of the Security Council, including the one devoted to the situation on the front, according to the section ""Events"" of the official site of the President, began on June 22 at 11.55 Moscow time,
And by 12.15 pm, i.e. 20 minutes later, the president took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Alexander Garden in honor of Day of Remembrance and Mourning. These 20 minutes would only be enough time to travel from the residence in the Kremlin to the Alexander Garden.

One might have assumed that the Council meeting would have continued after the laying down of flowers. But already at 1:05 pm Putin visited the Victory Museum, and at 2:50 pm he had a meeting with the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, Mohammed Al Thani.

The most interesting thing is that at 12:03 p.m. the RIA Novosti news agency began a live feed from the meeting of the Council of the Security Council.

TASS reported ""Putin discusses the situation in the CFE zone with the Sovbet"" at 12.00

In other words, Putin was in two places at once: at a meeting of the Security Council and laying flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and then visiting the Victory Museum. I wonder who Putin was at the Security Council - a real Putin or his double? And which Putin is acting as the Commander-in-Chief and in charge of Ukraine? Or maybe there are several doppelgangers? And each of them is designed for certain activities and actions?

I am well aware of all the complexities of trying to use look-alikes, and so I hope that there really are none after all? And the explanation is very simple: there was no Security Council meeting today. But then the question arises: ""Why was it necessary to fool the population about its holding? For what purpose was it done?""

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-23-23/index.html

""US officials determined as early as January that there was an internal power struggle underway between the mercenary Wagner Group and the Russian government, and have been gathering and closely monitoring intelligence on the volatile dynamic ever since.

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stalled earlier this year, top American officials said they saw indications of tension between the Kremlin and the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. They said they believed those tensions would mount over the coming months.

Officials said their assessments of the situation derived from intelligence, an indication of how seriously the White House and Pentagon took the potential for a power struggle to cause further instability in the ongoing conflict.

In January, a top White House official said Wagner was becoming a “rival power center to the Russian military and other Russian militaries.”

Officials suggested at the time that Prigozhin was working to advance his own interests in Ukraine instead of the broader Russian objectives. 

The Wagner Group, which the West claimed had recruited prison convicts for fighting in Ukraine, was making decisions based on “what they will generate for Prigozhin, in terms of positive publicity,” John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said in January.

Today's timeline clearly shows that Prigozhin's hand was forced. A few hours before Prigozhin went balls out both official and unofficial Russian sources began reporting that a huge combined spetznaz unit was coming to dismantle Wagner, personally overseen by Shoigu.

This means that Putin's finally had enough. He let the two fight it out and refused to take sides. We don't know what finally broke the camel's back, but Shoigu bringing the FSB along to take down Prigozhin could not have happened without Putin's sanction. Well, it could have if Shoigu executed a coup first, but there's zero indication of that so far.

Prigozhin's tendency to constantly mix truths with lies suggests that he told us what had actually happened in his mArCh oF jUsTicE speech. Prigozhin was asked to lay down his arms so that he and Shoigu could start working a solution that still allowed Wagner to defend the motherland. 

Prigozhin clearly saw that it was BS and he was a dead man, and refused to play along. Shoigu then reportedly sped out of Rostov and hopped on a helicopter to Moscow. 

So it's clear Putin finally made his choice, and forced Prigozhin to make his. The odds on which one of them ends up dead first don't look very good for Prigozhin.",False,1687559261.0,t3_14goa5g,t3_14goa5g,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

>  
>Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson regional military administration, said two workers had been killed and five others hospitalized when a Russian attack hit their facility on Friday morning. Mr. Prokudin said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had carried out 91 strikes in the region over the previous day and had shelled the city of Kherson 26 times.

>The attacks come as the authorities are still working to establish how many people died when the Kakhovka dam, which lies upstream from Kherson, was destroyed this month. While the floodwaters unleashed by the dam’s destruction have receded significantly, the human toll remains unclear more than two weeks after the disaster.

""Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of the private military group Wagner, said his fighters are entering the Russian Rostov region, which neighbors Ukraine.

“Now we are entering Rostov. The units of the Ministry of Defense, or rather the conscripts, who were thrown to block our road, stepped aside,” Prigozhin said, adding that at the moment his units “have crossed the state border in all places.""

""The border guards came out to meet and hugged our fighters,” he said.

Prigozhin also accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov of “making a decision to destroy the disobedient units (of Wagner PMC) that are ready to protect their Motherland.” 

Prigozhin warned against anyone obstructing him: ""We will destroy everything that gets in our way,"" he said.

The Wagner chief's statement comes as Russian state media TASS reported a stepped-up police presence in Rostov late Friday.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-22-23/index.html

""In exclusive comments to CNN, a senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that the main thrust of the counteroffensive against Russia “has not even begun in earnest,” and that it is too early to assess its success.

The official was responding to CNN’s reporting earlier Wednesday that Western officials believe that the counteroffensive is having less success than expected and “not meeting expectations on any front.”

It is “way too early to assess the overall trajectory of the counteroffensive,” the Ukrainian official told CNN. “The main thrust of the counteroffensive has not even begun in earnest.”

The official said that “shaping operations” were still underway, and the counteroffensive would not be able to be judged until fall or winter.

Some more context: In CNN's reporting, the officials cautioned that the counteroffensive is still in its early stages – and that the US and its allies “remain optimistic” Ukrainian forces will be able to make territorial gains over time. The US and its allies are likely to wait until at least July for a fuller assessment of the progress of the counteroffensive which was gradually launched over the last few weeks.

In addition, these officials note that Ukrainian forces have themselves been adapting to Russian tactics and defenses, including carrying out more dismounted operations. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have also had more success targeting and shooting down Russian aircraft.

Ultimately, the counteroffensive is proving a “tough drive” for Ukraine and Russia, one of the Western official said, with both sides incurring heavy losses.""",False,1687524049.0,t3_14goa5g,t3_14goa5g,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-23-23/index.html

""President Vladimir Putin is aware “of the situation unfolding around Yevgeny Prigozhin,” Russian state media TASS said Friday, referring to the leader of the Wagner Group.

He is also aware that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) initiated a criminal case accusing the mercenary force's chief of calling for ""armed rebellion"" on Friday, TASS reported.

According to TASS, the National Anti-Terrorism Committee said the allegations spread by Prigozhin “have no basis.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Putin is aware of the situation and ""all necessary measures are being taken,"" according to state media RIA Novosti.

Some context. Prigozhin on Friday accused Russian military leadership of striking a Wagner military camp and killing a ""huge amount"" of his mercenary forces. Prigozhin claimed that the Russian Ministry of Defense tricked Wagner and he vowed to ""respond to these atrocities."" 

Prigozhin and Wagner have played a prominent role in the Ukraine war, and the leader has repeatedly and publicly feuded with Russia's defense heads over what he said was a lack of ammunition, at one point recording a video of him lashing out while standing in front of what he claimed were dead bodies of his fighters.""",False,1687552709.0,t3_14goa5g,t3_14goa5g,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Prigozhin praised the Russian pilots for “refusing to carry out these criminal orders.""

The 394th Motorized Rifle Regiment (MSR) of the 127th Motorized Rifle Division (MRD), belonging to the 5th Combined Arms Army (CAA) of the Russian Federation, is defending the Rovnopol-Priyutnoye line. However, it is likely that they will soon be forced to abandon their positions near Rovnopol village and retreat to the Priyutnoye-Stary Mayorovskoye line.

The Russians are facing challenges in defending this area from multiple directions, and it appears that the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) have already cut off their access to Stary Mayorovskoye. The UAF's advance units have even reached the outskirts of Stary Mayorovskoye and Urozhaynoye.

In light of these developments, the Russian forces' attempt to defend Rovnopol village seems impractical and could result in heavy losses. If the Russians insist on defending, it is likely that the UAF will ensure their defeat.

Reinforcing the area north of Stary Mayorovskoye with additional forces from the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (OMSRB) is unlikely to help the Russians hold Rovnopol village. The focus of the enemy's 70th MSR and 37th OMSRB units is primarily on preventing attacks from Novodonezkoye-Novomayorskoye towards Kermenchyk village, which the Russians consider a critical part of their defense.

While the Russian command could redeploy 1-2 battalions from the 336th Separate Marine Brigade (OMB) to Priyutino or Stary Mayorovskoye, it is doubtful that it would significantly impact the defense of Rovnopol village. The movement of these Russian Marines in the limited routes available would be challenging, as they would face intense observation and fire from the UAF.

To summarize, it would be in the Ukrainian command's best interest if the Russians persisted in defending Rovnopol village using their reserves. However, the control of this area does not significantly alter the overall tactical situation, especially along the Stary Mayorovskoye-Stary Malinovka direction.

In conclusion, the Russian forces' determination to hold Rovnopol village appears impractical, and the Ukrainian command would welcome such a decision. The involvement of Donetsk ""police officers"" from the ""Cascade"" group, currently idle in the Kermenchyk village area, would not significantly impact the situation.

After the enemy's recent attempt to launch a counterattack in the Novopokrovka area towards Novofedorovka-Malaya Tokmache (apparently aimed at halting the advance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces towards Rabotino village through a flanking maneuver), it became clear yesterday morning that these spontaneous actions were unlikely to achieve their intended goal. The 71st Motorized Rifle Regiment, supported by additional forces, failed to make significant progress from the southwest towards Novodanilovka, while the Ukrainian forces confidently advanced in the defensive zone of the 291st Motorized Rifle Regiment to the south, towards Rabotino village.

The Russian command seems to be reasonably assessing its ability to hold the Rabotino-Verbovo line with the current forces deployed. The 1430th Motorized Rifle Regiment has completed its deployment to the south, and the following units have been introduced into the combat positions of the 291st Motorized Rifle Regiment defending the Rabotino area:

- Consolidated tactical squad BARS-3
- Motorized battalion ""Vostok-Akmat""
- A platoon or company equipped with ""Lancet"" weapons, referred to as ""Bobrs""
- The 417th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion has taken positions in Verbovo village, presumably as a tactical reserve.

The enemy has deployed significant forces and assets to cover the city of Polohy, which, together with Tokmak, represents a major defensive stronghold in the Southern Operational Zone. The city is covered from the west and northwest by a prepared defensive line that passes through Ivan Franko village and extends northeast.

Along the Novopokrovka-Novokarlovka-Bogatoye-Mirnoye-Zagornoye-Dorozhnianka-Marfopol line, the enemy has deployed the following units:

- 38th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade
- 69th Separate Covering Brigade
- 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade
- 70th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Rifle Division
- 177th Separate Marine Infantry Regiment of the 58th Combined Arms Army.

These forces form the core of the enemy's 35th Combined Arms Army, which is part of the Eastern Military District. Apart from the loss of their headquarters due to a missile strike by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, there have been no significant developments for these units.

The enemy's command appears to be facing challenges in terms of reserves on the flanks of this grouping, which is evident by the presence of various unconventional forces alongside special forces brigades in the front lines.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-23-23/index.html

""Ukraine is anticipating that it will be given ""clear terms and conditions"" toward becoming a member of NATO at the alliance's summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in mid-July, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said.

""I expect that we will be given a clear, understandable signal and a formula by which we will obviously become a NATO country,"" he said during a military briefing in Kyiv Friday.

The summit, he hopes, will ""outline the terms of accession"" or define a specific event that will trigger Ukraine's acceptance to the alliance and make the process ""no longer be an incomprehensible vague form of open doors.""

The matter of Ukrainian membership in the alliance is one of several issues leaders will tackle when they meet in the Lithuanian capital next month. Also up for discussion are new defense spending commitments and a successor to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is planning on leaving his post in the autumn. 

But it appears increasingly likely that the 31 NATO members will be unable to coalesce around a candidate to be the alliance’s next secretary general and Jens Stoltenberg will be asked to remain in the job for an additional year, multiple sources told CNN.

Some more background: After meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House last week, Stoltenberg said, “At the Vilnius summit, we will send a strong message of support and solidarity with Ukraine. And make clear that Ukraine’s future is in NATO.”

Stoltenberg said he expected member states to agree on a “multi-year program where we help to move Ukraine to transition from old standards, equipment, procedures, doctrines to NATO standards and become fully interoperable with NATO.” Those steps, he said, would bring “Ukraine closer to NATO.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he understands that his country cannot become a member of NATO while it is still at war.

But earlier this month, he told the Wall Street Journal, “If we are not acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius, I believe there is no point for Ukraine to be at this summit.”""",False,1687535139.0,t3_14goa5g,t3_14goa5g,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

The most likely outcome, Prigozhin dies and Putin continues the war, but having been so popular with the troops and the pro-War wing in Russia, Prigozhin's killing provokes the morale to collapse and Putin's hold on power cracks for good and Russia collapses.

In the unlikely case that Putin dies, there's no way Prigozhin can sway all heads of Russia's oblasts to back him politically, beginning with Khadirov, and Russia collapses.

""Sergey Surovikin, Russia’s top commander in Ukraine, urged Wagner mercenary fighters on Friday evening to ""stop"" and to ""obey the will"" of President Vladimir Putin. 

""I’m addressing the leadership, commanders and fighters of Wagner. Together with you, we have traveled a difficult and hard path. We fought together, took risks, suffered losses and we won together. We are of the same blood. We are warriors. I urge you to stop, the enemy is only waiting for the internal political situation to worsen in our country,"" Surovikin is seen saying in a video posted to Telegram by a Russian state media reporter.

""You can’t play into the hands of the enemy in this difficult time for the country. While it is not too late, please obey the will and the orders of the Russian Federation’s president that was elected by the masses,"" Surovikin said. ""Stop the columns, bring them back to the points of permanent dislocation and communication areas... Solve all the problems peacefully under the leadership of the Commander in Chief of Russian Federation.""

Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseev, a Russian intelligence official, also posted a video criticizing Wagner's actions on Friday, saying ""This is a coup d'etat.""

“What is happening now is a blatant fact of insanity. I cannot explain it in other words,"" Alekseev said in the video.

""Our country is in the most difficult position right now,"" he continued. ""When the whole Western world is turned against us. When the shells are coming from the whole world. Such things, that you started to fulfill now under someone's provocation idea will lead to enormous losses. First of all, enormous political losses. Imagine the enthusiasm that this will be taken with by the West."" 

""Only the president has the right to appoint the top leadership of the armed forces, and you are trying to encroach on his authority. This is a coup d'etat.

Channel Goryachie Tochki posts a screenshot of the ""conversation"" between two soldiers from Rostov. By their words, the command is preparing for a force move to arrest Wagnerites for their refusal to sign contracts with the MoD - a requirement that needs to be fulfilled before 1 July to ""legalise"" the PMC. The channel suggests those who resist the arrest will be shot.

His ""reset with Russia"" is hard to see as anything other than totally naive, and while the training and updating of Ukrainian forces after 2013 was a success, neither Merkel or Obama should feel they stopped anything in 2013. 

In the wider historical analysis, I think we'll ultimately see Putin as the consequence of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The US stretched too far without clear purpose, putting pressure on global alliances with unpopular and unending wars with no clear finish line. Bush's famous ""looking into Putin's eyes"" comments are the exact moment it the trade became clear. He couldn't be challenged on Georgia, on Syria or Crimea, and NATO countries shied from calling out his phoney elections, even making the excuses for him when he assassinated in NATO countries with WMDs like Novichok. The severity of that was downplayed and excused.

I don't mean to excuse Obama at all, but even if Mr. Romney had been in power I'm not sure he'd have had capacity to be tougher on Russia than Bush.

In response to TASS quoting Obama, who in this recent interview repeated some of Russia's lies about Ukraine's national identity and Crimea:

https://twitter.com/amanpour/status/1672069416060702721

Here's a reminder of the armed takeover of the Crimean parliament:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSrUcfeXJyQ

But according to Obama, ""There was not an armed invasion of Crimea because it was full of Russian speakers."" Obama knows many other topics but seems clueless about Ukraine and Eastern Europe. Back in 2014 and 2015, Ukraine had to ""hold the line"" against Russia alone with limited resources before any substantial NATO training happened or Western military aid arrived.

>According to the most conservative estimates, the war has killed six thousand Ukrainians and Russians. As of March 2015, experts estimate that approximately twelve thousand Russian military personnel were present in eastern Ukraine, and approximately fifty thousand Russian troops were stationed in camps along the Ukrainian border.

Russia had it's issues with the West then for sure, but how much of that was reality and not just rethoric, I wouldn't really know.

RIGA, Latvia — Russia’s Federal Security Service late Friday announced a criminal case against Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeniy Prigozhin, accusing him of “incitement to armed rebellion” after he declared an open conflict with Russia’s military leadership and called on Russians to join 25,000 Wagner fighters against Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and other top commanders.


Prigozhin, whose private military company helped Russia seize the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, Moscow’s only significant territorial gain this year, accused the Russian military on Friday of carrying out a strike on a Wagner camp, and appeared to threaten Shoigu, declaring “This scum will be stopped!”

In a rare late-night statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been informed about the situation and that “all necessary measures” were being taken.
The announcement of the criminal case by the Federal Security Service, or FSB, signaled that Prigozhin could face imminent arrest for comments in which he declared that he would lead a “march of justice” against his enemies in Russia’s Ministry of Defense. The Wagner leader denied that he was attempting a military coup.

In a series of furious audio messages, Prigozhin accused Shoigu of flying to Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia specifically to launch a missile strike against Wagner, before fleeing the area late Friday.

The Russian Defense Ministry responded swiftly to Prigozhin’s extraordinary threats, denying his claim that the military had struck a Wagner camp, calling it “an informational provocation.”",False,1687559369.0,t3_14goa5g,t1_jpa2bg9,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The Ukrainians received more anti-tank missiles plus important western military training after 2014, (*just to add:* this worked well in defending the more forested parts of Ukraine where tanks and other vehicle concentrated on roads) but the ever longer ranging artillery and bigger missiles were slow in coming.

* Leader of the Wagner Mercenaries, Prigozhin, starts his day be claiming that the war against Ukraine is unjustified.     
* Hours later, Prigozhin claims that a rear camp of Wagner was attacked by Russian Ministery of Defense forces, causing massive casualties. A video is put out, but it looks *super* fake and likely is.

At this point, many people go ""Oh ha ha, Prigozhin says a lot of shit"" because of how obviously not real that video was.

* Prigozhin (Supposedly. At least we know it was done from a Wagner camp for sure) puts put a statement declaring war on the Russian MoD, and claiming they have lied to the president. The statement claims they intend to attack Moscow and calls on anyone who would support them to join.     
* Russian Media explodes for a moment here (Figuratively)    
* Unconfirmed and possibly false statements put Wagner as having a 50km convoy near the city of Rostov.   

* Finally getting away from ""Unconfirmed and possibly false"" into ""Literally happening"" video starts emerging of the area around the Kremlin being closed off and military vehicles filling the streets in Moscow and Rostov.

At this point we know *something* is happening. Is it a full on civil war? dunno yet, but *something* is happening.

Other things to consider are how many deliveries a day do the supply convoys have to make?  What are material tonnage requirements?  How many trucks does that require? What are the conditions of the roads?

Generally speaking, for a supply line to function properly it comes down to how many tons of supplies are needed each day versus how many can the supply services provide.  I'm guessing that the Russian logistical system just wasn't able to meet the daily requirements.  Probably due to a combination of not enough trucks, too many trucks breaking down, not enough mechanics to repair them, and a lack of spare parts to make those repairs.

At that point they could ask for peaceful negotiations over the status of Crimea.  Ukraine would want to take it back, but is it worth a major war with 100k deaths to the west.  

If they actually agree to an independent Crimea, but with Russian bases, then a lot of nations would want it.  They just want this war over and to return to business as usual. 

Ukraine can slowly take back their country and frankly due it cheaply.  100 billion a year for the west isn't much, the lives are the real cost.  So Russia knows their cooked, eventually they will lose.  

If Ukraine has instant accession into NATO and EU benefits maybe not complete member yet.  It would probably be enough to negotiate for an independent Crimea that would still house Russian bases.  It would basically be returning to the status quo prior to 2014, except Ukraine could end any future Russian attempt to interfere.  

Once Ukraine is using full NATO weapon, there's no threat from Russia.  Russia will never be able to rebuild itself and go for round two.  The technology gap is just too great.  4x the population won't win a war with modern weapons in the equation now.

This is significant because despite how much the HIMARS system has excelled in being used as a weapon of strategic impact the role it was originally made for was more tactical strikes to destroy enemy artillery emplacements.

In other words, the Ukrainians now have enough strategic long range weaponry (storm shadows and maybe a few other systems not publicly acknowledged) that they are now comfortable using their HIMARS launchers in the role they were specifically designed to be employed in.

bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,14goa5g,jp8dshs,"Just to add some more wood to this bonfire, one thing to note is that the Russian doctrine with artillery is to bring them closer than the front lines to enable a deeper range of coverage across the operational front.   This allows them to increase the volume of fire they can deploy across a wider area.

Part of the challenge for the Ukrainians was that they were trying to employ Western-style artillery doctrine (which has the artillery units positioned deep to reduce the risk from those Russian artillery striking, as well as constantly moving to  various spots to enhance survivability) with similar equipment to the Russians, which meant that they were at a disadvantage.   This was slightly mitigated by the Ukrainians deploying the shoot-and-scoot method advocated by Western armies to enhance survivability, as well as an overall higher skill level thanks to a persistent army structure.  But, it was a problem.

Once the Ukrainians obtained Western-designed artillery and supporting systems, that Russian doctrine started to become a problem.   With the Ukrainians now able to perform shoot-and-scoot tactics with higher accuracy, vastly quicker setup times after moving and improved range over their Russian counterparts, that started turning things in favor of the Ukrainians, despite the numerical advantage the Russians enjoyed, as the Ukrainians could now follow the Western artillery doctrines as it was meant to be used.

In addition, the forward positioning of the Russian artillery batteries meant that they were also within drone surveillance ranges, which means the artillery positions could be found before they even opened fire, and fire could be corrected quickly before the Russians had a chance to move.  Throw in HIMARS ranges, as well as precision guided artillery ordnance, and it's even more catastrophic for the Russians.   And since the Russians are stuck with Russian quality equipment, they can't just move to a more protective stance for their artillery and simultaneously provide artillery support that fits their operational setup.   They pretty much have to suck it up, and hope that they can numerically outlast the balance shift.",1687534165.0,1687533697.0,t3_14goa5g,t1_jp84e0j,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

 Prigozhin began as a petty criminal, but after being incarcerated for a time he went into business by opening some stalls that served hot dogs.  He grew his business, eventually opening several restaurants, including one an a boat- which just so happened to be a favorite of Putin’s.  Through nepotism, a catering company that he ran was given a contract to cater for the Kremlin.  More nepotism and political savvy on prigozhin’s part also gave him the opportunity to create his own private contract army: Wagner.  Increasing lust for power is now driving him to challenge the current leaders of the Russian ministry of defense, and possibly even putin, itself.

You are conflating the Switchblade 300 with the 600. The 300 is a small drone with the equivalent of a 40mm anti infantry grenade as a warhead and has been sent in numbers since last year. The 600 is much larger, similar to a Russian Lancet drone with a large anti-tank warhead. The Switchblade 600 was just more recently deployed and like the 300 information about its use is being kept very close to their chest, no videos released and such. We have no ide how it is performing and probably won't for sometime.

Someone mentioned a warhead strapped to a FPV drone, don't conflate the two. The FPV's are cheap and great but the 600's strength lies in its much longer range and resistance to jamming. This makes them great for things like hunting artillery and air defense behind the lines which if you have been following the Russian daily losses have shot up considerably since 600 drones have arrived in country.

We know that he has many supporters among the Russian population and within the security services. We know that Prigozhin has big political ambitions and that he is fed up with greasy generals in offices who can't really fight. We know that if he launches an armed insurgency, he is very likely to succeed.

>But we also remember how he and his accomplices cut people's heads off, killed their own people with a hammer cynically videotaped and mocked the unarmed. We should not ascribe to him a military honor and valor that does not exist.

>Prigozhin calls for a fight against the renegade generals and for a war to the bitter end. But this war is not in the interests of the peoples of Russia. Prigozhin's battle with Shoigu, Gerasimov, and their generals is simply a battle for a feeding trough and the opportunity to continue to destroy and plunder the nations. Today's Russia is a collection of jackals who are tearing each other and the entire country apart.

The military of the newly birthed Russia of 1991-1992 was still controlled by the same people as the Soviet military. Proliferation of nukes was not palatable at all and since the USSR was a rational actor with these weapons, it made sense for them to go back to Russia. Hindsight is always 20-20 but at the time, given everything we knew at the time, it was the right thing to do.

There was a moment in time where the West embraced Russia, if with a bit of trepidation. Clinton's tenure in the Oval Office was that time. We \_should\_ have been open and helpful to Russia at that time to try and get them more aligned with the West. Given the option of civil wars all across Asia, with some members having nukes, or centralizing the nukes in Russia and trying to encourage Russia to shift to the West. The latter option was the right choice.

>saying deploying troops to Crimea in 2014 would have fixed things is beyond clueless

Correct. Ukraine was not stable at this time. There were large divisions within the country, some wanted closer ties to Russia, some wanted closer ties to the West. That's what precipitated the 2014 conflict. Sending troops in would have led to a direct conflict with Russia. Anyone calling Obama worthless for not sending troops also believes Biden is worthless.

>Go back and watch what Ukrainian forces looked like then vs footage now. That only happened with Western support that followed 2014.  


Correct. In 2014 Ukraine had a Soviet-styled military, just like Russia. Russia plowed them over through sheer numbers and by exploiting corruption in Ukraine's ranks. NATO, in an effort to try and foster good relations with both countries, had offered an officer exchange program with both countries (at different times.) Russia came and visited NATO training facilities, NATO went and visited Russian facilities. The Russian training was a joke and they never pursued an exchange because they feared rebellion in the ranks. It was better if the troops didn't have any autonomy.

Ukraine, on the other hand, not only took up NATO on this but had so many troops enrolled in officer training programs that NATO had to open up new schools. The Green Berets (sent in by Obama) were even in Ukraine for on the ground training. Obama was increasing weapons to Ukraine but wanted substantive anti-corruption measures taken before they were given the goods.

This is what led to all the BS under Trump. Ukraine was wrestling with sweeping the known corrupt actors out of government, but Trump was so corrupt and insecure, that his coercion of Ukraine to investigate Biden completely undercut that corruption effort. Trump even targeted the US ambassador to Ukraine who was the biggest anti-corruption official left.

It wasn't until Biden took over that Ukraine could continue its progression without fear of retaliation by a corrupt Oval Office. It's also this progression that triggered Russia's invasion. After Biden being elected, it became inevitable that Ukraine would move further West, joining the EU and possibly NATO. So, Russia figured they'd steamroll Ukraine again and take it over entirely.

I don't think that will be allowed - he needs to stay in Russian and ""fix"" the problem, or go down trying.

I can think of only one country in the world where they'd be safe. China.

Bush, and then Obama were too tied up in these conflicts to rally the world against what was clearly happening in Russia, and Putin was given a pass on Georgia, Syria, and then Crimea. ""Reset with Russia"" was naive, but Mr Romney couldn't have been any tougher on Putin with NATO allies stretched by their unpopular commitments in forever wars that couldn't be won. Indeed, while Mr. Biden's exit from Afghanistan was criticized, I doubt the global response to the Ukraine conflict could have been as decisive, united and clear.",False,1687503296.0,t3_14goa5g,t1_jp6z9mj,,3,6,0,6,0,0,
8c3dc59e3ec2dc6a08dec80f662ba238,14goa5g,jp7okpe,"**Memorie di guerra. Leningrado (1941-1945)** by Nikolaj Nikulin


>Le memorie di Nikulin sono un resoconto crudo e onesto non soltanto della vita al fronte, dove gli uomini si imbarbariscono, perdono i propri capisaldi morali e rischiano di trasformarsi in bestie, ma anche degli effetti devastanti che la guerra ha, persino dopo anni, su coloro che l’hanno vissuta. La testimonianza di Nikulin, che l’autore stesso definisce la confessione di un ragazzo terribilmente spaventato, rivela uno sguardo puro sulla realtà che permette alle sue memorie di rompere il muro di menzogne della propaganda riguardo alla guerra. Fino alla fine della sua esistenza proverà un senso di colpa per essere sopravvissuto a quei terribili avvenimenti, ne sarà tormentato, non riuscendo a sfuggire ai ricordi del fango, del sangue e delle pile di cadaveri. Pur temendone le conseguenze, sentirà dunque la necessità di trasferire su carta questi ricordi, dando una testimonianza sincera e senza fronzoli, che ricostruisca quanto più possibile una memoria veritiera degli avvenimenti bellici.
>
>Leggere oggi le pagine di Nikulin, tragicamente attuali, non può che convincerci di quanto la guerra, in ogni sua forma, sia un’assurda follia.

So yes, many people predicted Russia's intents and actions.  McCain was was probably just repeating what the Baltic states have long been warning about.   But Obama's decision might have had more to do with Ukraine than it did with Russia.

  

Let's look at some relevant history:

* The Afghanistan government, armed and trained by the US for more than a decade, never solved their corruption and dissolved as soon as the US withdrew, resulting in billions of dollars of military assets being seized by the Taliban.
* In the 1980's the United States provided arms to Afghan Mujahideen fighters to resist the Soviet invasion. However, some of those weapons ended up in the hands of factions that later turned against American forces during the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.
* In the 1980s, the Reagan administration secretly facilitated the sale of weapons to Iran as part of the Iran-Contra affair. Some of these weapons were later used against American forces, particularly during the Gulf War in 1990-1991.
* In the 1980s, the United States provided support to various Libyan opposition groups in their efforts to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's regime. However, after Gaddafi's downfall and the subsequent destabilization of Libya, a significant number of weapons from Gaddafi's arsenals were looted, and some fell into the hands of extremist groups. These weapons were later used against American diplomatic personnel in the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
* Following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the subsequent overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, there was widespread looting of Iraqi military arsenals. Numerous weapons, including small arms, explosives, and artillery, were acquired by various insurgent groups. These weapons were used against American forces and contributed to the ongoing insurgency and sectarian violence in Iraq.
* During the Syrian Civil War the United States provided support to various rebel groups fighting against the Syrian government. Some of the groups that received U.S. assistance later became affiliated with extremist factions, including the Islamic State (ISIS). Some of the weapons supplied to these groups, either directly or indirectly, were eventually used against American-backed forces or fell into the hands of terrorist organizations.",False,1687554234.0,t3_14goa5g,t1_jp89blo,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 This war started with two of the major groups of those failing spectacularly: the FSB at failing to predict Ukrainian levels of resistance and the heads of the Army - at failing to have any success whatsoever. Well some irregulars too - Chechens failed for example.

 In March of last year - Putin put another set of irregulars - a ""private"" mercenary company named Wagner group into the fight. This group is known to have connections with one of the Russian intelligence services, I believe GRU. Wagner group is led by Mr. Prigozhin.

 Over the course of the war - the Army and Wagner group have behaved in the manner described in the first paragraph - trying to outcompete each other in terms of results and sometimes sabotaging each other. Wagner has come out looking better - and Prigozhin has been increasingly vocal as he's the only part of the Russian force that seems to have had success.

 In recent months Prigozhin has claimed more and more sabotage coming from Russian army with delivery of weapons, etc. More recently he has even claimed that Russian units tried to mine Wagner withdrawl routes.

 As far as Russian army leaders are concerned - they've recently started making a play to force all ""irregulars"" sign up to be led by the Army rather then remain a private company.

 Seems to have come to a head today with Wagner claiming they got hit by Russian regular army strike and with rumors of Russian special forces being pulled in for a ""cleansing operation.""",False,1687554813.0,t3_14goa5g,t1_jp9s0br,,3,3,0,3,0,0,
