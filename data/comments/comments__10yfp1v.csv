Day 351-352 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a pretty uneventful day with nothing much happening other than usual air raid alerts, but at night we started getting hit with missiles and drones almost non-stop even up until now. At 4am today an air raid alert was triggered and less than a minute later we heard explosions, those were from missiles launched from Belgorod, and they launched a lot of them during this night.

There were at least 8 missiles fired at Kharkiv, we heard about 8-9 explosions, but our governor said that it was actually 12, so 3 fully loaded S-300 launchers firing their entire load. Some of the missiles were apparently aimed at Chuhuiv and some other places in Kharkiv oblast, which is why we didn’t hear all of the explosions that happened. They were aiming at our energy infrastructure this time as expected.

In the morning, during the massive missile strike, they fired just one missile at Kharkiv and sadly they did manage to hit one of our power plants with it. Though it didn’t actually do that much damage, only 15% of people, out of about 1.1 million, were left without electricity after the strike which is not exactly a blackout, for us specifically there were no problems with electricity today, other than some lights flickering during the first missile strike that happened during the night. There will be some, relatively long, 6 hours blackouts during the next 2 days to repair the damage, but honestly that’s not even that bad at all.

It's so weird that they are still trying to harm civilians far away from the frontline with missiles even when they are apparently trying to do offensive operations along the frontline. Do they actually not understand that inconveniencing some civilians for a couple of hours doesn’t actually help their military in any way? The strikes today didn’t even disrupt the trains in any meaningful way, there were at most some small delays, and for anything important we would just use steam locomotives which don’t need electricity anyway. I guess we really are just lucky that they are so fucking stupid.",False,1676075582.0,t3_10yfp1v,t3_10yfp1v,,0,108,0,108,0,0,

Fresh satellite images of Vuhledar show an incredible picture.

Black dots are all scorched areas without snow due to fires or bombing. 

The front line is right between Vuhledar and Pavlivka. Vuhledar is Ukrainian-held and Pavlivka is Russian held. So black scorch marks north of Pavlivka are all Russian. They're flattening the entire landscape.

Ukrainian artillery hits are best seen at Shevchenko. Just as many shells as the Russians, except fired out of a sniper rifle and not a giant drunken shotgun. That long thin line is exactly where a lot of Ukrainian footage was geolocated to, with giant Russian columns getting blasted in the fields. 

The convicted Russian war criminal Igor Girkin did not shy away from criticism:

> Most of our generals are exemplary cretins, always have been since before they enlisted. They gleefully repeated every single mistake they've made before. Staging armored and motorized columns along narrow roads on perfectly flat terrain, without air cover or any electronic warfare. All roads have minefields on each side. This lead to a predictable catastrophe. 

> Some vehicles were destroyed by Ukrainian ATGMs firing from Vuhledar high rises. Others were bullseyed by the enemy's excellent artillery. Over 30 vehicles were lost, I won't break down by type. Dozens of KIA among tank crews alone. Naval infantry, special forces, assault infantry, a lot more dead than that.

> [after describing idiotic Russian tactics at Vuhledar] At the same time our generals didn't want to ""get up twice"" so they habitually sent more men to slaughter, all along the all-familiar Donetsk industrial landscape. They sent former DNR militia that got fancy new ""RF Army"" unit names, and other volunteers. 

> They did not give them adequate artillery support. What they got was meager and exceptionally inaccurate. They got no armor support either because the generals wanted to keep their armor safe from landmines, and they could not arrange de-mining ""for technical reasons"". So they buried two more assault companies with the exact same result - no result at all. 

And immediately segues to [mobiks refusing to fight](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/10yfp1v/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j7zxwcl/). Girkin flat-out calls it a *revolt*.

>The United States, in coordination with the United Kingdom, is taking action to counter systemic corruption in Bulgaria by designating five former Bulgarian government officials as well as five entities for corrupt acts that resulted in illicit personal gain, undermined the country’s democratic institutions, and perpetuated its corrosive dependence on Russian energy sources.

>The Department of the Treasury undertook several designations today pursuant to Executive Order 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world:


>* Rumen Ovcharov, a former Bulgarian member of parliament (MP) and minister responsible for energy; Aleksandar Hristov Nikolov, a former CEO and deputy director of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP); and Ivan Genov, former CEO of KNPP and former MP were designated for a series of illicit dealings and the exchange of bribes related to energy contracts that robbed the Government and people of Bulgaria of hundreds of millions of dollars;
>*  Nikolay Malinov, a former MP and leader of the Russophiles National Movement and chairman of the Russophiles for Revival of the Fatherland Political Party, was designated for bribing a judge to permit him to travel to Russia, even though he had been indicted for espionage on behalf of Russian-backed interests and had been placed under a travel ban;
>* Vladislav Goranov, a former MP and former Minister of Finance, was designated for using his position to facilitate bribery in exchange for favorable legislation, depriving the government of tax revenues;
>* Inter Trade 2021 EOOD, MS Konsult 2016 EOOD, the Russophiles National Movement, and Russophiles for the Revival of the Fatherland, were designated for being owned or controlled by Malinov;
>* Trilemma Consulting Ltd EOOD was designated for being owned or controlled by Goranov.


>...

>These coordinated actions support the U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption and demonstrate the commitment of the United States and the United Kingdom to promoting accountability for corruption, and to helping Bulgaria, a NATO Ally, institute critical rule of law reforms.

>The corruption perpetuated by those designated today reflects a systemic pattern of personal enrichment at the expense of the Bulgarian people, government, and democratic institutions.  The United States and the United Kingdom stand steadfast in solidarity with those in Bulgaria who seek to tackle corruption and strengthen the rule of law.

Not only are they kind enough to immediately provide post-damage-assessment videos after every Ukrainian strike, they even use social media to openly discuss top-secret weapon R&D.

This twitter thread is all in Russian. It describes the brand new portable Repeinik EW station being tested by Wagner troops. It's a fascinating story. 

The prototype device, as helpfully described on its Russian-language wikipedia page, is a personal project by the lead engineer of the Sestroretsk Tool Plant, one Alexey Tsarkov. As of a month ago the project was all but one prototype. Now there are three. 

Sestroretsk is near St Petersburg and Putin and most of his henchmen are from St Petersburg. Apparently Tsarkov tried and failed to get any interest from the MoD so he contacted Prigozhin, and immediately got a ""pile of cash"" to try out his device at Bakhmut.

This portable device stands on a tripod and supposedly ""isolates"" drones, i.e. creates enough interference to make them fall out of a sky. There's a passive detection mode, and the active comms / GPS / GLONASS / GSM / WiFi suppression mode. 

Top minds at Wagner have been posting detailed updates on their progress. They helpfully revealed:

> Their first test run was with one prototype. They have now concluded the second round with three devices. Coverage area is approximately 9x9 km of full drone 'isolation', and partial isolation at 21x21 km:

> - 371 targets detected;

> - 78 targets identified;

> - 12 targets destroyed;

> - 60 targets suppressed.

And a few hours ago the same Wagner folks reported that based on the second round of testing, Prigozhin is personally financing serial production of these anti-drone devices.

To be fair: the point of AFVs / IFVs is to drive into artillery areas. Their armor can take stray shrapnel, moving at 30mph makes it difficult to be hit when artillery takes 1.5 minutes to land after firing (20km and 70km is a long distance for artillery to travel, even at massive speeds). There's a lot of dodging a car can do at 30mph, especially BMP (or Bradleys), which don't have to drive on roads.

Yes, a direct hit still kills you. But without armor, a 100m blast kills you. Dropping the ""kill area"" to only 10m or less means that AFVs / IFVs, especially when traveling at top speed, can reasonably safely enter these areas.

So just ""push the gas pedal and drive"" + armor (even though its not much armor) counters artillery pretty well.

But, for now, they don't need to leave. The only thing that will cause Ukraine to leave is if their situation becomes untenable (threat of encirclement). So watch the approaches north and south, if there is a change, that's where it will come from. 

Why Russia has recently slowed down? It is hard to say. All we know is that they are running out of time and have been pouring resources in at an unsustainable rate. They needed to make something significant happen somewhere, and they have failed to do so. ...but... who knows what that means. Maybe they are regrouping for a surprise push somewhere else. Maybe they just don't have the guys to keep it up anymore. Maybe they finally realized burning all these soldiers for Bakhmut is stupid. Like a lot of things, we just have to wait and see to see what the truth is. I'll just add that one 'common wisdom' about Bakhmut was that Russia *had* to keep applying pressure or they risked losing hard fought incremental gains. I don't know if that's true. I'm just an arm chair general. I think it's an interesting thought though. If they have really slowed down, it may reflect a huge shift in priority or a major change in condition.

My gut feel is the Russian military is panicked, demoralized, poorly led, and exhausting itself. These last few weeks were supposed to be the start to a fresh new chapter for them. But so far this book looks like the last book. So now I sense an air of hesitation. This Russian offense is a danger. But it is also a huge fucking gamble. If these divisions fall on their face, who will be left to guard the rear after all these weeks of unsustainable manpower burn? And how do they feel about taking that gamble, right now, exactly as they have planned, after they've seen how the last few weeks have gone (no significant success)? So, as a result, I think there are likely being some major last minute adjustments up and down the line. Russia will still have to launch their offensive no matter what. But I think it might look different than they had initially planned.",False,1676054653.0,t3_10yfp1v,t1_j7zxkjg,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Having the Initiative in a battle is where the opposition is having to respond to your moves, as opposed to the other way around.

It is usually associated with the side that is being more assertive and the most common reason is one side is becoming more dominant.

The analogy is a 1500m foot race. Often, if you see one athlete break away from the pack it’s is because they are a stronger runner than everyone else.

But there is a second reason why a runner might break out of the pack, it’s because they are going harder than everyone else. The issue is they are not pacing themselves, are not protected by the draft of the other runners, and are more likely to start failing in a few laps.

Russia is in this position now. They have ramped the up the pressure and the attacks, and thereby gained the initiative. 

Time will tell if this is wise move on their part or not. 

The reality right now is Russia has only made marginal gains and have lost A LOT more troops and equipment over the past two weeks compared to if they’d taken a less aggressive approach.

Ukraine taking the initiative now would mean them committing their reserves. Multiple opportunities exist. They will make impressive gains.

If Bakhmut is lost than Ukraine is lost and then the West, as a whole, is lost. Paraphrasing but actually pretty close to what they have to say.

That's just one account. And the reason to be extremely skeptical of it (to say the least) is that nobody else is basically saying that. The only people who say Wagner are badasses are Wagner. If Ukraine was getting smoked, then why do we see videos and pictures of obliterated Russian BTGs and failed attack after failed attack? Why are the front lines barely moving day by day? People can verify this with geolocated timestamped footage. Multiple sources can verify where the lines are day by day and at a high level what is true and what is not true.

The fight is hard and people with guns are never a joke. But the account from this video doesn't line up with observable, verifiable reality. Most accounts now are that Russia has ramped up activity and that most of those attacks have failed at tremendous cost of life and equipment. Most accounts are that Wagner absorbed massive losses and that the death rate is so high recruiting from prisons has basically frozen. Most accounts are that Russia is going all in right now, so hard times are ahead, but Ukraine is holding so far. This will be a hard and crucial point of the war. It is hard to believe Ukraine will be able to take Russia's absolute best punch and not flinch. But as long as they don't get too hurt, they can quickly turn this war into their favor.

Then there were all the comments about how Macron was trying to be a big shot and play statesman himself. I think he knew it might make him look foolish or ineffectual but it really was an earnest attempt to try and avert bloodshed.

There was a piece of a conversation with Zelensky he had just before his trip to Russia and Zelensky was telling Macron that trying to negotiate with Putin wouldn't work and was pointless and Macron just said sort of quietly ""I have to try."" And I really think beyond all the political considerations that was why he did, even if it was a million to one shot he was one of the few people in the world that could get a meeting with Putin and on the slight chance it could save thousands of lives Macron was going to try.

Despite the pro-Russian government, Ukraine still had opposition leaders, groups, militias, and leaders who organized and called for action. And when that happened, it was obvious that almost two thirds of Ukrainian people supported that action (57% according to polls taken during Euromaidan). 

When you know for sure that you've got over half the country on your side, and politicians who you can support to step in once you win, and you are able to coordinate and organize on social media, and the ratio of protestor to police state enforcers is favorable then you've got pretty damn good odds of beating the government. Again, not diminishing the bravery it required especially in the face of snipers and other violence protestors faced. That's a fact.

But the fact is a vast majority of Russians are still apathetic because this war hasn't affected them yet. Ukraine didn't risk their lives to stop their government fighting someone else - they did it because it was an existential crisis. I'm not justifying it - this majority of apathetic people have no excuse to stand by while their government commits genocide, and they are guilty. 

Even if you had half the country supporting a Russian regime change though, they still lack a lot of the advantages that Ukraine has. Who are they fighting for? There is no opposition government to take over, there are no militia groups or protest leaders, because they're all either dead, in jail, or in another country for their safety. People are only going to hit the streets, ready to die for the cause, if they are either confident of success or desperate and having no other choice. And right now we are very far from either case. On top of that there is around 1.5 million members of police state (police, OMON, rosgvardiya, etc). You'd need half a million people coming out in Moscow alone to overwhelm the police, though I'm willing to bet a million protestors would be a more even fight.

No, Russia is simply colossally fucked. And also no, I'm not asking for sympathy for Russians or trying to justify anything. This country will suffer the consequences, and for most of the people living here, well deserved.

My only point here is to dispell this idea that there is any realistic or pragmatic way for Russians to protest.

There had been fighting in Donbas for 8 years, and Russia had de facto control of a substantial chunk through the proxy of the DNR and LNR. If they'd gone for a localised push to consolidate, or just to annex what they already held, I imagine most of the world would have shrugged it off. Probably could have achieved a greater scope of goal by six months than they have within a year, stabilised a front line, drawn up a peace treaty and formal annexation, and Putin would have looked like a master of brinkmanship and geopolitical power play.

But no, they went for Kyiv and Lviv by air assault on one and missile attacks on the other, they actively tried to assassinate Zelensky, and they came via Belarus as well as land they actually controlled. Oh, and attacked a flipping nuclear power plant with live fire in the first few weeks.

That intrigued me, as in ""Why would the Queen grant a knighthood to an oppressive communist dictator?""

I guess she gave it to him because he had Romania buy a bunch of British planes.

""In June 1978, Ceaușescu made a state visit to the UK where a £200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and British Aerospace for the production of more than eighty BAC One-Eleven aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving a civil aircraft. This was the first state visit by a Communist head of state to the UK, and Ceaușescu was given a knighthood by the Queen, which was revoked on the day before his death in 1989.""
