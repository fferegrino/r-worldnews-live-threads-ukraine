""We have a clear understanding of how our defence capabilities will be strengthened in the coming months. I do not want to talk about it today, I think you understand why. But I am very grateful to President Biden for this,"" said Zelenskyi.

At the end of February, while the city of Kharkiv was still under attack, I met 21 yo, Eugene Gromadskyi. At the time I had no idea what he, nor Ukraine, were capable of. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63887570
>
>A hurried mobilisation was underway. The city and the country felt underprepared for the scale of what had hit them. These were the most troops I’d seen in the week there. From the crowd, a young National Guards lieutenant emerged and said, in English, “call me Eugene”
>
>Look at his feet. It’s the middle of winter, he’d been fighting back Russian attacks, and he was wearing trainers. He was confident and determined, but I couldn’t help but think, this isn’t how you defeat the Russian army.
>
>On the day of Russia’s invasion, he fought solidly for 48 hours, his unit outnumbered and out-gunned. But they stopped a number of armoured columns, killing attackers. They even captured some enemy forces as well as ammunition and vehicles. Eugene had help from his dad Oleg.
>
>Oleg, a retired army Colonel had gone straight to the barricades the morning of the attack, telling friends of Facebook to arm themselves and to prepare to defend their country. Courage runs in Gromadskyi veins. Seven generations of the family have served.
>
>Those first hours were brutal. Father and son fought shoulder to shoulder, one on machine gun, the other at a grenade launcher. Under heavy Russian fire, they had to withdraw. At ten o’clock that evening Eugene would learn that his dad had been killed in an artillery strike.
>
>Pause for a moment and think about that. Your country is under attack, your life is a risk, and you’ve just lost your dad. But Eugene didn’t have time for grief. He got together 20 men and returned to battle.
>
>And he kept on fighting, still smiling, still in the thick of it. When we could we’d meet in Kharkiv. He is an eternal optimist. But by summer he was growing frustrated by the stalled conditions. He wanted his country on the offensive.
>
>And then, silence. He disappeared.
>
>The casualties in this war are enormous. On both sides. Days after meeting a unit, I’ll get a message saying, “do you remember...”, informing me that someone we just met has been killed. Or badly injured.
>
>Then, in late May, he was back online and sent a single picture.
>
>""We came under fire and a shell exploded near me and shrapnel hit my face, near my lip and apparently came out at my temple. [In hospital] an operation was performed, I was put back together, they didn't need to use metal plates.""
>
>Again, he did not rest. After ten days in hospital he was back with a new unit, now in the Ukrainian Army, not the National Guard. He went back to fight WITH A BROKEN JAW.
>
>He’s been fighting ever since, as Ukraine gained momentum over the summer he was at the forefront of the offensive in Kharkiv region, driving the Russians out. Winter conditions  are appalling. But at least he has boots now. (And HIMARS, heavy artillery, armoured vehicles...)
>
>And on Sept 24th his bravery in Kharkiv and Ukraine’s initial desperate hours was rewarded. President Zelensky presented him with the order of the gold star, Hero of Ukraine award. “I was so nervous, I couldn’t remember my own name”, Eugene told me.
>
>His dad of course, couldn’t be there, and neither could his mother, Natalia. But we’ll have more on her tonight when our report airs on #bbcnews
>
>As 2022 ends, remember what’s been won, and lost. Eugene and his mum, along with millions of Ukrainians are suffering Russian aggression on the battlefield and the home front. Its remarkable what can be achieved with courage, determination and a good pair of trainers

Day 302 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had one missile strike during the day, which happened at 6pm. They fired 2 missiles from Belgorod, one of them was intercepted, but the other one made it through our air defense and landed somewhere on the outskirts of Kharkiv. We don’t actually know what was hit, there were no photos or videos, and at first, we didn’t even know what hit us, it was only a speculation that it was a missile strike, but it was confirmed later. Thankfully there were no casualties that we know of.

It's great seeing Russians being furious about Zelensky visiting US, everything they are supposedly fighting to prevent from happening is happening precisely because they started this war, and now they are seeing the consequences of their own actions, which they could have prevented by simply not invading in the first place. 

It’s funny that before Russians were saying that sending Patriot to us is an escalation, but now, when it is being done anyway, apparently Patriots are not a threat anymore, “they can deal with them” and of course even S-300 is better. Why? Because Putin said so. He also said that they are fighting to “protect Ukrainians” and while he was saying that line the missile strike aimed at Kharkiv was happening. Yeah, we definitely feel his protection here. Just fuck off with your protection, you fucking bastard.

Just recently Russians were also saying that they will “definitely” capture Bakhmut soon, but as usual they have been thrown out of Bakhmut back into its outskirts, confirmed by Girkin too, so it definitely happened. Now there are also rumors saying that Russians will again attack from Belarus 3 days from now, just how fucking stupid can they be if they actually try to do this? We will know soon if those plans are real, so for now we just wait.

> The National Guard was mainly stationed in the Kherson, Zaporozhye regions and in the Crimea, as well as in Mariupol. 

> They have returned to the regions, to large cities—specifically for mobilization activities in January-February, “so that there is no street violence,” to strengthen the protection of field camps, and to beat the draft dodgers “in the kidneys.”

> The National Guard goal was to maintain order in the occupied territories. But now: “**There will be battles in the occupied territories in the near future**, there is no need to maintain order there,” says a source close to the General Staff leadership.

> Sources in the Army also believe that the withdrawal of the National Guard is justified. In the fighting on the front line, they did not bring almost any benefit and suffered constant losses. 

> One of the officers of the National Guard is sure that the withdrawal is connected with the need to keep the situation inside Russia under control, because mobilization in the winter months can lead to protests by the mobilized and their relatives. 

> We [the journalists] do **not believe the prospect of mass protests inside Russia is likely**, but we know that the situation with the protection of military, transport, industrial and energy infrastructure in the regions of the Russian Federation is critical. Now the army units and the FSB are dealing with it, and they are not coping with the task. The National Guard can relieve the FSB and the army by taking on these tasks (although, the security of facilities is unlikely to increase from this).

According to other sources posted in these threads, with credentials that my limited knowledge about them makes them sound credible, Ukraine's 100k number is probably a bit inflated. HOWEVER! It is probably not inflated by ""We need to lie to look good""-amounts, but rather by fog of war-amounts. One of the articles put Russian losses at around 75k when Ukraine had reported ~90k russians kia (while Russia reported 5k losses... Sure...), meaning that while the 100k number is probably not 100% accurate, it is close enough that it will not take long for that ""milestone"" to actually get hit.

The ability to quickly and cleanly donate a huge amount of military stock and material to another power without degrading their own material stocks has been a huge part of this war. Having enough stock to not only meet your own needs but also donate enough to sustain an ally is clearly an absolutely massive strategic asset. 

Even if the material isn’t the gold standard that a public might expect their own military to boast, being able to shunt a few hundred artillery pieces and munitions to another country with minimal notice is so important. But it also raises questions about if there are systems that are a vital component in your own strategy but you are not willing to dispatch, having alternatives that you are able to send that fill out that gap is important. 

The west has its air forces that fill out many roles. It can’t/won’t send aircraft in major numbers, so it leaves gaps in the toolkit it can provide to Ukraine.

edit: imagine an early 2024 republican presidential debate. the commentator asks each candidate where they stand on Ukraine. how do they respond?.. some will sidestep, some will take a stance either way. the ones who take a pro Ukraine stance will risk being allied with Democrats months before the election. it's just a reality that this is going to happen. these events will heavily shape policy. 

if that doesn't do it for you then just view the editorial from cnn yesterday that claimed if trump had won Zelenski would be dead and Ukraine would be in very bad shape. it is unfortunate but true that our coming American election will push policy  concerning Ukraine in the wrong direction.

In short, the statement is too long, because it wants to be taken as a serious threat, because Iran is a powerful and dangerous enemy to make, and should be feared. Their pride is getting in the way of a good lie. 

Russia, on the other hand, is always the innocent victim. Russia is strong, sure — super strong — but only defending itself, right? It's always evil NATO starting fights with the peaceful, yet brave and plucky Russian Federation (DARVO: reverse victim and offender). The bold-faced lies about what is and what is not make a certain internal sense in the context of the bigger lie that Russia is a poor victim. If that statement were true then the other things might be too. This gives the rube an anchor to hang their beliefs on. Starting with the Soviets, they've been developing the manipulation theory behind this for a long time.  

With Iran's prideful bluster and demand to be feared, though, the lies stand out as the obvious lies they are: just a flex, true because we say it's true, what're gonna do about it?

If you think they are concerned about how many soldiers they are losing you are wrong, in fact they are willing to sacrifice every able man in the country if it means they can stay in power.

Make no mistake, they are more than aware this war is lost. But if they admit this, if they retreat, they are dead. They are in an impossible situation, end the war and die, or keep the war going and your country dies but you live.

Their main gambit here is to play the long game.

There will be presidential elections in the US in two years, chances are it's going to be a republican president, he may or may not be not be sympathetic to Ukraine but he may be a populist that says ""why give Ukraine money for weapons when we can use that money for [enter thing here].""

Wiling to ""do what it takes"". Not held back by pussy-ass rules and regulations (war crimes? I never even met her!).

Except wars aren't won by a bunch of individuals ""with a particular set of skills"" looking out for themselves and the A-Team was an escapist fantasy.

Wars are won through coordinated movement of force, and the logistics to back that force up. It's not nearly as glamorous as a bunch of Huns rushing over the hill, swarming the streets and murdering the townsfolk, carrying off the women. Wagner seems pretty good at the whole bloodthirsty sack-the-countryside thing. But we've invented machine guns, drone lookouts and GPS artillery since the age of Ghengis. 

So yep, LARPers. War it seems when best done is a whole lot of boring mixed with brief periods of brutal excitement, and the discipline to keep the boring part going, because you are a cog in a giant war-making machine with a bunch of different parts. Wagner wants the glory-right-now-all-the-time part and I dearly hope it gets them all killed very quickly.

How much material you have on hand and how quickly you can switch from a peace-time footing to a war one are important. Being the first into a battle often means you can control it and force your opponent to react to you. Ukraine has to endure months of Russia dictating the pace and locations of battles because Russia was the one to attack first. 

However, it’s dangerous to become too obsessed with it. Part of why WWI happened was that every European power had taken one lesson from the Franco-Prussian war, “he who mobilized first wins” to extremes, setting up a dangerous game of chicken where once one country mobilized, every other country had to mobilize or risk an embarrassing defeat. However, mobilizing first isn’t a guarantee of victory.

Oh yes, decades in the making. Putin's prisons are largely filled with the country's poorest, most of them from the impoverished regions with high levels of corruption.

The guy who made the newer anti-Wagner video, not the one who got sledgehammered, is very typical: born in a rural area, mother died when he was 5, dad gave him up to the orphanage, grew up in Dickensonian conditions of rampant child abuse, kicked out at 18, cheated out of his government-issued ""orphan apartment"" and the million-ruble orphan stipend that the government was supposed to have for him, went to Moscow to look for a job but found none so turned to petty crime. It's a conveyor of corruption, the country's most vulnerable get robbed and abused since they're little kids, invariably turning to alcoholism and drugs and crime, and end up in jail and / or dead before 30. 

Prigozhin just put that conveyor on fast forward.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html

>Less than a month into the Libyan conflict, NATO is running short of precision bombs, highlighting the limitations of Britain, France and other European countries in sustaining even a relatively small military action over an extended period of time, according to senior NATO and U.S. officials.

>NATO officials said that their operational tempo has not decreased since the United States relinquished command of the Libya operation and withdrew its strike aircraft at the beginning of April. More planes, they said, would not necessarily result immediately in more strike missions.

-

>But, they said, the current bombing rate by the participating nations is not sustainable. “The reason we need more capability isn’t because we aren’t hitting what we see — it’s so that we can sustain the ability to do so. One problem is flight time, the other is munitions,” said another official, one of several who were not authorized to discuss the issue on the record.

>European arsenals of laser-guided bombs, the NATO weapon of choice in the Libyan campaign, have been quickly depleted, officials said. Although the United States has significant stockpiles, its munitions do not fit on the British- and French-made planes that have flown the bulk of the missions.

-

>Britain and France have each contributed about 20 strike aircraft to the campaign. Belgium, Norway, Denmark and Canada have each contributed six — all of them U.S.-manufactured and compatible with U.S. weaponry.

-

>Concerns that supplies of jet-launched precision bombs are growing short in Europe have reignited long-standing controversies over both burden-sharing and compatibility within NATO. While allied jets have largely followed the U.S. lead and converted to precision munitions over the last decade, they have struggled to keep pace, according to senior U.S. military officials.

>Libya “has not been a very big war. If [the Europeans] would run out of these munitions this early in such a small operation, you have to wonder what kind of war they were planning on fighting,” said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a defense think tank. “Maybe they were just planning on using their air force for air shows.”

The war is in Europe and the Europeans should have the final say. They're the ones (after Ukraine) that has to deal with the Russian threat, not the US.

So, if the US gives aid that risks a widening of the war to greater Europe, it will fuel the division within both organizations. Those that want to arm Ukraine to the teeth and are prepared to go to war over it, and those that just want it to end and not see another bloody conflict in greater Europe.

I'm sure Russia would lose any greater conflict with Europe, but it wouldn't be as straightforward of a victory as reddit thinks. Start bombing Moscow, for instance, and the threat becomes existential to Russia risking nuclear escalation.

Sadly, the best way to damage Russia (and they do deserve to be damaged) is through Ukraine bleeding them out. The longer the conflict in Ukraine goes on, the more Russian soldiers die, the more Russian gear is destroyed (which is hard to replace), the longer the sanctions continue, the greater the damage to their economy, the more quickly its people will come to understand that the chosen path is wrong for them, and the more quickly they'll change leaders.",False,1671703507.0,t3_zsblp3,t1_j17ykwv,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

There are special countries like Poland and the Balkan ones, but generally speaking no war and no intervention in the scale US does al over the world. I get the feeling that NATO has less support from the population from a years now. Many more europeans would renounce to something to prevent wars in manners that americans would not in any way.

External affairs and defense politics of the USA is too aggresive for western europe. The population lately tends to think NATO as a subordination to the USA and it's supremacy. For example all the intervention in Japan or South Korea is pretty much out of Europeans concerns. I think this is ultimetely what leads to rising tensions. USA forced Europe to back them with Morocco for example, and publicly criticize China which everyone knew it would piss off lots of people. 

This leads to the feeling that Europe is becoming a buffer territory to face the Russian block. This doesn't mean Europeans don't support arms deliveries to Ukraine, but people think it like this isn't really about helping Ukrainians, but to face off Russia the same way as Syria.

I've argued quite a lot with people about NATO. I really don't think it's a subordination but rather finding common ground and aligned interests. Some decisions had to be made, decisions that did little favor to the everyday life of Europeans and it seems like the only thing important is the US and it's power projection. Zelensky visited the white house, not Brussels, not Paris or Madrid, but the white house. The US is their biggest ally when Europe was the most punished part of the equation (excluding Ukraine of course) either having to deal with Russia on our borders, gas and diesel prices skyrocketing and the increasing feeling that European politics is just a joke (which normally is) and a proxy of the white house.

But if they can't sustain a limited intervention for a month without the US in Libya, why the hell would they be able to sustain a war against Russia?

https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/08/fact-sheet-us-contributions-nato-capabilities

>...Some allies have some of these capabilities, in limited quantities, but if they were not able to operate as part of a multinational force that includes predominantly U.S. enabling capabilities, most allies would not be able to mount an effective deterrent, nor conduct high intensity or large-scale, long duration operations.  Therefore, declaring these enabling capabilities to be available to NATO, for planning purposes, can be an effective force multiplier for the United States, recognizing that additional allied forces include nearly two million military personnel equipped and potentially available for joint operations.  At the same time, NATO has undertaken to reduce its over-reliance on the United States by asking other allies to develop more of these enabling capabilities.

And from former US defense secretary Gates:

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/text-of-speech-by-robert-gates-on-the-future-of-nato/

>Though we can take pride in what has been accomplished and sustained in Afghanistan, the ISAF mission has exposed significant shortcomings in NATO – in military capabilities, and in political will.  Despite more than 2 million troops in uniform – NOT counting the U.S. military – NATO has struggled, at times desperately, to sustain a deployment of 25- to 40,000 troops, not just in boots on the ground, but in crucial support assets such as helicopters, transport aircraft, maintenance, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and much more.  

>Turning to the NATO operation over Libya, it has become painfully clear that similar shortcomings – in capability and will –have the potential to jeopardize the alliance’s ability to conduct an integrated, effective and sustained air-sea campaign.

>And while the operation has exposed some shortcomings caused by underfunding, it has also shown the potential of NATO, with an operation where Europeans are taking the lead with American support.  However, while every alliance member voted for Libya mission, less than half have participated at all, and fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission.  Frankly, many of those allies sitting on the sidelines do so not because they do not want to participate, but simply because they can’t.  The military capabilities simply aren’t there. 

>In particular, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets are lacking that would allow more allies to be involved and make an impact.  The most advanced fighter aircraft are little use if allies do not have the means to identify, process, and strike targets as part of an integrated campaign.   To run the air campaign, the NATO air operations center in Italy required a major augmentation of targeting specialists, mainly from the U.S., to do the job – a “just in time” infusion of personnel that may not always be available in future contingencies.  We have the spectacle of an air operations center designed to handle more than 300 sorties a day struggling to launch about 150.  Furthermore, the mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country – yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions, requiring the U.S., once more, to make up the difference. 

>In the past, I’ve worried openly about NATO turning into a two-tiered alliance:  Between members who specialize in “soft’ humanitarian, development, peacekeeping, and talking tasks, and those conducting the “hard” combat missions.  Between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership – be they security guarantees or headquarters billets – but don’t want to share the risks and the costs.

War time is completely different than peacekeeping missions. It's about who can out produce the other side. The US is the largest producer in the world, follow by China and then the EU. Russia's economy is a tenth the size of the EU.

You responded to me, not anyone else.  I said this:

>provide your evidence that I'm wrong and that non-US NATO countries can sustain a large air-war without the US

I said nothing about Russia.  What anyone else said is irrelevant.

>So yes this about Russia and sustaining a war with Russia in their back yard during war time.

No it isn't, but I'm still correct even talking about Russia. It doesn't change anything.  European countries would struggle to sustain a prolonged air war against Russia.

>It's about who can out produce the other side.

Thats only part of it of course.  And nothing you've said even comes close to proving your argument.

>While interesting the quotes you shared are not relevant

Ridiculous - what a joke.  Of course they are.  You simply have to say this to dismiss them because they prove I'm correct.  You have no evidence to back up what you're saying.  What's actually irrelevant is this:

>Russia's economy is a tenth the size of the EU.

-

Yeah, I'm sure there would be an abundance of it when Russia cut off the oil and gas.  And European economies would just be going through the roof.",1671756323.0,1671755425.0,t3_zsblp3,t1_j1aze5o,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
