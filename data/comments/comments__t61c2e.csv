Even if it sounds counterintuitive or paradox, but I think we need to stand also united behind the Russian people because they – hopefully – stand up in Russia and fight for their freedom, peace and democracy! 

1/12 We - Russia - want to be a nation of peace. Alas, few people would call us that now

2/12 But let's at least not become a nation of frightened silent people. Of cowards who pretend not to notice the aggressive war against Ukraine  unleashed by our obviously insane czar.

3/12 I cannot, do not want and will not remain silent watching how pseudo-historical nonsense about the events of 100 years ago has become an excuse for Russians to kill Ukrainians, and for Ukrainians to kill Russians while defending themselves.

4/12 It's the third decade of the 21st century, and we are watching news about people burning down in tanks and bombed houses. We are watching real threats to start a nuclear war on our TVs.

5/12 I am from the USSR myself. I was born there. And the main phrase from there - from my childhood - was ""fight for peace."" I call on everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace.

6/12 Putin is not Russia. And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be most proud of, it is those 6824 people who were detained because - without any call - they took to the streets with placards saying ""No War"".

7/12 They say that someone who cannot attend a rally and does not risk being arrested for it cannot call for it. I'm already in prison, so I think I can.

8/12 We cannot wait any longer. Wherever you are, in Russia, Belarus or on the other side of the planet, go to the main square of your city every weekday and at 2 pm on weekends and holidays.

9/12 If you are abroad, come to the Russian embassy. If you can organise a demonstration, do so on the weekend. Yes, maybe only a few people will take to the streets on the first day. And in the second - even less.

10/12 But we must, gritting our teeth and overcoming fear, come out and demand an end to the war.
Each arrested person must be replaced by two newcomers.

11/12 If in order to stop the war we have to fill prisons and paddy wagons with ourselves, we will fill prisons and paddy wagons with ourselves.

12/12 Everything has a price, and now, in the spring of 2022, we must pay this price. There's no one to do it for us. Let's not ""be against the war."" Let's fight against the war.",1646343454.0,1646343189.0,t3_t61c2e,t3_t61c2e,,0,289,0,289,0,0,

Day 8 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

We thought we were holding up all right so far, but today kind of broke us mentally, shelling has been constant throughout the day as well as airstrikes, I think we even heard a tank shooting at something nearby, we couldn’t even get just a moment of rest, the moment you try to sit there’s another sound of explosion and you immediately start running for the shelter. 

And all of this feels like eternity, it still doesn’t even feel real, we didn't think that our neighboring country could invade us and at the same time most russians suddenly became different people, before they had their own opinions, but now pretty much every single one of them share the same opinion, say the exact same things and accuse us of spreading “fakes” as if they were the same exact person. 

Reading russian comments under videos and in social media just makes us sick, they all spout the same thing, saying that it’s our fault they invaded us and that there’s nazis everywhere. And at the same time most russian people there act like nothing is happening and everything is alright. If the amount of nazis we actually have here excuses this invasion then we really should just go and purge the whole world, I bet there’s more nazis in Russia than here.

We were already living in borderline poverty before the war started which already felt almost hopeless, and now we are feeling the level of despair we didn’t even think existed. At this point we are afraid of sleeping and are extremely on edge all the time, completely uncertain of what will happen the next moment.

At the same time a fifth bomb was discovered in the basement of an apartment building in Ryazan, which is a city southeast of Moscow. And I went to Ryazan after the bomb was discovered and diffused to talk to local residents and it was clear from those conversations that what took place was a genuine attempt to blow up a fifth building. The authorities said that this was only a training exercise, but it was nothing of the kind.

The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors.

In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”.

However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”.

The fall of the first Ukrainian city to the Russian army bodes ill for the rest of the country. Russian forces, reports suggest, surrounded and starved the southern Dnieper River port of Kherson into submission. Kherson’s mayor told reporters that many citizens had been left dead and unrecognisable by high-calibre weapons used by the Russians to bombard his city. Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for Aleppo in Syria, today amount to war crimes.

Russian soldiers are threatening to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “the mother of Russian cities”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The Hague where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents.

The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the Chernihiv region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts. Forcing poor young men to fight in an illegal war ought to be added to the list of charges Mr Putin might face.

The production company behind the American version of the Russian state-funded network RT laid off most of its staff on Thursday, according to a memo obtained by CNN.

Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees.

The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network.

This story is still developing.

Here’s where we stand right now:

Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.

Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.

Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east was Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces.

At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihivon Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say. The death toll across Ukraine is continuing to rise.

Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence.

Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance.

The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said.

The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March.

What Kasparov is saying here about risk is interesting, because I heard something yesterday from Mike McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia. He was talking about the threat of nuclear war and said Biden’s job is to ‘reduce risk’ of that happening. He made it sound like an economics problem. But we are dealing with human emotions here and this isn’t a math exercise. And I’m saying this as a person that uses applied mathematics in my work. 

Here’s the interview with McFaul. He mentioned the risk part toward the end.

As long as they don't attack a NATO country, our help can only be indirect to avoid such a horrific possibility. 

But this begs the question, what happens if Putin calls our bluff even as to NATO? Let's say he wants to take a bite out of Poland too. Wouldn't all the same arguments about avoiding nuclear war still apply, NATO be damned? Are we really willing to go to nuclear war to honor a treaty alliance? 

It's still far-fetched as I doubt Putin would dare invade a NATO country, but then, a year ago I would have never guessed he'd invade Ukraine. So it's at least a question worth pondering I'd say.

It kind of seems like the only real ""wall"" for Putin in this sense is other nuclear-armed countries that would fire their own warheads to defend against a Russian invasion, regardless of what NATO does.

Say for example Poland donates some MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine. How will they transfer them? 

1. Polish(NATO) pilots fly fighter aircraft into an Ukraine airspace and land at the nearest Ukrainian airbase. For Russia, it's now a fact that NATO pilots are flying aircraft into their warzone and it will only be taken one way.

2. Ukrainian pilots travel to the country, Poland in this example. They remove all the missiles AND ammo from the internal gun. Can Russia see that on radar? Can Russia tell that the MiG-29 taking off from Polish airfield and flying to Ukraine airspace is not Poland attacking? Think carefully. Again, for Russia, these are fighter jets entering the warzone from NATO airspace. It's only going to be taken one way.

3. Literally the only actual option: MiG-29/Su-25 aircraft are flown immediately adjacent to the border with Polish pilots. The planes are WALKED across the border (literally pushed by hand). Ukrainian pilots enter the aircraft and take off from Ukraine. This is difficult because you can't always land a plane right near the border - you need a place to land on one side and also to take off on the other.

This exact mechanism (#3) has been used in the past to side-step such delicate material transfers.

tldr: Flying donated jets from NATO held country into Ukraine is dangerous. There are other options. We can get fighter/strike aircraft to Ukrainian hands AND we can do it without blatantly risking escalations.

*Edit*

Putin threatened to attack Ukraine if it joined NATO.  Then he attacked anyways.  NATO can not directly attack Russia for fear of nuclear escalation.  But Russia can not attack NATO for fear of the same.  So now that Russia has already played its hand and firmly lost, why does NATO not immediately accept Ukraine and stop the killing?  Once admitted, any continued aggression by Russia would be suicide.

Russia still has nuclear weapons but we all know mutually assured destruction makes their use effectively pointless.  They’re only useful as a deterrent against attack from NATO and visa versa.  Ukraine can remain non nuclear (as can Belarus), all problems solved.

The only risk to this plan is the same risk that exists simply but levying sanctions and supplying Ukraine with weapons and intelligence.

He said that his gut told him that at some point, they would, and nearly everyone in the comments agreed and were saying that NATO should already have “boots on the ground” in Ukraine & that we need to help more than we are. 

& I just wanna say…am I a horrible human being for absolutely NOT wanting to get involved? What is happening in Ukraine is absolutely awful and an atrocity, but if we risk putting ANY kind of military on the ground in Ukraine, then we’re escalating an already tense situation and we’d enter into WWIII, and I don’t want that. I do not want to risk a nuclear strike/war at all, whatsoever, but I feel like that might happen  IF we engage militarily with Russia. 

I just feel awful for not wanting to intervene. There would be SO many millions and millions of more people at risk if NATO were to escalate the situation with military.

Why haven't Ukrainians blown up a few bridges? (or have they?) Looking at google maps Treteriv and Zdvyzh rivers appear to be barriers to the NW of ~~Kiev~~ Kyiv. The forward forces of the Russian ""Convoy"" may already secured a bridge over the Treteriv since is pretty much where they are already. Zdvyzh may be less of barrier since it looks more like an irrigation canal than a proper river. But there are very few roads with bridges over these ""rivers"" into Kiev.

Just wondering. Given logistics forcing a 40-50 mile detour to get to Kiev would be good from a strategic viewpoint.

The answer is not really, no. It takes each satellite about 90 minutes to orbit the Earth, and by the time it's at roughly the same latitude again the Earth has rotated. You really need a constellation of them in order to have eyes everywhere. 

Combine that with the fact that most satellites can't see at night (which covers 50% of the Earth at any given time) or through clouds (60% on average), getting good satellite imagery is difficult.

SAR satellite imagery CAN see at night and through clouds, so they're the hot new thing in the commercial satellite sector.

Everyone I know would be happy about a democratic, free Russia participating as equals. I know US/NATO/EU also snubbed them  - but from Germany, France and others, real attempts at cooperative coexistence and even friendship were made. 

If Russia could move past its desire for regional hegemony and its illiberal control over people and institutions - the ""western"" world would gladly. But no... the inertia of history, institutions and people kept that from happening.

What's probably going to happen in that scenario is that the west will simply install an existing politician as new leader of the country with minimal changes.

The unfortunate, and sad truth is that many here completely underestimate the overwhelming force that Russia **could** bring to bear if they so wanted. Putin could glass the entirety of Ukraine with strategic bombers, and not bat an eye.


This **was** a land and $$ grab. He originally wanted Ukraine with its infrastructure intact. He thought Ukraine would just lay down and cower in fear over 190k troops / vehicles bearing down on them. It didn’t work out that way, and now we are getting a preview of how Putin plans to save face.


This world class narcissist will destroy as much of the country as is needed in order to force Ukraine into submission. Ukraine WILL fall. Russia WILL try to occupy it… **AND** they will spend years, and billions/trillions of dollars trying to keep it.

Eventually, like you said, they will be forced to pull out like we (the US) have had to do nearly every time we have tried to hold / occupy an enemy territory without the support of the local population. It is inevitable.

All while Russia’s economy collapses at home, and they are increasingly cut off from the rest of the world.

Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

At the beginning, they may have intended to cause as little collateral damage as possible, but since the first few days they are reverting to standard Russian Army doctrine. That convoy is 25-30km outside Kyiv, just outside maximum range of their self propelled artillery and MRLS systems and outside the range of Ukrainian counter battery fire. Standard Russian doctrine is also to stop convoys every 12 hours for resupply. They are most likely going to be setting up a FOB close to that location, as their supply lines are only effective for about 80km.  Usually they set up resupply points before moving large numbers of troops, and it seems that is what they were doing during the initial push so the larger numbers of forces coming in later are kept moving.   


At this point, they have started the normal practice of surrounding cities, then shelling them until the defenders surrender, run out of supplies or are all killed. As for Donbass, they keep initiating small attacks, then retreating. I don't think they are retreating, I think they are trying to tie up as many Ukrainian forces as possible so they will not be able to help Kyiv once the encirclement begins.

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,t61c2e,hz8xd43,"I respect the man immensely, but I do think he is wrong with this take. I don't think it's so much about following ""rules"" in this case, but about recognizing that Putin has committed an enormous blunder and is currently feeling incredibly self-conscious, exposed and weak, with an enormous need to reassert his authority. In other words, he is a bully spoiling for a fight. The correct strategy here from the West is to remove opportunities for a direct confrontation, while simultaneously delivering maximum support to Ukraine.

I think this idea of Putin attacking the Baltics as a ""next target"" is completely alarmist as well. NATO is currently putting more troops there. So if Putin attacks, he will be attacking American citizens and facing a newly unified NATO. The way this has been going there **will** be popular support for defending the Baltics, especially if a few German/French/American servicemen die in the initial salvo's. And clearly Putin attacked Ukraine *precisely* because it was not in NATO or the EU. So yes, reasoning from Putins ambition, surely he would *like* to attack, but realistically, they are completely different scenarios. On top of that Ukraine is a prize, it's a huge swath of land with broad natural resources and a large population. The Baltics, with all credit and respect of the people who live there, are not something a dictator who wishes the restoration of the USSR covets for, with their combined population of roughly 6 million. 

Additionally, even if Putin wins in Ukraine, it will be at an enormous and continuous cost, both in military terms and economic terms. With what exactly is he going to attack the Baltics, at that stage? It's not as if he can withdraw a lot of troops from Ukraine or anything. And he might need some strong security forces back home as well, to quell any populist uprising. 

On top of that, Putin clearly *very* much miscalculated with this move, that much is evident. In his mind the ""cost"" for this invasion would likely be higher than that of taking Crimea, but that NATO and the EU would be disorganized, that there might some strong sanctions, but ultimately after a few years of information warfare and political manipulation he would be able to sow enough dissent to reverse some sanctions or at least do business again with a few countries. He was expecting a few cuts and bruises, maybe a broken bone or two, but instead both of his legs are getting amputated. So clearly if he miscalculated, his next calculation cannot be taken to be made from the same erroneous position, and therefore the conclusion he will go for the Baltics next does not follow.

Lastly, even dictators need support. And while troops and elites may be loyal to the payday he is offering them, directly attacking NATO is a suicide mission for Russia. And while it may work for populists like Trump and Hitler, who enjoyed fanatical support in their base, Putin's intrinsic support is much weaker. He rules because over the years he has developed a system in which everyone is trapped, but not because people actually love or like him. Their loyalty or obedience exists because of money or the desire to stay out prison. Neither of those motivations are more powerful than eliciting a nuclear war by directly attacking NATO, or even getting reamed in a conventional war. These are also considerations and thoughts that Putin will have. If attacking NATO means death, what possibly could he offer his support base to motivate them to do that, if he does not have a cult like status?

That's not to say he will DEFINITELY not attack NATO. I think the last few years have shown us that unlikely and far fetched things can and do happen. However, the certainty with which Kasparov makes these claims are not substantiated by the surrounding context, I believe.",1646350318.0,1646349801.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8u5xs,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Some highlights from that post, and in general, are:

- Trump abandoned America's military bases in Syria, which were promptly seized by Russia 
- Russia paid out bounties for American soldiers killed in Afghanistan on Trump's watch without consequence
- Trump lifted sanctions placed on oligarch Oleg Deripaska by Obama as retaliation for the Crimea invasion. This was almost universally derided by both sides in Congress, but Republican senators still blocked a bill that attempted to stop Trump from doing this. 
- Trump described [a bill sanctioning Russia for their interference in the 2016 election as ""clearly unconstitutional""](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-signs-russia-sanctions-bill/story?id=48985465) but signed it anyway when it became clear the bipartisan support in Congress would be able to override his veto 
- Trump stood by while Putin installed his puppet in Belarus, whereas his predecessor worked with Ukraine to oust such a puppet which ultimately resulted in Zelensky's election. Now, Lukashenko is directing his military to fight for Russia in Ukraine. A military he would not control on behalf of Putin if he were not in power. 
- Trump attempted to withhold over a hundred million dollars in military aid from Ukraine as an attempt to blackmail Zelensky into manufacturing problems for Hunter Biden. Zelensky reported this to the US, resulting in Trump's first impeachment. 

So beyond what other commenters have said/will say, Trump's decisions directly enabled the tools Putin is using to protract his war in Ukraine today. One reason Russia was not invading Ukraine in 2015 is that they were busy invading Syria, and Trump all but handed over the keys to America's Syrian military bases to them. Russia is assisted by Belarus, a state they subjugated into a political puppet under Trump's watch. Trump actively worked against attempts to sanction Russia, helping them build the economic power they needed to conduct a land war in Europe, and worked to withhold aid from Ukraine for political gain. 

And the Republicans in congress aren't that much better. During Trump's second impeachment, they parroted conspiracy theories that *Ukraine* had actually interfered with the 2016 election and framed Russia for it - essentially saying they were wrong to have sanctioned Russia against Trump's wishes to begin with, and that Ukraine was at fault. That was a complete falsehood - not even a nuanced issue, just a straight up internet conspiracy theory uttered on the floor of Congress.",1646348519.0,1646347956.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8skdw,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

If he does consider Trump to be a reason not to invade, I doubt it is because Trump is so smart. In fact, it may be because Trump is so stupid he would trigger WW3, something Biden is avoiding at all costs.

Trump is not Putin's friend, even if Trump thinks they had some good conversations and laughs. Putin is sizing up everyone and calculating exactly how he should treat them to get the most value of them for himself. 

My guess (speculation): Putin is 69. It's now or never for him if he wants to see his goals through. It is possible he felt the Ukraine president Zelensky is weak (boy was Putin wrong - what a legend). He probably feels Biden is sane enough to not start WW3 over Ukraine.

You don't fuck with the money, and Putin's Ukraine adventure has fucked with the money in a HUGE way.

After that, I think the most likely scenario is Russia completing its invasion on paper, and settling into a bloody and expensive occupation that will eventually force them to withdraw. This is in line with the ""20-30 year war"" scenario that the US DoD thinks is likely if the status quo continues. I don't think the status quo will continue, because the invasion is hurting Russia too much to abide. 

The final two scenarios, I don't think are terribly likely, but they are possible:

1) The Ukrainian military successfully repels the Russian military. I don't think this too likely, because there's just too big a disparity in size between the two powers. The only reason it's even a possibility is because of the unprecedented Western support, coupled with the surprising ineptitude of the initial invasion.

2) The Russian people rise up and topple their government. Possible if the sanctions bite hard, but I don't think it terribly likely.

You tell Putin that starting in 24 hours, NATO will enforce a No-Fly zone and that you really hope that he will respect it.

After that Putin gets to choose whether he wants to further escalate (which then could lead to WWIII or a nuclear war certainly but is still a few stages of escalation away from it) or whether he wants to pull his planes.

Everything basically depends on how you evaluate Putin and his sanity and how far he is willing to go.

The truth is that if he is willing to be the first one to let the nukes fly over his imperial dreams, odds are we are doomed sooner or later anyways because his ambitions don't stop in Ukraine and if we always turn the other cheek if it reaches a certain escalation stage, all the talk about article 5 and NATO is also probably very much only talk. Because if he invades Latvia, we are in the same dilemma we are now. Do we shoot his planes out of the sky fully well knowing that this might be an escalation that could likely end in him throwing nukes?

So why are we letting the Ukrainians sacrifice themselves for our values right now? Because we don't believe that Putin would attack a NATO country (why not if he is willing to nuke the world to get what he wants?Either he is crazy or not. If he is not crazy, he will never throw nukes unless someone starts invading Russia) or because we hope he won't have the military ressources left (atleast for quite some time) to launch a fresh attack?

What I am trying to say, that if Russia feel like it can take on NATO it would do so right now, the reason can be made up. 

For all we know, there could be NATO pilots who are flying NATO plains in Ukraine already. There could be volunteers or hired mercenaries who are flying NATO planes in Ukraine as well. There is no way for Russia to know for sure, Russia assumes it possible but chooses to believe NATO.

1. They are wrong. We didn't run and hide from the Russians in Syria. No one thought Nuclear war was a serious possibility. Both sides knew the limits of the other. 
2. They are right. Something has changed in Putin, and he would have gone into Ukraine anyway and started shooting NATO planes out of the sky, we would have gone in full scale into NATO, and Putin would have gone Nuclear. 

If 2 is right, All we've done is shown Putin that he can hold the world hostage with the threat of nuclear war, and he'll keep doing the same thing, until it eventually triggers a NATO response. Like appeasing Hitler, all we've done is embolden a madman, and conflict is inevitable.

The French government did not wish to face Germany alone and took its lead from the British government, led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He contended that Sudeten German grievances were justified and believed that Hitler's intentions were limited.[4] That made Britain and France advise Czechoslovakia to concede to the German demands. Beneš resisted, and on 20 May 1938, a partial mobilisation was under way in response to the possible German invasion. It is suggested that the mobilisation could have been launched on basis of Soviet misinformation about Germany being on verge of invasion, which aimed to trigger war in Western Europe.[5]
On 30 May, Hitler signed a secret directive for war against Czechoslovakia to begin no later than 1 October.
In the meantime, the British government demanded for Beneš to request a mediator. Not wishing to sever his government's ties with Western Europe, Beneš reluctantly accepted. The British appointed Lord Runciman and instructed him to persuade Beneš to agree to a plan acceptable to the Sudeten Germans. On 2 September, Beneš submitted the Fourth Plan, which granted nearly all of the demands of the Karlsbader Programm. Intent on obstructing conciliation, however, the SdP held demonstrations that provoked the police in Ostrava on 7 September. The Sudeten Germans broke off negotiations on 13 September, and violence and disruption ensued. As Czechoslovak troops attempted to restore order, Henlein flew to Germany, and on 15 September, he issued a proclamation demanding the takeover of the Sudetenland by Germany.
The same day, Hitler met with Chamberlain and demanded the swift takeover of the Sudetenland by the Third Reich under threat of war. Czechoslovakia, Hitler claimed, was slaughtering the Sudeten Germans. Chamberlain referred the demand to the British and French governments, both of which accepted. The Czechoslovak government resisted by arguing that Hitler's proposal would ruin the nation's economy and ultimately lead to German control of all of Czechoslovakia. The United Kingdom and France issued an ultimatum and made a French commitment to Czechoslovakia contingent upon its acceptance. On 21 September, Czechoslovakia capitulated. The next day, however, Hitler added new demands that insisted for the claims of Poland and Hungary to be satisfied as well. Romania was also invited to share in the division of Carpathian Ruthenia but refused because it was an ally of Czechoslovakia (see Little Entente).[6]
The Czechoslovak capitulation precipitated an outburst of national indignation. In demonstrations and rallies, Czechs and Slovaks called for a strong military government to defend the integrity of the state. A new cabinet, under General Jan Syrový, was installed, and on 23 September 1938, a decree of general mobilization was issued. The Czechoslovak Army was modern, had an excellent system of frontier fortifications and was prepared to fight. The Soviet Union announced its willingness to come to Czechoslovakia's assistance.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

dcbb3cee018a22235bb025e7fdb0caaa,t61c2e,hz8tgy6,"So a little history lesson. 

Back during the Cold War, there was tensions mounting between the 1st and 2nd world. Because of the chance of going into a new war if either side showed weakness, the US and USSR were constantly on edge. Since the US established missiles in Turkey and other sites in Western Europe earlier in the Cold War, the USSR wanted to establish missiles of their own, and did so in Cuba. 

However, the US had recently had a botched operation called the Bay-of-Pigs Incident, which forced them to make concessions. In light of this, the establishment of nuclear weaponry in Cuba was deemed unacceptable by the US, and effectively set off a crisis situation. The White House went through plans ranging from bombing the missile sites to full scale takeover of Cuba, eventually settling on a blockade and embargo. Communication wasn't fully present, and so what occurred was Russia seeing a huge blockade of ships traveling towards Cuba, and a threat of invasion. Tensions reached an all time high as it seemed destined to come to war.

However, what ended up happening was... a peace talk. Khrushchev sent 2 letters; the first, an agreement to remove the missiles if the US did not invade Cuba (which was agreed to). The second, an agreement to dismantle the Cuban missiles if the US did the same to their Turkish missiles (which was agreed to, but publicly refuted). However, this was a slow and stilted process, due to communication methods. From encryption to telegraphs to simple travel restrictions, there was a lot of tension, and a very real threat of nuclear war. 

---

Out of this came a system known as the Hotline, a direct telephone line between the White House and Kremlin that allowed communication in minutes instead of hours or days. The Hotline was designed to prevent another Cuban Missile Crisis, and effectively a way for both countries to alert the other of intentions that could be construed as militaristic threats (Such as when Lyndon B. Johnson told the Kremlin the US was sending troops to the Mediterranean).

In essence, neither country wants nuclear annihilation, and the hotline is a way to ""avoid misunderstandings"". That is, ensure that neither superpower is spooked into full scale nuclear war as a result of the other taking actions that could cause such fears. If one country oversteps, or thinks they could be stepping on toes, the hotline is there to prevent the nukes from going off.

As far as this modern equivalent? It likely will be about making sure that the Ukraine/Russia war doesn't instigate nuclear bombs.",False,1646348124.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8orz4,,2,15,0,15,0,0,

It remains to be seen whether whoever replaces him would be better or worse for the world than Putin is, but it is quite likely that whoever replaces him quickly declares Ukraine as Putin's folly and orders the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine proper, likely holding on to some symbolic piece of territory so that they can claim victory as they flee.",False,1646347774.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8rbkx,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

He also appointed a new head of the State Security Committee, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, and removed Nazarbayev's nephew from the No. 2 position on the committee. Tokayev's Cabinet also resigned.""

the entire region was stabilized with the help of Russian forces as well. so Tokayev may feel in debt to Putin. again someone else could probably expound upon this better than i can.

there is actually an interesting thread by Vafa Guluzade, a former national security adviser for Azerbaijan who worked with three of that country’s first presidents.

he says :""If Ukraine falls now, then Azerbaijan, Georgia will fall next. I'm also not talking about Armenia - it is became like a province of Russia; Russian military bases are located on its territory, etc."" ""At any moment, the President of Russia can announce that the Russian-speaking population of Kazakhstan or Turkmenistan needs help, they are offended there, and he is going to send troops there."" ""The same thing will happen with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - everywhere there is a Russian-speaking population.""

President Obama issued Executive Orders (E.O.) 13660, 13661, and 13662 in March 2014. In December of that year, President Obama signed E.O. 13685, expanding upon the March sanctions. That same month, President Obama signed into law the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, further expanding his administration’s authority to impose sanctions.

>Russian hostilities against Ukraine and the U.S. expanded to cyberspace. In 2015, Russian hackers attacked the Ukrainian electrical grid, turning off the power for one-fifth of Kiev--an attack that cybersecurity experts said could be a test run for future attacks against more complex systems. Two years later, the CIA, NSA, and FBI confirmed that the Russian government intentionally attacked the 2016 U.S. elections to “undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency."" In response, President Obama approved an amendment to E.O. 13964, which gave him the authority to expand sanctions to include nine Russian actors, including two Russian government intelligence agencies: the FSB and GRU.

 >A battalion tactical group (Russian: Батальонная тактическая группа, batal'onnaya takticheskaya gruppa), abbreviated as BTG, is a combined-arms manoeuvre unit deployed by the Russian Army that is kept at a high level of readiness. A BTG typically comprises a battalion (typically mechanised infantry) of 2–4 companies reinforced with air-defence, artillery, engineering, and logistical support units, formed from a garrisoned army brigade. A tank company and rocket artillery also typically reinforce such groupings. BTGs formed the mainstay of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine from 2013–2015, particularly in the Donbass war.

The largest anti-government protests in the history of Belarus, the demonstrations began in the lead-up to and during the 2020 presidential election, in which Lukashenko sought his sixth term in office. In response to the demonstrations, a number of relatively small pro-government rallies were held. The protests intensified nationwide after the official election results were announced on the night of 9 August, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner.

Romania returning Ukrainian property to Ukraine is not a risk of escalation, I agree.

My rebuttal would be that it is not rational to say that scenario is the same as Romania supplying Ukraine with a fleet of MiG-29's. And it's even more false to say it's the same as flying them from Romania into Ukraine. This is a false equivalence and it is a dangerous one.

Again, as in my original post: 

You're NOT going to see NATO combat planes crossing into UA airspace. Doesn't matter if the pilot is NATO or Ukrainian.

tldr: Romania returning Ukrainian property to Ukraine (your example) is not equivalent to Romania providing a strike platform from NATO soil (what it would be if they gave Ukraine MiG-29's to fly from NATO airfield).",1646349231.0,1646346899.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8jvuv,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Regarding NATO escalating: if I somehow knew NATO could strike at Russia in Ukraine - save the lives of many Ukrainians and hold Putin accountable, then I would be all for it. Instead I think it would lead to World War III. Conventional at first, and nuclear once Russia starts to lose which would happen fast. 

My fear is the entire Western world descending on Russia WILL unite its people no matter how much of a piece of shit fascist Putin is. So, I disagree that it gives NATO righteous reason to take any such actions as you are proposing.

NATO *is* a defensive alliance. We state it out loud over and over. It's even written that way legally. 

But I think the outcome could still be decent: The Ukrainian people really might wear down Russia. I really believe they can win. So if there is no aggression from the West. Nothing beyond financial and material support for an independent nation (Ukraine), then Putin will go down. He already looks nuts to half of Russia. So if West keeps 'cool' then my prayer is that that **Russia itself** will solve this problem. Which would be the best outcome for the world... if the meltdown is limited to the Kremlin.

 >The Alaska Purchase (Russian: Продажа Аляски, romanized: Prodazha Alyaski, lit. 'Sale of Alaska') was the United States' acquisition of Alaska from the Russian Empire. Alaska was formally transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867, through a treaty ratified by the United States Senate. Russia had established a presence in North America during the first half of the 18th century, but few Russians ever settled in Alaska.

tldr: Outside of Moldova and potentially Georgia (and maybe continuing to Azerbaijan), there aren't any good targets.

Setting aside the obvious logistics, morale, and occupation problems they are or will have, his potential targets post Ukraine are limited. There's Moldova, I'm sure they're worried and rightfully so. Georgia, I'll not comment on as I don't know how their military looks, but the terrain is bad for an invader, at least. Not saying Russia couldn't conquer them, however. These two are likely and could conceivably be targeted assuming everything in Ukraine somehow works out for Russia while their economy is in tatters and possibly can't import what they need to replace guided munitions or sophisticated electronics. The likelihood of Russia being able to attack anyone conventionally after Ukraine seems low, but they do still have a large army mostly untouched so let's go with it for now.

Finland's in a grey area and they know it. Attacking them will involve most of Europe in some capacity, because the EU does have a mutual defense clause, it's just weak and ambiguous. The constituent EU members could probably win a conventional war without the US/Canada, *if* most militarily committed, *if* Russia failed to, or could not, fix it's logistics issues, and *if* they continued receiving supplies from the US (can't imagine why they wouldn't) The potential for full NATO involvement would be high, as so many members are in both, nukes are already in play on both sides since France is EU, and I doubt the US would just sit it out. But it's all ambiguous and no one really know how it would go down. I doubt they'd be a target because ambiguity is bad for planning major wars and worse when nukes are involved, but who knows he might try it. If he does well, that'll probably be where the red line everyone wants ends up being.

Lastly we have NATO allies. NATO will get involved, Russia cannot win conventionally it appears, and it will be a disaster for Russia. And possibly the world.

Most of the concern for nukes isn't for Russia (or the US) launching a planned first strike nuclear offensive. I don't believe Russia would do so short of a NATO grand campaign into Russia itself. It's pretty damn clear to all involved how that ends, and there's no reason to believe Putin or the people involved in launching one are suicidal and want to kill their whole country. The concern with nukes is all those close calls you heard about during the cold war. Most likely the reason those close calls remained simply close is that the US and USSR weren't actively shooting each other. Had they been engaged in a hot war, triggers would likely have been pulled. Being in a hot war also makes those situations more likely to occur.

There's a damn good reason the US and USSR never fought, and a damn good reason for having clear, unambiguous, bright flashing lines for where a war starts. That clear unambiguous line is attacking NATO. I don't believe he's foolish enough to do it, but if he does NATO absolutely would and should respond and destroy every Russian military unit inside NATO or near the border. Invading Russia proper is a non-starter which will limit concessions that can be forced, but that's just the reality of the situation.",False,1646346021.0,t3_t61c2e,t1_hz8npgt,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Check the article I linked. The first $250M was earmarked in summer 2019 and approved by Congress. A second $140M was slated for UA by the State Department.

The issue is that Trump's decision to delay *both of these for months, without discussion with Congress* was (AFAIK per 1974 Impoundment Act - I am not a lawyer) illegal, and the motivation was most probably political under the guise of investigating corruption. This is why he was impeached.

I'll say that again. It's a STRIKE that is being LAUNCHED from *POLAND*. 

You are Russian AWACS in Belarus. You immediately pickup and see MiG-29's taking off from Poland and flying straight towards the conflict zone in Ukraine. There is only ONE interpretation of this in a conflict. It's an attack and Russia WILL respond.

Yes, Putin will cry foul no matter what. That's a fact. He will escalate the conflict at any excuse. You almost get it.

Anyways, as I said. There is a mechanism for getting the jets to Ukraine. Yes, flying them makes a difference. If you can fly one set of strike aircraft from Poland, Russia will just assume it will happen over and over.

My 'poor' logic is explaining the facts behind the reality that you are seeing. Until we see NATO combat aircraft flying into Ukraine airspace (we won't, because that would be WW3), I will remain correct.

Until then, you hold the poor logic. Keep downvoting me. You will not be correct no matter how hard you press that down arrow.

So yes, flying makes a HUGE difference. On the ground, it is a transfer of materials. Flying from NATO airbase into Ukraine is a NATO country being the launch platform for a strike.

Please, more downvotes. Let's defy reality together.

The thing is, academic credentials don't matter in this situation, and throwing that out is just plain disrespectful to the people fighting for their lives out there.

I'm sure in another situation we would have a lot to talk about as I suspect our interests, academic, and professional lives would make for a lot of interesting conversations.

Unfortunately however, where we disagree is the value of human life, and the expectation of escalation.

This isn't an academic exercise. I don't know if you're aware but there are actual people dying. Human beings who will never see their families again. They are dying because of a mad man.

To clarify, if you feel you want me to expand on my opinion:

based on Putin's actions so far, it is clear that many of his actions were decided and prepared well before the action was taken place. We see this in the way that many of his addresses have been pre-recorded, and edited. How addresses were made several days apart but clearly recorded at the same time. His tactics so far have not been reactionary, despite his posture, but rather calculated (although poorly it may seem). Historically Putin hasn't been generally regarded as Reactionary. He plots and makes schemes, be plans and puts into place calculated actions.

Therefore, based on his historical actions, and recent actions, plus the obvious threat of a supperier NATO military and mutually assured destruction... If Putin was going to press the button, he's already decided to. He may have an excuse for it, but the actions of NATO and the west are likely to make very little actual difference.
