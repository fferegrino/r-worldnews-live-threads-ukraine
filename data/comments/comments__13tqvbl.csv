https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-28-23/index.html

""Ukraine gained “valuable information” from the cross-border incursion into Russia’s Belgorod region, Andriy Yusov, a representative for Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency, said in an interview with Ukrainian media on Friday. 

This week saw a group of anti-Putin Russian nationals, aligned with the Ukrainian army, claim responsibility for an attack in Belgorod, a raid that was embarrassing to Russia.

""As a result of the operation in the Belgorod region, valuable information for Ukrainian military intelligence was collected, which for obvious reasons will not be disclosed,"" Yusov said. He also said that the purpose of the incursion was to accelerate “the exhaustion of Putin's power apparatus,” as well as to reveal “Russia's vulnerability to internal attacks.”

Yusov’s comments echoed the claims of Wagner group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who said on Tuesday that Russian Volunteer Corps groups are really acting as “combat reconnaissance” to try to learn how Russians will act if their border is crossed.   

Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of protecting borders near the combat zone while ensuring the rapid delivery of everything needed to the regions newly-occupied by Russia, in his Border Guard Day address on Saturday. 

""A separate and very significant task is to reliably protect the borders in the immediate vicinity of the combat zone,” Putin said.""",False,1685298968.0,t3_13tqvbl,t3_13tqvbl,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

Today, 🇺🇦 went through one of the largest 🇷🇺 attacks by Shaheds. During this terrorist attack, the most powerful strike was aimed against the Kyiv region. This is how 🇷🇺 celebrates the day of our ancient Kyiv... 

Throughout its history, Kyiv has seen various meannesses from invaders. It has survived them all, and it will survive the ruscists. None of them will be here!

Kyiv and all our cities, our entire 🇺🇦, will put an end to the history of Moscow’s despotism, which has been bringing enslavement to many different peoples for a very long time. Neither Shaheds nor any other means of terror that it humiliatingly seeks around the world will save it. Because strength is in people, it is in cities, it is in life, and when life, people, and the most important cities for culture are despised, 🇷🇺 will only face defeat. And even hundreds of Shaheds will not save it from this. They will only enlarge 🇷🇺 disgrace.

In the second call, a civilian recalls his conversations with a member of the territorial defence in Belgorod who were fully geared except for having weapons, which resulted in them ""f*cking around all day"" but otherwise being practically useless.

Overall, it appears the reaction to the raid missed some key elements such as proper intelligence and armament, leading to frustration of Russians in the area.

An important step in this progress should be the Vilnius Summit, which will present the formulation of how Ukraine will approach and become a member of NATO.

Brief report i've seen ⏬️

KMVA: ""Today, the enemy decided to ""congratulate"" Kyivans on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs.  Previously, it was the most massive drone attack since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.  The air alert lasted more than 5 hours!

 According to preliminary data, more than 40 drones were destroyed by the forces and means of air defense in the airspace of Kyiv.

 As a result of falling debris, there are victims and destruction in various districts of Kyiv.

 In Holosiivskyi due to the downing of drones:
  - debris hit a 7-story non-residential building, one person died, one was hospitalized;
 - the roof of one of the malls caught fire;
 - a fire broke out on the territory of one of the buildings;- there was also a fire on the territory of the enterprise, warehouses of finished products caught fire, destruction on an area of ​​1,000 square meters.  , there is one victim.
The roof of a house caught fire in the Pechersk district.
 In Darnytskyi district
 in one of the shops windows were broken and doors were damaged.""

In the Solomyan district of the capital, a 35-year-old woman was hospitalized due to the fall of UAV wreckage near the premises of one of the gas stations.  But a 41-year-old man died.

You're looking way too much into names of cities in different languages.

Take Germany, and Poland for example. Let's look at the names of cities that used to be under German control (but were not necessarily originally German).

Posen - Poznan (close enough)  
Breslau - Wrocław  
Danzig - Gdańsk  
Allenstein - Olsztyn

Many Germans still use these words today, although arguably it would be preferable if they used the Polish variant. Nobody really cares though. Yes - Poland is not at war with Germany now, and has not been since 1945, but as someone from one of these cities, I have met Germans who claim this is ""their"" city, and even heard an old man saying that we ruined it (mind you I bet he's long dead...).

A much better example though would probably be English ""Warsaw"" which is a transliteration from German ""Warschau"", not the original Polish ""Warszawa"". Still, these are close enough not to bother with changing them I guess ;)

520fe4e9f39e89cacb5ed16bc98277ec,13tqvbl,jm0bied,"Well Russia has gotten to the very edge of what it can do without going Total War with it's society, and still due to sanctions has to largely par down it's manufacture to analog systems from from the early Cold War, and not a lot of them at that. Meanwhile the West is ramping up it's production of arms, the US budget battle seems to be winding down with aid to Ukraine left largely intact(and even increased in some area's) And so far the US presidential election is trending towards a Biden win, albeit still narrowly. So the idea that aid will stay the same is probably a false premise to start with, especially in light of Russia's ""Red Lines"" turning out to all be bluff and bluster. So INCREASED aid seems far more likely, for at least the next few years.

Now going from the idea that Russia really can't continue as it's going without falling behind, nor able to ramp up the war effort without SERIOUS political issues. We can look at what Russia's manpower situation looks like on the front. The fronts in Valudar, Adivka, and others have been shambolic distasters that have all failed and eaten huge amounts of men and materiel with little to show. And Bahkmut proper has FINALLY fallen, though according to the US at least it took 100k men lost in some form to do it; and the flanks are seeming to fall to Ukraine, so that's gonna become untenable before too long. But in order to dredge up the men to do this Russia has to clear out it's vast borders to the point that partizan groups can just raid in and out of Russia at will using tanks that ""anybody can buy at their local surplus store"". And it stands to reason that Russia wouldn't be letting that even be a thing that could happen if it actually HAD the troops to guard the border. So basically what Russia has on the few active front line area's is what it's got, and and very few of those left are anywhere near laughably trained or equipped. All this indicates that the coming offensive has a good chance to be effective in cutting off a large swath of captured territory, and the forces within. Russia just doesn't have enough dudes to really stop it, nor the equipment to force multiply for it;s lack of numbers, nor the ability to do the ""steel rain"" that enabled it's slow grinding push back in the spring before HIMARS was introduced. And this trend is going to continue with Ukraine getting stronger over the coming year, and Russia decreasing in strength and ability.

So where does that leave for a time table? While it largely does depend on HOW successfully the offensives go. I would argue that if they can replicate even half of the success of the last round of Offensives, that Ukraine could force the Russian holdings besides Crimea to be unholdable in less than a year. Or another year after that if the offensives go poorly, or Ukraine purposefully decides to not drive as hard as they could. Then Ukraine has to make the decision to either invade Crimea, cut it off and put it to siege, or try make it some sort of a negotiated deal. But all in all I think the hot war ends one way or another in less than two years at the max. Then i think we're gonna see a NK/SK type demiliterized zone without a true peace agreement, for maybe the rest of my life. Russia committed too many atrocities for Ukraine to play nice, and we are never going to be going to Moscow and forcing Russia to purge it's Fascism from it's system, make it's leaders actually face justice.

It would depend on the Ukranian counteroffensive. If Ukraine can push to Melitopol the war is over in 1 year or 2. The Russian army would be split in 2 and be forced into a horrible catch 22 when they have to choose between defending Luhansk and Crimea and cant do both and ultimately neither. A scenario in which Crimea falls but Russia just keeps business as usual is near fantasy but assuming it did, it would depend on how much of Luhansk is left to take. 

The absolute realistic worst case scenario is the Ukranian counteroffensives failing and the war turning into a war of economies where both sides keep fighting at a snail pace until the other side just cant keep fighting due economy, a war of attrition. If this happen the war can last for decades, but most likely some 10ish years until Putin dies.

Realistically western support is going to appropriately ramp up as Ukraine becomes stronger and Russia weaker which will boost Ukraine's chance to do successful counteroffensives.

There is just no fucking way it was going to end well for them even if the invasion had succeeded.

Building new nuclear reactors would have changed very little in regards of reliance on natural gas. (Also it would probably caused a major political crisis in Germany, because a large part of the population rejects nuclear power for several good reasons.)

All the other European countries, that haven't changed their usage of nuclear power, remained just as dependent on Russian natural gas as Germany.

(Edit: Also, it seems to be a little known or often ignored fact, that a very large part of the fuel for nuclear reactors all over the world was bought from Russia, helping it finance its military buildup.)

&#x200B;

Second: It's hard to predict the effect of sanctions in advance. Generally, you want to apply sanctions in steps, with room for escalation and easing.

It's also a misconception, that the sanctions from 2014 were so weak, that they did nothing at all. For example, they heavily impacted the ability of Russia to build and maintain modern weapon systems, which certainly contributed to the weak performance of Russia's army when they invaded. It also crippled Russia's exploitation of new gas fields and other strategic parts of their industry.

But all that wasn't enough to convince Russia to change its course. I doubt, just more and stronger sanctions would have helped to make Russia completely change its goals and methods. It didn't work on Iran or Noth Korea etc. even after decades of sanctions.

Russia's main goal was and still is to conquer and annex or control (as puppet states) all territories, that historically were part of the old Russian Empire. The West could have done nothing to change this goal.

Maybe allowing Ukraine into NATO would have been an effective deterrent. But Ukraine wasn't a very stable country in the past (sometimes a pro-Russian president was elected), and most NATO members wouldn't have allowed a new member with an ongoing territorial dispute into the alliance. (Hopefully, after Ukraine has won this war and regained its territories, it can join NATO as fast as possible.)

Another way may have been complete preventive surrender of Ukraine. If Ukraine's government had given up its independence without a fight and would have accepted to be ruled by Russia against the will of its people (possibly causing a civil war), that may have prevented this invasion. But for the rest of the world it would have only bought some time, until Russia would have attacked its next target on the list.",1685260014.0,1685259013.0,t3_13tqvbl,t1_jlwyq6v,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

Both he and Lavrov are trusted advisors to Putin; and next to Chubais, the three of them had *extensive* personal and professional ties globally. Even as President, Medvedev was routinely the ""guest"" of various associations, lobbies and business across the globe; he was seen as the level-headed one capable of orchestrating influence within the inner-circle in the Kremlin (along with Lavrov). Pre-2014 and annexation of Crimea, Medvedev was largely seen as the engine behind many of the reforms sought to improve the Russian economy and draw FDI. While Lavrov was working to build a PR machine, Medvedev was working on tangible change. Putin allowed him the latitude to drive the economic engine. 

After the annexation the wheels fell off. By now, he's lost his influence abroad. His sources of money are drying up; his connections, influence and control are waning. He's on the losing side of a PR battle and probably on the losing side of an actual war. He's threatened nuclear war so often that he's no longer seen as a viable alternative to Putin (which is exactly what Putin wants/needs). But don't forget, he's younger than Putin by about 13 years. Most of the inner circle or the ""Kremlin Kids"" were living abroad (London and New York primarily) and foreign educated. They've all had to return to Moscow, and have lost a lot. 

Someone like Medvedev could turn on Putin. When people are cornered, they're dangerous. This war has cornered Medvedev in a way that no one since the Stalinist regime has experienced.

Yes and no. Certain types of energy production work better with existing infrastructure than others. Nuclear power and natural gas are about as different as it could be, regarding the infrastructure they need to provide certain features.

In Germany, natural gas is primarily used for certain processes in the industry, for district heating and highly dynamic power production. To replace it with nuclear power, this infrasture have to be completely changed. District heating replaced with heat pumps, completely new industrial processes have to be invented and implemented, large energy storages must be build to compensate the lost dynamic etc.

Coal would be a somewhat better replacement for gas, at least for the dynamic load needs. But that is not the way Germany is going. Germany hasn't build a new coal power plant for decades, the percentage of coal in power production is continuously going down (faster than nuclear) and the shut down of some (strategic reserve) coal plants was only delayed by some more months because of the gas problematic regarding to Russia.

Luckily for us all, Germany was already well on its way, to not only replace nuclear power but also natural gas (and coal) with renewable energy. The necessary changes in infrastructure are going on for decades.

Change the course again and switching back to nuclear power would require extreme changes in this new infrastructure and bring a lot of costs and new problems.

Renewable energy is the future Germany has chosen. Nuclear power would be an unnecessary detour.

All this is very off topic, but maybe there is some connection. I really wounder what's behind all this critic and sometimes hate Germany gets for its exit from nuclear power. Fist it was about climate change. That makes at least a bit of sense, but not really, if you realize that renewable power is a much better alternative for this purpose. But now its suddenly also about Russia? Despite the fact that Russia is also heavily involved in the nuclear business? It was bad to buy natural gas from Russia but buying uranium is ok?

Fair, but it does point out that Russia is blowing through its ammunition far quicker than it is producing it. And it’s not using its infantry particularly efficiently, although the more professional troops are being held back. 

As for a mobilisation… sure. Russia could find a million bodies to send. The problem isn’t numbers though. It’s ability. 

And it’s not my presumption that Russia has taken a long time to adapt—that’s in the article. And taking a long time to adapt, combined with materiel losses in the first year of the war means you’re way behind the eight-ball when you finally stamp on the bugs.",False,1685346974.0,t3_13tqvbl,t1_jm1m6xh,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

>*Avril Haines, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, wanted to test the theory. She called a Deputies’ Meeting of the National Security Council to play a war game to see whether Russia’s new strategy might thwart America’s ability to project power in the region. (The participants included deputy and undersecretaries, as well as second-tiered officers on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.)*

>*The game’s scenario: Russia invades one of the Baltic countries; NATO fights back effectively; Russia fires a low-yield nuclear weapon at the NATO troops or at a base in Germany where drones, combat planes, and smart bombs are deployed. The question: What do U.S. decision makers do now? (I describe this game, in greater detail, in my 2020 book, The Bomb.)*

>*...A few hours of discussion ensued about Kahl’s political calculus, the conventional strength of NATO, the uncertainty of where to fire a nuclear weapon anyway, and the additional uncertainty of whether a nuclear response would end the war any sooner or more successfully. A consensus emerged:* **The U.S. should respond just with stepped-up conventional military operations.**

And more recently, the guy who'd actually make the decision said, “You think I would tell you if I knew exactly what it would be? Of course, I’m not gonna tell you. It will be consequential. [The Russians] will become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.”

There would be a response - an escalation of the West's involvement in the war.  That wouldn't be good for Russia and they know it.",False,1685344607.0,t3_13tqvbl,t1_jm1ib72,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Not if they continue to adapt. This is a long war now. Putin even said last year it will be a very long war. It's a war of attrition. Russia can hold out a lot longer than Ukraine. And CIA Director William Burns, who served in Russia since 1995, including as US Ambassador, said Russia wants dysfunction in Ukraine and that Putin knows Americans have short attention spans.",1685348329.0,1685347722.0,t3_13tqvbl,t1_jm1nlgz,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

But you're talking about a Nato country being attacked, though. That would be considered an existential risk.

Ukraine is not a Nato country.

Americans will surely not tolerate risking a nuclear war for non-Nato Ukraine if Russia uses a tactical nuke on them. Ukraine is not worth risking nuclear armageddon for Americans. Imagine the media response.",False,1685344971.0,t3_13tqvbl,t1_jm1knbr,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
