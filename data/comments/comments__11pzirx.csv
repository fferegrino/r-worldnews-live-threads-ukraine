The International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to seek arrest warrants against Russians over the war Ukraine ""in the short term,"" a source has told Reuters.

The prosecutor of the ICC is expected to ask a pre-trial judge to approve issuing warrants against several Russians for the abduction of children from Ukraine and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, the source said.

The reports come after the New York Times reported that the ICC intends to open two war crimes cases tied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

For context: A team from the ICC in The Hague left for Ukraine to start investigating possible war crimes last year.

Hours before their departure, prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC and Moscow does not recognise the court.

The ICC has 123 members and prosecutes individuals responsible for the worst atrocities when a country is unable or unwilling to do so.

>  
>The cases represent the first international charges to be brought forward since the start of the conflict and come after months of work by special investigation teams. They allege that Russia abducted Ukrainian children and teenagers and sent them to Russian re-education camps, and that the Kremlin deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure.  
>  
>The chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, must first present his charges to a panel of pretrial judges who will decide whether the legal standards have been met for issuing arrest warrants, or whether investigators need more evidence.  
>  
>It was not clear whom the court planned to charge in each case. Asked to confirm the requests for arrest warrants, the prosecutor’s office said, “We do not publicly discuss specifics related to ongoing investigations.”  
>  
>Some outside diplomats and experts said it was possible that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could be charged, as the court does not recognize immunity for a head of state in cases involving war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.Still, the likelihood of a trial remains slim, experts say, as the court cannot hear cases in absentia and Russia is unlikely to surrender its own officials.  
>  
>The Kremlin has denied accusations of war crimes, but international and Ukrainian investigators have gathered powerful evidence of an array of atrocities since the invasion’s early days.  
>  
>The first case, the briefed officials said, deals with the widely reported abduction of Ukrainian children, ranging from toddlers to teenagers. As part of a Kremlin-sponsored program, they were taken from Ukraine and placed in homes to become Russian citizens or sent to summer camps to be re-educated, The New York Times and researchers have found. Some came from orphanages or group homes.  
>  
>Moscow has made no secret of its program, presenting it as a humanitarian mission to protect orphaned or abandoned Ukrainian children from the war.  
>  
>Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, the program’s public face, began sending children to Russia within weeks after the invasion began in February 2022 and has regularly appeared on television to promote adoptions. Mr. Putin signed a decree last May to speed up access to Russian citizenship for Ukrainians.  
>  
>Mr. Khan, the prosecutor, has publicly signaled his intentions to pursue this case, saying that illegal transfers of children to Russia or to occupied parts of Ukraine were a priority for his investigators.  
>  
>Earlier this month, he visited a children’s home in southern Ukraine, now vacated, and his office posted a photograph of him standing among empty cots. “Children cannot be treated as the spoils of war,” he said in a statement following his visit.  
>  
>A report published in February by Yale University and the Conflict Observatory program of the U.S. State Department said that at least 6,000 children from Ukraine were being held in a total of 43 camps in Russia, with the actual number thought to be higher. The National Information Bureau of the Ukrainian government said that as of early March it could be more than 16,000.

This will hopefully show why encirclement of Bakhmut is so incredibly hard for the Russians to achieve and an even more difficult prospect than the Eastern side of Bakhmut which has taken them 9 months to finally get a foothold in.  It can also tell you why Bakhmut is so important beyond bleeding the Russians. 

Chasiv Yar sits on top of a huge hill, giving artillery on top of the hills numerous advantages (lines of sight, range, less mud on the higher ground making it easier to shoot and scoot, easier concealment, etc. etc.) the sides of the hills are covered in lovely forest perfect for hiding armour, AA and arty in.  Ukrainians have repeatedly shown themselves to be better in woodland warfare than the Russians. 

All the low ground  between the towns is in sniper range to snipers on top of the hills at Chasiv Yar. The distance between the outskirts of Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar is less than 4kms.  

The 00506 road travels mainly on the high spine of one of the hills, dropping down steeply at Khromove to cross the river with the train line.  This is the one real point of weakness on this road  and will make Russia have to take Khromove if they have any chance of encircling Bakhmut. (The bridge has been restored since it's destruction at the start of March)   if they do attempt to take Khromove they are in a killing bowl at the bottom of a really steep slope.  Their lines of supply will all be along the low ground from the direction of Yahidne.  Good luck with that. 

So basically in order to encircle Bakhmut they also need to encircle Chasiv Yar, and ladies and gents......  that just isn't happening.  If you think the poor mobiks have been having a hard time pushing forward across flat fields imagine what going up an 100m  high hill is going to do to them with enfiladed fire (the hills are close together falling down to steep valleys. You'll nearly always have someone able to sight you.)

Can they establish fire control over the roads? Yes, probably, but they still need to be able to sight it for this to be more useful than random artillery spamming and the 00506 is not going to be easy for them to do that on (The T0504 is more open for this unfortunately) .  

Why is Bakhmut so important beyond just bleeding the Russians? It comes down to topography and artillery.  This is an artillery war and everything since the initial pushes towards Kyiv were defeated have been based around it all the way down to informational opsec (photos of liberated towns not being released until 10 kms or more behind the front lines etc) .  If Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar are abandoned the Russians gain the high ground.  This is a range of hills that run at a height of around 300 meters from Kurdyumivka in the South to Slovyansk in the North.  Kramatorsk and Slovyansk are both overlooked by the North end of this range of hills around 10kms North of Chasiv Yar. 

Kramatorsk and Slovyansk and surrounding conurbations had a prewar population of over300k.  If Ukraine retreat from Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar they allow Russian artillery to have full artillery control over these two population centers and logistics hubs. We have all seen by now what happens when Russian artillery gets in range of towns.  

Ukraine won't be leaving Bakhmut, and Chasiv Yar's strengths and proximity mean they won't have too. It is a very hard fight but it is a very important one. Don't believe the masses and masses of Russian propaganda trying to frame this as the Ukrainian leadership leaving soldiers to die for no good reason.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 13 March 2023  


* In recent weeks, Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin has likely lost access to recruiting in Russian prisons due to his ongoing disputes with the Russian MoD leadership. Prigozhin is highly likely pivoting recruitment efforts towards free Russian citizens.  

* Since the start of March 2023, Wagner has set up outreach teams based in sports centres in at least 40 locations across Russia.  

* In recent days, masked Wagner recruiters also gave career talks in Moscow high schools, distributing questionnaires entitled ‘application of a young warrior’ to collect the contact details of interested pupils.  

* About half of the prisoners Wagner has already deployed in Ukraine have likely become casualties and the new initiatives are unlikely to make up for the loss of the convict recruit pipeline.  

* If the ban endures, Prigozhin will likely be forced to reduce the scale or intensity of Wagner operations in Ukraine.

Canadians are training Ukrainian soldiers on Leopard 2 tanks in Poland

A former top soldier in the United States says he expects that Western countries will eventually furnish Ukraine with fighter jets, fulfilling one of the embattled country's most urgent requests.

""I think the F-16s will be provided, it's hard to know exactly when but I think they're coming,"" said Mike Mullen, a retired admiral and former chair of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, in an interview airing Sunday on Rosemary Barton Live.

Mullen told guest host David Common that shipments of fighter jets to Ukraine could make a ""significant difference"" on the battlefield, and that Ukraine's top area of vulnerability was air defence. In recent days Russia has renewed a barrage of missile attacks against Ukrainian cities.


The attacks have ""one goal in mind, to destroy life and leave nothing of humanity,"" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week.

Will the West provide its F-16 jets to Ukraine?

Rosemary Barton Live speaks with retired admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the latest on the war in Ukraine, when Ukraine might be provided with the fighter jets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pushing for, and how this artillery boost might play out on the battlefield.
Two Ukrainian pilots are currently in the United States training on F-16 flight simulators, U.S. media reported last week.

Mullen gave credit to American leadership and other countries in the West for bolstering Ukraine's ground-based defences, with artillery and new tanks — including the Leopard 2 main battle tanks provided by Canada. He said Ukraine had the potential to have a ""devastating effect on any kind of ground attack that the Russians bring forward.""

The war in Ukraine has been stuck in a grinding stalemate over the winter, but Western countries are working to once more fortify Ukraine with weapons and munitions ahead of an expected Russian offensive in the spring.

Bakhmut battle allowing Ukraine to target key Russian forces, Zelenskyy aide says
Twenty-five Canadian soldiers are currently in western Poland training Ukrainian soldiers to use the advanced tanks, as part of Operation UNIFIER, Canada's mission to train Ukrainian military members. That mission is part of the broader Canadian effort to support Ukraine, which includes over $1 billion in military aid.

Lt.-Col. Chris Boileau, the current task force commander of Operation UNIFIER, said in an interview Sunday on Rosemary Barton Live that the first cadre of Ukrainian soldiers had just graduated from the training and returned to the front lines.

Leopards 'night and day' with Ukrainian tanks


Boileau noted that the biggest challenge in training the Ukrainian tankers was the difference between older Soviet technology and the newer Leopard 2s.

""Top speed, their firepower, armour package and overall capabilities are, to put it mildly, night and day,"" Boileau told Common.

""So being able to take an even experienced tanker and then move them into more complex and in-depth technology is a challenge,"" he said.

Boileau noted that Operation UNIFIER had increased in size dramatically since his time in command, with the training force doubled in roughly the past six months. He also said that the ""education has been occurring in both ways"" as Canadians imparted some skills in urban warfare, but also learned from the experience of their Ukrainian counterparts.

For example, Boileau said, Canadians were hearing about what it was like to operate with a ""pervasive drone threat,"" something with which Canada does not have experience.

Rosemary Barton Live speaks with Lt.-Col. Chris Boileau, task force commander of Operation Unifier, about the Canadian Armed Forces training Ukrainian troops in Poland to operate Leopard 2 tanks in preparation for a spring counteroffensive.
Efforts to maintain pro-Ukraine unity

There are some concerns that resolve in Western countries may be weakening, with elements of some opposition parties, including Republican representatives in the United States, calling for an end to aid to Ukraine.


U.S. President Joe Biden recently travelled to Ukraine and Poland to reaffirm his administration's support, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen took a similar tour of North America this week, including an address to Parliament in the House of Commons.

In Canada, Green co-leader Jonathan Pedneault walked back some recent comments around the idea that Ukraine might use weapons from the West to push beyond its own borders.

He notes that the current state of the war, positional battles and such, is not likely to continue through spring and Summer in light of Ukraines upcoming offensives.

Russias Winter offensive has been lackluster and it's forces are in no condition to press any further significant offensives.

Bakhmut is likely not a favourable battle for Ukraine as things stand. The casualty ratio likely favours Ukraine, but not by much.


The Wagner human wave conception is not quite true. Wagner also has elite assault detachments, which are causing the most damage by capitalising on the exhaution caused by the constant low value human wave attacks. They attack day and night.


The UAF has a problem with military culture. Especially since so many old soviet trained officers have returned to service. Command and control/ flexibility isn't as Western style as it appears and they have lost a lot of those NATO trained between 2014-2022.


Back to Bakhmut; it was an advantageous fight up to a point but it has reached the stage of diminishing returns as a strategy, particularly following the loss of Soledar.

Bakhmut is a political objective, and in terms of military practicality, losing it wouldn't matter much. Ukraine has favourable high ground positions to fall back to.


Russia's choice to go on the offensive and expend manpower and supplies has set Ukraine up well for its offensives. But predicting how successful it will be is difficult.

More artillery ammo and air defenses are more important than Western tanks and jets.

This spring/ summer is likely to be the decisive phase of the war. F16's etc. will have no impact on this. Whether approved or not.

Even a resounding Ukrainian success doesn't mean the war is over. It's often up to the loser to decide when a war ends and Putin can drag this out for years even if Crimea is lost.

RU is likely to have another wave of mobilization later this year.

The threat of nuclear weapons remains low, but not 0. A catastrophic collapse of the RU forces could cause the politicians, under pressure of time and potential regime collapse, to order tactical nuclear strikes.",1678745773.0,1678741298.0,t3_11pzirx,t3_11pzirx,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

>As the world remains rightly focused on Vladimir Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine, the Russian leader continues to advance his destabilizing, antidemocratic agenda in other places in the world.

>  
>...  
>  
>But there was one foreign leader who detested Saakashvili: Vladimir Putin. A successful Georgian democracy on his southern flank was anathema to everything Putin stood for, and he was determined to block Saakashvili’s determination to anchor Georgia in the West. The Russian president particularly disliked his pronouncements about Georgia’s aspirations to join NATO. Putin feared the color revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine precisely because they threatened the legitimacy and stability of his autocracy in Russia. In August 2008, Putin showed his hand by invading Georgia. He followed by recognizing two regions of the country as independent states, thereby freezing any discussions in Brussels about Georgia’s NATO membership.  
>  
>As Russian tanks rolled toward the Georgia capital of Tbilisi, some urged Saakashvili to flee. Like President Volodymyr Zelensky last year in Ukraine, Saakashvili chose to stay. Putin ultimately decided not to try to arrest or kill Saakashvili or to overthrow the Georgia government through military force, but the Russian leader remained focused on undermining the Georgian president. (Today, Russia still occupies one-fifth of the country’s territory.)

>Putin and his proxies soon figured out how to use democratic institutions to bring Russian loyalists to power, orchestrated by Putin’s main surrogate in Georgia, the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili (who made his fortune in Russia, not Georgia). Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream party has succeeded in eroding the power and independence of political parties, civil society and the press, dramatically weakening the country’s democracy. Last year, the European Union officially declared Ukraine and Moldova as candidates for membership — but not Georgia. Nothing could have better dramatized Georgia’s diminished status.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is making personnel changes in his ministry.  Translated into English:

>*Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has made his first important personnel decision.  According to SPIEGEL information, Inspector General Zorn has to vacate his post.  The ""Corona General"" Carsten Breuer is to be his successor.*
>#
>Defense Minister Boris Pistorius begins restructuring his ministry.  According to SPIEGEL information, the SPD minister has decided that the Bundeswehr will get Carsten Breue as new inspector general. The previous general inspector Eberhard Zorn, meanwhile, will be placed on temporary retirement.  Other media are also reporting on the change.
>#
>In addition, Pistorius installed his close confidante Nils Hilmer as State Secretary in the Bendler Block.  The previous state secretary Margaretha Sudhof has to vacate her post for Hilmer, the administrative lawyer had come to the defense department with ex-minister Christine Lambrecht.
>#
>With the decision, Pistorius is fundamentally reorganizing the leadership of the Bundeswehr.  The inspector general not only functions as the highest-ranking soldier in the force, he also holds an important position in the ministry that is similar to that of a state secretary.  At the same time, the Inspector General is the Federal Chancellor's top military adviser.  Pistorius informed both Zorn and Sudhoff personally about the decision on Monday.  Officially, however, his ministry has not yet confirmed the personal details.
>#
>##New task for ""General Corona""
>#
>Breuer, 59, had been a candidate for the post of inspector general for months.  The three-star general currently serves as Chef des Territorialen Führungskommandos (head of the Territorial Command) of the Bundeswehr.  Breuer became known last year when Olaf Scholz brought him to the Chancellery during the corona pandemic to manage the vaccination campaign.  Since then, Breuer has been one of the Bundeswehr officers who repeatedly appears in the media as ""General Corona"".
>#
>From the ministry it was said that both Breuer and Hilmer were suitable for the management posts due to their outstanding performance in large and important events.  During the refugee crisis, Hilmer had headed the central department for Pistorius, who was then Minister of the Interior in Lower Saxony.  Breuer, in turn, showed during the Covid pandemic that he was able to control huge and complex departments even in stressful situations.  Since his time in the Chancellery, Breuer had also built close ties to politics.
>#
>Zorn, 62, had been inspector general since April 2018, having been appointed by Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen.  It was not yet clear on Monday when he would give up his duties.  However, according to Bundeswehr circles, the new ""GI"" will probably take up his official duties as soon as possible.
>#
>Zorn is said to be receiving his release certificate as early as Thursday, before that he is on a visit to the troops in Estonia with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

For me it [feels](https://twitter.com/tarasmi/status/1635163682706722816) like another Russian rezet 2.0 is in the works. Sanctions are way too careful, and US goes out of their way to portray this war as if only Putin is to blame. Which is a lie. This war is possible because o Russians, and their imperial ambitions, and desire for ""greatness"".  They do not show in US what the real russians are like. They do not show how they gloat whey missiles are launched, how they celebrate war crimes, how they praise their genocidal war of conquest. There is almost no cover on this. Only few channels in the internet try to show what russians are truly like, while entire western media machine almost tries to paint russians like they are “victims”. 

I suspect this is done intentionally to leave a way for fast removal of sanctions against Russia, and ""restoring"" relationship just like it was after Georgia or Crimea.

We know attacking during the mud season aint no walk in the park. Most of us (including myself) have a hard time envisioning a bigger UKR offensive push until the drier months. 

BUT… it’s not totally unheard of either. At least in a more limited scale.

What if, and this is a big what if, UKR is so confident in their new Offensive Guard (quality of troops and new toys) that they plan to smash the RUS around Bakhmut almost head-on? 
The mud season obviously makes long territorial pushes very difficult, but (I guess) it also makes evacuating/pulling back over longer distances equally hard for the RUS army? 

Might it be that the UKR armed forces are preparing to smash the russians right there in the mud where they are stood around Bakhmut, without the russians being able to pull out/escape easily, as a first move / preparation for more offensive operations later in the spring? 

As I’ve understood, theres a lot of «higher quality» (sic) army units in that area, as well as the Wagner Bunch. 

On other parts of the front the «good» (sic, again) russian units seem to smash themselves well enough to pieces doing idiot attacks on very good Ukrainian strongpoints, so might it be that a *very* violent, fast and (arguably, with the fresh units) combined arms tech-superior attack straight in the kisser around Bakhmut would be a good play for the UKR armed forces in regards to newtering a good part of the more capable enemy forces?

I believe they are planning to do it when the weather gets better but the amount of troops they are going to send to the front is at a number that they have to start the buildup now. It is just going to take Ukraine time to move all of the troops towards the front.

Look at how Ukraine mentioned that they are almost done forming a 28k man volunteer assault brigade that will be training for 2-4 months before they are used in battle. I believe those will be replacements for the coming offensive. We know that the west has been training a lot of Ukraine soldiers and last year Zelensky has stated that none of the newly trained soldiers are being sent to the front. They are all in the north doing border patrol, building trenches and training. The UK alone trained 10 thousand. That was 10 thousand last year, they have had nearly enough time to train the second group and a 3rd is going after that. UK said they plan to train 20k in 2023. France, the US, Germany, Poland... Everyone is training them and they have not been sent to the front.

I believe that Ukraine has built up a very large force that isn't involved in the war currently but they are being moved towards the front now but the numbers take time to move. If what Zelensky claimed last year is true and none of these soldiers are being used then imagine how long it would take to move just the 10k that the UK trained. The first group of those trained on Bradleys and Leopards will be done soon, maybe by next month. They might be expecting that it would take them a month or so to get everyone to the front that is going to take part in this. Especially since they have to get all of the logistics in place to feed and supply this group.

He used the argument that the Ukrainians also had to wait a siginificant amount of time before launching the Kharkiv counter offensive too, and that is true, i mean the loss of Severodonetsk happened in late July of last year, and the Kherson and Kharkiv counter offensive would take place a couple of months later. But one of the reasons it took that long was that Ukraine was still waiting equipment to arrived from the west. One of those pieces of equipment were the HIMARS, that if i'm not mistaken only started arriving in Ukraine around June, and in quite limited numbers still. Another weapon that it took a while for the US to give to Ukraine was the HARM missile, which was another piece of crucial weapon for Ukrainian counter offensives.   


The point is that it wasn't just a lack of training the reason why Ukraine was only able to launch its counter offensives two months after Russia's offensive power had culminated, it was a lack of equipment as well. And while Ukraine still lacks a lot of equipment that it needs to defeat the Russians, the equipment has been arriving faster and in significant quantities in the past few months. I just don't see why given the aid that Ukraine has been receiving a reason why it will take over half a year for Ukraine to launch another major counter offensive. That is unless the losses that they are incurring defending Bakhmut are simply too great to the point where they are actually having to dig into their reserves - those that you would expect would be used for future counter offensives - to hold the Russians in Bakhmut, if that is indeed the case - which some OSINT comentators have suggested in the past few weeks - notably DefMon - then yeah maybe it could take over half a year to train a new force capable of offensive operations.

Day 382: March 12

Last time I told you that one of the main axes of the Ukrainian counterattack was recently revealed by Russians because the concentration of Ukrainian forces in Minkivka and neighboring settlements has substantially increased. I also told you that, in response to this development, Wagners focused more than a third of their forces on this 5 km front line in order to create a buffer zone as fast as possible.

The freshest reports provided by the Ukrainian Spokesman of the Eastern Group of Forces noted that the intensity of fights around Bakhmut increased even more. After establishing control over Dubovo-Vasykivka, Russian forces struggled to move directly to Orihkovo-Vasylivka because of a natural barrier in the form of another hill. Russian forces shifted their fire on the Ukrainian strongpoint near the highway, and after they breached it, they could approach Ukrainian positions on this hill along the tree lines. Such a development exposed Ukrainian positions in Orikhovo-Vasylivka, and, according to Russian sources, Ukrainians had to retreat from 2 checkpoints inside the village out of 4 due to the overwhelming crossfire. The main goal of the Russians is to get to Minkivka, exactly where Ukrainians have their forces concentrations. The idea here is to start attacking them before they launch a counterattack – this way, Ukrainians will get entangled in positional fights, which will complicate offensive actions significantly.

The second thing that Wagners are doing is trying to breach the most fortified area inside Bakhmut – the AZOM industrial area. Some sources reported that Wagners have already entered the northern part of the industrial area, however, reports with recently made geolocated footage only confirmed that Russians maintain positions no closer than 800 meters from this complex. The main idea of attacking the most formidable defenses is that if Wagners somehow manage to breach it, then Bakhmut will fall very rapidly, and there would be no point in making this massive counterattack. 

But such a risky and aggressive approach comes at a great cost. Since Wagner forces launched this highly attritional westward expansion, Russian losses have spiked once again, and if last week Russians were losing approximately 600 soldiers, then over the last 3 days Russians are losing almost twice as many soldiers. 

Russian sources report that Wagner's advances are constrained by artillery and mortar strikes as well as airstrikes. Because Wagners are advancing along the very narrow line to the north of Bakhmut, Ukrainians are engaging their artillery units not only from Kostiantynivka but also Siversk. Ukrainian mortar units are shelling Russians from safe positions behind the canal in Novomarkove. Advancement along such a narrow line also means that Russians are getting too far from their air defense, which makes them vulnerable to airstrikes. Yesterday it was confirmed that Ukrainians are freely engaging up to 6 fighter jets to bomb Russian strong points. Today it was also reported that 3 helicopter gunships are operating at low altitudes for the long-running battle for Bakhmut. With that in mind, the spike in Russian losses is not surprising. 

In order to compensate for such levels of losses, the Head of the Wagner Group, Prigozhin, doubled down on expanding recruitment efforts in Russia. At first, they were opening recruitment centers at sports clubs, but lately, Wagner Group has also started focusing on youth. Wagner Group has recently opened six recruitment centers in schools. Russian Ministry of Education in Apatity included Wagner personnel at a career guidance lesson to tell “heroic stories” and promote the service in the Wagner Group. The Wagner Group likely aims to recruit more impressionable recruits through these youth-focused campaigns and instill in them Prigozhin’s extreme ideology. Some Russian officials are even advertising contract service in unusual places, for example, it was recently revealed that a Moscow-based psychiatrist is calling on suicidal men to join army and die for a good cause.",False,1678687659.0,t3_11pzirx,t1_jc0xhfj,,2,38,0,38,0,0,

Wagner forces are pushing West (north of Bakhmut) in order to tie up these fresh Ukrainian formations and interdict the offensive.

This western push comes at great attritional cost. Ukraine are able to use air power as Wagner are operating outside their air defense umbrella.

The 'political decision' to hold Bakhmut may not actually be a political decision at all. For example, Russia is overinvested in taking Bakhmut, so may do increasingly riskier things to try and achieve success. Thus it could be easier to capitalise on that.

I find it hard to believe that after 12 months of letting his military call the shots that President Zelenskyy would suddenly change his approach.

The emergence of the EU and Europe being militarily united in NATO is a new thing and not the reason why CH is allowed to be neutral.

First of all, neither Kadyrov or Prigozhin has a snowballs chance in hell of taking over after Putin. Neither hold anything near the sway over the armed forces nor the Oligarchs, nor the political factions, nor the police or security forces to pull it off. Never going to happend. Anyone who tells you its even a snowballs chance in hell, has no clue about internal Russian politics and affairs. Bad example, not relevant. 

&nbsp;

Second, how do you know things would be ""more democratic under Navalny""? You don't. There's a pretty wide history of him saying things that indicate he wouldnt be. Which is why you shouldnt attempt to try to pick a winner there. Generally I think trying to convince paranoid Russians (Just...believe me. Paranoia is a national hobby there. For good reasons..) that we are not after destroying Russia and installing our puppet there...then presenting them with our prefered choice is a *really* bad idea.

&nbsp;

Third, we do not let Maga's and Tankies influence our thinking. Period. The way we let *Russia* know, is by telling them that ""Russia under Putin remains and will continue to be shite. Do better"". If we try to pick and present an alternative to them, its going to harden their stance that they don't want a change, and they'll most certainly not go for your preferred pick. Thats *basic* human psychology. 

&nbsp;

You're *seriously* going for an argument that we need Navalny to demonstrate that the Putin regime is evil? There's *just* the war and Navalny to accomplish that? Can't think of a single other thing? Really?

Political parties in ukraine tend to be “personalist parties of one person and funded by two oligarchs.” The latter part is of course bad and a problem slowly worked on but the former is more important.

But largely the parties follow their founder through their political life and death, Zelensky has Servant of the People, Poroshenko has European Solidarity, Medvechuk had his “For Life” party, Lyashko has the Radical Party, etc. 

There’s an interesting twist right now that Zelensky himself is very popular, Servant of the People isn’t as much. Not that they have done anything very wrong, just politics has shifted very fast in recent times, the people want military affiliated people in parliament.

How many Javelins have we sent?   I don't know the current number.  Last spring Javelins were ""running out"" when numbers around 7 to 8 thousand had been delivered or promised.  

Some Javelins miss their target though reports suggest that is rare.  Others will be damaged or destroyed by artillery.  Probably not far off from the rate that infantry are wounded or killed.  Missiles also get used on targets like bunkers or utility vehicles.  

Ukraine has to deter Russian forces along about 3000 kilometers and the active war zone is close to 1000 km.  Ukraine has to keep reserves.  Even if Ukraine still has thousands of javelins in stock there would be only a handful within range of any one point.  

Obviously war is a stupid choice and Russia should just go home.  Russia chooses not to exercise that good option.  Next they choose between infantry unsupported by any tank (this happens), infantry supported by T72s and BMPs, and support from T72s, BMPs, plus a few additional T62s.  The extra T62s either sponge the missiles leaving a functional T72 or the T62 survives and provides tank support where there would otherwise be none.

Switzerland exports not only weapons but high precision machine parts etc in general. Those are then also used to build weapons or more advanced military equipment. We also export information technology that is then used in radars for airplanes and so on.

Personally, I have no issue with the idea of selling countries weapons or machine parts for weapons as long as they use them to defend themselves. I don't think this hurts neutrality. We can also hardly control our exports in such a way, that we would be able to prevent our precision industry to partake in the weapon industry.

However, as any rational person I hope, I hate to see Swiss built weapons - or weapons with swiss machine parts - in the hands of Saudis, African Warlords etc.

So how to prevent this? CH tries to prevent this through disallowing re-export into regions of conflict. The idea is that it becomes hard to control who gets our weapons whenever they are sent to regions in conflict.

So it's not really about: ""We don't want Swiss weapons to be used in war"" but more: ""We trust certain countries not to be dickheads, so we allow sending them weapons"".

This idea has flaws and sometimes weapons still end up where they should not - as with all weapon exports of every country, sadly. However, under these restrictions (maybe they could be strenghtened more) I see no wrong in us exporting such material. Weapons can protect people and just because we are neutral does not mean we ought to not participate in the weapon industry the rest of the world is so happily active in.


In this case, Ukraine should absolutely get weapons to allow their defense. However, it could also be taken as breaking neutrality, as they are openly supported by NATO. I think it is dumb by us, not to allow re-export of our weapons, as it will hurt our industry and due to the weapons going to a legitimate, democratic government that is not attacking anyone - so I see no harm to our normal restrictions.

It was Swiss geography and the alps, which stopped Hitler to make it part of Nazi Germany, because an invasion would have been costly, without much strategical gain. Lots of the small countries Hitler invaded and that also tried to maintain a neutral stance, were simply not as lucky. Denmark, the Netherlands, or Belgium, for example.

Generally, as a German, I'm not really fond of the Swiss approach, but let's be honest. All this big rhetoric about neutrality letting evil succeed is kind of overblown given that Switzerland is just a small country nobody really cares about, and that there are less than 10 million Swiss in total.  I'm always eye-rolling at Swiss people who confuse their neutrality with morality, but on the other hand, it's just how their political culture works, and historically and culturally this stance makes sense when you have 4 different communities speaking 4 different languages and one of the most federal systems there is you need to focus on yourself in order to hold it all together.",False,1678712786.0,t3_11pzirx,t1_jc1keym,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

I don't think anyone would argue with the contributions of Swiss scientists for example. But there is no simple equation for right and wrong. 

And in many ways Switzerland has used neutrality as a crutch. 

It's original purpose was to maintain Swiss independence when surrounded by European powers which were vying for colonial domination abroad and territorial expansion in Europe. 

But that very independence has been virtually guaranteed by the post WWII European order. There is no threat to Swiss sovereignty that neutrality is protecting them from anymore.

If anything, not supporting Ukriane in maintaining its borders poses a bigger threat. Russia is literally in combat to destroy the order that Switzerland has benefited from. While it flagrantly spits in the face of the Geneva conventions.

It is time to examine the national myth, reflect on why Switzerland was neutral in the past, and understand that Europe is not the same today. And the very reasons they moved towards that position back then should make them move towards supporting Ukriane right now.

You admit that WWII was not a great look on hindsight, I think the same will be said about not supporting Ukraine here. The quote form that holocaust survivor is apt:

I remember back in the protests after the documentary about Putin's palace and his subsequent arrest in Saint Petersburg. For many of us it wasn't a protest for Navalny's freedom, or to show solidarity. It was more that he was the last and only guy still standing up to the Kremlin, and the only one who could get tens of thousands of people in the streets. Now, the Kremlin has pretty much succeeded in silencing him, not only through prison, but also amplifying this message that he is as bad or worse than Putin. Now there are no anti-Kremlin leaders left. Anyone who comes close to organizing or calling for action disappears. 

I don't say all this to shed tears for Navalny or try to excuse his shitty behavior. But I did believe for a while that he might at least help Russia throw off its oppressors, and give just enough chance for democratic reform.

That's a great argument. As well as the point about neutrality not helping the tormented. Russia breaking international law so blatantly is also why I personally support re-export of CH weapons.
I would argue that Switzerland can still play a role in helping Ukraine without active military support. We can be a place of conversation after Ukraine improved its situation, we already took in refugees (I do think we could take more..), and we do send money and goods helping the population.

For there to be any chance of a brighter future in this country, there needs to be a complete and utter purge - the FSB, the siloviki, the oligarchs. It's not even worth discussing democracy in Russia while any of these elements have any fingers in the pie. 

Anyway, I think Navalny's time has come and gone, really. Like Dugin, he seems to get talked about in the west a lot more than here. 

I hope both Russia and the US will overcome their troubles. You guys more so than us. Russia is already a lost cause for the foreseeable future, but whatever bad stuff the US has done in the past - you guys are really leading the good fight right now.",False,1678742510.0,t3_11pzirx,t1_jc37jl0,,9,3,0,3,0,0,
