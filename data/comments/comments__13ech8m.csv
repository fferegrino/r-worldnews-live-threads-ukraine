Ben Wallace: ""It is not easy to take a British-French missile and incorporate it on a former Soviet-era or Russian aircraft. That has been one of the reasons for the time, working out if it is technically feasible.

""I would like to pay tribute to our scientists and our technicians who have done an amazing job not just with this capability - and actually other scientists across Europe who have managed to produce the integration of western weapons into Russian equipment...

""It took long partly because of the technical feasibility. Taking effectively a 5th or 4th generation weapons system and putting it sometimes onto a 3rd or 2nd generation aircraft is not easy and we will see.

""I am not going to comment on when we expect these to be used but nevertheless they have yet to be tested and we will soon find out, maybe in the next weeks or months - we will find out to the extent that that has worked, but that takes time.""

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 11 May 2023  


* Since the start of 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has ramped up a scheme to recruit Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine. It is likely that up to 10,000 convicts signed up in April 2023 alone.  

* From summer 2022, prisoners were the key pool of recruits for the Wagner Group private military company‚Äôs operations in Ukraine. However, the group highly likely lost access to the Russian penal system in February 2023 when its public feud with the MoD was escalating.  

* The MoD‚Äôs prisoner recruitment campaign is part of a broader, intense effort by the Russian military to bolster its numbers, while attempting to avoid implementing new mandatory mobilisation, which would be very unpopular with the Russian public.

What is happening right now is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù.

Ukraine has been slowly eroding the Russian narrative has been keeping the water running in a certain direction.

Eventually those changes add up, and seemingly suddenly, we‚Äôve reached a point when the water starts running the other way.

Russians have finally started to truly appreciate they are going to lose this war.

Up until now, most Russians haven‚Äôt really thought about what that will mean, they‚Äôve been too distracted by the internal noise of Kremlin intrigue and propaganda.

Now the average Russian soldier, Russian sympathiser, crooked businessman who‚Äôs been supporting Russia, compromised politician, and business oligarch (of any nationality) is starting to think about what‚Äôs going to happen when Russia loses this war, and they are realising it‚Äôs not going to be pretty if you are seen to be on the losing side.

This change of direction will cause a flow on effects that may well be completely devastating to Russia‚Äôs war effort in Ukraine.

The actions of millions of former allies and shills to insulate themselves from Russia‚Äôs fall will now drive the Putin regime into the ground.

Just like a river changing course, it might not happen quickly, but the cumulative power of all these small changes is immense.

This is based on nothing but my gut, but I think we are starting to see exactly this play out today.

Providing Ukraine with the required number of F-16 aircraft requires more financial resources than the U.S. government has currently allocated. This would complicate the supply of air defense capabilities and artillery shells for the needs of the nation's Defense Forces.  
This was stated by Joint Staff Spokesperson Colonel Dave Butler in an interview with RBC-Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.  
""I can talk a little bit about this as an American, not on behalf of the international community. We have allocated a certain amount of resources for Ukraine, and F-16s are very expensive. The Russians have more than 500 fighters. And being able to provide the Ukrainians with the same or at least a competitive number of F-16s would require more resources than our government has allowed us to have at this time,"" Butler said, according to the report published in Ukrainian.  
VIDEO OF THE DAY  
He added that if the U.S. started supplying Ukraine with F-16s, it would be so costly that providing other necessary weapons would not be possible.  
""...Had we started supplying Ukraine with F-16s, it would've been so expensive that we would not be able to provide what Ukraine needs now: Air defenses, Patriots, artillery shells, Abrams on the way, etc. Instead, we would have spent all our resources on the F-16, which is very technically complex, expensive to maintain, and expensive to operate. In fact, it's a balancing act between the two. In this case, probably, not everything can be done (at the same time - ed.),"" Pentagon spokesman said.

These are older western made missiles that are extremely heavy, and need to ""talk"" to the plane holding them.

I've heard some experts say it could take months to years to make these compatible with Soviet aircraft(MIG/SU), and yet Ukraine has already received these and the UK says they are operational.

What am I missing here? Did the process to integrate these happen months ago? Did they find a loophole to get them to work now? Can Soviet aircraft even hold these things? They are extremely heavy.

Will this delay the counteroffensive so Ukraine can utilize these?

What is happening right now is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù.

Ukraine has been slowly eroding the Russian narrative has been keeping the water running in a certain direction.

Eventually those changes add up, and seemingly suddenly, we‚Äôve reached a point when the water starts running the other way.

Russians have finally started to truly appreciate they are going to lose this war.

Up until now, most Russians haven‚Äôt really thought about what that will mean, they‚Äôve been too distracted by the internal noise of Kremlin intrigue and propaganda.

Now the average Russian soldier, Russian sympathiser, crooked businessman who‚Äôs been supporting Russia, compromised politician, and business oligarch (of any nationality) is starting to think about what‚Äôs going to happen when Russia loses this war, and they are realising it‚Äôs not going to be pretty if you are seen to be on the losing side.

This change of direction will cause a flow on effects that may well be completely devastating to Russia‚Äôs war effort in Ukraine.

The actions of millions of former allies and shills to insulate themselves from Russia‚Äôs fall will now drive the Putin regime into the ground.

Just like a river changing course, it might not happen quickly, but the cumulative power of all these small changes is immense.

I doubt it.

Bakhmut is a special case for Russia. They've clearly sent a lot of men to die there. Human groups aren't able to function effectively if lots of people die.

But human psychology is limited to maybe the nearest 500 people around you. Good organization can extend that out to larger groups, but I have my doubts that Russians care much about people outside of their Division (ie: 10,000 grouping).

That is, if you're in 1st Infantry Division and all 10,000 people in your Division look and feel good, your morale  is high. Sure, there might be rumors about 3rd Division getting decimated and/or slaughtered, but that's a world away.

Lets put it this way: when you were in High School, how much do you care about your fellow classmates within your grade? How about your fellow classmates outside of your grade? And finally, what about students from another school?

The further-and-further away people are, even if you're ""on the same team"" (ie: part of the same country or city) means nothing. Your human psychology limits you to caring about smaller groups than what you're talking about.

-------------

If anything, Russian organization is worse than other armies. This means that a soldier in the Russian army cares less about their fellow soldiers more-so than usual.

IE: US Army Divisions may compete against each other so they have stories like ""Remember when we faced 1st Division in that football game?"" and have tangible experience working together, albeit as sports rivals at least. Those kinds of connections are done on purpose to help make the US Army structure caring for each other and supportive.

But what we see in Russia? They barely care about other people within their platoons (ie: group of 50), let alone Division or higher. It takes culture and training to ""care"" about what happens to other people. This does have the side effect that morale won't be as unified as other armies though.",1683860984.0,1683860741.0,t3_13ech8m,t1_jjtr05x,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

9 months later they are still failing to take this small town.  

There is no chance of a Russian victory, that died in the streets of the suburbs of Kyiv last year.  

All that Bakhmut would give them is to prolong or possibly stop their own collapse.  

When they fail to take Bakhmut (I'm in the when not if camp and have been since before Christmas) it will be the absolute zenith of their offense and everything will be rolling back from here (You could argue the zenith was just before they pulled out of Kyiv, or before the Kherson/Kharkiv collapses but I would argue this is the last offensive attempt they are going to make in this occupation and from here on out it will be a case of losing ground only. ) 

As for casualty figures I believe the daily figures are casualty count not death count.  In the early days of the war it did seem to be estimated deaths in these reports and then it switched around March last year to a casualty count including wounded and dead. 

I am pretty certain that 200k Russians IMO have not died in Ukraine yet but close to 200k Russians are not going to be able to be involved in the military anymore.  These figures then tally quite well with Western agencies estimations of deaths that have been released over the last year, which look like about just over 2 wounded to dead ratio. Whilst not as high as the propoganda counts make it seem these are still staggering amounts of dead and wounded. 

 I am not sure if the daily counts include captured POW's or whether these are recorded separately. I suspect it does include them. 

I believe the equipment counts are a more accurate representation but don't always count vehicles that were recovered from the field (Russia are pretty shit at achieving this though TBF)  The Kharkiv rout showed that they had a few stockpiled areas of broken and damaged tanks and vehicles that they had recovered and were looking to restore so 1 tank down on the column does not necessarily mean it is out for good.",False,1683798018.0,t3_13ech8m,t1_jjpvgli,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

Ukraine is likely waiting to see what develop before committing larger forces. 

I still think the main plan is along the Vuhledar - Mariupol axis. Russians expected it but they expected lots of other things too. Their defenses are spread very thin. If Russia diverts reserves to prop up Bakhmut, the drive to Mariupol will be easier. If Russia does not, Ukraine will retake Bakhmut and still drive towards Mariupol.

I don't think this weapon will be as deadly as we hope.  With air defense Ukraine will have to launch the bomb 50-100km front the front line.

They've probably figured out a way for them to drop the missiles pre-programmed with a target and rely on internal guidance after launch, much like the AGM-88 HARMs they were given earlier.   The more challenging thing will be whether they fire the missile below Russian radar coverage, or launch the missile within the safety of Ukrainian SAM coverage, which comes with their own issues.

>Are they likely only going to be used for major targets? I.e. ammo/fuel depots, grounded aircraft, ships, big long bridges going to Crimea?

It will be for any target the Ukrainian deem to be a must-hit.

Russia relies heavily on train-based logistics that were able to bring ammo close to the front where it could be offloaded from railheads and trucked in.

Too few transport vehicles to supply their ammunition plus excellent NATO-derived intelligence and precision long range artillery worked together to choke out Russian supply, leading to Wagner's goblin-CEO to complain about a critical ammunition shortage.

Yes, land is valuable (more vantage points, more flanking areas, less fire upon your supply routes, etc. etc.). But sometimes losing land slows down the enemy's advance (they have to carefully sweep the area after you leave to make sure they aren't ambushed).

Your goal is to fight harshly, but doing your best to save your soldier's lives. You need to evaluate the ""hopeless positions"", and save those soldiers constantly as the frontline shifts. You need to fight long enough for those evaluations to be made, but still retreat quickly enough to make sure that not too many people are dying in any hopeless situation.

It's more than possible, it's probable.

Bakhmut is of no great strategic importance to either side.  Russia is continuing to fight there primarily because it's as close as they can find to ""doing well"" in the war.  Ukraine is continuing to fight because the defender has a significant advantage in a *1917* WWI style trench warfare.

I wouldn't go so far as to describe their plans with as much detail as *""a pincer counter attack leaves large numbers surrounded and isolated in the city""* or anything like that.  I don't think anyone but the Ukrainians know where, if anywhere, they intend to counterattack.  Even they might not know (yet).

They might be holding off on that decision based upon what the current probing attacks reveal about Russian forces.  There are limits to what NATO intelligence can tell you about the Russian troops.  10,000 troops means a lot more if it's 10,000 Spetznaz and Airbornes or if it's 10,000 fresh conscripts, half of which came out of a prison, and the satellite can't tell the difference.",1683854762.0,1683834272.0,t3_13ech8m,t1_jjs38zy,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

They've been defending with a relatively modest force and fighting until losses become too significant, and withdrawing to better defensive lines to then increase Russia's relative losses and deplete their momentum. Once the Russian offensive ran out of steam, Ukraine has freshly trained and equipped reserves that should have a far easier time retaking that ground with fewer losses than if they attempted to defend it outright from the outset.

This is also likely being done fairly economically in terms for forces committed by Ukraine. Bakhmut isn't a great spot for their actual offensive, so any offensive here will clearly be limited in scale, but it does hold significant propaganda value. Considering the outsized commitment Russia has made to its capture, absorbing the momentum while minimizing losses and weakening the attacker, to then retake the territory would be a pretty major blow to remaining Russian prestige.

Earlier this year a diplomat from a southern nation said they all knew they were selling their children's future to China, but they had no choice. They need the Chinese Belt and Road investments and projects as well as cheaper grain and artificial fertilisers. The latter two Russia and China are exploiting by weaponising the grain exports from Ukraine and by trying to keep the fossil fuel prices high to make artificial fertiliser prohibitively expensive and pricing them out of the market.  

The message put simply is support Russia and China or starve.  

They mean it too. Climate change is already badly affecting the southern nations. One country, I forget which, is having to subsidise the artificial fertilisers for farmers. They just don't have that kind of money to spare from their already tight budgets. That's why they are so dependent on the Chinese Belt and Road scheme.  

The diplomat really was begging for western investors to work with them so they could ditch China. He knows what a stranglehold China has over them and their children's future.  

It's not just building infrastructure and owning businesses. Can you imagine the security implications of having China working on their telecoms infrastructure, or their power grid?  

When the British government announced plans to work with China on rolling out upgraded telecoms infrastructure there was a big outcry here in the UK.

That's all keeping in mind Ukraine continues doing what they're doing, we may start seeing more strikes in the luhansk direction so russia reinforces that or ukraine sweeps south through severondonetsk and cuts off the bahkmut soldiers.

There's also the possiblity of initiating more of these counter attacks in the south combined with maybe a river crossing in kherson (they have multiple foreign bridgelayers) causing a route in that direction.",False,1683817964.0,t3_13ech8m,t1_jjqw2df,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

At the start of the war, there was no threat from precision artillery ordnance, anti-radar weapons or standoff missiles, so the Russians were pretty confident that between piling a thick layer of SAMs across the front line positioned where they needed to be.  Between that and some fighter patrol coverage, they had their air defense needs filled.  

Once HIMARS and precision 155mm artillery rounds came into Ukrainian hands (and then the anti-radiation missiles),  the Russians had to conceal and hide their systems from targeting, and move some of their larger systems deeper behind Russian lines.  That created small gaps in the frontline protection that gave the Ukrainians the chance to make close air support missions a regular thing.  There still wasn't much of a need for much depth in coverage however, as the Ukrainians couldn't strike deep behind enemy lines without some serious balls-to-the-wall flying and raw courage.

Now that JDAMs and the Storm Shadow missiles are in play, Russia has to change once more.  They now have to shift their depleted SAM assets across a deeper area of coverage across the theater to ensure protection against the longer ranged threat as well as the front lines.   The gaps in coverage will only grow, which either have to be filled by (a) flying more fighter aircraft patrols with planes that are continually piling up airframe mileage in an environment where spare parts and maintenance downtime are a growing issue, or (b) prioritizing what will be protected, which is dangerous due to the vast capacity the Ukrainians have to suss out the targets with lower coverage.",False,1683810610.0,t3_13ech8m,t1_jjqcpzx,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

As far as I know most of the supplies getting into Ukraine from Russian trains are coming through Troitske down through Svatove into the front lines. There is another major line going through Luhansk but I believe lines from Russia feed into Luhansk from the north and east. So Starobilsk to the north and east towards the border.

The news I've heard about Belgorod is coming from stories of a lot of equipment traveling through Kharkiv. I don't think it would be logical to go into Russia since the same thing could be achieved inside of Ukraine and far closer to the front line than going through Russia.

Taking Svatove would cut off a lot of the supplies into the front line areas that Russia has been putting most of their attention into but not from the eastern directions. If Ukraine could push as far as Starobilsk it would be cutting off even more to Russia.

So if Ukraine could take Svatove and Starobilsk in Luhansk Oblast then also take Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia Oblast it would cut off a lot of the supplies to Russian controlled areas. Taking Tokmak and hitting the Kerch bridge would cut off the majority of supplies into Crimea and Kherson Oblast. Svatove and Starobilsk would take out a good chunk of the supplies into Bakhmut.

Give the locals near full autonomy.  Full access to international press, provide supply lines for necessary humanitarian aid, withdraw if those supplies cannot be delivered.  Allow residents transport to Kaliningrad or the option to stay at home.  Make it clear that Ukraine has no intention of holding the ground so collaborators need to use caution and maintain anonymity.   

There are many options that require little or no thought towards occupation.  Just blitz in and rip up track.  Classic civil war era track breaking was to use the railroad ties to mak the bon fire.  The iron was laid across the fire to soften it.  A large wrench twists the rail.  

A fancier move would be to steal the tracks, power lines, and electrical equipment.  Obviously the tracks should be moved west where Ukraine can build a European guage track.  However, if you want the non-theft version the rails can be cut up and welded into anti-tank hedgehogs.  

Plowing the roads could be effective.  That requires some heavy equipment and i am not sure if a tank is adequate.  Would be fancy if they could take the concrete and use it to build fortifications on Ukraine's side of the border.  

Raiding can be considered nasty.  It is not nearly as nasty as invading and occupying a city.  We are talking about various options for Ukraine to forcibly recover Donetsk city.  The potential loss of human life as well as property is much higher if Ukraine goes straight in.  If they go straight into Donetsk then that damage is done to Ukraine.

He never said that at all.  

> NATO is an outdated organization that we should withdraw from.

Again, that's not what he said.  You're doing exactly what I said about the OP my reply to you.

He called it outdated, because it doesn't face the realities of what the world is now.  He said that NATO needs to become proactive against terrorist organizations.  

He also said that he would withdraw from NATO if the NATO countries kept up with not meeting their GDP requirements on defense spending.  That he was tired of seeing the United States as Europe's solver of military problems and overseas problems.

Shortly after his comments he began pressing the other leaders of NATO countries to begin the process of meeting the GDP requirements and many have committed to doing so and have started to meet those requirements.

That is not at all what he said.  You can view his remarks [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L07fMoafVh4)  At no point does he say he would stop supporting Ukraine.  At no point does he say Ukraine can't defend themselves.  At no point does he say he will stop sending them weapons.

In that sense, it is kind of like of flying deep into Russian airspace. The only difference is the abundance of short range Russian AA.

This is where US Intelligence shines because US probably knows where a good majority of Russian AA are. So with careful selection of routes deep penetration through gaps in lower altitude coverage is possible.

Ukraine has flown deep penetration missions into Russian controlled airspace on numerous occasions, not with fighter jets because the radar signature is too large, but with helicopters because of the smaller radar signature and lower altitude flying. The smaller radar signature of Storm Shadow will help in that regards.
