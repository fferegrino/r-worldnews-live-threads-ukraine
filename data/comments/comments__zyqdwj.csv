More than 300 days of brutal war against Ukraine have blown up decades of Russia’s carefully cultivated economic relations with the West, while Kremlin efforts to replace those ties with closer cooperation with India and China appear to be faltering.

Putin has always kept his own counsel, relying on a close inner circle while seeming to never fully trust anyone.

Day 310 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a relatively quiet day, there were no missile strikes, but Russians continued to launch a bunch of Shaheds at us throughout the night, and I’m pretty sure all of them were intercepted, there were no confirmed hits by them anywhere. There are also reports that about 40 Shaheds are headed to us from Rostov right now, and they are expected to reach us in half an hour, they just can’t stop using those drones it seems. They also continue to shell towns/villages close to the border every day. Today, sadly, they killed 2 civilians and injured 2 more in a village that is over 20km away from the border in Kharkiv oblast.

Our energy companies announced that despite the yesterday’s missile strike on our energy infrastructure, the energy deficit did not increase, which is pretty amazing considering that 10 energy infrastructure facilities were hit. That means that our air defense did a great job yesterday, the damage that Russians managed to inflict was relatively small, some cities are still recovering, but at the same time Kyiv is back to the regular scheduled blackouts instead of emergency ones, and it had a lot of problems with electricity lately.

Funny thing, yesterday when Russians were firing their missiles at us, one of their main news agencies “Ria Novosti” was posting “news” about Peruvian shamans predicting that the war will end by August of 2023. Ah yes, the “Peruvian shamans” a very reliable source of information and predictions. Do they use those shamans to predict how the war will go and alter their strategy based on their predictions too? 

It’s wild how their main official channels seriously talk about stuff like shamans and astrology, they also love psychics and mediums as well, and it’s not something new either, they were talking about the exact same stuff 15+ years ago, I remember seeing it on TV all the time. It was already weird to see back then, and it’s even weirder now, because now it seems like they truly believe in it, it doesn’t seem like they are doing it for entertainment anymore.

* NATO and Ukraine started planning ""an attack and enslavement of Russians"" in 2014

* The special military operation is a bonafide success because it prevented that attack.

* Russia now has new regions and more new land than Crimea, Slovakia, Croatia, or Denmark!

* Propagandists must remember that Russia is not fighting Ukraine but rather NATO, and must refer to Ukrainians as little as possible

* ""We're not looking for quick victories, and time is on Russias side"". Ukraine has bogged down and NATO support is waning, with increasingly fewer supplies going to Ukraine.

* Propagandists are to reinforce the ""hardening"" of Russians around Putin and back it up with opinion polls.

* Russia is now the leader of the anti-West block that champions a ""fair, democratic, multi-polar world"".

* Putin is giving Europe one last chance to come to their senses, and realize they're mere puppets, and that the only future they have is in ""close cooperation with Russia""",False,1672418647.0,t3_zyqdwj,t3_zyqdwj,,0,105,0,105,0,0,

Eastern Ukraine Update: Donetsk 

Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Avdiivka area as well as in Bakhmut, where the pace of Russian offensive operations may have slowed compared to previous days.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks near Soledar (10km northeast of Bakhmut), Ivanivske (5km west of Bakhmut), and Klishchiivka (7km southwest of Bakhmut).

The General Staff typically names more settlements around Bakhmut as the targets of Russian attacks. This inflection may indicate that the pace of Russian attacks there is slowing, possibly supporting ISW’s forecast that the Russian offensive around Bakhmut may be culminating.

Russian forces also continued ground attacks north of Avdiivka and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on December 30.

Anyone who thinks the Russia will win by the west ""losing interest"" needs to read up on the Military Industrial Complex in the US.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex

As well as the Wolfowitz Doctrine after the initial fall of the Iron Curtain

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfowitz_Doctrine

For the first time since WWII, we have a conflict that is close to unanimous in who ""the good guys"" are, and by supporting them on a path to victory, we crush our ideological and once upon a time equal ""enemy""

This is a wet dream for the States. A bipartisan one. The MIC is more powerful than the elected officials. Don't believe the hype about the Trumps or the Rand Pauls, they just give the illusion that voters have power.

Not to mention, any other country that shares a geographical interest with the Russia (Im Canadian.....arctic shipping lanes) is not going to lose interest either. May not be on the front page of the newspapers, but you can bet our leaders will stay involved till the end.


Putin wanted to rebuild the USSR, we all laughed at him.

Then it was like ""oh shit he's for real?""

NATO was losing its shine, seen by some as a cold war relic, maybe even overkill in this time of peace and globalization. Putin single handedly reminded us all why its necessary. 


In the meantime, sad to say, the trickle of weaponry will continue. The west doesn't want Ukraine to have ""too much"" firepower, just enough to slowly win the grind. The end game for the west is to make the Russia a non factor in the political landscape, another North Korea if you will; or collapse the Kremlin and have rivaling factions (already seeing the beginnings of this) which can be influenced by the West, command power, and then rebuild like Germany or Japan after WWII.

In order to do that, the war has to continue, with the Russia spending all of their resources on a war it can't win.

This will go down as the biggest suicide of a nation in history.

*edit*

Stumbled across this right after this post. For those that aren't familiar with Canadian politics, the government we have in power is as anti war as I was. Our military has been underfunded and ignored for years, and most people were fine with that. We were ""peacekeepers"" after all. Well...

>Another potential explanation is that the VKS are not confident in their capacity to safely deconflict large-scale sorties with the activity of Russian ground-based SAMs operated by the Ground Forces. Friendly-fire incidents by ground-based SAM units have been a problem for Western and Russian air forces alike in multiple conflicts since 1990. Running joint engagement zones in which combat aircraft and SAM systems can engage enemy forces simultaneously in a complex environment without friendly-fire incidents is hard; it requires close inter-service cooperation, excellent communications and regular training to master. So far, Russian forces have shown extremely poor coordination across the board, from basic logistics tasks, to coordination of airborne assaults with ground forces activity and arranging air defence cover for columns on the move. In this context, it might be the case that the decision was made to leave the task of denying the UkrAF the ability to operate to the ground-based SAM systems, with the explicit understanding that this would be instead of large-scale VKS air operations. However, once again, this is not a sufficient explanation in itself, since given the limited fighter and SAM assets available to Ukrainian forces at this stage, the VKS could still have conducted large-scale sorties against key targets at pre-arranged times, during which Russian SAMs could be instructed to hold their fire.",False,1672377778.0,t3_zyqdwj,t1_j27ivg2,,1,34,0,34,0,0,

Its legislative branch consisted of the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK), while the Council of People's Commissars composed the executive.

Most Americans are not going to encounter jobs where a non-English language is a requirement.  Also, most of us will likely never travel to a location where a second language is needed.  There are some areas in the Southwest US where Spanish is common; but, even in those areas, English still tends to be spoken by enough people that someone coming from elsewhere in the US is unlikely to have too much difficulty getting along without speaking Spanish.  And international travel is a fairly large undertaking for most US residents.  With one of the common international destinations, Canada, also being predominantly English speaking.  So, at best, Americans may learn a second language in High School (which is _way_ too late).  And, unless they make a very concerted effort to keep up their fluency, it's gone a few years later.  With no reason or place to practice much, it atrophies.  

Contrast this to residents in many European countries.  Because of the size and reach of the US Economy, it's much more possible for a resident of Europe to encounter an English language requirement for a job (especially in poorer countries).  When traveling, the residents of most European countries have a much shorter distance to go before entering a country with a different language and such international travel is more common.  Schools in many European countries also do a much better job of introducing students to a second language early (you will learn languages better if you become multi-lingual very early).  And those students are more likely to have reasons and opportunities to practice and maintain those non-native languages.  

The whole situation pushes Americans away from multi-lingualism, while also pushing non-native English speakers to learn English.  I do wish we tried harder to introduce children to it; but, I suspect it still wouldn't stick.  Even when immigrants come to the US, they often lose their ancestral language within a couple generations.  It takes effort to keep up and only takes one generation being ""lazy"" about it to lose it.",False,1672412734.0,t3_zyqdwj,t1_j28iqcb,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Putin honored the term limits and even went to the extent of giving Medvedev de jure leadership for a period so he could legally run again. This implies that the word of the law is in effect and respected to a certain extent. I wouldn't call this a mafia state. I'd apply that term more to a country like nazi Germany where the written law had little meaning, the state and party exercised a ton of power extrajudicially and ""illegally"". Hitlers leadership style was also a lot like a crime boss, with the ill defined responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions and purview.

Note that I'm not defending putin or the regime by saying this. Putin is a de facto dictator. And there are certain messy, weird aspects like the number of intelligence agencies and such. But putins style is much more legal. He operates within the law, but its a law largely of his choosing, if that makes sense. Even though putin wields a huge amount of power, he does so within a nominally constitutional Republic, and he does go out of his way to maintain the image that he is a legitimate representative who was freely and fairly elected. 

The point I'm getting at is that i believe the legal, constitutional apparatus is indicative of what would happen if putin died. There are other reasons for believing this. His oligarch backers would want a clear line of succession as well. Without clear legal processes, succession becomes a power struggle or even a civil war. That's not desirable for a group of people who already control the economy tightly. This is why monarchies existed so long historically, succession in a monarchy is generally very clear and straightforward, which prevents the realm falling into civil war whenever the leader died.

First, when I read your comment, I rhetorical question popped into my head: if you're in an active shooting conflict, what are you saving your newest and arguably most functional weapons for? Are you planning on saving those weapons for peacetime?

You might want to hold back a small reserve of your best weapons if you're a country like Russia. Russia might feel the need to credibly threaten NATO countries with cruise missiles, so firing them all off against Ukraine is counterproductive. But other than that, there's no reason not to fire your weapons.

Second, you want to use your newer, more capable, safer, and reliable weapons before you reach for the older ones. This is because when a conflict starts, you have a limited amount of time to hit critical targets before it moves or gets additional defenses. This means that your first sortie or barrage needs to hit and destroy your target.

Third, using newer weapons first limits your casualties. If your weapons are not effective on your first sortie, then sending aircraft again on a second sortie increases the risk of those aircraft being lost forever, not to mention the increases maintenance cost per target serviced, plus the opportunity cost of those aircraft not being able to service other targets.",False,1672401161.0,t3_zyqdwj,t1_j28dmwe,,4,-3,0,-3,0,0,

“The law needs to ensure a competitive media market with clear rules for all, an independent regulator and alignment with EU Audio-Visual Media Services Directive,” the official added. “The Commission will assess the draft voted in the first reading and make further recommendations to Ukraine to ensure its alignment with EU legislation.”

The draft law will now reportedly be considered for a second reading by Ukrainian lawmakers within the next three weeks.”",False,1672418262.0,t3_zyqdwj,t1_j299f8d,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

I was exaggerating to get my point across when I said ""missing by an oblast"", so you can cool it with the pedantry. 

> I saw a few missing by a 100-200m due to aperture of the target and a few hitting something in a radius of around 500m of nearest point of interest, but without any obvious targets around.

The Kh-22 is very inaccurate in a cluttered radar environment when you need to pick out one specific radar return among many. Missing by 200m is functionally the same as missing by 10km- the target is not destroyed and you have to try again.

That's exactly what I'm saying in this thread. You use the weapon that will the necessary effects on target. Your weapon by is very nature is going to be the newest one designed for its task to prevent having to expend more resources than necessary in destroying the target.

In the case of the Kremenchuk mall strike, the Russians wasted at least two missiles on what was believed to be a strike against an industrial park. Now that Russia has wasted two missiles, it has to spend more weapons to try to hit the target. This incurs the additional costs that I've described above.

It is this exact sort of logic that helped drive the US into adopting PGMs during and after Vietnam. Far too many sorties were spent attacking and reattacking the same targets over and over again, such as against the [Thanh Hóa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanh_H%C3%B3a_Bridge#The_final_blow) bridge.",1672435544.0,1672435183.0,t3_zyqdwj,t1_j2a4l8t,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
