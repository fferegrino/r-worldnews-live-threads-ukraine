Day 263 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day with no missile strikes or drones, but we did get plenty of air raid alerts, one of them even started just now, at 10pm. It seems like this one will also be uneventful. Actually it already ended by 10:20pm, before I even finished writing this. It could be that Russians are just shelling some town close to the Russian border, and that’s why an alert was activated.

There doesn’t seem to be many missile strikes happening recently, but some do still happen. Today air defense was active over Zaporizhzhia again, yesterday Russians fired an Iskander at it, and considering that it fell without exploding, it might have been intercepted. When Russians were firing 4-8 Iskanders at Kharkiv every day we never managed to intercept any, so if one was intercepted over Zaporizhzhia then that’s good news. That might mean that one of our new NASAMS is operating there.

Those new developments around Kinburn’s Spit seem interesting; if we actually already managed to liberate some settlements there, then that’s great news. In the past couple of days Mykolaiv’s governor was hinting at this assault happening in the very near future, so it might have actually happened by now. We should still wait for the official confirmations, but so far this seems promising if true.

**UPD 10:45:** And just after I posted this suddenly Russians became active and fired a bunch of missiles at Kharkiv. People are reporting explosions, but from where we are we don't hear any of them.

No, just no.

The RuAF's failure of achieving air superiority doesn't actually have much of anything to do with the Ukrainian Air Force, but rather the Ukrainian Air Defence Force.

To this day, there has still not been a single *confirmed Ukrainian air-to-air kill (*though there probably are a fair few against helicopters and attack aircraft)*,* every known engagement between the RuAF and UkrAF has resulted in a Russian victory.

The issue of Russia's air superiority is that Russia has (in general) poor SEAD and DEAD capabilities. Russia cannot effectively deal with Ukraine's vast AD network. 

This means that even if Russia wins every single aerial battle of the war (which they mostly are), they cannot achieve air superiority. The Ukrainian jets can just run away, and Russia cannot follow them. Russia cannot press their advantage in the air and finish off the UAF for good because Ukraine has a very much active SAM net.

So no, the UAF is not anywhere close enough to air superiority over the frontlines. Neither is Russia, but Russia is certainly closer to it than Ukraine right now.

Also, Russia actually had Air Superiority over a decent chunk of the country in late Feb-early March, back when the UAF and UADF were pretty disorganized. The same disorganization from the Russian Air Defence Force allowed Ukrainian TB-2 Bayraktars to decimate Russian Army convoys during that period. However, as the war turned into slow frontlines and artillery duels, increased organization from both sides resulted in each other's Air Forces mostly taking a backseat, to where it is today.",False,1668333501.0,t3_ytr91x,t1_iw6ak09,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

 >The raccoon ( or US:  (listen), Procyon lotor), sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal.

Conversely, western military doctrine grants a large amount of autonomy to its NCO corps and field officers While the senior staff are responsible for overall tactics.

Actually, a whole lot of time you don't have bodies.  So you end up with multiple groups estimating/claiming the same kill.  ""Oh yah, we completely wiped out a squad"" can easily be reported in twice by groups providing interlocking fire.  And a couple guys could have gotten away.  Confirmation bias + confusion.

This systemic overcounting happens across the board, even when you really want accurate numbers for planning and force estimation purposes.

It was signed by United States Army Lieutenant General William Harrison Jr. and General Mark W. Clark representing the United Nations Command (UNC), North Korea leader Kim Il-sung and General Nam Il representing the Korean People's Army (KPA), and Peng Dehuai representing the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA).

Again, if you’re telling me that this number is just the sum of field level body counts with no logic applied, then you aren’t talking about an estimate… you’re talking about a count, very different.

Just consider the idea for a second that you see this obvious error that has happened in every war including this one… and you find the issue - people are double counting bodies. How dim would our militaries have to be to continue on pushing out the incorrect estimates, without even addressing the issue.

Because it's not obvious what to divide by.  This isn't the German tank problem where you eventually get some ground truth data.  And different conflicts, with different chances to observe casualties and command structures result in different ""multiples"".

Whenever you attempt to apply a correction to data, it's generally far better to under-correct for an uncertain bias than to over-correct.  Doing anything else runs the risk that you will end up dwarfing the actual signal with the correction metrics you employ.

Yes, I know there are reasons why people may want to report higher numbers for morale, etc.  But even absent these exterior motivations, there are big upward biases in the input data that aren't easily corrected for.  And confirmation bias tends to apply a further upward adjustment: above all else, you are asking people how effective they think their actions are.

I understand my characterization of this differs from yours.  I've professionally spent a whole lot of time using faulty counting to come up with the best estimates I can.  I also build control systems, tracking filters, and state estimators, which deal with noisy systems subject to various correlated and uncorrelated errors, and have had a lot of exposure to human and organizational factors in counting and estimating.",False,1668367472.0,t3_ytr91x,t1_iw8eg61,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

This is not random, is doesn’t bounce around 0, you’re saying it ALWAYS results in high reported kill numbers in a way that substantially adjusts the ESTIMATE upwards… the solution is simple… apply a factor to the estimate. You say you’re afraid of an over-correction but if this is something that ALWAYS adjusts the number upwards, then refusing to address it isn’t the neutral option, it’s the “I’m paralyzed in indecision resulting in predictably wrong estimates” option.

Here’s an example where even you would act rationally. Let’s say you market and sell clams on behalf of a clam farmer, you agree to buy x clams per year, but this fucker is always low, you never know how much, but he’s always low. Would you try to sell all the clams the agreement is for, knowing he will be short, or would you sell a little less in anticipation of him being short?

Do you expect the Ukrainian military / NATO would make life and death plans based on kill counts that they know to be high, because they’re afraid of an over correction on the adjustment factor for double counting bodies? This is irrational.

Edit: my guess is this isn’t much of an issue at all, most double counting would be caught while it’s being compiled and the rest could be caught in a small factor adjustment or even just small enough that it would be accounted for in the estimate range. Field reports are only one of many data points and with Russian friendly fire being so high double counting is probably just inconsequential.",1668370807.0,1668370123.0,t3_ytr91x,t1_iw8fe2w,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
