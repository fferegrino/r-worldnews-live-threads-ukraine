Since Russia’s soldiers first stormed Ukraine, women have been gang-raped, men castrated, children sexually abused, and civilians forced to parade naked in the streets, according to the United Nations.  
  
The Kremlin stands accused of terrorising the Ukrainian population with sexual violence in a systematic and unsparing manner. It is thought that the full-extent of this barbarism will not come to light until years after the war.  
  
The allegations come ahead of a major international conference for preventing sexual violence in conflict, held in London on Monday, during which dozens of survivors from around the world will speak out about their abuse.  
  
“In Ukraine, an alarming number of reports are coming in from areas illegally controlled by Russia. The UN has begun to document them, and they are chilling,” James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary, wrote exclusively in the Telegraph ahead of hosting the conference. More than 50 ministers from around the world will join him.  
  
Last month, a UN Commission documented what it described as “patterns” of rape and sexual violence inflicted on Ukrainians throughout the war. “Victims range from four to over 80 years old,” it said, detailing a series of appalling accusations in October’s report.  
  
One Russian soldier forced a four-year-old girl to perform oral sex on him in the presence of her parents, according to the report. The 22-year-old mother was raped, her husband sexually violated, and the pair were also forced to have sexual intercourse in the presence of the armed forces.",False,1689256130.0,t3_14ya41i,t3_14ya41i,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

>The Ukrainian civilians woke long before dawn in the bitter cold, lined up for the single toilet and were loaded at gunpoint into the livestock trailer. They spent the next 12 hours or more digging trenches on the front lines for Russian soldiers.
>
>Many were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target, and a former city administrator trudged around in boots five sizes too big. By the end of the day, their hands curled into icy claws.
>
>Nearby, in the occupied region of Zaporizhzhia, other Ukrainian civilians dug mass graves into the frozen ground for fellow prisoners who had not survived. One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot — yet another body for the grave.
>
>Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia and the Ukrainian territories it occupies, in centers ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to clammy basements. Most have no status under Russian law.
>
>And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more. A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.
>
>In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia. This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia indefinitely, which has happened in multiple cases documented by the AP.

> The events at the front have been overshadowed by a new scandal within the RF Armed Forces. Yesterday, a State Duma deputy, and former commander of the 58th Combined Arms Army, Andrey Gurulev posted the voice message from Major General Ivan Popov, who has been serving as the current commander of the 58th during the war in Ukraine. Popov reached out to his ""gladiators"" (since Popov's call sign is ""Sparticus"") and confirmed the information that had appeared earlier—that he had been relieved or his command removed for reporting the problems with counter-battery combat and with the lack of rotation of personnel, all brought to the attention of the ""senior authorities."" According to him, in this way the higher leadership ""treacherously and vilely beheaded the army at the most difficult and tense moment.""

> Later, Secretary General of the United Russia party, First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Andrei Turchak,  said that Popov's statement had meant to be contained in private chats of the officers & fighters of the 58th Army—it was not intended to be public.

> Turchak accused Gurulev of creating ""political theatre,"" and relieved Popov of blame, that ""Popov's conscience should be clear"" and ""the Motherland can be proud of such commanders."" Turchak also stressed that ""the army has been, and remains, out of politics.""  How such characterizations can be reconciled with Popov's criticism of the high command in front of an audience of soldiers and officers, Turchak did not specify.

The publication then showed how all the media and Z-channels fell in line.  With over a dozen examples.  That Popov did nothing wrong.  That must be able to speak frankly.  And person who released did something wrong.

""US President Joe Biden said he doesn't think the war in Ukraine will drag on for years to come, declaring that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""already lost.

""There is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He has already lost that war,"" Biden said at a news conference with Finnish Sauli Niinisto in Helsinki when asked if Ukraine not immediately being admitted to join NATO could embolden Putin.

The US president said he doesn't think the war will continue for years because Russia cannot maintain its resources for that long, and Putin will likely eventually ""decide its not in interest for Russia, economically, politically or otherwise.""

He said he hopes Ukraine makes progress in its current counteroffensive to spur a negotiated settlement.""",False,1689262195.0,t3_14ya41i,t3_14ya41i,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

>The ambiguous diplomatic language in the summit’s final communiqué on Ukraine — an invitation will be extended “when allies agree and conditions are met,” leaving unsaid the conditions — did not disguise some serious strains among alliance members. And President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, in his first public remarks since backing Sweden’s bid for admission to the alliance, tempered expectations that he would swiftly push the approval through the Turkish Parliament.
>
>Even so, President Biden hailed the unity of the alliance in a speech at Vilnius University following the summit that invoked Cold War history, including Lithuania’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. “We will not waver” in support of Ukraine, he declared, emphasizing that the war must end on “just terms.”
>
>Other leaders also chose to emphasize the positive. President Volodymyr Zelensky — who before the summit said it was “absurd” there was not yet a timeline for his country’s full-fledged NATO membership — said that he was leaving Vilnius with “support from the leaders and an unambiguous statement that Ukraine will be in NATO.”

>- Several nations pledged new military aid to Ukraine, a move that Russia called a mistake while warning of unspecified countermeasures. There were promises of midrange missiles from France, tank ammunition from Germany, a training center for fighter pilots in Romania and a rehabilitation center for wounded Ukrainian soldiers in Britain. The Biden administration is also considering sending Ukraine long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS.
>
>- Mr. Erdogan’s hints that Sweden’s accession may not be a done deal were bound to disappoint many of his NATO allies, who had hoped that his use of the issue to win concessions for Turkey over the past year had finally come to an end. Mr. Erdogan also said that Sweden needed to continue working to address Turkey’s security concerns, suggesting that he was not yet ready to give up his leverage.

> One of the reasons#Ukrainehas not received any concrete promise in#Vilniuswas a fear of#escalation, or even fear in general. Fear and anxiety are very fundamental factors for Western decisions-taking since decades. I wrote an essay on this recently

This is an often repeated point of view, and I don't think it's correct. Russia has been exposed as weak, every red line they've drawn has been crossed and most recently Putin has been shown to accept compromise in the face of open rebellion. There is no reason to fear Russia.

The simple issue regarding NATO membership is that the future is unknown, and it is not in the interest of NATO member states to commit to Ukrainian membership in an unknown future. That is not to say that this is a *moral* position, it's just the way things are.

Fact is, that after the war ends - Russia will not be in any position to attack Ukraine again in a period of at least 2-3 years. So rather than committing now, NATO member states lose nothing by waiting for the war to end, assess the conditions and then make up their mind. 

Ukraine not being offered more concrete assurances is not fear - it's simply realpolitik.",False,1689280208.0,t3_14ya41i,t3_14ya41i,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

1. **Killing members of the group**: [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-e3756976cf33cf5de29aa62d61ea7eb6) reported over 40,000 civilian deaths, including women and children. This scale of loss clearly indicates Russia's actions are leading to a significant loss of life among the Ukrainian population.

2. **Causing serious bodily or mental harm**: The existence of a 'torture center' in Kherson, Ukraine, run by Russian forces, as reported by [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/13/ukraine-russian-torture-center-kherson), unmistakably contributes to serious bodily and mental harm.

3. **Deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to cause physical destruction**: Russia's deliberate and systematic attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, leading to a near obliteration of everyday life, as described in [The New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/23/world/europe/ukraine-civilian-attacks.html?smid=nytcore-android-share), certainly align with this criterion.

4. **Preventing births within the group**: The [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukrainian-psychologist-sexual-violence-ukrainian-soldiers-endured-the-times-2023-6) report on the sexual violence, including castration, against Ukrainian POWs, illustrates a horrific strategy that effectively prevents births within the group.

5. **Forcibly transferring children**: The [story on Jurist](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/07/russia-says-700000-ukraine-children-brought-to-russia-during-war/) documents that Russia has forcibly transferred 700,000 Ukrainian children during the war, fitting the last criterion of genocide.

We ALL know the language Putin and Russian officials have used about their desire to erase the independent Ukraine and their national identity. This is clearly not only an attempt at a land grab but a deliberate and vengeful quest to put an end to an entire peoples that Russian leadership does not believe deserve their own identity.

How? Only the US and/or NATO could do that. How does that scenario play out?

1. US forces land in Ukraine
2. US launches an all out assault on all Russian assets in Ukraine killing hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers, destroying the Black Sea fleet, liberating Crimea, etc.

What happens next? You think Russia is going to not respond if the US kills hundreds of thousands of their soldiers? No. Russia deploys tactical nukes in Ukraine in response. US soldiers on the ground are fried to a crisp. This is almost a certainty.

What happens next? The US must respond by attacking the source of the tactical nukes (which are within Russia).

What happens next? Russia responds by attacking bases in the US that provide the weapons used in the previous escalation.

What happens next? After the homeland is attacked the US and NATO get active and start invading Russia and attacking Russian naval assets all over the world.

What happens next? Russia declares an existential crisis and announces an imminent nuclear response against large cities if hostilities don't end immediately.

What happens next...

This may not be exactly how it plays out but it's a very real possibility, and this is why the US/NATO isn't getting directly involved. Russia understands it can't simply use nukes against Ukraine without reprisals because Ukraine isn't a nuclear power. But if a nuclear power started killing Russian troops en masse then all bets are off.

The US/EU/NATO need to keep providing Ukraine with the weapons necessary to deny Russia the ability to achieve its goals while simultaneously increasing economic penalties on Russia. That's the only path forward. At some point the economic losses will become untenable for Russia and one of a few things will happen, a) Putin will withdraw, b) ""they"" will depose Putin, or c) an internal conflict will ensue necessitating the end of hostilities in Ukraine.

Beyond that, it's hard to make any predictions. There is some reason to think that Russia will not be able to sustain the war effort from a financial point of view at some stage. There may also be some logistical bottlenecks when it comes to production of new hardware. 

Western support for the moment is solid. But if the Ukrainians fails to show any gains in the coming 6-12 months, that may change. Wildcard remains the US Presidential elections. A Trump victory, while not likely, would be a major loss for Ukraine.

\- Tried a sort of Blitzkrieg and failed badly

\- The plan failed badly because Putin completely underestimated Ukraine and Europe reponse. Somehow understandable mistake if we look how europe and NATO reacted to 2014 Crimea invasion. He genuinely thought it would end up the same way.

\- Putin plan was to keep Nato away and use in the worst case scenario Ukraine as a buffer zone. He helped instead Nato to get bigger and unite as ever.

\- The whole reputation of the Russian army is absolutely gone to hell after this. The perception we had about them before and just few months after the 2022 invasion is completely changed. And now everybody knows the gap existing between russia and NATO. Russia allies knows that too now, which is another key dynamic.

\- The war is lost because Putin can't sustain this the way he needed, Russia can't get better from this while Ukraine will get more and more help.

That isn't a bad thing, nor is it a slight against Ukraine. No one's denying that they are heroes without equal, that they are not only defending their land but Europe, and that they have shown nothing but great leadership, devotion to principles of humanism and freedom, and respect for the rights and laws that we uphold in the west. Still, it doesn't mean that Ukraine will suddenly be immune from future turmoil. What happens post-Zelensky? How does Ukraine deal with the demographic conflicts and social divide within its borders once this is all over? There are lots of questions that aren't automatically or inherently answered in stone in a favorable way. Personally I believe that Ukraine will far surpass any and all of our expectations, but national leaders don't base their geopolitical decision making on beliefs, and it only takes a few wrong steps for Ukraine to backslide. The West surely doesn't want to deal with another Hungary or Turkey type situation. Again, I don't believe that will happen, but the realpolitik would remind us that it's still not impossible.

Also, I don't think this means the west will leave Ukraine out to dry, even if they hold off invitations to NATO. I will be very shocked if they leave Ukraine hanging again. Whether it's an Israel type situation where the west just arms Ukraine to the teeth, or stationing troops inside the border as peacekeepers, or maybe even individual security pacts from other countries - whatever the case, as much as I believe that Ukraine will be in NATO eventually, I also believe that Russia will never be able to invade Ukraine again, and the West will make sure of it.",1689283631.0,1689283397.0,t3_14ya41i,t1_jruols8,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Were it an ideal situation - read as 'not in the middle of a war' - fine.   I'd agree.

Sticking to the aircraft - let's get them the best stuff possible that fits their needs, and then some.   We can sort out how to get those planes to the Ukrainians, either likely unbuilt or commited to supporting front-line forces elsewhere, along with enough air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions to sustain a force performing 2-3 sorties a day, 7 days a week, plus extra if the tempo goes up.   We can make sure that they have enough spare parts and the right equipment to maintain equipment that requires multiple hours of maintenance per operating hour and ensure system uptime is as high as possible.   We can also get them the proper training in not only how to operate the weapon you handed them, but how to use it in the best manner that fits how they were designed to operate along with other systems and tactics employed not only by the air forces, but the ground forces they'll be supporting.   Oh, yes, and you'll be able to move all of these goods and equipment to run things while not stressing out a logistical pipeline that's already being stretched because you're in an active conflict.

But we can't.   Ukraine is in the middle of a war.   There isn't any luxuries we can afford.   They need everything they're getting yesterday.   There's no time to plan, there's no time to train and get them up to speed.   So now it becomes what's the most available to hand over right away, what's the easiest to get into their hands with as little training as required, what has the most readily available supplies and the least upkeep, and what can they not only fight with, but sustain so that there's no issue with downtimes.

In your scenario, the Russian reaction to the envoy will be something like “put all of our nuclear forces on high alert immediately, recall ambassadors from all NATO countries, issue public warning that any attack on Russian forces by NATO will be seen as a declaration of war on Russia and that nuclear war is imminent”.

This alone would be sufficient to cause great chaos in the Western world as people try to flee to anywhere from Venezuela to Australia (at least until the ultimatum is over and the risk of nuclear war has diminished) and the global economy spirals into a nosedive.

To demonstrate their resolve, Russia publicly conducts an above ground nuclear test on their own soil; the images and video of the mushroom cloud further intensify chaos around the world, as people are aware that we are likely only days from global catastrophe.

Putin again announces publicly that any attack on Russian forces will be met with an immediate nuclear reaction, and spells out that the first targets would be Warsaw and the capitals of the Baltic states, with the next level of escalation thereafter being Germany and then France & the UK.

At this point, what do you think public reaction in the Western world will be, and how popular do you think NATO will be amongst their own population?

Russia would likely continuously follow an “escalate to deescalate” approach, at every step trying to scare NATO to eventually back down - they wouldn’t quietly fold, as they believe they have the upper hand in the balance of resolve: most people in the Western world would be nowhere near ready to die for Ukraine or actually trade London for Charkiw, Paris for Lviv and New York for Odessa, so Russia will view NATO threats as an empty bluff they’re willing to call.

Should NATO actually go through with a conventional attack on Russian forces in Ukraine, Russia has every incentive to launch a first limited nuclear attack (perhaps over the Baltic Sea, perhaps even on Polish territory), to show that they are serious about nuclear escalation without immediately going to full-scale nuclear war, and then NATO will have to decide how far they want to push or when they want to sue for peace.

There is a reason why Joe Biden has made sure to explicitly rule out any actual NATO intervention from the very first day of the war, and nothing will ever change about that - we are not risking nuclear Armageddon over something that is important enough to Russia that Putin has already effectively bet the future of his regime on, but that for NATO is in no way equally existentially important. 

If we were willing enough to do this, we would have been willing enough to accept Ukraine into NATO years ago, or at the summit just this week - our priorities are clear (avoiding a nuclear confrontation with Russia, which should always be our priority), so any outlandish threats we make all of a sudden out of the blue will very likely be seen as an empty bluff by Russia, which would make the situation all the more dangerous.",1689251457.0,1689249089.0,t3_14ya41i,t1_jrse5aa,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

A light fighter like F-16 even with the latest AIM-120 versions doesn't play on the same level - it doesn't have the speed or the radar range and AMRAAMs are  medium sized missiles, much better and accurate than R-37 but for much shorter engagement range.

Mig-31 and R-37 are simple one-dimensional one-trick-ponies (massive airframe, massive engines, massive radar, oversized missiles), but that brute force and simplicity is what makes them work even with the Russian level of sophistication. Kinda like F-14 and Phoenix missiles, but one generation newer.

Climb high, fly extremely fast, use its powerful radar to lock targets at long range and give their huge long range missiles more initial kinetic energy than anything else in the service.

It's not a massive threat as the technology has usual Russian issues and careful targets can avoid those cumbersome telephone poles, but it's still enough to force the target to defend itself, interrupt a mission and sometimes the missile just gets lucky.

They didn't have a problem with post-2014 Ukraine until 2016 when Marie Yovanovitch was appointed US Ambassador to Ukraine. She really pushed them to address corruption. Ukraine's lack of progress on this front was evidenced by Ukranian politicians (Yuriy Lutsenko) encouraging Trump to get rid of her (coincidentally highlight American corruption in the process) because of her anti-corruption progress. In 2019 Yuriy Lutsenko was removed from his position.

Zalensky \_has\_ made progress on this front even during the war, but I do think he and Ukraine have a ways to go before they're on par with NATO standards. That combined with additional legal reforms, means it'll be a while before they're admitted. Even if the war ended today.

I think what happens is that Ukraine gets into the EU before NATOO, but that this EU-ization of Ukraine will help bring it in line with NATO standards more quickly.

Here's how I see things progressing for Ukraine:

Step 1: End the war either by total overwhelming victory or by making territorial concessions.

Step 2: Sign security agreements with NATO members.

Step 3: Acquire state of the art defense technology from the West, things that the West is hesitant to send today.

Not sure about the need for the victory to be overwhelming: it may well be that at some point the war just kind-of ends because the active fighting stops as Ukraine reaches the border with Russia.

Liberalism = Good : Increasingly citizens within established democracies feel disenfranchised. If democracy, as an extension of liberalism, is the ultimate form of citizen empowerment, then why do democratic governments fail to respond to the the people's will? 

Globalism = Prosperity : While over all wealth has skyrocketed, many in developed nations have found themselves disenfranchised by foreign competition. If globalism brings prosperity then why do a significant portion of us feel worse off than several decades ago?

And Russia is *alone*, with minor exceptions.

[Here is a chart showing arms exports by country.](https://fairbd.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/10LargestArmsExporterInTheWorld.webp)

Russia's exports *were* 40% of the US's. Every other country on the chart is an ally of Ukraine, except for China, which is offering Russia very little aid. North Korea and Iran are Russia's only allies, and they appear in the small *Others* section, presumably. Edit: Israel is *barely* an ally of Ukraine.

I emphasized *were* because Russia's poor performance in Ukraine has reduced demand for Russia's weapons.

> After cresting in the early 2010s, Russian arms exports have fallen to levels not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal referred to Russia’s precipitous decline in arms exports as among “the casualties of Russia’s war in Ukraine.”

> But the timing doesn’t add up: According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia’s arms exports began falling in earnest in 2019, and were already down nearly 20 percent relative to 2011, the high-water mark for the Russian arms industry. That year, Russian arms exports nearly matched U.S. arms exports and were delivered to 35 different countries. **Eleven years later, Russian arms exports had fallen by nearly 70 percent, with deliveries to just 12 countries.**

> If the war on Ukraine dealt the knockout blow to Russia’s arms exports, the industry had already been on the ropes for some time.

For example:

[India cancelled orders of Russian jets, weapons \(March 2022\)](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/russia-ukraine-war-india-weapon**s-systems-us-7799245/)

> Underlining that it would be difficult for any country to continue buying military hardware from Russia after US sanctions in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday that in the “last few” weeks, “what we’ve seen from India…is the cancellation of MiG-29 orders, Russian helicopter orders and anti-tank weapon orders.”

It's been a while since I wrote about this (on reddit, I'm not anyone of note), but IIRC, Russia is building 3 new factories to *refurbish* tanks. When they are complete, Russia will have the capacity to *build* just 10 tanks a month and refurbish another 80. Until the 3 new factories are working, Russia can only refurbish 20 per month.

[How Russia Lost '4,000 Tanks' in Ukraine \(June 2023\)](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-tank-losses-4000-ukraine-general-staff-1807584)

If we accept the 4000 number (it is difficult to know the real number), then Russia has averaged a loss of 266 tanks per month. 

Russia's eventual 90/month will cover only a third of that.

> how the heck did Russia manage to become the second biggest arms exporter in the world

I don't know much about that, but here's a guess. The US military destroyed a ton of T-72 tanks in Iraq. [From here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-72):

> About 25,000 T-72 tanks have been built, and refurbishment has enabled many to remain in service for decades.

My guess is Russia was able to sell T-72s to Iraq and elsewhere that were left over from the Soviet Union. They bought gun sights from France; that source is cut off. Refurbishing old Soviet tanks was cheap and easy and doesn't require much manufacturing capacity.
