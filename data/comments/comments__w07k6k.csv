Day 143 of my updates from Kharkiv.

We didn’t get shelled directly today, but Derhachi was shelled, and as we are only about 5km away from there, we heard that shelling very clearly, it was very loud even though it was decently far away from us, and also apparently electricity was cut for some people living there.  

Then the usual missile strike, at first we thought that they forgot about it, but they just did it at 2:30am. There were 4 missiles in total and all of them sounded very close to us. First 2 were weird as even though they were extremely loud – they didn’t create any real shockwave, as if they blew up midair. Last 2 missiles were a bit less loud, they did create a decent shockwave, and they did sound as they usually do when hitting something, the extremely unpleasant grinding/tearing sound of metal and concrete.

I’m not sure if the first 2 missiles hit something or if they blew up in air, but the last 2 definitely hit something, a really big fire started and I can see it from my window, the smoke trail spans for many kilometers, and can be seen from basically anywhere in the city. As of now there’s no info about what was hit, but from what I can see I’m pretty sure it’s somewhere in Kyivskyi district.",False,1658023146.0,t3_w07k6k,t3_w07k6k,,0,125,0,125,1,0,

🪖 On Friday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  This doesn't mean nothing happened!  The following mappers can tell you all the details: [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1548104406129729538), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547892218123325445.html), [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1548091829135892480.html).

🍄 The Ukrainian government stated that in the past week they've destroyed more  [30 russian (logistics) hubs](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1547992158514188290).  No videos there -- sorry.  Ukraine must be reloading their HIMARS.

👉 russia bombed [Dnipro](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1548020809393848323) killing [3 and wounding 15](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1548095981404557312).

👉 russia continues [rushing ammunition](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1548054522802556929) to the western front in the wake of the destruction of a [massive ammunition dump](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546585310364160002.html) near Kherson.

👉 Ukraine [received](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1547987846287396873) its first [M270 MLRS](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1531067601006301184.html) systems today.  The M270's are slower, more heavily armored systems that have two missile pods instead of the one on the HIMARS systems.  

👉 Some twitter aggregators are still repeating the debunked claim that Ukraine is getting [300km range missles](https://twitter.com/ukraine_map/status/1547980808157204484).  The US and Ukraine are in talks about those long-range missiles and there [is much optimism](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1547901605793583104) Ukraine will eventually get them, but they are not currently being supplied to Ukraine.

👉 Ukraine claimed it took out [two russians SU-25s](https://threadreaderapp-com.translate.goog/thread/1548024428084072449.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) with MANPADS, destroying one and damaging the other.

👉 Stuck inside the US $800 Billion dollar defense bill which takes effect in October is a provision for $100 million to train Ukrainian pilots to [fly F-15s and F-16s](https://twitter.com/knittingknots/status/1548102206213148672).  Ukrainian pilots flying [US jets](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546589483360985090.html) is still up to a year or more away.


👉 Paul Urey, a British Aid Worker captured by russian forces in Ukraine [died in detention](https://twitter.com/RadioPonca/status/1548021326484451328). Mr. Urey was a diabetic, dependent on insulin and that may have played a factor in his death.

👉 russia [accepted responsibility](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547874958432276480.html) for the [bombing of Vinnytsia](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1547534137556455424) saying they hit a ""garrison officer's house"", in actuality, russia bombed ""The House of Officers"" -- a concert venue.  Ukraine's ministry of Internal Affairs [said russia has conducted](https://twitter.com/JaneLytv/status/1548054403013259265) “17,314 strikes on civilian targets, and a little more than 300 hits on military targets.” since the war began.

📊 Germans want to [continue to support Ukraine](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547855803318579200.html), but not too much, and the German government appears to be in sync with what its citizens want.

💰 Starbucks is selling its [business in russia](https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1547873154382454786).

💰 The Wall Street Journal has [reported](https://twitter.com/KevinRothrock/status/1548096025398616066) -- paywall -- that China's exports to russia of microchips and other electronics components has increased since international sanctions on russia were put in place. 

⚽ russia lost its [appeals to FIFA and UEFA](https://twitter.com/Herald_Sport_/status/1547928970921902080) meaning russia will not be participating in international soccer matches in the near future.

📌 On the July 11^th summary, I put a pin in the 15th since putin was calling an emergency session of the Duma (russian Congress).  There was no mobilization, although over [100 bills were passed](https://twitter.com/jenssiegert/status/1547888372189765634), and (probably most importantly) appointed a new Deputy Prime Minister that will be overseeing a rather radical [transformation](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547939034952962053.html) of the russian economy.

👉 In the July 14^th summary, I linked to [this thread](https://twitter.com/PhillipsPOBrien/status/1547576761105334274) by Phillips P. O'Brien regarding criminal charges to russian makers of the S-400 anti-aircraft systems.  Unfortunately Mr. O'Brein built his thread on a shaky reference that I've been unable to corroborate so you should treat that ""interesting thing"" with some skepticism.

👉 It's the weekend so no report on the 16^th.  I'll be back Monday for a recap of the weekend.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been [shrinking its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: [a stalemate](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288) that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16th July 2022
 

- Russian offensive operations remain reduced in scope and scale, with fighting west of Lysychansk focussed on Siversk and Bakhmut. This is despite Russian claims to have entered the outskirts of Siversk town earlier in the week.

- Russia has previously made premature and false claims of success. This is likely at least in part aimed at demonstrating success to domestic audiences and to reinforce the morale of the fighting forces.

- Ukrainian defence has been successful in repulsing Russian attacks since Lysychansk was ceded and the Ukrainian defensive line was shortened and straightened. This has allowed for the concentration of force and fires against reduced Russian attacks and has been instrumental in reducing Russia's momentum.

I doubt the US gives the E variants since they will probably be needed in the Pacific as a deterrent to Chinese expansion.  

The F-16 is more interesting, however, because it gives the Ukranians access to the AGM-88 HARM which, theoretically, could neutralize the Russian S400 and S300 missile systems and open up the possibility of striking Russian ground targets from the air. The F-16s ground and pound while the F-15s cover with AMRAAMs.

- How many are being trained? The more, the better.

- How long has this been planned? If it's been in the works for some time, the spin-up of this capability will be far quicker.

- What sort of variants are Ukraine going to be getting and how many? Variants indicate intent for use.

- How does this impact on military support dollars? Aircraft are very expensive, it's why the allies have been sending artillery, buckets, and ATGMs/MANPADS.

Both times the ‘big and mighty’ Russian Army invaded a weaker neighbor after months of prodding and provocative action, expecting a quick victory with a massive front wide attack, only for years of military neglect and bad leadership to rear their ugly head. They bog down and take massive casualties, eventually forcing them to dial back and focus on a narrower front in the South to score a minor victory.

There are plenty of minor differences of course(Finland has better terrain for defence, Ukraine was better armed in comparison), but in many ways it holds true.

The critical difference is, in the Winter War, Finland was on their war. Nobody helped them beyond some small arms because they were hording their own weapons to deal with the crazy mustache man rampaging in Europe and also didn’t want to risk pushing the USSR to sign on to the Axis. Finland lost mostly because they eventually just ran out of guns, so when the Soviets pushed at full force into the South the line broke and the Finnish lost Vyborg(the equivalent of Kharkiv or Odessa to them) and gave in. Ukraine has been getting Western aid from the start and it’s only increasing. Russia blew their chance early on and they don’t have time on their side or a Bavarian Corporal to distract people.

My response:

I've written about it twice before but I'm going to copy+paste my longer post about what the larger implications could be 

https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/thi49b/-/i188f06

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ugsmgr/-/i72m5oy

>I hate Putin, and I hate Fox News' polite coverage of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. But there is a really, really important, and distinct benefit we get out of all the negatives that Fox's press coverage of Putin gives us.

>And it's this.

>In Russia, pretty much as everyone has seen, almost all alternative media and dissenting voices have been turned off everywhere in the country. 

>When I go and talk to my Russian friend and she gives me all these pro-Russian talking points,  she can never really deny that Putin is a dictator. It's obvious to anyone that there is no freedom of speech in Russia.

>But we have freedom of speech here!

>They accuse the West of being the real dictatorship that is out to destroy Russia, but that would mean we have to play by Putins autocratic governing mechanics, which involving stifling dissenting opinions(As we know Ukrainian support is very high in the US) but to those that live in the US and can voice their support for that POS Putin, they can be confident that even they know that theyre protected by the first ammendment.

>Our governments and their institutions are really difficult to change, but that's by design or else a autocrat could try and bend the rules to dismantle our institutions little by little in order to gain more power by doing so. And part of having power means the ability to silence dissenting opinions so that they will hardly have any exposure and thus less opportunities to change public opinion.

>That's Putins playbook. Same thing happened in China where Xi changed the laws to allow him to pursue an infinite amount of terms which virtually makes him infinitely powerful. On top of his state censorship and surveillance apparatus that's being augmented by artificial intelligence behind a great firewall. Almost all of my friends in Asia who are pro-West are such because they've been exposed to American culture, music, and have also embraced our counter-cultural and non-conforming traditions before their lesser known countries knew well enough to start censoring like the Chinese have.

>In 2010 the most powerful person in the world was Barack Obama. In 2020 it was definitively Xi and Putin.

>This first amendment gives us near infinite credibility in the world stage, because most people know they can't deny that a sitting US president is not actually all that powerful based on everything we've seen unfold in American politics, Bush, Clinton, Trump, Obama, they're basically toast. Not to forgot all the unfathomable amounts of negative press coverage they recieve. We can reliably expect have a new guy basically running the worlds most powerful nation once every four years (add another 4 after reelection) and there's a lot of checks and balances to that person's power.

>Imagine what kind of country we'd be if George Washington decided to rule as a monarch instead of a president?

>As long as we have that credibility,  we will attract all the rogue defectors after they've been freshly purged from Chinese and Russian ranks that will share with us everything they know about our adversaries.

>Credibility is incredibly powerful, and soon China will find out, as Russia did, that autocracy will sap your credibility because eventually an autocrats interests is going to collide with too many people as they grow more powerful. As long as our institutions hold strong and not one political establishment becomes too powerful and influential.

On the other hand, the US has a rare bipartisan understanding in the Senate (which matters more because a lot of House Republicans will follow their lead).  Essentially, the leadership of both parties know that Americans are tired of boots on the ground and that fatigue would hurt both of them.  Why does this matter?  Well Russia has made it clear they won't stop after Ukraine and it's only a short distance towards NATO countries.

Perhaps it's a risk too far, and perhaps the Polish people would not support such action from their government; but it would still be a long way off the sort of escalation that would arise from e.g. the US getting directly involved, yet would be a stronger guarantee of Poland's long-term security than ""merely"" providing military aid.",False,1657992612.0,t3_w07k6k,t1_igev8r1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,w07k6k,igfhyq1,"New?!?  

In 1914 the Russians were firmly set on using vast numbers of bayonets.  Sure the bayonets were fixed onto rifles but the bayonet was the concept they worked from.  It became obvious that bayonets were not adequate against German heavy artillery.  The machine gun and German officers ducking rather than standing proud like Russian officers are thought to be major factors in poor battlefield results.  But the Russians learned it as heavy guns being the god of war.  In Western thinking the tank changed everything in WWII.  The Germans developed tanks in Russia because the treaties banned developing tanks in Germany.  The Russians think of ""a tank"" as an artillery piece with armor and machine guns attached.  They did not misuse them in WWII like France/Britain so they never had to reinvent a new way of thinking about ""tank warfare"". 

If you step back and look at several centuries of warfare it is not accurate to say that terror bombing cities is really a Russian specific phenomenon.  The US Air Force strategic bombing survey concluded that fire bombing German cities just motivated them rather than breaking their will.  Submarines and leaflets were both far more effective against Japan.  Nonetheless we (USA and a few friends) were still carpet bombing Hanoi decades later.  Rather than recognize it not working we carpet bombed the whole countryside and then also defoliated it.  

Terrorizing civilian populations goes back to before, and certainly during, the Golden Horde.  There is no reason to think Russia learned it from USA since it was already an old tactic before USA existed.  There is no shortage of other powers that Russia could have learned it from.  However, it is most likely they brewed this idea domestically.  Russians need to first learn that it does not work.  Then they need to learn how to make sure anyone in power does not pull anything like it again.  Then they need to develop institutions that would prevent anyone from trying it even if it did hypothetically work sometimes.  

You think giving Ukraine long range missiles so they can lob them at Russian cities will convince Russia they need to change military tactics?  I am not convinced.  Furthermore I do not want to be involved.  Lets try tactics that actually work at least some of the time instead. We do not ""need an excuse"" to sell weapons.  Putin needs us to make this mistake.

Even the phrasing of a shared consensual reality as ""bias"", instead of a valid judgement on truth is a perceived reality. The move is to discourage the idea that factual ""truth"" even exists, so they can then just declare what is or is not true. Never forget that.

All you need to do is look at the conflicting messages from the Russian propaganda machine that change day-to-day to come to the conclusion that that source of information is not to be trusted. Considering that back in 2014 the ""little green men"" story, denied at the time, was eventually admitted to be true, that they were indeed Russian soldiers. They lied and invaded a country and seized part of it. This time they lied again an refused to admit they had invaded a country. Now they are trying to seize parts of it. 

These aren't even my opinions on the ethics of these acts, but just the facts. Facts that Russia deny because they lie, which is already proven. 

It is not a lack of critical thinking skill that refuses to entertain the idea that Russia is a victim here, but the conclusion of quite a lot of critical thinking that has brought us to this place.

""finishes his work"" sounds like he's cheering him on but he didnt say it like that..

he basically said it like this ""putin will take this and that village or small town(he says the exact names) and then he will give an ultimatum to the West and west will not accept it and then God help us all""

just before that he talked about how rusophiles in serbia are happy because russia will cut gas to Germany and how they don't realize that if Germany's industry stops for whatever reason so does our own.

like you don't understand how worse the situation would be if someone else was in power, he's practically neutral in comparison to them. but propaganda is kinda funny isn't it


you might not get this idea from just translating but if you understood serbian language you would see that Vucic is basically a doomer boomer. He's just constantly dooming about shit.

That doesn't mean that amendment will pass the senate (although since there seems to be bipartisan support for it it is likely it eventually will, once they navigate past the deliberate delaying tactics of russian shills like Rand Paul), and most critically it doesn't mean that Biden will actually give Ukraine the planes- up until now his administration has said no to supplying planes due to the (in my view conpletely idiotic) worries about 'escalation', whatever that means, but they've said that about multiple different kinds of equipment they've eventually decided to provide.

Hopefully the bipartisan support for this makes him realise he's out of step with public opinion and get moving on this issue.

As for your questions, regardless of expense and how it impacts on other support it's fair to say this tech is the absolute top of the list in terms of what Ukraine would want - if the US delivered, for arguments sake, 100 modern F15s and F16s (worth about $5 billion ) with proper logistics, trained pilots and a good store of Air to Air, laser guided bombsand anti radar Air to Ground Missiles  that would be utterly gamechanging.

> Why is it okay to send an infinite amount of military equipment to Ukraine, but setting up a no-flight zone isn't.

First, it's not 'an infinite amount': they're getting more, but still not quite enough, and the Ukrainians are still not getting everything they want. It's a lot more measured than you're suggesting.

Second, it's 'okay' to send military equipment to Ukraine precisely because it is *supporting* the Ukrainians in doing what they themselves want to do: defending themselves against Russia. I'm sure they'd be happy for, say, Polish troops to march in and help, but they aren't asking for and really don't need bodies.

Ukraine have tons of people willing and able to fight. They need equipment and training so they can fight as well as possible and defend their country against this invasion.

Third, setting up a no-fly zone is a riskier move because it would bring NATO aircraft and anti-air systems into a combat zone with Russian aircraft. This is one of the major reasons Russia is acting so aggressively toward non-NATO countries who express interest in joining.

The NSA, CIA, State Dep, Pentagon, etc have literally spent the better part of a century probing Russian military organizations. Given the utter state of dismay Russian communications seem to be in it is likely the US is using AI to simply listen in on every conversation and read every text/document the Russians are sharing amongst themselves. 

We have 100M wide radar dishes in orbit that can simply suck up every cell call and radio communication in Eastern Ukraine. Since the Russians have been forced to rely on mainly unencrypted communication (I'm sure the US has done nothing to knee cap attempts at using encryption) it's literally a free for all for US AI to construct a real time view of what the Russians are saying amongst themselves that the Russians probably don't even have themselves.

Same goes for other spy satellites. Do you really believe that Ukrianian partisans are going to come up with intelligence spy satellites that can read every license plate in the country and track where each vehicle goes in real time? This is undoubtedly the level of orbital surveillance Eastern Ukraine is under right now and it seems likely to me the US knows exactly how much ammo, fuel, etc is moving from one location to another on an hourly basis. Given the level of technology these satellites have, it's possible they can literally see through the trucks canvas or box and ""count"" how much of this or that equipment or ammo is in a given vehicle. The success against these ammo dumps is likely a result of something like this: US sats gather huge amounts of real time data tracking literally thousands of individual vehicles across the battlefield. An AI algorithm determines how much of what material is going where. US agents/military review a summary of these troop and material movements and then alert Ukraine to the juiciest targets.

The main objective isn't that those fed the propaganda necessarily believe it. If they do, that's  just considered a pleasant surprise for the propagandists. The main objective is to paralyze the recipients and/or create factions of responses such that any noticeable responses are reduced in impact (because the listeners have been split into factions vs. just one or maybe two responses). It serves to create confusion and a sense of helplessness by its recipients because knowing the truth becomes that much more difficult.  

Long term in a population this type of extreme propaganda (extreme = consistent over time and consistent in conflicting messages)  leads to inaction and depression in recipients which allows the propagandists to take whatever actions they want. In so doing, the propagandists make themselves always the cause, while the recipients of propaganda are the effect. Thus, recipients of extreme propaganda lose any agency they may have had prior to brrig recipients of the propaganda.

Even western artillery, specifically the M777, are designed for around 1500 to 2500 effective full charge shots before the barrel needs to be replaced, and that's with the new barrels that last 50% longer. I can't imagine Russian artillery is any better than that.

If the Russians were firing from maximum stand off range, their number is not that far off, if they were only firing half charges though, that number could double or triple. It entirely depends on what the Russians were firing. My guess is something in the ball park of three to five thousand rounds would be the average each gun could last before the barrel should be replaced.

Now ""should"" is operative word there. Obviously the Russians could just keep firing the gun beyond it's recommended barrel life. It would mean the gun would be less accurate due to the rifling wearing out and make the gun more likely to have a catastrophic failure (aka, explode), but they could still do it.

Give how inaccurate some Russia artillery barrages have been lately, I would not be surprised if they are wearing out their barrels.",False,1658009510.0,t3_w07k6k,t1_igfib7m,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

With way more information and evidence will find 3/4 of what hits the news justifiable and a lot more you never heard of will move to prosecution. I will wait and cheer every guilty verdict. Look at a map. That city is in close support of a major front and the gateway for logistics from the east. Universities would be a great place to billet and stage troops. Would Ukraine tell us if they had? I wouldn't, fuck Russia.  Could Russia have had bad intel to suspect it was used for military purposes? If you buy the narrative that they are incompetent than you have to also accept that possibility and again read anything on military inteligence also check out the New York Times expose on the drone war from December which show the decision making process and resultant civilian casualties of strikes when they have real time visuals of the targets.

I went shooting with a buddy of mine and a former co-worker.  I took a bunch of steel plate out to the country (actually, it was my coworker's place) because one of the things we were curious what it would take to punch through it.  Thickest stuff I had with me was 3/8"" (9.5mm) and, both, the AK and AR (and mini-14 for that matter, which also uses .223) went through it like a blowtorch through butter.  In fact, we had to angle it at *more* than 45° - and *even that* left a divot behind like Stevie Wonder taking a swing with a nine iron on a golf green.  (Iirc, the plate was just [A36 alloy](https://www.metalsupermarkets.com/grade-guide-a36-steel/))

Regardless, one of the really neat things that I noticed was that the bullets would leave their copper sleeve behind, like it was lubrication for the lead core of the bullet and that the steel raised up at both the entry and exit point - as though the steel had been spread to the sides from the center of the hole.

The different elements you raised while not being blatantly so were for the most part strawman arguments or in the spectrum of whataboutism.

The core concepts that came across were 'but casualties are a fact of war', 'but the West has killed civilians too' and by nature of those points you imply Russia's crimes are less.

But one has no impact on the evil of the other and by linking them you play down the seriousness of Russian crimes.

And Russia's are far worse as they are targeted, have no regard for civilians and are frequent.
