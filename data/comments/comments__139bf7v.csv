- The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/we-knew-putin-would-attack-ukraine-back-in-2011-says-bill-clinton)

> 
Clinton said he had talked to the Russian president at the 2011 World Economic Forum in Davos, where Putin brought up the issue of the memorandum, under which Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed in 1994 to give up the nuclear arsenal they inherited on their territory from the Soviet Union, in return for assurances their sovereignty would be respected “within existing borders”.

It was signed by Boris Yeltsin on behalf of Russia, Clinton for the US, and John Major on behalf of the UK, acting as a third guarantor nation.

“Putin told me in 2011, three years before he took Crimea, that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin, that they would respect Ukraine’s territory if they gave up their nuclear weapons,” Clinton said on Thursday at a public discussion at 92nd Street Y, a Jewish cultural and community centre in New York.

> “Putin said to me: ‘… I know Boris agreed to go along with you and John Major and Nato, but he never got it through the Duma [Russian parliament]. We have our extreme nationalists too. I don’t agree with it and I do not support it and I’m not bound by it.’

“I knew from that day forward, it was just a matter of time,” the former president said of Putin launching an attack.

The Russian leader had already launched an invasion of Chechnya in 1999, and Georgia in 2008.

After the seizure of Crimea in 2014, Putin claimed Russia was not bound by the Budapest Memorandum because the Maidan revolution and change of government in Kyiv earlier that year meant Ukraine had become a different state. “In respect to this state, we have not signed any obligatory documents,” he said.

However, his conversation with Clinton suggests Putin had decided not to honour the agreement years before the Maidan uprising.",False,1683355657.0,t3_139bf7v,t3_139bf7v,,0,112,0,112,0,0,

> The Russians do not report to their superiors when they are losing territories or retreating.  They just keep the report up [on the status] for two days so that that there’s no arrivals [pointed at them],” Reznikov said.

> “Therefore, the Russian general in charge of logistics, thinking that he was in the rear, 60 km from the front line, was traveling with a convoy, and here come our guys, ‘good evening, we are from Ukraine,’ 
now meet our column and take him prisoner.  He was shocked, because he did not think that the Ukrainians would already be in—what that General had understood as—the rear,"" Reznikov said.

An interesting tactic that is being used by some Russian apologists (I’m not referring to anyone in particular) is to claim people are being monsters when celebrating Ukraine’s achievements.

Russia has made the choice to invade their neighbour for no good reason. Russia made this choice. Nobody else made this choice for it.

Ukraine did not at any time invade Russia.

Putin decided to invade Ukraine in an attempt to remove its existence as a separate country from Russia. The people of Russia have supported this decision. They did not revolt. They have formed his army.

Every Russian soldier in Ukraine is there for one reason only. To make Putin’s genocidal intensions a reality.

If given the opportunity, every Russian soldier in Ukraine will kill Ukrainians, and then take their land, women, and children.

All Russian soldiers in Ukraine have made that choice, unless they surrender.

Russian soldiers in Ukraine have chosen to participate in genocide. The argument of “I was just following orders” is no protection from their actions. The Nuremberg trials have explored this issue in depth.

Unless they surrender, every Russian soldier in Ukraine deserves little empathy.

Russian soldiers are going to die in large numbers in really gruesome ways. That is not something to celebrate. If Ukraine is to survive, the deaths of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Russian soldiers (unless they surrender) are likely necessary.

What should be celebrated is the bravery and the sacrifice of Ukraine’s soldiers. Many of them are giving their lives to protect Ukraine and indeed the whole civilised world. 

It is a crime that they have to die.

The Ukrainian soldiers did not choose to be invaded. They did not choose to defend their families and their homes with missiles, guns and bombs. They did not choose to fight a war.

The sacrifices of the soldiers defending Ukraine should always be celebrated. They are heroes.

All deaths, both Russian and Ukrainian, are solely the fault of one man. 

Putin deserves no mercy.

The people who are willing to do Putin’s bidding deserve no mercy.

The actions and the bravery of the defenders of Ukraine should be celebrated at every opportunity.

I ask all of you to think on this as Leopards kill Russians in scores.

Ukraine’s achievements should be celebrated.

e01a16a83ef91b43b2cf3aef9792110c,139bf7v,jj3pk46,"Regarding the whole prigozhin-MOD feud that’s currently going on, there are a few options I can think of as to what it could be really about.

1. Prigozhin is actually telling the truth, Wagner isn’t receiving enough ammunition and prigozhin is pulling out as a result 

- probably the most unlikely scenario, neither the Ukrainians nor many of the Russians seem to think that this is the full story with wagner expending massive amounts of shells in bakhmut still, and Russian sources claiming that wagner was receiving more shells than regular Russian units. Prigozhin also doesn’t have the best reputation for being honest. 

2 It’s an attempt to escape from bakhmut and disengage from the front line ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive

- possible, Wagner has been absolutely battered thus far and still hasn’t captured Bakhmut. prigozhin may have other plans for the future involving them, including going back to operations in Africa. 

The issue with this one is why would the Russian MOD allow him to abandon the front just as they need the soldiers the most. They’ve been suspiciously silent on the whole thing so far. At the bare minimum you think they’d push back at him and call him a coward or something after months of insults from him. 

3. It’s internal politicking and Prigozhin is trying to further his political ambitions by setting himself up as a “patriotic opposition” to the current Russian government. 


- Very possible, Prigozhin has made efforts to cultivate his reputation as a commander who understands the war better than the MOD does. Setting the scene for him to oppose them at some point to “save Russia”, and he has made statements in the past indicating that he wants to get involved in politics, especially with his “I’m going to run for president of Ukraine” stuff. 

It fits with the long-standing feud he’s had with shoigu and gerasimov. I think he’s also likely gone too far in insulting them for at least some
of that hatred not to be real. 

4. It’s a trap, and prigozhin is trying to trick the Ukrainians to attack in the wrong place at the wrong time

- also possible, but maybe less likely. 

The biggest bits of evidence for this are the timing, the previously mentioned reports that Wagner isn’t actually suffering from a major shell shortage and the suspiciously detailed reports he’s given of the military situation around bakhmut. Almost as if he was baiting the Ukrainians to exploit his weakness. 

However for this to have happened, it would require some coordination and secrecy between those in the Russian military. Something that the Russians seem almost entirely incapable of thus far. Also If prigozhin really is in a feud with the MOD why would he be so willing to set himself up as bait and bear the brunt of an attack? He likely does still take commands from Putin though so maybe Putin has forced him to go along with it. 

But It must also be asked, does prigozhin really want the war to drag on much longer? If he really does have political ambitions, russia having to retreat may actually be better for him than russia starting to succeed and Wagner becoming unnecessary and finally possible to get rid of. 

My suspicion is that it’s option 3 and prigozhin is continuing with his political ambitions at the expense of the Russian MOD. And the reason that they haven’t pushed back too hard is that the Russian military is in such a dire state that they can’t afford to actually take him
Down a notch at the moment. However I also think 4 is a distinct possibility and that the Ukrainians should exercise caution.",1683389891.0,1683389515.0,t3_139bf7v,t3_139bf7v,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

Above is my simple view over the last 6 months and what they (Putins Russia) are preparing for.

Prigozhin admitted to founding Wagner and is running it 5 or so months ago.  Now Mikhail Mizintsev (Deputy Minister of Defense), who was fired a little over a week ago, is top echelon of Wagner.  Crazy videos of Prigozhin calling out Shoigu, including calling him a ""faggot"" (huge insult in Russia) and claiming he was coming for him, and the classic scorched earth (phosphorus bombs) blanketing Bahkmut.

Shits gonna be spicy.  Oh, and Prigozhim sent a letter to the MOD that he was pulling out troops on 5/10, respecting the countries Victory day (be like pulling out troops in a losing war on July 5th in the USA).  Russians love paperwork.

Spicy. Now, they are shaping the Russian population for total loss, including the idea that Crimea is gone.  But not at Putins fault.

Kyiv has had a curfew since early 2022. The only partying are small weddings (before the husband goes to war) and spontaneous celebrations when something good happened at the front lines.

Pro-Ukrainian Westerners did more damage than good by picking the ""THEY ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE FUN"" defense instead of questioning the validity of the video so the discussion under the tweets are dominated by them instead of Ukrainians debunking the video.

9b9a6fe4b08b31785749384cbd05be0e,139bf7v,jj3wkm1,"A quick rundown on the large uptick on artillery losses as I've seen a number of questions/comments on it.

- This was predicted by a number of OSINT sources earlier in the war going all the way back to the Siege of Mariupol.

- Russia has massive numbers of artillery systems, well over 7000, however like most of their gear, it was made during the Soviet era.

- Russia started out expending anywhere from 25,000 up to 60,000 rounds per day.

- This situation was exacerbated by the lack of air superiority.

- Russia is now down to between 5,000 and 10,000 rounds per day.

- Early in the war Russia with large stockpiles and relatively fresh artillery pieces could fire shells at max range which requires additional powder/explosive charges. This was very difficult for Ukraine to counter as they couldn't effectively reach the weapons doing them the most damage.

- Firing at max range is safer for crew and equipment but less accurate and shortens artillery barrel life. 

- Russian logistics are terrible so shells, extra powder/explosive charges, barrels, repair parts, and even trucks/vehicles to haul the artillery around are difficult to get supplied.

- As the life of the Russian artillery pieces dropped due to overuse, maintenance need, poorly trained crew etc. Ukraine was *adding* new hyper accurate Western artillery and systems that for many went unnoticed - **Counter-battery radar** was a *HUGE* part of Western military aid packages.

- Most artillery can only cycle a few thousand rounds before the barrels become fouled and warped. Then they become increasingly dangerous until they fail and explode, often killing or injuring the crew.

- Russia being unable to replace barrels have been using bad ones reaching the end of their life, not having charges to fire at max range they have to move closer, and with poor barrels you get poor accuracy so you have to move *even closer* to the front to hit anything.

- Russian artillery crews are poorly trained and up until now they were trained to fire at max range. They were not well trained in firing and then moving to avoid counter-battery fire.

- Russian military doctrine doesn't assign a dedicated vehicle to each towed artillery piece (the vast majority of artillery in use) as an integrated system so frequently a truck drops off the artillery piece with ammo and drives away to grab another artillery piece or ammo. This leaves Russian artillery as mostly static.

- So as Russian artillery became less accurate, moved closer to the front, and remained relatively immobile Ukraine was receiving very accurate counter-battery radar and exceptionally accurate Western/NATO artillery systems where due to being out manned and out gunned UA had been fighting in firing and displacing constantly so they are far better about avoiding counter-battery.

- Finally, Russias biggest and last real advantage in artillery is beginning to turn to Ukraines benefit. Russia is beginning to lose, fail to maintain or replace, and unable to adapt to the changing dynamics.

- This is why T-55s are making an appearance as artillery. Iran has lots of 100mm HE (high-explosive) rounds and T-55s are a mobile tracked platform. This is obviously a desperation move and demonstrates both their fears and their lack of capabilities.

- TL;DR: Russia is fcked. Russia's biggest advantage *was* artillery. They overused the arty and ammo and had to get close to hit anything anymore. As they get close they're more likely to get shot back. Because Russia is so stupid they have lost their one real effective advantage. Russia is fcked. Putin is fcked.",1683393887.0,1683392516.0,t3_139bf7v,t1_jj3i2vc,,1,47,0,47,0,0,

It is true, but it's an over-hyped point. Javelins could be shipped and distributed in Ukraine in a day or two. They're small, light, easy to transport, and we had the inventory ready. There was no invasion force on their border, and Obama was playing a diplomatic game. He wanted Ukraine to continue to focus on eliminating corruption, while not publicly antagonizing Russia. (Was the sale of Javelins the proverbial straw that broke the status quo between Russia and Ukraine? I don't know, but Obama felt it might be so he held back.)

What was a big deal, that most people miss, and which isn't included in your comment, is the fact that the Obama Administration helped modernize Ukraine's armed forces.

Under the Bush Administration the US forces in Afghanistan found that soldiers from participating countries lacked discipline and skill. So, US forces in NATO setup some war colleges in Europe for training NCOs and such. Both Russia and Ukraine were invited to send some soldiers. Neither had much interest nor really participated.

After the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Ukraine became very interested in modernization.

>In April 2015, elements of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade stationed in Italy again deployed to Yavoriv and established an ongoing operational program called “Fearless Guardian.” The program was progressive, training everything from individual soldier skills to battalion-level operations, all based on lessons learned from the eastern and southern Ukrainian combat zones. The increasing energy at Yavoriv showed the need for a permanent enhanced training center, modeled after the U.S. Army’s training programs in the United States and Germany. In December 2015, U.S. Army Europe formally established Joint Multinational Training Group – Ukraine (JMTG-U), where a multi-national team of Americans, Poles, Canadians, Lithuanians, and Brits began training Ukrainian battalions as combined arms teams.

After so long like this, and you have a large fraction of the Russian people who are just... broken slaves. They cannot envision not being under opression, nor envision a better world. They assign no value to their existence, nor that of others. They are only concerned about their immediate survival, which includes doing what their ""Czar"" says or try to weasel out of it (e.g. fleeing mobilization), and what limited personal ambitions they can afford in their immediate surroundings.

But in modern military parlance, a “hypersonic missile” refers to a missile that is capable of both maneuvering and maintaining a non-ballistic trajectory while also staying hypersonic. I agree the US has not prioritized the development of hypersonic missiles, and is probably ahead in both the development of hypersonic technology and missile technology individually, I think it’s likely that China is slightly ahead in combining those technologies into a viable weapon.

Javelins were absolutely useful and effective at stopping Russian tanks in the early part of the war.  They weren't the only portable anti-tank missiles that Ukraine had -- they used Stugnas too, and probably some other missile types I'm forgetting.

I think your argument is naive. I don’t know you or what you really think, but your argument assumes that the world will be good to you simply because you are being a nice person.

Justice doesn’t just happen for being good.

Fairness and equality doesn’t just happen. Good people need to stand up for it and fight for it.

Sometimes it needs to be fought for personally. Sometimes you are doing it for another person.

A good example of fighting for good is donating to Ukraine’s u24 charity.

I recommend you do it. 

Sitting on your arse and expecting the world to hand you a fair slice will often not work out.

When people are put in unfair situations and push back against them, their efforts and their sacrifices should be celebrated.

In fact, if you don’t celebrate people standing up for their rights you are usually actively doing harm.

Some of the worst behaviours seen in recent history have come from the thinking behind your argument.

The treatment of Vietnam Veterans is the example that comes to mind. These are soldiers who went to war for their country. They suffered some of the worst trauma in modern history. When they came back home their governments were “anti-war” and shunned them. The damage of this and the sense of betrayal ruined a whole generation of young men from PTSD.

This is where your argument lacks insight and subtlety.

Russia has every right to celebrate its soldiers, who, if you are dumb enough to believe Russian propaganda, are going to Ukraine to “defend their country”. Their bravery should also be commemorated in Russia. They should be treated with respect and their considerable sacrifices should be celebrated IN RUSSIA.

There should also be a reckoning IN RUSSIA about why they were sent to Ukraine in the first place. And that reckoning should be brutal for the criminals who instigated this war.

While they are in Ukraine, Russian soldiers are committing a crime, and the efforts of Ukraine to stop the spread of fascism should be celebrated everywhere.

In summary, sitting around and expecting everyone to be nice to you and give you a lollipop is a bad idea.

Fighting against crimes should be celebrated.
