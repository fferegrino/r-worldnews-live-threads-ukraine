Day 139 of my updates from Kharkiv.

In the last couple of days we have been getting shelled from MLRS pretty much daily, and they do it during the day as well, to maximize the amount of civilian casualties. Just today we have been shelled twice, once around 1pm and then again at 10pm, some people were injured, but thankfully nobody died. 

Actually at first we thought that the shelling at 10pm was a missile strike, because the time is right, and it was very loud for us, but most likely it was just the proximity to the explosion, they must have been shelling somewhere close to us, there were at least 6-7 explosions happening one after another, hopefully there are no casualties.

They also didn’t forget their usual missile strike, it happened at 3am this time, with at least 3 missiles, there might have been more, but we only heard 3 explosions in the city. What was different this time is the place they were shooting from, apparently this time they moved, but before that they were firing their missiles from the same exact place, every single day, for over a month.

Not sure what was hit, but in all the 3 places of impact fires started. Their yesterday’s missile strike was pretty weird; they hit some playground in the middle of nowhere. There were some residential buildings around it, but that’s it. While their ammo dumps keep blowing up every single day, they keep fighting against schools and playgrounds. 

They don’t call them ammo dumps though; they are saying that it’s humanitarian aid or saltpeter. It’s my first time seeing humanitarian aid that explodes for hours at a time when hit. Maybe those missiles that they are firing every day at Kharkiv are actually humanitarian aid too?",False,1657680333.0,t3_vx1wqh,t3_vx1wqh,,0,80,0,80,1,0,
6a2f1cc366adb997273d0578d06471d6,vx1wqh,iftdy9v,"📰 [Daily War Summary] Summary of the events which transpired on Monday, July 11^th.

👉 On Monday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  russia engaged in shelling, recon in force, and some small assaults in the Donbas without effect.  Ukraine did liberate [some small villages](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1546580726589554689) near Kherson as it continues to [shape the battlefield](https://twitter.com/IuliiaMendel/status/1546440307121815553) in the south.

🍄 Ukrainian attacks on russia's logistics took a small break on Monday but what it lacked in quantity it made up for in [quality](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546585310364160002.html), as one might suspect, russian bloggers [were not amused](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546599180730245120.html).

👉 In an **unconfirmed** followup to a HIMARS attack on a russian command post over the weekend, [it's claimed](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1546564286771773441) that the commander, chief of staff, head of the operational staff, and head of artillery for Russia's 20th Motorized Rifle Division and chief of staff of the 22nd Army Corps were killed in Kherson Oblast.  This would certainly account for a lot of grief expressed on russian [message boards](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1546234978001833984).

👉 russia is having to scavenge [drones from Iran now](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1546590787101663234).  The best way to put this into perspective is if the US decided to invade mexico, only made it to Tiajana and then had to start buying military equipment from Haiti.

👉 Only around [340,000 civilians remained](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1546549682809315335) in the Ukrainian controlled Donbas area, from a pre-war population of 1.67 Million.  This is around the same percentage of people that refuse to evacuate for Hurricanes or other natural disasters.

👉 In a quick equipment update: Ukraine put a [captured Pantsir](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1546492983821869059) anti-aircraft to work and it's scored it's first kill.  Czechia slipped a little something extra in their [shipments of RM-70 MLRS](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1546455028554244096).

👉 Insightful Reading: Just as russia is getting a crash course in the failings of their military, the western nations are getting a crash course in their [failure to tend to the basics](https://twitter.com/shashj/status/1546514989875400704).

📡 Under the Radar:  The first foreign ships made their way to Ukrainian ports through the [Danube, Black Sea canal](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1546589018799935488) thanks to the recent liberation of Snake Island.  This is the first step to helping Ukraine start exporting stored grain to make way for new harvests to help the looming food crisis.

📌 Put a Pin in it: The russian Duma (congress) has been called back into emergency session on [July 15^th](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1546582602404057089).  Speculation is that russia **might** actually get around to declaring war so it can mobilize troops and equipment.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has no clear war objectives and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Current state of the war: a stalemate that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 12 July 2022
 


- Russian troops continue to make small incremental territorial gains in Donetsk oblast with Russia claiming to have seized control of the town of Hryhorivka. Russian forces also continue their assault along the E-40 main supply route towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, Russian forces are likely maintaining military pressure on Ukrainian forces whilst regrouping and reconstituting for further offensives in the near future.



- Russian Armed Forces' personnel shortages may be forcing the Russian MOD to turn to non-traditional recruitment. This includes recruiting personnel from Russian prisons for the Wagner Private Military Company. If true, this move likely indicates difficulties in replacing the significant numbers of Russian casualties.

Russia should have won this war in days if Ukraine’s government had fled. When that did not happen, they should have won it in weeks. However, they failed at all the details that a military should be good at doing - basically, logistics. And they didn’t simply fail in a small way. They failed to move troops and supplies into an occupation force before Ukraine could get its act together and respond. So they failed at both Plan A and Plan B, in a big way. 

Now Russia is fighting a more unified Ukraine force, led by competent people, and a population led by a popular president who is able to appeal to the west for vital equipment and other assistance. In addition, Ukraine has a steady supply of modern military equipment which it would be unable to build fast enough on its own, even if it had the industry to do so. To a casual observer, Ukraine’s armies appear to be better trained, better led, and better supplied than the army which they are fighting. 

Also, this war is occurring on Ukraine‘s home ground. In this aspect, Ukraine is more like the Soviet Union in World War II, fighting Germany, then is Russia in this analogy. 

Last, though Russia has a larger army, it does not appear to be using it to its advantage. I think this is due, in part, to Putin’s reluctance to initiate a mass mobilization. He appears genuinely afraid of alienating his own citizens. Ukraine does not have this problem, despite the smaller size of its army. Ukraine’s significant level of unity and purpose probably rest on its inspiring, improbable victories, as much as on any one person.

Looking at all of this, while Russia should be able to move slowly but persistently over Ukraine, I don’t think they’re going to be able to do so. The question is whether they can retain their current position on the map, or whether they retreat. 

Looking at all of this with a limited knowledge of a Redditor, I think Ukraine’s ultimate fate rests in the hands of the west and NATO. If the US, and other NATO allies, continue to supply and replace Ukraine‘s military with new weapons, as fast as they are destroyed, I think Ukraine can win and regained all of its territory. And if we failed to supply Ukraine they will lose. By lose, I mean that Russia will win, and will take all or most of Ukraine‘s territory, absorbing it into Russia. I think this is the one decisive issue - the supply of weapons to Ukraine from NATO countries. Ukraine’s win is not inevitable.

Civilian targets near military targets are certainly going to get hit sometimes. That is part of gauging the accuracy.  If it is not reported then you cannot trust the sources at all.  

The US government precedent I remember from bombing Serbia was that military targets are legitimate regardless of what is nearby.  So, for example, they hit an intelligence agency office building and the cruise missile actually hit the intended structure.  The blast wave knocked in the windows of a nearby maternity ward.  Serbia complained.  USA said that was completely within the rules we would play by.  Also in same bombing campaign we hit the Chinese embassy which was the intended building but intelligence that was several decades old.  That was error.  Apology sent. Then the weirdest was a tomahawk missile that hit Sophie in Bulgaria instead of hitting Belgrade.  Software glitch. 

The exact quote from the late secretary Albright: ""we will not tolerate the use of human shields"".  It is clearly stating that we would kill civilians that we knew were present.  Also makes clear it is not direct targeting of civilians.  

War is not a thing people should do.  Reporters should report things that happen in wars.  People who should not get hurt do get hurt.  Reporters are not judges determining guilt.

All things remaining static as they are? I'd be willing to say Ukraine's win is inevitable. However, there's a LOT of things that can impact the state of things and flip that.

The upcoming midterm elections in the US, for example. There's a very real risk that the GQP will secure enough of a majority to halt US aid to Ukraine. MOST likely though, the halt would be temporary until Biden caved on giving them something they want in exchange for reversing the halt. While that wouldn't be directly crippling, due to the rest of NATO, it could cause some serious problems.

There's always the possibility that Zelenskyy gets assassinated and his replacement is missing some indefinable aspect that is necessary to keep things going as they are.

And ultimately, there's the literal nuclear question. Just exactly what WOULD the NATO nations do if Russia drops a tiny ~5 kiloton bomb somewhere?

not sure what they are actually doing, but (using us states since i don't know how to spell all the ukrainian names) if they trained all the NC guys in an M109, all the SC guys in an M777, and Georgia guys in caesars, etc and just ran all the supplies through that way they wouldn't have as much of a nightmare as long as after training they went back ""home"" with the equipment and supply line in place with whatever else is headed there daily",False,1657674023.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_ifxfo6m,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

That's why so many nations are donating M113 armored personal carriers to try and reduce that logistical burden. They're old but they built 80,000 of them and a lot of nations bought them so there are a lot of spare parts floating around as well as just a lot of them that various countries have in storage to donate. That also means there are lots of M113's to strip for parts if you need to do that. The drivetrain is an older design so apparently simpler than modern designs and easier to repair.

Then they have been trying to get as many M777's and M109 variants to Ukraine as possible so that at least a large chunk of their new artillery force is somewhat standardized. These are also used by many nations and have had many produced, over 7,000 M109's were made for instance, so spare parts should be less of an issue there as well.

Also as they said they already set up a repair and maintenance facility for M777 across the border in Poland I would heavily wager the same thing has been done for a lot of this donated equipment. Sure it's an extra burden to get it to Poland but since I would think most Ukrainian repair and maintenance facilities are already deep in western Ukraine to lessen the chance of being hit that it isn't as big a deal to drag it another hour or two to be repaired just across the border in Poland. I bet if you don't mind living in Poland for a bit there are some nice contracts available right now for any ex-military personnel that know how to fix an M109 or M113  ...

No doubt it does suck when something simple is broken on a T-72 or BMP that they could fix close to the front line but they can't and need to send it far away to be repaired but of course better to have something that is a pain to fix than to not have it at all, especially when it comes to heavy weapons that you need to fight the Russians.",False,1657673866.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_ifxfo6m,,2,15,0,15,0,0,

not so much, actually. 

Watch oil prices.  Period.

The danger is; if prices stay high, inflation stays high, and central banks will want to try to raise interest rates to control it, which will kill business and employment.

If we get a little price relief from oil, then things will be fine.  Longer-term, heading into the winter is where we may run into trouble, because that's when Russia will try to blackmail Europe with winter heating gas, which will drive prices up. If western central banks don't take the bait, we'll probably be fine. 

Russia will probably do this regardless of the military outcome in Ukraine.

HIMARS can do things, particularly as related to range, that the M777 and M109 cannot do. The M777/M109 tops out at 30 km range when using rocket assisted projectiles. The current range HIMARS grants Ukraine is 50 km. That brings a LOT more of Russia's assets into range, which is going to force them to push their logistical bases MUCH further back from the front than they are capable of.

If the US were involved in a conventional war, then we might go ahead and do something like fire off a full pod with each rocket targeted onto an individual artillery position or machine gun nest and damn any potential questions of cost efficiency, because we have money to burn.

But in Ukraine, they don't have that luxury, so they are using them against high value targets that is going to hamper Russia's ability to operate effectively. Most of those targets are the ammo dumps we're enjoying watching go sky high, but sometimes that involves blowing up command-and-control facilities. Russia has a very centralized command structure, one that just can't function currently if forced to spread out. From a financial perspective, those ammo dumps going up almost certainly represent many tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, of assets. So the trade is still very much in the West's favor.

It's not likely a realistic scenario either. They'd have to keep a sufficient force in the air 24/7 to realistically have a hope of being in position to pounce on a HIMARS they located. It only takes HIMARS something like 2 minutes to pack up and go. After that it can sprint away on roads at over 50 mph (probably faster). Let's say these drones can move 500 mph (I have no idea, but my assumption is they are slower. Handing over ""1000 drones"" smacks to me of being propeller powered, but I'm using more pessimistic values here). The whole front in Ukraine is over a thousand miles long and they are moving the HIMARS system around as much as they can. Lets say Russia wants to make sure the planes are worst-case within 10 minutes of any potential HIMARS sighting. That means you'd have to be flying these flocks of drones every 100 miles along the front. That's already putting you in the position of at most 20 drones per flock (40 if you assume two adjacent groups jump at the same spot) assuming the front is ""only"" 1000 miles long. But you also have to take into account that there's going to be downtime for these aircraft. Fueling, maintenance, etc. So realistically you won't actually have the entire swarm of 1,000 aircraft in the air at any particular moment, which means fewer that can pounce when you need to. And ultimately, these craft are going to suffer attrition at the hands of Ukrainian air defense capabilities.

Even if the planes were sitting on a street somewhere, ready to take off, it wouldn't likely work as well as you'd want. The time it would take to recognize that a given attack was HIMARS, then communicate this information to the relevant people, who then have to communicate it to the drone groups, etc gives extra time. With the 50 mile radius mentioned, that's already giving the HIMARS trucks time to get 3-5 miles away from the launch point (~2 minutes to pack, the rest to run) assuming the planes were already in the air. Adding in the time it would take to get all the drones in the air then approach the target in a coordinated fashion, the HIMARS trucks could very well have moved 10 miles or more from the launch position by the time the drones got into position. So now they'd have to spread out and start looking for them. Ultimately, the likelihood is that they wouldn't find it because it's either just flat out gone, or it's hidden in one of a thousand suitable buildings in that 10 mile range.

Now, lets assume the BEST case scenario for Russia, and through a combination of factors (like under-serving low priority areas and over-serving high priority areas) they DO manage to make this work once or twice. The obvious response from Ukraine is to make the next time one hell of a trap. Hundreds of soldiers with shoulder fired rockets, dozens of proper SAM systems all waiting for the order to light up their radars and go to town, etc. A huge portion of that drone flight would get taken out, and the 1-2 HIMARS that Ukraine will have lost would almost certainly have been replaced fairly immediately. The US has something like 500 HIMARS trucks in its inventory and the orders to begin producing more have almost certainly begun. Losing a couple is nothing when it comes to the available supply.

In all likelihood, Russia won't be doing massed air attacks with these and will be applying them in a more generalized sense. Plus, there's no guarantee the deal is actually going to go through. Iran almost certainly wants to get paid for these drones. If the West sanctions Iran for more than they are getting from Russia, Iran might pull the deal. Quite honestly, if I were a betting man, Iran never intended to go through with this plan and instead they WANTED the West to find out about it so when we send our diplomats to deliver the ""Strongly Worded Letter"" publicly, once the door shuts, the question will be asked ""What will it cost us for you to just not do this?"" and the haggling begins.",False,1657617743.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_iftwaru,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Flying back-and-forth from base and the front-line is a lot slower than delivering either shells or rockets to the frontline. Not only slower, but also more expensive.

I wouldn't QUITE put it that way, but more specifically, Russia's logistical system is designed based around strategies and tactics that they just aren't using partly because they don't have the manpower and partly because the world doesn't work like it used to.

Russia's military strategy operates on the Soviet era strategy.

 * 0) Force the enemy to a stop (skip this step given they are on the offensive here).

 * 1) Slam forward as far as you can with a general offensive until you hit significant resistance.

 * 2) Dig in and defend while in your back area the rail battalions place the rail needed for the supply trains to get to the front, while mustering the next wave.

 * 3) Once the supplies are in place and the next wave ready, the new wave attacks forward through the first line's defenses.

 * 4) Repeat from Step 1 until you've taken the whole enemy nation.

On the DEFENSE, their logistical ability to move resources around in their own nation between prepared locations and in massed quantities is actually pretty decent. Literally all their major military facilities are linked by rail for this reason. On the offense though, the two problems they have are thus:

 * 1) They can't actually bring supplies as close to the front as they could in WW2. Back then you could functionally drive your trains up to within a few miles of the front and probably not have much of an issue. Then trucks, horses, or even hand-carrying of supplies could get the stuff to the front without much delay. Even before HIMARS showed up, this wasn't possible for Russia. Even the field artillery Ukraine had at the start can chuck shells a good 8-9 miles, and that's assuming they aren't some of the rocket assisted shells that can reach out to ~12 miles.

 * 2) Russia doesn't actually have the combat force strength necessary to work this way. As such, instead of the exploratory wave in Step 1 being measured in the tens of thousands, we get those little forces of like 2-5 tanks with ~2 APCs for the foot soldiers, and a couple trucks in attendance. People were wondering what's going on with Russia just sending these tiny groups into the grinder of Ukraine's defenses for no gain. It's because THAT was the Step 1 force, which was supposed to reach a point, stop, hold, and wait for everyone else to slowly come up from behind. Instead, they barely had enough forces to hold a position for a few minutes, much less a day or more. Worse, because of Russia's communications problems, many of these groups literally had no way to call back to let anyone know they'd actually reached a position they could hold. They have so few men available that they CAN'T have second waves prepping. New recruits tend to be useless at first, so they can really only be expected to hold areas that have been taken while your exhausted and spent attacking group is the one that needs to start prepping to do what they just did all over again...and again...and again. We're already hearing morale problems from forces that have been on that sort of attack pace since Day 0.

To put the scale of Russia's lopsided manpower problem into perspective. When Germany launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, they had approximately 3 MILLION soldiers involved in advancing the 1,800 mile long front. That works out to each individual soldier being responsible for 1.5 meters (or 5 ft) of the front. When Russia attacked Ukraine, they tried to open a front that was around 2,800 miles long with only about 150,000 men, each soldier responsibly for 30 meters/100 ft. Almost twice as long with less than 10% as many soldiers. Just imagine how long 100 ft is, now imagine that you by yourself are responsible for BOTH holding that land if attacked AND for advancing forward and taking territory from prepared defenders. The guy on either side of you can't help, they have their own 100 ft to worry about. While not literally the situation Russia has, it puts into stark contrast things.

Now, all this leaves aside that Russia's ""modern"" logistical system has taken some VERY peculiar steps back from the Soviet era. Namely...Russia's military seems to have nearly entirely just done away with the pallet system. Instead of loading boxes of ammunition/equipment onto pallets, securing them, and then moving the pallet's with forklifts, they have this weird obsession with using two-man carry boxes. As the name implies, these are boxes that require two men to lift and move them. Nearly a CENTURY ago the US military did an experiment. A standard sized cargo train car was loaded with gear you might expect in any random logistics shipment. A full team of the sort normally tasked with offloading such a vehicle was assigned to offload it as fast as they could. Working through the night, it took the team something like 30 hours to offload the entire railcar. They then repeated the test but with a forklift (fun fact, forklifts were invented in 1917!) and pallets. It took about 2 hours to do. Further perplexing is that what trucks they have (and the numbers of those are somewhat baffling as well) almost never have integrated cranes. In the US military we've got somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of all transport trucks equipped with cranes, such that even if our military forklifts (yes, those are a thing) aren't available, we can still use the crane to offload the pallets. You can even use the one crane to offload OTHER trucks if you had to.

Russia's truck situation is, as said, somewhat baffling. Vehicles like tanks, APCs, etc require a LOT of truck capacity to support. In fuel alone, even if ignoring ammunition, food, water, etc. Russia's BTGs when at full strength actually have MORE vehicles in them than equivalent sized US military forces...and something like a third as many logistics trucks attached to them. So more load and less throughput. Now, theoretically this relates back to the trains. In an ideal situation, the trucks should never have to make a journey more than about ten miles away from the rail system. However, as previously discussed, they are having to operate at longer and longer distances. Almost for sure in the coming weeks those will be stretched like never before to deal with HIMARS. So those trucks can take fewer and fewer trips per day. Meanwhile, it takes almost an entire day to just load OR unload the truck. So you're in a position where those trucks in many situations are getting about a single trip in per day. Two if they are lucky.

I can't wait to see just how badly screwed up their logistics gets as they react to HIMARS.

I should note, incidentally, that one of the things we shouldn't need to worry about, is the rumor that on the 15th the Russian Duma might go in on a proper war declaration in order to throw more manpower at the situation. This is pretty much the WORST possible move they could make from a logistics perspective. Right now Russia's military logistics system is completely tapped out just supporting <200,000 troops in Ukraine. If they try to go full-Soviet and get their numbers up to where they need to be to operate like I described above, they'll literally starve their deployed military trying. Though a sobering point to make, is that they know this, so if they actually fully mobilize ANYWAY, that's a pretty heavy indication that they literally can't think of any other non-nuclear options to try and accomplish anything.",1657618017.0,1657612358.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_iftfuux,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

Russia is facing sanctions which cut it off western trade and supply chains in the next year and will then then roll over to pressure the rest of the world to end trading in the years to come.

Russia's failure to modernise over the last two decades have left it without the technological and manufacturing base to maintain and rebuild its army.

Pulling Ukrainians out of battle to train them could accelerate Russia’s gains, officials say. The Pentagon is also monitoring the levels of its own stockpiles.""

WASHINGTON — The Ukrainians say they need faster shipments of long-range artillery and other sophisticated weapons to blunt Russia’s steady advance. The United States and the Europeans insist more are on the way but are wary of sending too much equipment before Ukrainian soldiers can be trained. The Pentagon is concerned about potentially depleting its stockpiles in the coming months.  
  
The Biden administration and its allies are struggling to balance their priorities against Kyiv’s demands as Russian forces intensify their bombardment of cities and villages across eastern Ukraine, according to American and other Western diplomats, military officials and lawmakers.  
  
U.S. officials say Ukraine could mount a counterattack and claw back some — though not all — of the territory it has lost if it can continue to exact a bloody toll on Russia until new weapons can flow in from the West. But some officials are concerned that pulling too many Ukrainian artillery specialists off the front lines for weeks of training on the new weapons could weaken Ukrainian defenses, accelerate Russian gains and make any future counterattacks more difficult to carry out.  
  
“There are no good choices in a situation like this,” said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee. “You have to take your best artillery officers and enlisted personnel and send them back for a week or two of training. But in the long run, I think that’s probably the smarter move.”  
  
In addition, Pentagon officials have expressed concerns about hurting U.S. combat readiness if the war continues for months or longer. After two decades of mostly supporting counterterrorism missions, America’s defense industry largely stopped making the kinds of weapons Ukraine will need to survive a long war of attrition. The United States has authorized $54 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine and has sent more than $7 billion in weapons drawn from existing Pentagon stockpiles.  
  
Ukraine’s urgent requests come at a time when the United States appears to have reached the high end of the type of sophisticated arms it is providing. The next shipments are to include truck-mounted, multiple-rocket launchers called HIMARS, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and precision-guided Excalibur howitzer shells. But the fighter jets and advanced armed drones on Ukraine’s wish list have been shelved for now as either overly provocative to Moscow or too time-consuming for the Ukrainians to learn how to use.  
  
The nearly five-month war is at a critical moment, U.S. officials and others familiar with the intelligence assessments say. As many as 100 to 200 Ukrainian soldiers have died every day since Russia shifted its military campaign in the spring to focus on eastern Ukraine. But overall, about 20,000 Russians have been killed. Injuries have taken about 60,000 more off the battlefield. Nearly a third of Russia’s equipment has been destroyed in the war, according to Western officials, including several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.  
  
To replenish its military, Russia would have to mobilize more of its population, by making a declaration of war — officially the conflict remains a “special military operation” — or by moving troops and equipment from Russia’s Far North or Far East to Ukraine.  
  
That President Vladimir V. Putin has been reluctant to undertake either move is a sign that he believes time is on his side, officials say. Instead, the Kremlin is trying to fill its manpower shortfall with a motley mix of Ukrainians from the separatist territories, mercenaries and militarized National Guard units, and by promising large cash bonuses for volunteers.  
  
Mr. Putin might also think that Western support for Ukraine will soon reach its limit as Americans and Europeans grow more anxious about energy prices, which have spiked since the war began.  .........",False,1657647242.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_ifvr27u,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

This is questionable, but nevertheless are you suggesting that the Ukrainian people (and indeed their international allies) have not also been rallied pro-defence of their nation?

What do you mean by ""win""?  Russia's stated war aims keep shrinking, and it's no longer clear what a ""win"" for them even would be.  In any event, it's also looking like simply holding on to the territory they currently occupy could over time cost tens of thousands more Russian lives and billions of dollars.  I cannot see how that will be sustainable for Russia for even a few more months let alone the many years for which the West is preparing.  So it seems to me far more likely that Ukraine will win ""in the end"" (and by ""win"" here, I mean reestablishing its 2021 and perhaps even 2014 borders).

>Given that many countries operate more than 50 to 100 HIMARS or equivalent

This was my original point, many countries think they have the logistics capacity to support many system like HIMARS and equivalent such as the M270 which fire the same GMLRS pods. The arguments have all been about how many GMLRS pods can be shipped across Ukraine in a timely fashion. My points have been that other countries think they can feed many many GMLRS launchers in a time of war.

>Besides, the M270 is not the equivalent of HIMARS. M270s look like an absolute pain in the ass to field compared to a 5 ton truck.

And despite being a pain to operate Germany and Japan have 100 of such systems, egg on their faces for thinking they could maintain and feed such bests.

>There have been reports of the difficulty Ukraine has had with coordinating troops as is.

Tell me how this directly relates to moving 2.5 ton boxes, because I'm about to tell you how this doesn't directly relate:

Lets say Ukraine has 200,000 combat troops, they are maybe organized into 20,000 10 man squads, these potential 20,000 squads need to be equipped and supplied with a whole host of different things, guns, knee pads, magazines, tourniquets, rations, secure radios. These squads need to have transport assigned to move them to 20,000 different points within 1 km of the enemy under artillery fire and direct observation.

Contrast that to, a 2.5 ton rectangular metal frame with sling load points. To feed say 50 launchers for lets say 5 attacks per day each we are talking about 250 missile pods which need to be delivered to perhaps 25 or so temporary terminal distribution sites within 30km of the front line. So, each temporary site gets 10 packs brought to it every day to feed two launchers that operate off of that distribution site.

If we divide the combat zone up into 4 fronts with a designated rail head per front, we send a train to each rail head every day with ~16 cars with four pods on each car for ~60 pods per train. From the rail heads the pods can be loaded into flat bed trucks with integral cranes that can take them the 100km to the distribution sites. A single flat bed truck with crane can probably make 4 round trips a day to the nearby distribution sites, so ~70 flat bed trucks with integral cranes is enough to carry 250 missile pods per day to all of the terminal distribution sites.

So in total we're looking at 4 small trains, 70 trucks, 140 skilled driver+small crane operators to take shifts in order to feed enough missiles to fire 6 missiles at each of 250 ammo dumps or command centers, or troop concentrations, or vehicle assembly areas per day.

Since each missile can be individually targeted, 4 small trains and 70 trucks could enable the pin-point targeting of 1500 targets per day.

That or retreat all the way back to Russia of course.  


Assuming these ammo dumps aren't the majority of Russia's entire ammo stockpile, they will take some time to build up more rearward dumps, and once setup they can resume operations with, pulling a number out of my but here, roughly 50% less ability to deliver artillery strikes due to the supply trucks having to make a round trip to a dump 80km away instead of a dump 40 km away.  


But if Russia can find a more trucks and more conscripts and more fuel, they could potentially just throw more machine and meat at the problem to maintain their original tempo.  


I think this would give Ukraine several days of reprieve, before Russia continues with its reduced capability which will give Ukrainian artillery and forces a bit more time to do their thing. But the fact will still remain, that even though Russia would take maybe twice as long to shell a town into the dirt, their trucks still need to be attrited to cut them off from supply, and their forces need to be hit directly to ultimately stop them.  


Right now the 8 or so HIMARS are doing a number on the Russian ammo dumps that are in range currently, but once those dumps are destroyed, the HIMARS will be left only able to hit much smaller intermediate dumps, barraks near the front, HQ's near the front and whatever clusters of men and equipment that are worth a volley. This is why I think Ukraine will benefit from having 25 or so M270s or 50 HIMARS or whatever ratio of the two give 50 pods worth of GMLRS launching ability to really cut the Russian army up.  


Of course, once Russia sets up ammo dumps 80km and more behind the front line, Ukraine can receive a hundred or so ATACMS and destroy every ammo dump Russia has within 300km of the front line and Russia can have its rate of fires cut to a 6th of their original capability.",False,1657667028.0,t3_vx1wqh,t1_ifwxoth,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

You could perhaps make the same argument for a GMLRS launcher versus a 155mm howitzer, a 2.5 ton GMLRS pod has six missiles, so roughly 420kg of cargo weight per missile, an M777's 155mm shell weighs \~50kg, so for the weight of 8 artillery shells you can fire 1 missile.

I have to wonder weather a pin point accurate missile with 182,000 tungsten fragments is ultimately going to do more damage on average than 8 artillery rounds. Even if it isn't more effective, it can be launched from safer positions further from the front line so will face less attrition and less loss of highly valuable trained crew.

This is a good point actually, I imagine it is similar for Ukraine, they likely move artillery rounds around on trucks and have a bunch of recruits man-handling each individual shell and charge. It likely takes a half an hour to load or unload a ton of ammo from a truck.

Whereas a GMLRS pod can be moved as a unit with a single small crane, it likely takes one person and less than 5 minutes to handle 2.5 tons of missile pod if they have the right equipment.

This is just it, the key argument you have for why Ukraine shouldn't operate more than 12 HIMARS is that Ukraine will only be provided with 12 HIMARS. 

What would you say tomorrow if Romania said that it is going to transfer its 52 HIMARS to Ukraine, would your argument then be that Ukraine must surely be able to logistically run 64 HIMARS because there are 64 HIMARS in the country. Were you saying a week ago that 8 HIMARS was more than enough because there were 8 HIMARS in the country?

>Exactly... practically every large western power.

Romania with a population of 22 million people and a GDP of 704 billion and a military budget of 5.6 billion believes it needs and can operate 52 HIMARS, Ukraine with a population of >40 million and a GDP of 584 billion and a military budget of 5.4 billion and on a war footing and huge western support and in an active war only can only run 12 though?

I'd dearly love to hear the western military leaders justify why they need so many systems if that number isn't required to fight off one of the largest armies in the world.

Edit:
I just noticed that Norway and the UK have or are sending 12 M270 launchers which carry 2 GMLRS pods each.
