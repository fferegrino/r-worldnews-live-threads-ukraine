Military Events:

The Russian military is reorganizing its military efforts in an attempt to remedy poor planning and execution based on erroneous assumptions about Ukrainians’ will and ability to resist.  Russian operations around Kyiv remain limited as logistics and reinforcements arrive but will likely resume in greater strength in the next 24 hours. Ukrainian military leaders said that they have used the pause to strengthen Kyiv’s defenses and prepare to defend their capital in depth. The Ukrainian military likely cannot prevent Russian forces from enveloping or encircling Kyiv if the Russians send enough combat power, but likely can make Russian efforts to gain control of the city itself extremely costly and possibly unsuccessful.

The Russian military has begun using area-attack weapons including tube- and rocket artillery in the city of Kharkiv, dramatically increasing Russian forces’ damage to civilian infrastructure and the number of civilian casualties. Unconfirmed reports indicate the Russian military is also using thermobaric weapons, which can have devastating effects, especially on civilian targets. Ukrainian resistance in and around Kharkiv remains determined, but it is unclear how long Ukrainian defenders can hold if Russia sustains or increases attacks of this variety coupled with ground attacks supported by arriving Russian reinforcements.

Russian advances in southern Ukraine remain slower than they had been in the initial days of the war, possibly due to Russian efforts to concentrate sufficient combat power to conduct decisive operations against Mariupol and, possibly, Zaporizhia. 

The next major phase of Russian offensive operations will likely begin within the next 24 hours and play out over the ensuing 48-72 hours. Ukrainian resistance remains remarkably effective and Russian operations, especially on the Kyiv axis, have been poorly coordinated and executed, leading to significant Russian failures on that axis and at Kharkiv. Russian forces remain much larger and more capable than Ukraine’s conventional military, however, and Russian advances in southern Ukraine threaten to unhinge the defense of Kyiv and northeastern Ukraine if they continue unchecked.

Russian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes and a possible fifth axis, discussed in turn below:

1)     Kyiv Axis: Russia deployed additional heavy forces and artillery it has so far failed to employ in assaults on the city to the western approach to Kyiv on February 27-28. Russian forces will likely launch a renewed assault on western Kyiv on March 1. Attacks by Russian light forces on the outskirts of the city failed to make progress on February 28. Ukrainian forces are unlikely to capitulate.

2)    Northeast Axis: Russian forces began using heavy artillery against central Kharkiv on February 28, indicating a dangerous inflection in Russian operations as the Kremlin chooses to use air and artillery assets it has held in reserve to date. Russian forces additionally resumed limited advances in northeastern Ukraine on February 28 after an operational pause on February 26-27.

3)    Donbas Axis: Russian and proxy forces resumed assaults on Ukrainian forces defending Mariupol from the east and deployed additional artillery and anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) assets to the Mariupol front line on February 28. Russian forces may attempt a renewed assault on Mariupol in the coming days. Russian forces likely intend to pin Ukrainian forces in place on the line of contact to enable Russian forces breaking out of Crimea to isolate them.

4)    Crimea Axis: Russian forces continued limited advances on two axes out of Crimea—north toward Zaprozhia and west toward Mykolayiv, reaching the outskirts of Mykolayiv on February 28. Russia may struggle to fully supply both axes of advance and may be forced to choose which advance to prioritize.

5)     Russian and Belarusian forces may be preparing for an additional line of advance from Belarus into Western Ukraine. The Belarusian 38th Air Assault Brigade deployed to Kobryn, near Brest in southwestern Belarus, on February 28. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on February 28 that there is a high likelihood of Belarusian forces joining Russian operations. ISW previously reported a Russian armored column assembling in Stolin, Belarus, on February 25 to support a possible advance into Rivne Oblast in western Ukraine. A Russian offensive in western Ukraine would likely seek to cut Ukraine off from ground shipments of Western aid through Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. However, Belarusian airborne forces would likely face similar difficulties to previous, failed, Russian airborne operations against Kyiv if they attempted airdrops.

Just leaving classified briefing on Ukraine crisis. A few takeaways that I can share:

1/ Confirmation that the Russians have fallen behind their timeline. Ukrainian resistance has been fierce and there have been multiple Russian equipment and logistics failures.

2/ DoD and DHS are pressing hard for Congress to end the continuing resolution and get a budget passed. There is no way for our national security agencies to be nimble enough to support Ukraine if they are operating on the 2020/21 budget.

3/ The ability to keep supply lines running to Ukraine remains alive, but Russia will try to encircle and cut off Kiev in the next several weeks. The fight for Kiev will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat.

4/ The U.S. and allies are coordinating to not only freeze the assets of Putin and his oligarch allies, but to seize those assets as well. This is likely a further step than Putin’s inner circle anticipated.

So, I have been poking around about the mercenaries in Ukraine, specifically former SOF. There's a good background article[^1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3nqb5/ukraine-war-foreign-fighters) on this issue you should all check out.

If you all remember, Zelensky called for a mandatory curfew [^2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60539122). The reason why was due to the fact that there were assassins sent out to kill him and other government officials as well as his own family.[^3](https://intelnews.org/2022/02/25/01-3159/) This is not the first time this has happened. Back in September, there was an assassination attempt on one of Zelensky's aides.[^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/12/24/what-we-know-about-remote-control-assassination-attempt-in-ukraine/?sh=20a81624c3fd)

So, back to the mercenaries. There's a sizeable group in Kyiv right now from the United States, France, and UK[^5](https://www.instagram.com/p/CahBNC-sK5y/). I have been trying to find out if there are any former JTF2 members in the group, but it seems like there aren't any at the moment. Why is this interesting? Because they are made up of former SEALS, Green Berets, 75th Rangers, SAS, SBS, SASR. If you scroll through that guy's profile, you can see various patches denoting these kinds of connections. There are even some in Kherson right now. [^6](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/t2ry59) Some of them come from the company known as the Forward Observations Group.

Now, obviously, they aren't going to give away any details of their assignments or roles in Ukraine. But one thing they do very well is ambushing and forward observation. Indeed, Russians are getting first-hand experience of what that kind of military training, skill, and intelligence is like when they were confronted by foreign attackers.[^7](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/t2qg90/russian_invaders_tell_with_horror_how_ukrainians/)

What does this have to do with Zelensky's curfew mandate? Well, it appears that one of the reasons for implementing the curfew was to snuff out any saboteurs.[^8](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-saboteurs-spark-suspicion-solidarity-in-ukraine-kyiv/) It would not surprise me if the other reason was to utilize these SOF to isolate and hunt down assassins using the western mercenaries, including the one linked on Instagram. These guys are there to hunt, as they have fought against them in the past[^9](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html). They aren't there to just play war.

Russian forces have launched rocket attacks that killed “dozens” of civilians in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, and began a renewed assault on the capital Kyiv.

At least nine people have been killed, including three children, and 37 wounded in one day after the shelling in the Kharkiv, the city’s mayor said.

The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Satellite images taken on Monday show a Russian military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64 km), Reuters reports.

Russia used a vacuum bomb on Monday in its invasion of Ukraine, according to Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US.

The United States has promised more sanctions against Russia and more weapons for Ukraine’s military, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.

The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead.

Canada will supply upgraded ammunition and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, prime minister Justin Trudeau said.

The Ukrainian president has called for a no-fly zone for Russian missiles, planes and helicopters following the attack on Kharkiv.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy also signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. A senior EU official said leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March.

Ukraine has opened its border to foreigners willing to fight. 
Ukraine’s president has issued a decree temporarily lifting requirements for entry visas.

Fifa and Uefa have suspended Russia’s national and club teams from all international competitions until further notice.

The US will expel 12 Russian diplomats, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security.

High-level talks between Ukraine and Russia that took place on the border with Belarus on Monday morning ended without a breakthrough. Both sides agreed to keep the negotiations going and a second round of talks could take place in the coming days.

Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, and thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.""(9) Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that because the ""shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue...it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate.”

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646100099.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Reminds me of Russo-Japanese War


Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. **For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan** caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy.[90] Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. **Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917**. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000–300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest.[91] Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement (in particular, Józef Piłsudski) sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising.[92][93]

In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.[94]",False,1646100721.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

The question for the up and coming days is whether Russia will commit to a traditional, full-scale war against Ukraine now that its play at ""cheap, dirty, and quick"" is over, or whether it will step back from the edge and negotiate.

Either way, the fact that so much effort was spent on hiding the war from the Russian public and, for that matter, from the junior members of the Russian armed forces, is revealing and will have consequences. 

It shows that Russians don't really want this war and the country isn't behind Putin on it. The maximum support we've seen is for the annexation of the eastern separatist regions; even there, it's only about 60% of people support it. 

So going forward, if Putin decides to double down and prosecute this as a traditional war with the full power of the Russian military, it's going to be contrary to his own political interests both in Ukraine and at home.

For this reason, I think we should see a negotiated settlement in the coming days, but not before Putin has tried to scare the rest of the world that he's serious.",False,1646104044.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

fa440be8d8428640044e9cf9660712b6,t3w9ox,hyuzbq8,"For all ya armchair math magicians, for the 40 mile long convoy, let's use some math to figure out roughly how many vehicles there are.

Assuming they're driving single file, [like in the picture here](https://twitter.com/evanhill/status/1498453745352519681/photo/2), there's ~50 vehicles.

Let's then figure out how long that distance right there is. 

[Thankfully Google Maps is a thing, and you can measure the distance between two points!](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/50.9203915,29.8874643/50.9197115,29.9010255/@50.9196956,29.8911653,729m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0) So we got 1km long. 

40 miles is about 64km. That means, if you were to use exactly the same spacing, you're talking about around 3,200 vehicles. But realistically, as the other images show, they're not all spaced that close together and since this picture is a bend, you're vehicles are going slower and closing the gap.

[So take this picture for example.](https://twitter.com/evanhill/status/1498453745352519681/photo/1) 

I can't find the location, but if I use my sausage finger to try to figure out the amount of vehicles that can fit total in that road, it's about 45 total vehicles that can fit assuming you no meaningful distance between each. But instead, you have about 7 total vehicles which means the spacing is around 6-7 vehicles rather than the one in the first picture. So that means the density is 1/7th to be conservative.

That puts us between 500 and 3200 vehicles. Midpoint of 1850.

TL;DR a fuckton of vehicles, probably not 5,000+.",1646100992.0,1646100948.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

Russia took Ukraine lightly on the war, they thought they had the support from the citizens of Ukraine. They aimed that UA was underequipped only posing little resistance.  
Knowing that they do not want Russians back at home to know what they're doing, they kept the skirmishes small, and charged in thinking Ukraine was easy pickings instead of a conventional war approach.  
Result: Absolute failure on catastrophic levels and Ukraine, using proper propaganda and informationa channels crushed Russia thus far.  
The defenseless convoy lines have been obliterated by drones and air strikes, every corner has met resistance from citizens and UA has proven to be formidable.  The world reacted harshly tearing up the Russian economy and giving a giant setback.  
Adaptation: To protect its economy, MOEX has shutdown its market. I expect it will do so until the war clears and Putin (as arrogant as he is) believes Ukraine will be in a place that he wants them to be in within the next week. Crazy as it sounds, we are only day 4 into the war.  
Russians will start to use more of their conventional army approach and become more cautious. Their convoy moving at a snail pace means they're not moving recklessly, probably setting up AA/radar with every ground they cover. As witnessed by Kharkiv, they have resorted to their usual methods of aerial bombardment disregarding cilivian life using an air force that has been largely untouched to establish control.  
 It is logical to assume that orders will be brought in to the CoC to be more aggressive, and taking objectives with impunity.  
I honestly believe the next 72 hours will be scary and catastrophic, especially for Kiev.",False,1646100143.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Yes, Ukraine has give Russia hell but, people seem to forget invasions can take weeks and months to succeed. Sometimes years. We're 5 days in and it isn't like the Russians haven't made any ground. They're knocking on the door at Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson. They've secured southern access to the Dneiper. If they obtain full air superiority, even if it takes a few weeks, what's to stop them from cutting the Eastern front off and obliterating them?

Once the cities are under full siege, the Russians can starve the populations and any armies they're sheltering out. It doesn't look like Kyiv is far from that. And if their rate of territorial acquisition holds constant from the last 5 days, they could have Eastern Ukraine in weeks.

They've even talked about destroying supplies moving into the region from neighboring countries. If someone else doesn't intervene, I legitimately do not see Ukraine being able to sustain their territorial integrity in the long term.

I fully support Ukraine but, I don't feel as optimistic in the long run as some of you do.

Average distance between vehicles = 8’, but let’s assume 20’ to account for larger random air-attack gaps in the convoy

ed069749f9bc3eb6172a3a2f0149dabd,t3w9ox,hyux3nh,"For whatever reason, Putin saw a weakness in both in Ukraine and in the willingness to act from the West.

**Why was Putin looking for that weakness?** Well, Putin must have thought there was a chance, no matter how tiny it may have been, that either Ukraine would relinquish their claims over both the contested regions of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region, or the EU and/or NATO would forgo their requirement that a country be stable in order to be considered for admission. Ukraine may have still relinquished their claim over the contested regions regardless. Maybe they'll think it's better to be safe and stable, then to be neither just so that they can continue to hope that they'll be able to someday wrestle back from Russia those newly discovered oil and gas resources in the Black Sea and in the Donbas region.

**In the short-term**, Ukraine joining EU would impact Russia's revenue streams from their own supply of oil and gas through Ukraine. It would also likely undermine Russian claims over newly discovered substantial oil and gas reserves in the Black Sea near Crimea, and elsewhere in Ukraine.

**In the long-term**, Ukraine joining NATO would impact Russia's defensive footing in the west. Ukraine presents a huge hole in Russia's defenses. Should a future ever arise where nuclear deterrence is no longer effective for some reason, and/or the political landscape of Europe and elsewhere has changed in ways we cannot predict, then Russia will want to have all those geographic boundaries they had previously enjoyed prior to the collapse of the USSR. Reconnecting to more of the Black Sea and returning to the Carpathian mountains (especially after Moldova falls, which would be an inevitability should Ukraine fall), would be completely faithful to centuries old Russian doctrine that dictates Russia should surround themselves with as many geographic barriers as possible.

Putin is not just thinking about Russia though. If the chance that Ukraine would join NATO or the EU was not 0% even after his own death, then it was a threat to his own legacy. He was the one that failed to keep Ukraine. It must really burn in his mind that he lost Ukraine, because he believes so passionately that Ukraine is Russia, and that the Russian Empire's original reach and might should be restored as much as possible. Russia had Ukraine in the bag as far as Putin knew. Whether or not the West had their hand in the 2014 revolution is not something I'm going to weigh on, but, whatever happened, Russia lost.

**As a result, in my opinion, there are 2 short-term goals for the invasion:**

1) Capture as much land near Crimea and along the southern region, in order to both enhance Russia's claim over present and newly discovered oil and gas resources in the Black Sea, and also enhance the security and welfare of Crimea and of the Crimean military base. Recall that Crimea currently has no land-bridge to Russia, and no fresh water, since the latter was cut-off by Ukraine. Crimeans may eventually revolt against Russia if fresh water continues to elude their lands. A revolt would jeopardize Russia's oil and gas claims in the Black Sea, and would also undermine the security of their own naval base which is crucially the only warm-water port that Russia has in the west. That could all change after this war, and might very well be the primary objective of the conflict.

2) Optimally, overthrow the Ukrainian government, and install a puppet regime. Restore Ukraine to pre-2014 revolution status as a Russian puppet state. The goals mentioned above will be satisfied, oil and gas revenues from the pipelines running through Ukraine can be absolved of any of the fees that are currently enacted upon them, and Russia can also tap into the newly discovered oil and gas reserves near the Donbas region and in the western part of Ukraine.

I honestly believe Putin must think he has his 1st short-term objective in the bag, and overthrowing the Ukrainian government would just be a bonus and/or is just a distraction in order to more fully achieve his ambitions in southern and eastern Ukraine.

Putin might just be considering that by taking a shot at Kiev and/or other larger cities, and perhaps succeeding even just partially, that it will give him more leverage to legitimize Russia's claim over the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine and her resources, restore fresh water to Crimea, and/or reduce/eliminate fees on the oil and gas supplied through Ukraine from Russia.

**The more land Putin can capture elsewhere in Ukraine, the more he gets to bargain with in order to get sanctions lifted, etc... while still realizing his southern and eastern Ukraine ambitions. However, can the world make Russia suffer enough economically from sanctions and suffer enough militarily from increased supplies to the Ukrainian army? Can the Ukrainian army continue to show the same resolve they have so far? Will it all be enough that eventually Russia simply loses the fight, and/or self-implodes politically? That remains to be seen, and may be the crucial part that Putin may have miscalculated when he assessed that Ukraine and the West were to weak to adequately resist.**

**2 longer term goals would also be achieved if either of the 2 short-term goals are met:**

\- Strengthen defensive footing along the west of Russia.

\- Open the door for future covert projects in Moldova, and other countries neighboring Ukraine and abroad.",1646100427.0,1646099932.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

Helos don’t like bullets at all. Second a Carpet bomb would work but I bet the Russians have jets circling to combat any kind of air craft intervention. The best way to counter it would be to gather as many howitzers and artillery missles as you can and TOT (time on target) at a future location. If the column is as stretched out as it’s claimed that will only take a couple of vehicles out before the Russians start moving in a way that would prevent a lock by artillery. However you could easily just hammer them all the way in assuming Russias counter batteries don’t annihilate you in the process. To prevent that they would have to shoot then move then set up again and shoot and move and repeat. Also the Russians can send helos to get the locations of the artillery and send their own artillery that way. It’s a tough situation.,False,1646103009.0,t3_t3w9ox,t3_t3w9ox,,0,-23,0,-23,0,0,

I don't think the reason why the United States isn't willing to enter Ukraine is solely related to the use of nukes.  Russian military doctrine doesn't call for the use of nukes in a conventional conflict that doesn't threaten Russian territory.

The bigger issue in the EU and in the US, dismaying as it may be, is that the populations of those countries  don't have the stomach to send people off to war.

Edit because sounds like a lot of people don’t know what they are talking about. Before the order can be processed by the military, the president must be positively identified using a special code issued on a plastic card, nicknamed the ""biscuit"".[7] The United States has a two-man rule in place at nuclear launch facilities, and while only the president can order the release of nuclear weapons, the order must be verified by the secretary of defense to be an authentic order given by the president (there is a hierarchy of succession in the event that the president is killed in an attack). This verification process deals solely with verifying that the order came from the actual president. The secretary of defense has no veto power and must comply with the president's order.[7]

I've been feeling we are nearing this point. Half of what they are doing is just butchering civilians with no clear goal. It's a shit situation, the nuclear threat could potentially be devistating but it feels like Putin's anger is going to just turn into a genocide. 

If there was a clean way to assassinate Putin and some of his close circle I don't think the Russian population and a lot of the gov is interested in continuing this. But if that failed it would absolutely result in WWIII. Really, really crossing my fingers for 1917 round 2 but we will see.

besides the fact that ukraine is using it to good effect with live cams, tracking google maps for their movements and the people (and president) using social media to communicate quickly, i realise that social media also allows ordinary russians to access information that may be previously not available if there was no internet and just the usual state backed media on TV, newspapers, and radio to follow.

it does makes me wonder, how much of the previous wars like WW2 and before was fought  because of the sheer amount of misinformation that was supplied by each side's government to its people. if you have no access to internet, and you are constantly fed that the other side are ""brutal enemies"" and ""will kill you on sight"", and you have been in only your country your entire life, no doubt you would believe your government more than doubting them.

contrast this to today, just one short video of russian soldiers laughing with a Ukrainian civilian about a joke (im referencing the one where the driver offered to tow the tank that ran out of gas back to russia) is enough to show the public that both sides dont want this war and immediately removes the fear, tension, and hostility of the other party for many people.

It does, but only when NATO or a competent air force is around. Russia is doing this against Ukraine because it can and Putin gambled that NATO wouldn't intervene.

It may cost him hundreds or a few low thousands number of troops, but if it helps him achieve his desired goal of toppling Kyiv faster, he's willing to commit to it.

Also many people are getting carried away with the drones. Ukraine only has limited TB2 drones--many have been shot down, but some remain. TB2 drones only hold limited amounts of firepower. An A-10 or any US strike plane will carry far more ordinance not to mention the likely numbers we'd field to bomb a column like this.

Allies could… by way of Ukrainian planes drop packages from above. Landing in the city center.

Allies could drop packages to the West to soldiers who could re arm and then take out units on the West side of Kiev

It’s possible.

Equally we don't have information about Russia's ability to complete and maintain the encirclement. Troops, planes, etc.. Sieges are hard and they act as a ""force multiplier"" for the defender, allowing Kiev to shield their soldiers from attack and hold down a much larger attacking force.  Basically like an old medieval castle.

Just looking at a map, never having been to Kyiv myself, it looks like Russia is actually attempting to surround the hardest city in Ukraine. Kyiv has a large river that divides it and they have blown a lot of bridges. The two halves of the army needed to surround the city are going to have a hard time sharing supplies and moving troops between the areas.  Kyiv, meanwhile, will have interior lines allowing them to dictate when and where attacks will happen, allowing them to continually attack where Russians are weakest.

Might be easier just to try and encircle a smaller city on the south, destroy the garrison, and then move to the next city.

She clearly notes that history, whether we want it to or not, is very much repeating itself. Putin has the same goal as Hitler did. Hitler went after German speaking countries to rebuild the German Empire. Putin is doing the same thing.

WW2 didn't begin with the invasion of Poland. It began with the invasion of Austria. The world at the time didn't take the German threat seriously in the same way the world didn't take the Russian threat seriously when it invaded Georgia in '08.

She is correct, the only way we can end this is to destroy their economic through barring any business from doing business with or in Russia. However, that will likely provoke an attack. There might not be a way to punish Russia without provoking a military response and we may already be beyond that point.

1. Russia is not negotiating, continuing to lie and will not slow/stop, uses all engagements to sabotage and lie.
2.

Now with sanctions it's not just a dream, it's a necessity. They need to control the narrative through terror and force.
3. With 2. being true, the function of diplomacy is over and if Europe doesn't want to be overrun (and it doesn't) they have to convince the world community that Russia is coming for them, and they (and Russia itself) have done that.
4. If Ukraine is put into the EU/NATO or we establish a No Fly Zone over any of these nations, it's a declaration of war. But Russia has already declared this war, it's just up to the world community to see it and not pretend it's something else.
5. Russia logically upon seeing that action take place should back down and not behave like a rabid weasel, but either way, we gotta stop a rabid weasel.

I think one of the main reasons for such severe sanctions is to prevent other countries from thinking something like this is acceptable. With the weapons we have nowadays, war would probably end most of humanity. Peace is essential. We can’t go around colonizing places anymore and at least two other countries have their sights set on another. If we had let this go unchecked or with lighter sanctions, it would have encouraged these other countries and caused even more conflict. 

The hope here is that this action is enough to deter others and even the current invader without this war escalating further.

>The Russian [assault on Grozny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grozny_(1999%E2%80%932000\)) began in early December, accompanied by a struggle for neighbouring settlements. The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000. According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny. The separatist forces also suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders. Russian Defense Minister [Igor Sergeyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sergeyev) said that 2,700 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny. The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the [mine field](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_field) at [Alkhan-Kala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alkhan-Kala&action=edit&redlink=1).[[87]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War#cite_note-88)

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646105828.0,t3_t3w9ox,t1_hyv9fc2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

“Coincidentally”, a lot of this started a decade ago when gas reserves were discovered in Ukrainian, a lot of it off the coast in Ukrainians waters in the Black Sea. Ukraine entered into partnerships with Exxon and Shell to start extracting and refining… so Russia invaded Crimea, which caused Exxon and Shell to pull out and out a large portion of those reserves in contested areas. The “separatist” states in the East, being funded by Russia, are near the Eastern reserves, and not surprisingly, the “separatist” region that Russia is funding in Moldova is near Ukraines western reserves.

There is a huge difference between locals raiding an unattended store, which likely won't even exist anymore unless they win, to feed their families or resistance soldiers when their city is under siege and they have no other choices, and literal invaders raiding the city they're attempting to occupy.

Yet by saying what you said, undermining that narrative, you implied, regardless of whether you intended to, that if the video shows Ukranians, it's somehow just as bad but with Ukraine/Ukranians at fault, and furthered the notion that Russians are being blamed for Ukranian actions which is a top-tier dominant narrative they are currently putting out. **You** are contributing to that. People accused you of being Russian because this narrative and style of whataboutism, denial, claiming the other side did the things they're responsible for and ""playing devil's advocate"" are a well known Russian tactic.

If it's not a risk in that way, then calling it out right now, or at any point in the immediate future whereby someone else might be able to leverage the points you make to do harm, will usually do more harm than good through furthering Russian narratives and diminishing its propaganda value.",False,1646106282.0,t3_t3w9ox,t1_hyv5yai,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

Homes are replaceable if we have the money to do so in this case all of it is being sent to Ukraine.
