Day 207 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, and it hasn’t happened in about a week by now, so we are most likely out of range of their Uragans now, and they very rarely use Smerch. They still do missile strikes almost every day, but today there was no missile strike, at least not yet, but it is already very late, so it might not happen at all, hopefully it doesn’t.

They still continue to strike our critical infrastructure. Almost 2 hours ago, at 2am, they fired around 8-10 missiles at Zaporizhzhia, after the explosions some districts in the city lost electricity, which means they were aiming at power plants again. There are also some reports saying that some missiles were fired at one of our nuclear power plants, the one in Yuzhnoukrainsk, but there was no critical damage.

About that supposed protest in Belgorod, it doesn’t look like it happened after all. There were no news about it at all in Russian telegram channels, which is where it was announced in the first place, I guess not many people saw it, and those who did probably wouldn’t want to risk going to a protest anyway. 

I’m pretty sure they made some dumb law, which states that you cannot gather with more than 2 people in public. Not that long ago there were some news, where someone’s meetup, which had nothing to do with war, was stopped by the police just because there were more than 2 people present on it.",False,1663548394.0,t3_xh6g7x,t3_xh6g7x,,0,178,0,178,1,0,

1. Russia is running out of missiles and needs to scrap together more somehow, and using SSM capable AA missile systems as a substitute for proper cruise missiles is one possibility. Russia has already been using anti-ship missiles against land targets, and the S-300 in the ground attack role. 
2. Russia has lost so much of its AA capability in Ukraine that it needs to bring in more even from high-priority areas, increasingly cannibalizing its priority defence capability to keep fighting in Ukraine. 
3. Russia simply needs more AA capability yet for some reason didn't bother to bring these before the invasion or any time earlier during the invasion. 

I think #1 is the most likely explanation. They have limited stockpiles, they have limited capability to make more especially now with sanctions, they have used a lot of them on pointless terrorism, Ukraine has been getting better at shooting them down, and even when they are used against valid targets, the keyword in Russian missile is ""miss"". Russia will always keep a few advanced missiles in the reserve if they have any sense left, so I doubt Russia will literally run out, but they certainly can't afford to keep up a constant missile bombardment. 

Also, Russia being willing to take away missile defences from so close to the border in one of their top priority areas shows yet again that all their claims of the threat of NATO are nonsense.",False,1663488165.0,t3_xh6g7x,t3_xh6g7x,,0,159,0,159,0,0,

https://twitter.com/DrAlakbarov/status/1571653782664089600

> Vladimir Putin’s jet also landed in Uzbekistan – but president Shavkat Mirziyoyev was not there to welcome him, sending his Prime Minister Abdulla Oripov instead.

> On the frontlines in Ukraine, Russian forces are suffering from increasingly obvious manpower shortages that make a mockery of attempts to portray Russia as the world’s number two military power.

> The Kremlin has been forced to withdraw troops from deployments across the former Soviet states while also recruiting soldiers from among the Russian prison population.

> Russia’s withdrawal of nearly 1,000 troops from Armenia to bolster the faltering invasion of Ukraine was a signal to the countries of the South Caucasus that Kremlin influence in the region is in decline, which is likely to be filled by Turkey and other actors.

> Azerbaijan, which has pursued a multi-vector foreign policy and has not joined Russian-led initiatives, has used Moscow’s waning influence to bolster its geopolitical position in Karabakh and other areas of the South Caucasus.

> Even Georgia under pro-Kremlin oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili has not officially backed Ukraine over the Russian invasion and has instead joined Armenia in helping Moscow evade sanctions.

> Kazakhstan's president Tokayev said that Kazakhstan would not be recognizing the independence of the breakaway states in Eastern Ukraine that Vladimir Putin says he's liberating.

> Kazakhstan also didn't hold a military parade to celebrate the Soviet interpretation of its World War II victory
> Both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan expanded cooperation in rerouting energy supplies to Europe bypassing Russia.

> Long-serving Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov spoke out in support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, including in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea.

> In Moldova, which depends on Russian energy supplies and hosts hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees, President Maia Sandu said her government is following Russia’s actions in Transnistria with “caution and vigilance.”

> A few days after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Moldova applied for European Union membership, along with Georgia and Ukraine.

> Even Russia’s closest ally, Belarus, President Aleksandr Lukashenko only managed to survive a prolonged popular uprising in the fall of 2020 once he received support from Putin. 

> The collective grievances of Belarus’s society have not been solved.

> Despite Russia's objections, Russian only remains a state language in Belarus, although it retains the status of an official language in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan...for now.

> Azerbaijan switched from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet in the early 1990s while Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are at different stages of the same transition.

> Just four countries have joined the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union, and the intergovernmental military alliance the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) has 6 members, Russia included.

> Large pro-Ukraine protests were held in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Moldova. Even in countries like Kyrgyzstan, where the government banned anti-war protests, a few brave activists still filled the streets.

> Russian culture is losing its dominant position among younger generations in post-Soviet states. These more diverse and new generations are formed by domestic as well as foreign influences, whether from Turkey, the Persian Gulf, or Europe.

> Russia's weakening influence does not necessarily mean post-Soviet countries will seek a closer alignment with the West. 

> Political incumbents in Central Asia and the South Caucasus may be more inclined to seek closer ties with China and Turkey.

> Post-Soviet states are not pawns that are moved around on Moscow's chessboard.

> Russia’s neighbours are turning into active players in the international arena—and have not hesitated to play external powers against one another to extract maximum benefits.

> Central Asian states are becoming more like other countries in Asia and Africa—searching for multilateralism rather than solely attaching themselves to Russia.

> Russia is just becoming just another neighbour, along with the EU, China, Turkey, and Iran.

> More people in former Soviet states in Central Asia and the South Caucasus now see Russia as an agressive neighbour engaging in genocidal violence rather than as an historic ally. 

> And Moscow's imperialistic and nationalist crusade in Ukraine is boosting this negative image.

> It wouldn't surprise me if Uzbekistan like Kazakhstan in further undercutting Russian influence likely to develop energy infrastructure to pump oil and gas into existing networks that lead from Azerbaijan to Turkey and onward to Europe.

> In a nutshell, Ukraine and Moldova are now within the EU sphere of influence. 

> Azerbaijan has bolstered a strategic alliance with Turkey

> Georgia’s unnatural pro-Russian stance is going downhill.

> Meanwhile, China has replaced Russia as the preeminent power in Central Asia.

> Russia is just became China's junior partner after military fiasco in Ukraine and economic isolation from the West.

> And yes, it was Ukraine that is serving as the catalyst for Russia’s retreat and opened pandora's box for Moscow.",False,1663552448.0,t3_xh6g7x,t3_xh6g7x,,0,62,0,62,0,0,

The facts:

We invade our neighbour. The neighbour gets help from its neighbours and starts kicking our arse.

Russia’s “facts”:

“It’s not fair that other countries are helping Ukraine” - This not the lesson I get out of this. No, Russia is just getting what it deserves. Saying it is not fair that other countries are helping its intended victim just illustrates how illegitimate Russia’s acts are, and worse, that they are not in any way repentant of this. This is a great way to further motivate Ukraine’s allies to provide more military aid.

“It’s part of a much wider global war” - No, it’s not part of a larger global war. It’s simply that actions create consequences. When you act like a terrorist state, everyone hates you. Again, this just makes Russia look even more disconnected from reality and even more dangerous. Of course, this just motivates the world to push even harder against Russia.

“Russia can still win this” - No it can’t. It’s losing right now. Thanks to western aid Ukraine continues to get stronger and Russia has lost its best troops and equipment. Russia is practically now begging other countries to grind it’s remaining weakened forces into the dust.

“Russia has allies” - No it doesn’t. Iran, Belarus, and Syria want your money and are themselves panicking because their own despot regimes are going to be untenable once Russia falls. China, Turkey and India see you as a cheap source of resources. No one is your friend. Saying this just brings everyone’s attention to this fact.

“Ukrainians are Nazi’s and corrupt” - No. The Ukrainian’s actions during this war speak for themselves. They have been brave, organised and aggressive. Their behaviour on the battlefield has been remarkably honourable. The reality is now EU sees Ukraine as a future EU and NATO member precisely because of how unlike Nazis Ukrainians are. Again, this statement by Russia is only drawing attention to how much Russia’s current behaviour is like that of 1930s Nazi Germany.

“We might Nuke you!”. - No. At least, they better not. This is so dumb I don’t even know where to begin. Russia is now stating clearly it is unreliable and a danger to the world. It is announcing clearly to the world that it does not possess the responsibility or self-control to be a nuclear state. It is not possible to overstate how much damage these types of statements do to Russia’s future reputation and it’s ability to operate in the modern world. This mostly likely result of these statements is increasing longterm isolation and sanctions on Russia. It also means that if Russia goes through another collapse the world may even takes its Nukes off it. That would become a certainty if it was stupid enough to actually use a tactical nuke.

Russian propaganda is now so bad it is making Russia’s position on the world stage worse. These talking points push people and potential allies away from Russia.",False,1663538287.0,t3_xh6g7x,t3_xh6g7x,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

Why not? Russia bombs Ukraine, they can't expect Ukraine not to hit military and strategic infrastructure on the Russian side of the border. The UN charter says military action in self defence is always allowed, even collective military action. It'd be fully legal for NATO to go in and bomb Russia to smithereens, not that I think they should do that, but the point is there's no rule saying you can't attack a country that attacked you first.

Maybe it'd be an 'escalation' but it's not really an escalation to respond with a fraction of what the aggressor did to you. Russia can bomb Ukrainian civilians with absolute impunity but Ukraine can't try to prevent that by bombing Russia's air bases and ammunition inside Russia? I also very much doubt *this* Russian red line, that ATACMS means WW3 or whatever, is a real one unlike the hundreds of unreasonable red lines they drew, the west crossed and nothing happened. Russian military infrastructure in Russia getting bombed is in no way an existential threat to Russia. Countries have attacked and bombed nuclear armed states before without threatening their existence (India-Pakistan, Argentina invading the British Falklands), and those were in far less clear-cut cases of justified self-defence

Also good analysis on potential Ukrainian weaknesses - something it is easy for us to ignore, but necessary for a balanced view. 

For example, that the Ukrainian forces haven’t had the opportunity to train with all-arms tactics in large formations; and in their counteroffensive, they took risks which could have been fatal against a good opponent. 

Thing is, his analysis is that the Russian army simply is not capable of being a good opponent. Its problems run deep, and cannot be fixed without years of reform. 

The most telling part was when he said he got criticism from some for saying stuff that the Russians may find useful.

Scroll up here and see how Ukrainian troops is in Bilohorivka which his just west of Lysychansk.

But yes, taking Lysychansk would be completely insane but it is possible Russian troops weren't prepared and didn't set up proper defenses. Maybe they saw the Kharkiv collapse and just fucked off. 

One scenario is that a Ukranian soldier reported it as taken because they drove into the outskirts of Lysychansk or so and didn't at first meet resistance.

It is weird that Russians aren't freaking out about it on telegram but maybe they have PTSD from the ""there is no panic"" statements not having much of an effect and want to try and actually shut up this time.

It's not pejorative - just English being English. (From my perspective as a native English speaking American).

Some people would say 'The Ukraine' because they're used to saying 'The United States'.  This is especially true for Ukraine because there's just *something* about the pronunciation that somehow invites 'the' to proceed it...  I can't put my finger on exactly what - perhaps it's because it shares the same first phoneme as United from The Untied States ... which makes it feel correct even though it is not?

Regardless, definitely not pejorative and I haven't seen it heard anyone refer to Russia as The Russia.

Edit: this is regarding the Midwestern dialect - and in terms of 'The' Ukraine, when it's uttered, grammatically the '**T**' in **T**he Ukraine would also be capitalized, just as it is with The United States.  Anyone living in a area that speaks the dialect is welcome to go ask a neighbor or friend if 'The' should precede Ukraine and I can guarantee you that you'll encounter confusion and uncertainty.  It's not a matter of disrespect.

Edit 2: and, of course, if an American uses the term - generally it does not represent disrespect.  Instead, it's an opportunity for education, and that opportunity should be acted upon (politely, please, because the offense is *very likely* not intentional).

Lyman appear to be the current focus of the Ukrainians and Russians in this sector, the Russians threw in what they had available in order to hold Lyman, which so far has held, but their situation is becoming more difficult by the day with Ukrainians getting positions to attack the town from 3 different locations, creating a real opportunity to encircle the Russian units in the town.

*""from a diplomatic point of view, this is the public equivalent of being down on your knees licking boots, and Putin had to do it all. And at the end of it, the CHina didn't even really give anything back. There will be no tech transfer, there will be no weapons transfer, there will be no troops, Putin actually asked for troops. All that the Russians are going to have is the right to sell raw commodities to the CH at a horrific discount...*

*""So the CHina have basically turned Russia into a more loyal satrapy than North Korea has been, and that will absolutely have strategic consequences for both countries down the line""*

The enemies of liberalism are always shocked to find that people will fight for it

JANAN GANESH

Idealising his nation as only an immigrant could, Frank Capra was the natural pick. The brief: a series of propaganda films to shore up US public backing for the second world war. The “producer”: future saviour of immiserated western Europe, General George Marshall. The title? Why We Fight.

Think of the implicit insecurity here. The idea that western societies lack martial fibre is so beguiling that it gnaws at leaders of the west itself. And this is after Pearl Harbor had people queueing up to volunteer.

I am sure a contrarian finance bro will insist, if you look at the right geospatial data, from a certain angle, adjusting for media bias, that the invasion of Ukraine is going well. For now, though, it seems the Kremlin has put too much store in western decadence. Neither the resistance on the ground nor the staying power of its sponsors in the democratic world were bargained for. By way of consolation, Russia has plentiful historical company. Terrorist clerics, godless Marxists and other enemies of the west, or “Occidentalists”, share few beliefs. One is that free societies have an innate flakiness: a sort of will to impotence. Even as those enemies have failed to survive, the trope does.

I don’t pretend that the average westerner has read their Hume and Spinoza. I don’t even pretend they deal in such abstractions as “the west”. But there is a way of life — to do with personal autonomy — for which people have consistently endured hardship, up to and including a blood price. Believing otherwise is not just bad analysis. It leads to more conflict than might otherwise exist.


Kremlinologists report that Vladimir Putin saw the US exit from Afghanistan last year as proof of western dilettantism. From there, it was a short step to testing the will of the west in Ukraine. You would think that US forces had rolled up to Kabul in 2001, poked around for an afternoon, deplored the lack of a Bed Bath & Beyond, and flounced off. They were there for 20 years. Whatever the mission was — technically inept, culturally uncomprehending — it wasn’t decadent.

How much carnage has this misperception of the west triggered? The Empire of Japan couldn’t believe the hermit republic that America then was would send armed multitudes 5,000 miles away in response to one day of infamy. (And, remember, never leave.) The Kaiser in 1914 and Saddam Hussein in 1990 made similar assessments of the liberal temper. It is not out of vanity or machismo that the west should insist on recognition of its fighting spunk, then. It is to avert the fighting.

Last week, at a bar counter, I cycled through three small pours of white wine to find the right pairing for a mackerel and dill starter. I left in some pique at having failed to nail it. Don’t blame Occidentalists for questioning the mettle of a society of such risible comfort. We who live here don’t understand it either, which is why the decadence thesis haunts us with its intuitive plausibility. The culture that produced the Jazz Age shouldn’t have been able to take and hold Guadalcanal. Each month, I expect to see western exhaustion with Ukraine. Each month, the support persists. Seventy per cent of Germans tell pollsters that high gas prices won’t sap their will.

Why? The eternal error, I think, is to confuse the substance of liberalism (which is compromise-minded) with people’s attachment to it (which is far from compromising). Liberalism is sparse in content. It has no account of the good life, but rather allows competing ones to go at it within a framework of rules. If I say “socialist architecture”, for instance, you picture something concrete and rectilinear. What is liberal architecture? There are Islamic rules about sex and diet: a liberal can be celibate or wanton, a vegan or a regular at St Johns.

Occidentalists can’t believe that a creed that makes so few truth claims would inspire devotion. But here we still are, and here so many of them aren’t. The historical record is clear: it is possible to be committed to a political system that itself abjures commitment. Knowledge of the dire alternatives helps. In the end, rousing though it was, Capra’s work was squandered on a domestic audience. It is the other side that wonders why we fight.",False,1663535478.0,t3_xh6g7x,t1_ioz68l2,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

They can reach out farther with Soviet era cruise missiles, using Ukrainian enhancements for range and accuracy, like their Neptune R-360 missiles used to sink the Moskva: range 170 miles (280 km), warhead 330 lb ( 150kg), speed 900 km/h. https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/gearscout/2022/05/12/the-neptune-anti-ship-missile-the-weapon-that-may-have-sunk-the-russian-flagship-moskva/#:~:text=Although%20its%20900%2Dkilometer%2Dper,as%203%20to%2010%20meters. It is basically the Soviet KH-35, designed starting in 1983. This missile does not seem ideal for land targets, since it is designed to skim the waves at low altitude and might hit power lines or structures en route to target, then it is supposed to pick up the ship on radar, rather than one building among many, but it flies at hundreds of meters attitude during part of its flight. There is supposed to be a ground attack Russian version, KH35-U. The Neptune is designed to be fired 25 km from the sea. Ukraine had dozen of long range ICBMs in silos, while nuclear warheads were removed in 1991 in exchange for promises of peace from Russia. Ukraine was a major arms producer for the USSR, and likely has a goldmine of documents and designs to fabricate a variety of missiles. 

Drones are a very promising way for Ukraine to reach out at touch power plants and other infrastructure in nearby regions of Russia when Russia strikes Ukraine. Russian air defenses are likely degraded far below the Soviet level of 1987 when a teenage pilot named Matthias Rust, with 50 hours of flying experience, flew a single engine Cessna from Helsinki to Moscow, (farther than Kyiv to Moscow), circled Red Square, and landed, flying through Soviet air  space for about 5 hours. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Rust. 

Ukraine could likely produce domestic equivalents of the Bayraktor TB-2, with a 300 km/186 mi round trip range and 150 kg (330 lb) payload. Bayraktor cruise speed 130km/h. The Neptune has about the same range and payload but obviously one way so it can touch targets twice as far away, with a much higher speed. I couldn’t find the unit cost for Neptune, but the US Tomahawk costs about 2 million. The Bayraktor costs about 5 million but is reusable unless intercepted. 

Obviously the goal would be to do more damage to infrastructure than the cost of the attack, unless it is purely to tweak the enemy’s nose, like the WW2 Doolittle Raid on Japan. A 150 kg warhead with accurate guidance could do millions in damage to a wide variety of targets. Even a less expensive target might cause degraded enemy capability and be well worth while, if it saves Ukraine lives. It has long been common to fire weapons that cost more that the target.",1663519975.0,1663519741.0,t3_xh6g7x,t1_ioxlsz5,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

The truth is much more complicated, but requires people to actually know something about history and opposing viewpoints or at least place more importance in fact-checking such things than the pleasure they get from everything fitting into a nice little graphic.  

For this observation to be accurate you have to condense a very broad range of opinions (for example, that make up an ideology most Americans would call the 'far-left') into just a single opinion/party, when that isn't reality.

This war is not simply Ukraine vs. Russia, it is very much a war of ideologies and polar influence. You have to understand that one of the biggest things to come out of this entire event is the re-engagement and galvanizing of all the countries in NATO. I’m sure a second angle is not wanting the most advanced weapons we have to potentially fall into Russian hands if things go sideways for some reason.

The group of NATO and Western countries are more motivated and united than ever. Historically neutral Switzerland just placed a $5.5B F-35 order from the US. The somewhat neutral Finland just picked a side with their friends the Swedes. NATO countries that have been increasingly pacifist and disconnected from NATO have suddenly stepped up military budgets and are sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine. Part of this unity is also that the more aggressive countries, like the US, are being careful not to upset the countries that fear awakening a full Russian military mobilization and widening of the conflict. You also have to be mindful of Russian allies that have, for the most part, completely shied away from this conflict. China, India, to some extent even Belarus has stepped back and said they support their friends but they aren’t getting involved. 

Ukraine striking deep into Russia with NATO weapons undermines some of those positive outcomes for the West and would only serve to upset some member countries with limited benefit for Ukraine. Ultimately this Western unity is equally, if not more, important to the West than a faster or easier victory for Ukraine. At the end of the day, this war is relatively meaningless to countries like the US.

 >RAS syndrome (where ""RAS"" stands for ""redundant acronym syndrome"", making the phrase ""RAS syndrome"" homological) is the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym (or other initialism) in conjunction with the abbreviated form. This means, in effect, repeating one or more words from the acronym. Three common examples are ""PIN number"" / ""VIN number"" (the ""N"" in PIN and VIN stands for ""number"") and ""ATM machine"" (the ""M"" in ATM stands for ""machine""). The term RAS syndrome was coined in 2001 in a light-hearted column in New Scientist.

The first is that as a Russia's biggest ally NATO, the EU and Ukraine's other supporters will not want it to appear that China directly benefitted from reconstructing the country that their ally invaded in the first place. Sure China hasn't actually aided Russia in the war all that much other than buying their oil and some other commodities but it doesn't matter, China is identified as a friend to Russia and won't be seeing any direct contracts. This also serves as a message to China against invading Taiwan. NATO and it's allies want to make it clear to China that invading your neighbors is a costly affair that you will not benefit from.

Secondly with European countries spending so much money they will want to buy as much material as possible from within Europe so their own countries benefit as much as possible from the money they are spending. The purchase of Chinese products will be minimized because of that alone.

Third [as you can see on this map](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1544212844610215938/photo/1) the vast majority of the countries that have committed to rebuilding areas of Ukraine do not use Chinese companies for building in their countries and if they do it's only very little. Italy is only one country on that list, Greece isn't even present so their influence in selecting Chinese companies will be small if non existent, what's more Italy will simply be told not to because of the next reason.

Because maybe most importantly as Russia's largest ally the Ukrainian government and it's people will not tolerate construction deals signed directly with Chinese companies because they are viewed as supporting Russian aggression. You're not going to have Chinese companies working in Ukraine when the country won't give them permission to do so, there isn't really any way around that.

Sure China will make some money as their prominence in the global supply chain means that some products and material used will inevitably come from China but they will not be directly involved in the reconstruction for all the reasons above.

The Putinists lie about literally everything — the bad stuff, obviously, but also the good and indifferent. The point is to make the kernels of truth indistinguishable from the fictions, so that people give up on trying to sort it out. They have lives and need to get on with them, so practicality wins. This controls the population. 

To answer your question:

>how does any semi intelligent Russian read this and not make the connection 

they don't make the connection they are being lied to because they know they're being lied to already, and that everybody lies all the time and there is no single external truth already. They are already living in post-truth society so they already *agree* with the propaganda on a deep level. 

It's all just astonishingly cynical to devise that as a means of control, so much that its hard to understand. It's purposeful, and was developed under the Soviets, but really flourished under the current lot. Obviously corruption thrives under that sort of thinking, so the corrupt people encourage it. It makes it easier to steal. I see the right-wing populists in the West using the same techniques, because they unfortunately work to some degree. 

However the corruption is at the core, and the lying breeds hopeless inefficiency as everybody with a little power is just out for themself.

adjective: expressing contempt or disapproval.

Russia has explicit contempt for Ukraine as a country. Putin has given speeches where he emphasizes that Ukraine isn't a country, doesn't have a culture or language of its own, and would be much better off listening to big strong Russia who clearly knows best. When a Russian uses ""the ukraine"" they are 100% intentionally being pejorative. They are going by the Russian talking point that Ukraine isn't a separate country, they're merely a region that actually belongs to Russia.

The Ukraine does roll off the tongue, and so a lot of westerners used it until it was made clear that Ukrainians find it offensive. Some still use it out habit or because they don't know any better. But those who don't know are shrinking by the day. So a non-Russian person using it isn't necessarily pejorative, but the chances of that being true increase by the day.
