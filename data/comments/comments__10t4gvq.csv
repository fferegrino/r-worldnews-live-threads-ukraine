Day 345-346 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were pretty quiet, there were no missile strikes, but as usual the towns that are close to the border get shelled every day. I don’t think there were even any reports of Kupiansk getting shelled these past 2 days, but it still could have been shelled, just not reported, there aren’t that many people living there nowadays after all. Though there were also no missile launches from Belgorod, so if it was shelled, then it was done by regular artillery and not missiles.

While it was pretty quiet here, it wasn’t nearly as quiet in Belgorod because our forces managed to hit a couple of targets there yesterday. Looks like they hit both an oil refinery, and a factory that was making parts for the Kerch bridge, so those are some pretty good news. In response to that Russians decided to raise the terrorist threat level in the region to yellow. Funny how hitting their military targets is terrorism, but hitting our civilians with missiles is just fine and not at all terrorism.

Great to hear that GLSDBs were finally officially announced, it was enough to make Medvedev throw yet another nuclear tantrum, saying that “Ukraine will burn” if we hit Crimea, yeah right. Did he forget that we hit Crimea many times already? And he promised us a judgement day for hitting it before, but for some reason it didn’t happen even though we destroyed an entire air base with a lot of their planes after his promise. Do Russians really not see how weak they look by constantly threatening nuclear war and never backing up their words? Either do it already, or stop with your stupid threats, which are not being taken seriously anyway, or we wouldn’t be getting tanks and long-range weapons right now.

1/4 No significant changes for the past 24 hours. The enemy continues to increase the number of artillery and infantry in the area. It seems that the enemy is preparing for slow grinding tactics which we have previously seen near Bakhmut.

2/4 Finally I got some time to share a few images, which can shed some light on what's going on near Vuhledar. As I previously indicated in my reports, the heaviest combats happened in the areas of southern and eastern dachi.

3/4 Fresh scorch marks on fresh snow can visually confirm that the enemy continues attempts to establish control over the dachi's area by covering  assaulting infantry groups with heavy artillery fire.

4/4 You can also see how the enemy attempted to outflank Vuhledar from the East, but sustained losses and had to retreat to Mykil's'ke. 

Overall the situation remains dangerous due to increasing numbers of enemy infantry and artillery.

So many videos of loitering munitions dropped and bodies blown apart. Knowing through a sense of macabre sonder they had lives much like you and I... Going through posts and videos of gore and heroism thinking about which tweets should be shared in concurrence to tell the briefest of narratives. I'm depressed.

I keep at this out of an act of love and responsibility to a community that means *so much* to me... but it takes a toll. The torture chambers and blown apart limbs. Chunks of human flesh mixed in with rubble, steel, and dirt. Smoldering carcasses of tanks with limbs by the wayside. Dust clouds from dropped drone grenades that obscure death within them. War is hell, and I only see its after images through a screen interspersed with a feed of cat pictures and memes.

Knowing folks care keeps me going, day in and day out. Knowing people check this while drinking their coffee because you too reading this comment *fucking care* makes me check for updates during my lunch break while at work, at midnight, and whenever I have a moment.

In this moment of pain I bear myself to strangers in this thread I feel closer to than people I talk to face-to-face everyday. I live in Washington D.C. and want Ukraine to win this more than anything. I want to do everything I can from where I am with the limited power I have to support those that have given more than I ever could. But it takes a toll. I'm drinking more than I used too. Sleep isn't as easy. And we're barely coming up at the one year mark.

Mods are just volunteers. We just want to give back to the community we each found kinship with and fell in love with in order to give to the next generation the same experience and same feeling of belong that captured us when we started.

>Having failed to gain air superiority in Ukraine early in the war, Russia has turned to missiles of various speeds and sizes to deprive entire cities of power.

>
>After long hesitation, Germany agreed to supply Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine two weeks ago. The decision was preceded not least by pressure from European partners. Now that the German government is waiting for confirmation, the neighboring countries are keeping quiet.
>
>Doubts are growing in the German government as to whether the announced delivery of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine can be realized as planned. As reported by ""Der Spiegel,"" there have been no firm commitments so far from European partners, who had previously publicly called for the delivery of modern battle tanks to Ukraine, to participate in the planned deployment of two tank battalions for Ukraine. The problems had been confirmed in government circles, it said. ""Putting together the battalions is turning out to be an arduous feat,"" the magazine reported, following an inquiry to that effect.
>
>About two weeks ago, Chancellor Olaf Scholz had announced that Germany, together with other EU countries, planned to deliver two tank battalions equipped with Leopard 2 weapon systems to Ukraine by the end of March. While NATO has such units equipped with 44 main battle tanks, the Ukrainian military has 31 tanks as a benchmark. Germany is providing 14 Leopard 2A6 tanks from the Bundeswehr for the weapon package. Germany intends to keep a further five tanks in reserve so that they can be deployed in the event of breakdowns or any necessary repairs to the other tanks.
>
>Chancellor Scholz is also putting on the pressure
>
>According to a report in Der Spiegel, the Defense Ministry immediately began talking to EU nations such as Poland after Scholz's tank decision. Warsaw had previously publicly declared its willingness to supply Leopard 2 tanks, putting Berlin under considerable pressure. The magazine further reported that at a video conference hosted by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius last week, no EU country was willing to make concrete commitments to participate in the tank package. Even the Dutch government, which like Poland had already pledged in the media to supply Leopard 2 tanks, did not want to commit itself, he said.
>Because of the lack of commitments since the beginning of the week, the German government spontaneously launched a diplomatic initiative to persuade its partners to make quick decisions after all, ""Der Spiegel"" reported further. Even Chancellor Olaf Scholz himself intervened and persuaded three heads of government from northern and southern Europe to make binding commitments. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has also spoken on the phone with several of his European counterparts. The German Foreign Office was also involved in the negotiations on weapons assistance.

They had to endure the brutality of that war, the death much like the Ukrainians now against Russian Nazi's. In WW2 Americans fought, saw their friends maimed and killed and grew ever more weary. Then they found concentration camps used to industrially exterminate Jews and others. Hardened men fighting for months or years hardened by the brutality of war could not believe what they were witnessing. War is depraved and cruel but this was just beyond comprehension. These soldiers endured huge burdens to end the most organized human depravity ever witnessed in  modern history. Their role was heroic but  they had to witness the degeneracy of the Nazi's first hand often resulting in a mental fatigue like you and others feel now. They suffered so that others could be freed, to destroy a regime so groteque they could not imagine, then had to bear the mental scars which took a long time to go away. The individual soldier in such a large operation probably felt their individual contribution to be small, not that significant, but it was. Every small effort together added up to a huge valiant effort to crush human evil unlike we had ever seen. We thought this could not happen again, Nazi's? Today? Everyone has seen the history, no animal like Hitler could happen today! Then there was Putin. Yup, never again sadly has become just ""again"". The rapes, the torture, senseless loss of life. We look back proudly at those individual members of the WW2 military, hold them all as heroes in a giant group heroic effort and they were.  Now we are seeing this horror today with Russian Nazi's, and you have been here to help inform multitudes so that we can all press to make sure our leaders do the right thing to fight this evil. People need knowledge to be motivated to do that and you have helped provide that. May not feel like you have done much, but the individual soldier in WW2 didn't feel like he did that much often times either but they did as you are now. You will be able to look back when this is over and say ""I did something"", ""I helped fight the Russian Nazi's"", and you have. It takes an e motional toll though, just like the soldiers liberating concentration camps. Witnessing this kind of human depravity takes a toll on our human psyches. Vermin like Putin count on good people being broken down by his Nazi depravity, to give up like Russians do, so he can do as he wants. They don't do war crimes by accident, it is by design to break the will of good people. It takes a toll. You have withstood almost a year of dealing with helping inform on this depravity. 

But here is the thing. In WW2 the soldiers do not fight all day, every day till the fight is over. No they need rest, recuperation, they need to maintain their morale. They would do no good burned out unable to help. It is reasonable to take a break, no one should or could fight every day without a break. Step back from the front lines to recuperate, rest and keep the morale up in the face of Russian depravity. Is it possible to get additional help with modding so you can step back? At least for a bit? I am not hugely tech savvy to help but I am sure many here are and can fill in if this helps. But remember, whatever you decide to do, stop, take a break, or whatever know that you made a difference. You didn't turn away in the face of Russian Nazi atrocities, you did what you could to help. You probably can't feel that pride right now, and probably won't for a while, but at some point you are going to look back and realize you didn't just watch, you helped, you did something and it had a big impact. I have read this thing every day for almost a year now, kept me informed, helped us push for help for Ukraine in their darkest hours. Making damn sure our leaders stepped up and helped Ukraine. You helped with that, you helped as one of many to stand against Russian depravity. Kudos to you. And thanks, I don't have to wait to realize I appreciate what you do, I appreciate it right now.

Even before Covid and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to many nations were kind of already checked out.  For all their Ideological differences, Obama, Trump, and Biden have all been America First populists that ranged from being disengaged with the globalist system to actively hostile towards it.

I think this War actually might be more important that attempting to preserve the old system.  Because I think that system is going away and there really isn't much we can do about it.  I think this will be the beginning of dictating how the new system will work.  Are Western Nations going to stand together, or fragment into pockets of self-interest.  Can America become re-engaged in Global policies, or will they continue the trend of the last 12 years of being increasingly isolationist?  

Its increasingly important because looking at Russia's current situation, this War is basically their last hurrah.  Win or lose, they have taken losses so monumentally staggering that they will not be able to stage another conventional war in our Lifetimes.

The chancellor appeals to the Panzer partners' consciences

After the Leopard 2 decision for Ukraine, there are problems with implementation. According to SPIEGEL information, there have been hardly any tank commitments from European partners. The situation is precarious, the chancellor intervenes.

The federal government has launched a frantic diplomatic offensive to realize the planned delivery of Leopard 2 main battle tanks for two tank battalions to Ukraine.

According to SPIEGEL information, doubts are growing both in the Chancellery and in the defense department as to whether the plans announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) can still be implemented as planned due to the lack of delivery commitments from other European partners. The problems have been confirmed in government circles. ""Putting together the battalions turns out to be a tedious feat,"" they say.

Scholz announced just over a week ago that Germany, together with other European nations, intends to deliver Leopard 2 weapon systems for two tank battalions to Ukraine by the end of March.

Reluctant Partners

Within NATO, such an association includes 44 main battle tanks. In the Ukrainian military, however, the number of 31 tanks is a guideline. Germany is making 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks available to the Bundeswehr for the weapons package, and the troops have five more tanks in Germany as a reserve. They should be used in case of failures.

After Scholz's decision, which only came about after a lengthy struggle with the United States, the Ministry of Defense immediately began talking to EU nations such as Poland. Warsaw had previously publicly agreed to deliver older Type 2 A4 Leopard tanks, putting considerable pressure on Berlin.

At a video conference to which the new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) invited last week, no EU country wanted to make any concrete commitments about participating in a package with more modern Leopard 2 A6 models. Even the Dutch government, which had already promised delivery in the media, did not want to commit itself to the switch.

The German government is now once again in an awkward position due to the hesitation of its partners. The Chancellery had roughly discussed the idea for the two battalions with some partners before the announcement. However, no one asked for firm commitments or even written declarations about specific participation in the tank packages.

Now it is said in the government headquarters that precisely those European partners who had previously demanded the loudest deliveries of Leopards did not want to get involved in a binding manner. In the case of Chancellor Scholz, this should underpin his fear that many announcements only served to drive Berlin along.

The rough plans for the two battalions initially sounded realistic.

For example, the federal government had outlined the idea of equipping one of the formations with Bundeswehr Leopard 2 A6 models. In order to end up with 31 or even 40 tanks for a formation, the Netherlands should then hand over a similar number of Leopard 2 A6 models, which they are currently leasing from Germany in service with the German-Dutch corps. If everything had gone according to plan, other nations such as Portugal would have completed the package with a handful of Leopard 2 A6s each.

Scholz talks partners into conscience

So far, however, none of the European partners has come forward with a firm commitment. According to SPIEGEL information, the federal government has therefore started a real tank poker game since the beginning of the week. Even the chancellor picked up the phone and persuaded three heads of government from northern and southern Europe to finally make firm commitments.

Defense Minister Pistorius was apparently even more active. According to SPIEGEL information, he urged several of his colleagues in office every day to finally show their colors. The Foreign Office is also involved in weapons diplomacy. Minister Annalena Baerbock has activated her Political Director Tjorven Bellmann for this purpose.

Because of the lack of commitments, some of the officials involved are already pessimistic about the European tank package. ""The only Leopards that will actually be ready with a trained crew at the end of March will be the Bundeswehr tanks,"" said one of the experts on Friday.

In the Chancellery, however, one still hopes that some nations can be brought on board by addressing them directly and that the two battalions will be equipped by the end of March. However, equipping the two formations with around 40 tanks is no longer considered realistic, rather the number of 31 tanks per battalion applicable in Ukraine will be used as a guide.

Six to eight weeks of leopard training

The troops are already urgently looking for soldiers with the appropriate language skills in their own ranks. But until then, at least that's how the military sees it, the Bundeswehr should know which other nations are still involved.

In the best case, the training could then be organized together or at least largely synchronized, according to the planners in Minister Pistorius' house. The plan is to complete the training in six to eight weeks.

The formation of the second battalion, which is to be equipped with the somewhat older Leopard 2 A4, is also proving tough. Apparently, Poland has promised to provide a good dozen Leopard 2 A4s, but Warsaw does not want to provide any training or spare parts packages, which are absolutely necessary in a combat operation.

However, the other nations that were planned for the Leopard 2-A4 battalion have not yet received any commitments, or only small ones.

Spain, for example, confirmed it could sell a handful of the older Leopard 2 A4 tanks. Finland, however, probably does not want to deliver at all. There it is pointed out that the tanks are needed for the long border with Russia.",False,1675498576.0,t3_10t4gvq,t1_j75svdz,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

According to a report in Der Spiegel, the Defense Ministry had immediately begun talking to EU nations such as Poland after Scholz's tank decision. Warsaw had previously publicly declared its willingness to supply Leopard 2 tanks, putting Berlin under considerable pressure. The magazine further reported that at a video conference hosted by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius last week, no EU country was willing to make concrete commitments to participate in the tank package. Even the Dutch government, which like Poland had already pledged in the media to supply Leopard 2 tanks, did not want to commit itself, he said.

Because of the lack of commitments since the beginning of the week, the German government spontaneously launched a diplomatic initiative to persuade its partners to make quick decisions after all, ""Der Spiegel"" reported further. Even Chancellor Olaf Scholz himself intervened and persuaded three heads of government from northern and southern Europe to make binding commitments. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has also spoken on the phone with several of his European counterparts.

People just pulled up numbers from military porn sites like Global Firepower and see ""2000 Leopard 2"" not realizing the many problems:

1. The tanks are spread all over more than a dozen countries. ""If everyone gives just 10%"" to which the response, as usual, is: ""If"".

2. More than half of those tanks are unavailable straight off the bat:  More than 700 are shared between Turkey and Greece. Good luck getting them to part with anything. Next 300 are owned by Switzerland... exactly. Finally a handful of additional ones are owned by Austria who will also not get involved because they are not just neutral by choice like Switzerland but neutral by agreement and treaty - they agreed to neutrality after WW2 in order to avoid being split like Germany. A similar offer was made to Germany but West Germany refused:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin_Note

3. Now we are down below 1000 Leopard 2, we have to divide between active service Leopards and ""stockpiled"" or ""reserve"" Leopards. Active service ones will be in working order and presumably battle-ready, but countries will be extremely reluctant to part with a substantial amount of them, maybe that 10%, so we have 50 tanks. Then you are down to the stockpiled tanks, which are probably in poor shape after years of disuse, have been used for spare parts etc. We can draw some from those but it will take time to fix them.

Bottom line: All this excitement and blaming Germany was useless theater. We are lucky if 100 tanks can be scraped together this year and another 100 next year.

And while underspending is partially to blame with the situation, another important factor is that Europe, unlike the US, has no unified procurement. Equipment is hand-build in small batches because no single country in Europe orders thousands of tanks from a single manufacturer (barring exceptions like the huge orders by Poland recently - but note how even that happened under the impression of invasion). For that reason alone Europe will never have a huge stockpile like the US and getting unified action going is always going to be a huge shit show.

Despite this, there are plenty of people complaining about how even having unified procurement would spell the end of sovereignty etc. Which is fine, it's a valid political position but the result is that the above situation will persist and Europe can only hope that the US will continue to be willing to carry an outsized share of the load.",False,1675555632.0,t3_10t4gvq,t1_j78vr3o,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

RPGs have an effective range of 100m to 300m, depending on how good of a shot the soldier is. Advanced weapons like NLAW or Javelin can increase that to 1000m to 3000m thanks to sensors / thermal sights.

M1 Abrams has a firing range of 3000m, and fire control systems (aka: gun computers) that allow it to precisely place those shots.

To kill an M1 Abrams with an RPG (and lets assume its an appropriate tandem-launch advanced RPG warhead that can destroy an Abrams), you need to pass through 2900m of territory where the M1 Abrams can shoot you, and then fire at the tank your one and only shot (assuming 100m shot)

If you kill the M1 Abrams, you then, you have to run away those 2900m, hoping that the teammate M2 Bradley doesn't see you.

Der Kanzler redet den Panzer-Partnern ins Gewissen

Nach der Leopard-2-Entscheidung für die Ukraine hakt es bei der Umsetzung. Nach SPIEGEL-Informationen gibt es bisher kaum Panzerzusagen europäischer Partner. Die Lage ist prekär, der Kanzler schaltet sich ein.


Die [Bundesregierung](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/bundesregierung/) hat eine hektische Diplomatie-Offensive gestartet, um die geplante Lieferung von Leopard-2-Kampfpanzern für zwei Panzerbataillone an die [Ukraine](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/ukraine/) zu realisieren.

Nach SPIEGEL-Informationen wachsen sowohl im Kanzleramt als auch im Verteidigungsressort die Zweifel, ob sich die von Kanzler [Olaf Scholz](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/olaf_scholz/) ([SPD](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/spd/)) verkündeten Pläne wegen fehlender Lieferzusagen anderer europäischer Partner noch wie geplant umsetzen lassen. In Regierungskreisen wurden die Probleme bestätigt. »Die Zusammenstellung der Bataillone entpuppt sich als mühsamer Kraftakt«, heißt es.

Scholz hat vor gut einer Woche verkündet, dass [Deutschland](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/deutschland/) gemeinsam mit anderen europäischen Nationen bis Ende März Leopard-2-Waffensysteme für zwei Panzerbataillone an die Ukraine liefern wolle.

Zögerliche Partner

Innerhalb der [Nato](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/nato/) umfasst ein solcher Verband 44 Kampfpanzer. Im ukrainischen Militär gilt indes die Zahl von 31 Panzern als Richtwert. Deutschland stellt für das Waffenpaket 14 Leopard-2-A6-Panzer der [Bundeswehr](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/bundeswehr/) zur Verfügung, als Reserve hält die Truppe fünf weitere Panzer in Deutschland bereit. Sie sollen bei Ausfällen zum Einsatz kommen.

Nach der Entscheidung von Scholz, die erst nach längerem Ringen mit den [USA](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/usa/) zustande gekommen war, hatte das Verteidigungsministerium umgehend begonnen, mit EU-Nationen wie [Polen](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/polen/) zu sprechen. [Warschau](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/warschau/) hatte sich zuvor öffentlich zu einer Lieferung von Leopard-Panzern vom älteren Typ 2 A4 bereit erklärt und [Berlin](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/berlin/) damit erheblich unter Druck gesetzt.

Bei einer Videokonferenz, zu der der neue Verteidigungsminister [Boris Pistorius](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/boris-pistorius/) (SPD) vergangene Woche eingeladen hatte, wollte kein EU-Land konkrete Zusagen über die Beteiligung an einem Paket mit moderneren Leopard-2-A6-Modellen machen. Selbst die niederländische Regierung, die eine Lieferung in den Medien schon zugesagt hatte, wollte sich in der Schalte nicht festlegen.

Die Bundesregierung gerät durch das Zögern der Partner nun erneut in eine missliche Lage. Zwar hatte das Kanzleramt die Idee für die beiden Bataillone vor der Verkündung mit einigen Partnern grob besprochen. Dabei aber verzichtete man auf die Abfrage von festen Zusagen oder gar schriftlichen Erklärungen über die konkrete Beteiligung an den Panzer-Paketen.

Nun heißt es in der Regierungszentrale, dass sich ausgerechnet jene europäischen Partner, die vorher am lautesten Leopard-Lieferungen eingefordert hätten, nicht verbindlich einlassen wollten. Bei Kanzler Scholz dürfte dies seine Befürchtung untermauern, dass viele Ankündigungen nur dazu dienten, Berlin vor sich herzutreiben.

Die groben Pläne für die beiden Bataillone hörten sich zunächst realistisch an.

So hatte die Bundesregierung für sich skizziert, einen der Verbände mit Leopard-2-A6-Modellen der Bundeswehr zu bestücken. Um am Ende auf 31 oder gar 40 Panzer für einen Verband zu kommen, sollten dann die [Niederlande](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/niederlande/) eine ähnliche Zahl von Leopard-2-A6-Modellen abgeben, die sie derzeit von Deutschland geleast im Deutsch-Niederländischen Korps im Einsatz haben. Wäre alles nach Plan gegangen, hätten andere Nationen wie [Portugal](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/portugal/) das Paket mit jeweils einer Handvoll Leopard 2 A6 komplettiert.

Scholz redet Partnern ins Gewissen

Bisher aber hat sich keiner der europäischen Partner mit einer festen Zusage hervorgetan. Nach SPIEGEL-Informationen hat die Bundesregierung deswegen seit Anfang der Woche einen regelrechten Panzer-Poker gestartet. Selbst der Kanzler griff demnach zum Telefon und redete drei Regierungschefs aus Nord- und Südeuropa ins Gewissen, endlich handfeste Zusagen zu machen.

Noch aktiver war offenbar Verteidigungsminister Pistorius. Er drängelte nach SPIEGEL-Informationen jeden Tag gleich bei mehreren seiner Amtskollegen, endlich Farbe zu bekennen. Auch das Auswärtige Amt beteiligt sich demnach an der Waffen-Diplomatie. Ministerin [Annalena Baerbock](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/annalena_baerbock/) hat dafür ihre Politische Direktorin Tjorven Bellmann aktiviert.

Wegen der ausbleibenden Zusagen sehen einige der beteiligten Beamten für das europäische Panzerpaket schon schwarz. »Die einzigen Leoparden, die Ende März tatsächlich mit ausgebildeter Besatzung bereitstehen, werden die Bundeswehrpanzer sein«, sagte einer der Experten am Freitag.

Im Kanzleramt aber hofft man noch, dass einige Nationen durch die direkte Ansprache mit ins Boot geholt werden können und die beiden Bataillone bis Ende März bestückt sind. Allerdings sieht man derzeit eine Ausstattung der beiden Verbände mit um die 40 Panzer nicht mehr als realistisch an, vielmehr werde man sich an den in der Ukraine geltenden Stückzahlen von 31 Panzern pro Bataillon orientieren.

Sechs bis acht Wochen Leopard-Training

Die Zeitlinie für eine Lösung ist eng gesteckt. Die Bundeswehr will schon in gut einer Woche mit der Ausbildung der ukrainischen Panzermannschaften beginnen, dazu sucht die Truppe in den eigenen Reihen bereits dringlich nach Soldaten mit entsprechenden Sprachkenntnissen. Bis dahin aber, so jedenfalls sehen es die Militärs, müsste die Bundeswehr wissen, welche anderen Nationen sich noch beteiligen.

Im besten Fall könnte man dann die Ausbildung gemeinsam organisieren oder zumindest weitgehend synchronisieren, hieß es bei den Planern im Haus von Minister Pistorius. Angedacht sei, das Training in sechs bis acht Wochen abzuschließen.

Auch die Aufstellung des zweiten Bataillons, das mit den etwas älteren Leopard 2 A4 bestückt werden soll, gestaltet sich zäh. Offenbar hat Polen zwar die Bereitstellung eines guten Dutzends Leopard 2 A4 zugesagt, allerdings will Warschau kein Training und auch keine Ersatzteilpakete zu Verfügung stellen, die bei einem Gefechtseinsatz zwingend nötig sind.

Von den anderen Nationen, die für das Leopard-2-A4-Bataillon eingeplant waren, kamen indes noch gar keine oder nur kleine Zusagen.

So bestätigte beispielsweise [Spanien](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/spanien/), man könne eine Handvoll der älteren Leopard-2-A4-Panzer abgeben. [Finnland](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/finnland/) indes will wohl gar nicht liefern. Dort verweist man darauf, dass man die Panzer für die lange Grenze mit [Russland](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/russland/) benötigt.

The man who helped Putin seize power has said that when Putin dies Russia will likely fall and a Putin v.2.0 will rise to take his place.  

A major part of the problem is that only an absolute tyrant like Putin could survive as leader in Russia. A prospective leader would have to have the FSB, the military and GRU, the brutal police, the oligarchs and the Russian mafia not just under their control but also totally loyal to them. Plus, the entire system in Russia is designed around Putin. It cannot function without him.  

Such a system would eat any other person alive, but it gets worse. Any potential threat to Putin has already been murdered, imprisoned or exiled. From Putin's perspective preferably in that order.  

If that weren't bad enough, many Russians believe the Kremlin propaganda. A group of them have swallowed it whole and really gone off the deep end. Think of them as kind of like QAnon folk. These people in Russia are ultra nationalistic and very pro-Putin. They want nothing less than a total conquest of Ukraine.  

Those people brand anyone who so much as hints at ending the war without a total conquest as an unpatriotic weak coward, a traitor in league with Nazis.  

Dictators hide behind a phony image of being a tough strong man. Putin is no different. If enough of those people were able to make those accusations stick to Putin, or any dictator who follows him, that could potentially be a problem for the dictators image.  

That isn't likely to happen though as Putin has no qualms about just throwing peoples lives away on the battlefield. Part of the reason for using Wagner mercenaries and prisoners is so that the Russian public will think better *that* type of person dies in the war than their own loved ones.  

You may wish to watch the PBS Frontline series of documentaries on Putin. They are available on the PBS Frontline YouTube channel.  

If you have the time and want to learn more, I definitely recommend you watch the full extended interviews from which the PBS Frontline documentaries are based on. At least watch the full interviews with Julia Ioffe. She covers this in far more detail than I can.  

If after that you want to learn more about what lead up to Putin's rule, the catalyst for it, watch the seven part BBC documentary by Adam Curtis titled [Russia 1985–1999: TraumaZone, What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_1985%E2%80%931999:_TraumaZone).

* There is no ""rich half"" and ""poor half"" of Europe. That's your own mindset polluting the sample. You drew a line and decided that every country above that line is ""rich"".

Fallacies like ""leading questions"" or ""begging the question"" happens all the time on here, under the guide of sincere Concern, or appended with disingenuous labels like stating Honest Question somehow makes it so.

This can be amplified by combining the question from one account with a few initial answers / opinions from other accounts in cahoots that 1) position the response to support a certain narrative and 2) try to make their preferred narrative seem like the popularly supported opinion.

Every time this same tired subject comes up, somebody like you claims it *can* be done, as though others are saying it's impossible. I have heard nobody say as much, only that it's imprudent. US officials repeatedly said that the Abrams would impose a cost for limited benefit over a comparable MBT. Germany and others at last twisted their arm into sending a few at some undefined point in the mid to distant future. Every indication is that this is a decision agreed to grudgingly.

And still people are going to spam this space with this obsessive talk about the Abrams. I have no idea why so many think it's a magic bullet, that it has some sort of capability far beyond a Leopard. As you squeeze every last bit of performance from a system, the challenges of maintaining it grow with diminishing returns. That high cost is worthwhile for the US as a force with a global supply chain and decades of platform specific operations experience.

Ukraine needs reliable armor on the field, not a fuel hog. Over the last two low intensity conflicts, the US saw one casualty per every 50 supply trucks convoyed. Ukraine is certainly experiencing a greater rate of attrition. An Abrams might need one more fuel truck that wouldn't otherwise need to be dispatched, might need someone to source hardware to service prematurely worn components because the crew isn't adequately trained in preventative care and maintenance, and when the jet turbine needs a major overhaul due to suboptimal fuel, let's call out a recovery vehicle with a crane capable of jerking 70 tons out of the mud, then ship the tank cross country to Poland for refit.

- one of their submarines sunk when trying to leave the harbour

- they didn't have homing torpedoes for Kobbens

- there was a limit of 60 rounds of ammunition per year per soldier.

I'm sure the Ukrainians will be quite pleased that the Germans have another five earmarked for them as backup as well, but the Germans don't dictate Ukrainian force structure.",False,1675515881.0,t3_10t4gvq,t1_j76dpev,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
