Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar: ""War is not without losses. The most terrible but inevitable losses are people. And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. 

But today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why?

Because the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. 

In this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example,by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. 

Therefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.""

All evidence pointing to deliberate destruction by explosives, not simple structural failure. Most likely the dam destroyed by the Russians, who were earlier reported to have mined it.

>
>Russia had control of the dam, and thus the opportunity to place demolition explosions within the dam structure - the most effective, and perhaps the only way to ensure its destruction. Ukrainian intelligence said it observed explosives and other equipment being moved to the dam.
>
>Starting in October last year, the level of the water in the Kakhovka Reservoir was reduced from 16.5 meters to about 14 meters in February this year. It then rose to a record high of 17.6 m in April, at which point it overtopped the dam
>
>Water levels in the reservoir subsequently fell. 
>
>The Russians, as they controlled the dam, controlled the sluice gates that helped regulate the level of water in the reservoir.
>
>It is possible the Russians deliberately reduced the level of the reservoir so they could place explosives on the lower part of the dam structure. The water levels were then raised to ensure the maximum destruction downstream when the dam was blown.
>
>The destruction of the dam coincided with the reported start of Ukraine’s long-expected counter-offensive against Russian invasion forces.
>
>The effective widening of the Dnipro and destruction of the only crossing point (the road over the dam) south of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhya had some military advantage to the Russians, even though their forward defenses on the east bank were flooded.
>
>They had to move back, but the city if Kherson is still within range of their artillery- they shelled Ukrainian flood evacuees and their rescuers in Kherson on June 8.

>But the main effect of the dam’s destruction is the long term damage it does to Ukraine’s economy and future recovery. Kherson Oblast is an important farming area, and agricultural exports are an important earner for the Ukrainian economy.
>
>…

As we wrote earlier, the enemy again stepped up offensive operations by nightfall.

Fighting continued throughout the night, as a result of which the enemy, with massive support from artillery and armored vehicles, managed to occupy several positions of our troops in the Orekhov-Tokmak direction.

The situation is really serious. Neo-Nazis by their actions are trying to create a threat of encirclement of some of our advanced groups in one of the directions. The activity of the battles is extremely high.

Recall that during yesterday's run-up, the enemy was also able to cling to our advanced positions, but could not gain a foothold on them.

What matters is that there are a couple armor there, a couple armor here, probing. Then, sizeable attacks, which did not properly start before yesterday, include columns of like 10 armor each… And then it is not a one sided engagement but a pretty hard one for the Russians as well. 

So, if you were ever worried that thousands of Ukrainians died and a hundred vehicles lost, it makes zero sense. Russian mil bloggers do not have any incentive to under report the size of attacks, their shitty military depends on communication via their channels.

>#Moscow Rigs Toxic Chemical Plant Next to Sulfuric Acid Lake with Explosives, Ukraine Claims

>**The Crimean Titan chemical plant is ready to blow, and if the Ukrainian army gets close and the charges are set off, the toxic cloud released will be ‘worse than Chernobyl,’ one official said.**

>Russian army engineers have rigged a giant industrial chemical plant built next to a toxic acid lake the size of a small city with explosives, and if the Kremlin orders the charges set off Ukraine and neighboring states will face a man-made disaster potentially worse than Chernobyl, officials and independent news platforms warned. 

>Covering a territory of 4.7 square kilometers and sited near the city Armiansk, the sprawling Crimean Titan plant in its heyday was one of the world’s biggest producers of titanium dioxide, a non-toxic industrial chemical widely used in the production of paints, coatings, food supplements, in medicines, and as a whitener.

>Use of titanium dioxide was banned in Europe in 2022. A fine, white dust, the chemical is considered by some experts potentially to be carcinogenic. It is insoluble and deadly for plants and animals using ground water contaminated by the chemical. Some precursors and byproducts of titanium dioxide production are toxic, including sulfuric acid and sulfuric dioxide gas. Both of those compounds are poisonous and if exposure is severe, they are potentially lethal.

>Ukrainian military analyst Roman Svitan, in Thursday evening comments to the Apostrof TV news channel, said Russian authorities in Kremlin-occupied Crimea have already fully prepped the north Crimea plant for demolition, and that Russia’s national leadership would be very likely to blow the factory up to create a toxic chemical barrier, if the Ukrainian army got too near, Svitan said.

>Located on the Isthmus of Perekop, which connects the Crimean Peninsula to mainland Ukraine, Armiansk together with its adjacent rail switching station city Dzhankoi are a natural bottleneck to travel in or out of the peninsula. The Russian military high command needs only an order to trigger the explosives, and it would turn the region of salt flats, retirement communities and truck farms into a poisonous wasteland, Svitan said.

>“The plant is already completely mined, including containers with acid, chlorine and reagents. They recently began to rig explosives there, because they saw the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) could cross the Dnipro (River) and attack Armiansk… Blowing Crimean Titan up will have military expediency for the Russians, since chemical emissions can slow down the movement of the AFU.”

>Svitan’s warning echoed statements by other Ukrainian officials, and media reports, predicting dire consequences should Russian Federation authorities continue its campaign of destroying major Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, and in its next move demolish the Crimean Titan plant at Armiansk.

>The web magazine Focus used computer modeling to predict that the toxic cocktail of chemicals contained in the plant premises would, if released into the atmosphere, produce a poisonous cloud 50 kilometers wide and, travelling about 200 kilometers a day, potentially reach Turkish, Bulgarian or Russian territory (depending on prevailing winds) in two or three days.

>Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson Regional Defense Command, in a June 2 Telegram video said Russian plans to blow up the plant were well advanced and that if the explosives were to be set off “thousands of tons of toxic materials would be released” in an industrial accident “worse than Chernobyl.”

>One of the earliest reports of explosives being placed inside the Crimean Titan plant for its intentional destruction surfaced in early May, when a Telegram channel claiming to be linked with partisans operating in the peninsula, said Russian authorities were planning “ecological terrorism.”

>Ukrainian officials first warned of Russian troops rigging explosives in the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in April 2022. At the time, some members of the international community viewed Ukrainian official statements as hyperbolic and overly biased against Russia. Kremlin spokespersons this week accused Ukraine of blowing up the Khakhovka dam, a key piece of Ukraine’s power grid, but without offering credible evidence.

>The toxic chemical threat to people and environment near Armiansk’s Crimean Titan plant is well documented. In September 2018 Russian authorities evacuated 4,000 children from Armiansk after noxious sulfur dioxide gas blew into the city.

>Kremlin-appointed officials in Crimea said summer heat and low water levels in a reservoir the factory uses to hold industrial waste had evaporated sulfuric acid in the reservoir and, probably, created a poisonous sulfur dioxide gas cloud. Ukrainian officials at the time claimed Russian artillery training near the factory had damaged sulfuric acid holding tanks.

>The sulfuric acid reservoir next to the factory covers 42 square kilometers (16 square miles), international news reports said at the time.

>Since the outset of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Kyiv officials have accused the Kremlin of pursuing a strategy of destroying the Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and natural environment in order to compel Ukraine’s population to surrender and, longer term, to eliminate the Ukrainian state and Ukrainians as a nation.

>Thousands of Russian missiles launched at Ukrainian civilian targets, forced emigration of residents of occupied regions, abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children, destruction of radiation measuring equipment in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, repeated shelling of chemical plants in Ukrainian cities like Sievierodonetsk and Pavlohrad, and emplacement of explosives in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station are, Kyiv has long argued, evidence of that long-term Moscow strategy.

>The June 6 demolition of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam was the latest attack in that long-running Kremlin scorched-earth campaign, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a June 7 speech televised nationally. Western states allied with Ukraine, such as the US and Britain, have refrained from directly blaming Russia for the Kakhovka disaster, saying there is not yet enough intelligence available to prove it.",False,1686318332.0,t3_144unux,t3_144unux,,0,52,0,52,0,0,

America/West has previously rolled over their enemies in the last couple of decades for 2 primary reasons, 1, they had complete air superiority. 2, they were fighting much weaker opponents that had low morale to begin with.   


Russian morale might be low compared to Ukraine, but most either believe Ukraine is full of Nazi's and a threat to Russia, or they are desperate for money, either way they have at least a reason to fight.   


Russia also might not control the skies over Ukraine, but they have it better in the air nevertheless. We know Ukraine is having problems with the ka-52 at the moment. In the past the ka-52 has been shot down in large numbers crossing into Ukrainian controlled territory, right now its the opposite way around so shooting them down wont be as easy and they are bringing their capabilities to bare as reports have shown.   


Overall its too early to judge the offensive's results because its only begun and is ongoing and will be for some time, modern battles don't last hours/few days as in the past, they last weeks and months and even years in some cases.

&#x200B;

While there are losses there are also gains, and the gains are in some of the most fortified areas of the front, I still believe Ukraine's current offensive will achieve the goal of splitting the land bridge and then maybe Ukraine will pause and wait for the F - 16's to finish the job once and for all throughout the country.

For who doesn't know about this: A Dutch museum (Allard Pierson, in Amsterdam) had historical items from four different Ukrainian museums on loan in 2014. These Ukrainian museums are located in Crimea. When Russia annexed Crimea the Dutch museum did not know to whom they should return the items. Both the Crimean museums and the Ukrainian government claimed them. An earlier court decision said to return the items to Ukraine but the museums appealed.

After the successful landings on D-Day June 6, 1944, German troops managed to create a defensive cordon that contained the Allied troops. It took 2 months of heavy fighting, progress counted in meters, or hedges, until the defenders were worn too thin and the front collapsed.

It illustrates how heavy fighting can wear down a defender despite lack of obvious progress. Or how a ""successful"" defense might just prolong the inevitable.

There are also many examples of where heavy fighting has resulted in nothing but many dead.

The reason you see the Bradley mess is because Ukraine has the power to be attacking one of Russia's hardest points. So it's a sign of power, not weakness.

The mess seems to have happened because the probably newly trained drivers didn't stay exactly in the mine clearing lane. That happened because Ukraine has the power to train up and equip with great systems a huge number of new troops. This is also a sign of power.

We are talking about one company's equipment out of maybe 50 companies. The Bradley's are a small fraction of the force. That's how powerful this attacking force is. 

And lastly, the great thing is, those new drivers can get supplemental training on how to stay in the lane because they are still alive.

Well gee. Mainstream news picks up pretty much anything, especially if it's remotely sensational. That hardly makes it true in itself. There's also a distinct difference between UFO's and aliens. There's plenty of unidentified flying objects around; but that doesn't mean they're extra-terrestrial. 

If there were actually any alien craft, I highly doubt the US would be the only one that encountered them, and I also doubt they'd only start appearing now rather than any point prior in history.

And even if anyone *did* attempt to keep it a secret, I doubt it could be kept for long.

Former intelligence official David Grusch can say whatever he wants, but he has admitted to never having witnessed any such 'alien' craft (or even any photographs of them) himself.

Ukraine’s goal was to get close enough that they could hit the supply routes which would make Russian defense untenable and Russia’s goal was to use deeply entrenched units to deny Ukraine that opportunity. Contrary to what some bloomers will say Kherson was an insane grind and there were several points where Russian forces beat back Ukrainian attacks but eventually Ukraine broke through and rendered the defense untenable leading to a Russian withdrawal. 

Even if Ukraine can’t smash through lines fully and route Russian brigades they may still be able to get their artillery to the right point to force Russia to abandon defensive lines.

> I highly doubt the US would be the only one that encountered them

This whistleblower says other nations have also recovered them and describes a secret cold war like scenario between nations racing to recover them. Other people have said the US isn't the only one with them.


>I also doubt they'd only start appearing now rather than any point prior in history.

We have cameras now, more people and better documentation of events and dissemination of information so sightings would invariably increase as a result. There are credible sightings recorded by the military and pilots going back decades though. It's obviously up for debate what they are observing and secret test aircraft is certainly a possible explanation (though in some cases does not seem possible due to the technological capabilities being displayed) but there are cases which have resulted in injury and long term side effects so something unexplainable has happened that is worth evaluating. Many sources also suggest a link between nuclear facilities and sightings so it could be that they increased after we discovered nuclear technology. Going back to the earliest nuclear tests there were sightings.

>Furthermore, a confirmed encounter would probably not be kept a secret - as such a potential existential threat would deserve humanity's full attention. And even if anyone did attempt to keep it a secret, I doubt it could be kept for long.

I disagree with that. I mean yes such a thing should deserve humanity's full collective attention but that doesn't tend to be how we handle anything. Case in point, climate change deserves our full attention but we still have people arguing over whether it is real, media and governments that downplay how truly dire the situation is and even the IPCC is too optimistic since they don't factor in feedback loops and rely on mitigation technology that doesn't exist and might not even be viable. The fossil fuel industry were successful in downplaying and covering up climate change for decades despite the link between CO2 and warming having been demonstrated in the 1800s.

If a military thinks keeping something secret will benefit them and only them - they will do it. If a government thinks the truth will impact society or the economy they aren't likely to openly discuss it. If there is a financial motive behind any technology then it won't be openly shared.

The US stealth bomber program resulted in a lot of UFO sightings and to help cover it up they actively helped disseminate the UFO stories and fed false information to the people observing the aircraft. If you want to cover something up you don't just stay silent about it or deny it - you put out an alternative narrative. Russia's Firehose of Falseness tactic is a similar strategy and the CCP do similar with their propaganda and it can be quite effective. Such stories muddy the waters and conceal the truth and if it's something that sounds crazy and is easy to ridicule like flying saucers then it has the added effect of keeping anyone from actually looking into it without being called a crackpot. There are sources that have been talking about UFOs for decades but they were always ridiculed (and often were ridiculous) so it discouraged any serious investigative journalism as such a thing would kill your career. Pilots didn't come forward about sightings as doing so might get them grounded for medical or psychological evaluation - you don't want someone who might be hallucinating flying a plane. Military personnel couldn't come forward without serious repercussions. Members of the public who spoke out got called crazy discouraging others from doing so. It covered itself up by virtue of human nature.

Historically there are stories that have a lot of similarities with the modern 'tic tac' sightings but they're just not phrased in the same way we see it today, ie. something technological or alien. Instead their stories are gods, angels or demons and in some of the really old ones they are described as animals or spirits as they were animist cultures who viewed everything that way. As such these stories are very open to interpretation and it's hard to decipher myth from anything actually genuine in them. They feature in many of the creation myths of disparate cultures though. 

Interestingly the former head of the UAP program (who released the tic tac videos and then left his job) said that when he tried to present the evidence to higher ups in the Pentagon some of them refused to even investigate the issue as they were evangelical Christians, thought the objects were demons and that even exploring them would invite Satan into their lives. So despite these unidentified aircraft stalking their carriers and flying over the country presenting a credible national security threat - they went unexplored because of superstition.",False,1686327416.0,t3_144unux,t1_jnitb3y,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Except if advanced alien craft existed, this would be a far greater potential threat to humanity than our own societies, economy, or even other nation's armies. Keeping it a secret would not only be almost impossible, it'd be tremendously detrimental to our survival as a species as a whole.

I don't believe in these farfetched conspiracy theories. The truth is almost always impossible to hide fully in the long term if definite evidence exists, on scales both large and small. And the scale here would be *beyond* large; as definite proof of intelligent extraterrestial life might easily be one of the most important existential discoveries in humanities history; an intellectual competitor to mankind. The fact that throughout history there's still zero evidence of this on an international level tells me more than enough. I don't know a single agency competent or foolish enough to keep such an important discovery a secret for long. Let alone *all* of them world-wide.

I see it often because I get to see my comment getting buried in downvotes when I make the point.

>Also who cares, the thread is about the war, not about itself.

It's not the downvotes that make me angry about it. It's that people use the livethread as a form of hype entertainment rather than an information source. People regularly punished my posts because they did not like the accurate information in them, which means they are also doing it to other posts with accurate info. Other people end up less informed, and then so do I, because I'm not able to read other informative posts that people are intentionally burying because they contain unpleasant news.

Another reason hype is bad is that it causes people to assume all negative information is coming from a troll. Back of envelope, I would guess that people falsely accuse 7 out of 10 posts on this livethread of being a Russian troll account, *solely* because they are providing negative information about the war or asking a question with a negative implication. I get accused of being a troll on this livethread a minimum of 1-2 times per week, even though I post here virtually every day and have made it as clear as possible that I want Ukraine to win.

This is a toxic backlash effect of Russian trolling -- people become paranoid and lazy. Instead of looking into an account's history to determine if they are actually a troll, they just resort to ""negative info means troll."" This is terrible for the informative purpose of the thread. Because again, if they're doing it to me, then they're doing it to other people -- and I see it happening to other people a half a dozen times a day in here.

Trolls bring us to the third reason I try to discourage hype here: because it has the effect of teeing expectations up for Russian propaganda. The Russian trolls have been gleefully pointing out this one destroyed Leopard2 for the past day precisely because so many people naively insisted that simple dumb artillery shells and mines can't destroy Western tanks. This gave an opening to Russian trolls to swoop in and take advantage of the invincibility expectation. They are only able to demoralize people when the news is shocking to their target audience. If people had had more realistic expectations about how Western tanks would perform against relatively simple defenses, they wouldn't have been shocked and the trolls wouldn't have had a narrative to leverage.",1686317359.0,1686317032.0,t3_144unux,t1_jnilgq8,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
