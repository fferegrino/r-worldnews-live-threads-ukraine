*One of the Azov women exchanged was interviewed:*

An elderly woman, a 71yo retiree, who was a military nurse during the Soviet-Afghan war, later became an obstetrician-surgical nurse around Kyiv, until retired.

After Maiden in 2014, she was impressed with Mariupol, wanted to move there, go back to work but for Ukrainian military.  All the units in Mariupol rejected the pensioner.  She kept trying, eventually, the Azov Battalion hired her to organize new medical centers in the garrison. 

When they were ordered to surrender, none of the civilians or medical personnel were let go, in violation of Geneva, they were treated like combatants and processed as POWs. 
She was captured, taken with the women POWs.  She says the women were not beaten or tortured—that the guards and fellow prisoners had strict orders that were not to cause bruises or injuries.  However, that doesn’t mean no punishment—harshly exercised and food/water deprivation.  She was eventually released in an exchange, likely because of her age.  Other civilians from Azovstal have not been released.

When the terrorist state and all 🇷🇺 individuals whose collaboration with the Kremlin created the conditions for aggression or who are a public cover for 🇷🇺 corrupt officials lose their money, a very important goal will be achieved - they will feel what loss is. 

They do not respect life and do not feel regret when human lives are lost. The 🇷🇺 ruling class does not value people and is willing to waste human lives by the hundreds of thousands. But they do care about money - the money they have appropriated. They value their assets.

Main point is Putin uses “we” instead of “they” when talking about his forces, which implies he has been sufficiently convinced Russia will more or less hold against the Ukrainian counter-offensive, and in a few years will be back in Kyiv once the west tires of supporting Ukraine. 

Although he’s preaching to the choir in regards to us in this thread, Vexler stresses we need to increase our support for Ukraine. It’s especially important to consciously commit to Ukraine’s victory as our end goal. We can’t see this as getting Ukraine to a better position to negotiate for peace, but rather as victory being mandatory. Anything less and, whether it’s 2025 or 2028 or 2032, we’ll be right back where we are now again. Russia in its current form will never stop for good, only until it believes conditions are more favourable. They’re playing the long game. Anything less than Ukraine’s victory will only be a temporary reprieve.

And one delicious little minor point of his: these Z bloggers are such trashy, minor players in Russia that it’s symbolic of the degeneration of the state that Putin is sharing a room with them. Hope Putin’s enjoying his new social circle lol Fucker.",1686817895.0,1686816324.0,t3_149s5nj,t3_149s5nj,,0,125,0,125,0,0,

Commander Serhii Yaremenko and his 96th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Air Command Center were at the heart of the defense, though they didn't realize until later they had defeated one of Russia's toughest weapons, he said in an interview Thursday.

“Frankly speaking, I realized that we had shot down the Kinzhal only after expert analysts examined the wreckage,"" Yaremenko told Army Inform, a Ukrainian defense ministry website.

When Russia launched its assault, ""Sixteen ballistic targets flew from different directions, most of them aimed at the Patriot system,” the commander said, referring to the powerful US-provided missile defense system.

“I'm always proud of my subordinates, but this time even I was shocked by their endurance. People realized that ballistic missiles were moving directly toward them,"" he continued.
“They did not panic for a second, acted in a coordinated and organized manner, shared targets across sectors, and ensured their destruction at a minimum range, high enough to reduce the likelihood of damage to infrastructure.""

Yaremenko said the Ukrainian fighters were emotional when all the targets had finally been destroyed and the airspace declared clear. Later they learned there were six Kinzhals among the assault.

""Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar says Kyiv’s military offensive is continuing in several areas and is making what she called gradual progress.

Maliar told a briefing in Kyiv that on the southern front – which many expect to be the main focus of Ukraine's counteroffensive – the ""offensive continues in several directions, and the armed forces are also gradually but surely advancing there.""

But she cautioned that ""the enemy is putting up strong resistance.”

“There, the armed forces are facing continuous mining of fields, the use of kamikaze drones, intense shelling, and the enemy certainly does not give up its positions easily. That's why there are battles everywhere and a powerful confrontation,"" Maliar said.

The minister said that “all defense forces are engaged in both offensive and defensive operations. That is, today we are conducting an offensive in several areas, and defense, because the enemy is also carrying out offensive actions.”

She also appealed for what she called ""information discipline"" to ""give our soldiers the opportunity to deliver unpleasant surprises to the enemy."" 

Maliar said the Russians were bringing additional reserves into the Bakhmut area, trying to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces.

But she said the Russians had been unable to take more ground, and claimed Ukrainian forces had advanced three kilometers (almost two miles) in the Bakhmut area over the last ten days.""",False,1686831688.0,t3_149s5nj,t3_149s5nj,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-15-23/index.html

""President Joe Biden and his team are in the midst of a high-stakes conversation with fellow NATO members on how and when Ukraine may join — a debate that could expose strains in the alliance ahead of a key summit.

The matter of Ukrainian membership in NATO is one of several issues leaders will tackle when they meet in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in mid-July. Also up for discussion are new defense spending commitments and a successor to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is planning on leaving his post in the autumn.

Yet it is the issue of Ukrainian membership that will prove one of the biggest flash points for the group, which has managed to remain remarkably united amid Russia’s unprovoked invasion.

At past NATO summits, the allies have produced a joint declaration outlining their shared views. A failure to reach a consensus this year would be hugely consequential and would signal trouble for the unity of the alliance as the war in Ukraine continues.

Some allies, particularly those in Eastern Europe who are located closer to Ukraine and Russia, have advocated for a more concrete path for Kyiv to join the defensive alliance once the war ends.

Other European officials, particularly those in western and southern Europe, have argued an expedited entrance of Ukraine into NATO could be too provocative and that it could amount to an extremely risky gamble for the alliance even if there is an end to the fighting, particularly if Russia still stakes claim over Ukrainian territory.

Biden and members of his administration have remained committed to the alliance’s current posture, which states Ukraine will eventually join NATO but without any certainty of when.

The divide has prompted urgent discussions ahead of the summit. The result of the conversations could determine whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends.

“If we are not acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius, I believe there is no point for Ukraine to be at this summit,” he told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.""",False,1686831409.0,t3_149s5nj,t3_149s5nj,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar: ""War is not without losses. The most terrible but inevitable losses are people. And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. But today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why? Because the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. In this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example, by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. Therefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.""",False,1686803924.0,t3_149s5nj,t3_149s5nj,,0,78,0,78,0,0,

He told me that when they do war-games, they almost never use entirely real-life troops and equipment. The tanks might be real, the trucks might be real, but if there was supposed to be a B-2 in the air, for example, they would use a simulated B-2 that existed only in the computer. Apparently, they could replace pretty much anything that they wanted with a virtual facsimile. They could run a war-game where practically everything except for one type of element was run virtually, or they could even run it without any real troops at all.



The most interesting thing that I remember my friend telling me was that they ran war-games not only to train troops, but also to train the war-game software. They were collecting data on the performance of real troops to be able to run more sophisticated simulations in the computer.



That was a long time ago. Computers have never been all that good at predicting the behavior of individuals, but the more people involved, the more elements involved, the better a computer can predict what will happen when they all start to move.



I have faith that the absolute best war-gamers on the planet have been running the circuits off of some very serious computers to come up with good plans for the Ukrainians. I also expect that real-world data is being fed back in to that software so that every day the plans can evolve and get even better.

While Zelensky’s office has made attempts at this over the last year, only when the two civilians died outside the locked shelter did his office believe they had ‘cause’ to instigate re moval.

Over the last 48hrs, two attempts to oust him from his positions failed, the latest being Serhii Gaidai declining to accept the position. 

A **meeting by the Security Council has been called, for midnight tonight, Kyiv time**.  To try, once again.  This time, to install a member of Zelensky’s cabinet to Klitschko’s job.

There is no local support for this—and the City Council and Regional Administration have both attempted to intervene to stop it.  There’s uproar because it’s considered anti-democratic re move elected officials, of opposing parties, and instead install own. 

The press writes that only the intervention, influence of foreign partners will persuade Zelensky’s office to abort this effort.

*This is not what Ukraine, Kyiv, or Zelensky needs right now.  This shocking effort only hands Zelensky’s detractors ammunition.  Zelensky has obtained such good will throughout the world, and Klitschko is so respected, this will would be hurtful to Ukraine’s end goals.*

Yes, you can get the planes in.   And get the air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions in to sustain continual operations.   And get all the equipment and spare parts you need to sustain operations in for planes that need around 20 hours of maintenance for every flight hour.  And then insure that you have adequate defenses to protect your airfields when they become the new #1 priority target for Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.   And get the air crews, maintenance teams and other support personnel trained.   And then set it up so that your own SAMs don't shoot down your own aircraft.   And then train your air defense and ground forces to work in coordination with the aircraft.   Will you then be ready?  Maybe? Possibly, but less than 100%?

Would we prefer those planes be available for the Ukrainians?  Sure!  They'd be hella effective in bringing this war to an end a lot quicker.  But the reason why NATO air forces work as effectively as they do is because all of those elements I listed above are already in place (and then some), and that took decades of work to get to that point.   Yes, the Ukrainians can take shortcuts, but in the long run, that's only going to put Ukrainian pilots and planes at risk.

The real threat of cyber isn't some apocalyptic total system collapse: everything is highly available now. Storage in 2023 is crazy cheap; so there's always more backups. Really cyberwarfare works as a support for other kinds of attacks. Yes, you can't take down a system forever, but if you time your attack right, you take it down when it's most needed. And that's what Russia did: the initial invasion was accompanied by a mass of attacks on Ukrainian systems, and that probably helped create confusion in the Ukrainian defense. But after that initial flurry, Russian cyber has been underwhelming. 

The thing with cyber is that you spend years building bullets that you can only fire once. You spend ages finding vulnerabilities to exploit, but when you've shot your shot, the other side patches, and you're back to the drawing board.

In addition to all the equipment that Ukraine is receiving, the battlefield is quite fair all else equal.

° By tying up Russia's resources in the south, i.e *exactly* where anybody would attack, they can concentrate the rest of the yet to be used assault brigades into the east where they can retake territory occupied in 2022 that hasn't yet been built up defensively as much as the 2014 occupation areas.

° Once the supply lines north to south are cut they can focus on the south and cut across currently occupied territory to reach the sea of Azov and open the way to Crimea.

There has been research on detecting mines with drones via machine learning and I'm sure they are using this on the front.  

But there are certainly complications - the detection relies on visual confirmation, which requires that the drones fly low and slow enough to scan the area with precision.   The mine also has to be visually exposed.  There are theoretically systems which could detect via emag fields but these would have to be even closer and even slower and would have a lot of false positives with all the debris. 

There are counter drone measures near the front like jamming etc as well that makes these operations more difficult.

Finally, while it may detect some mines, and theoretically other drones could be used to destroy the mines it won't catch everything and false confidence is almost worse.

Mainly... There are mines fucking everywhere...  They don't need a drone to know that.   It's less complicated to just push with a tank equipped to destroy the mines - and even these often get KOed after half a field or more and then the column has to turn around.

Let's be generous and say it was mid June so two weeks after they announced Ukraine would be getting them at all.

So did they do all the required training and ship the systems and ammunition all in two weeks? Obviously not, training and moving HIMARS systems started well before they even announced Ukraine would be getting them. I would wager they were being used just before June as well because they would not give the Russians any warning that Ukraine could now hit positions further behind the lines giving Russia time to make adjustments in their operations.

Plus you just ignored the HARM missiles that were never announced at all until they were confronted by the Russians as having used them, that right there is proof  right there some weapon systems are operational in Ukraine before being announced.

I'm assuming they would have needed some level of training on how to use and definitely needed to be fitted into the Ukrainian airframes to fire.  

Ukrainian Troops were training at the home of the Challenger Tank training grounds months before an announcement of tanks being sent (at least from August 2022).  You could argue they were there for other training but it seems unlikely. 

HIMARS and M270 (British supplied ) started being used in June 2022 and were announced end May.  these normally have around an 8 week training program (the US said they were doing it in three for Ukraine... hmm. ) so IMO call it 5/6 for war time, putting training starting  at latest start of May 2022. Apparently the training started on 1st June 2022, I'm going with a big hmmm on this one. 

There's been rumours around certain airbases over here for the last nine months of Ukrainian airforce training on certain airframes.  There were definitely at least two being trained in the US back in Feb/March this year before official agreement on the airframes

At the end of this there will be massive depopulation of Ukraine, if not from battle then from people who have been living 10+ years in the EU and choose permanent migration. Having achieved EU citizenship why would they go back?

There will also be massive debt from IMF style programmes that beggared south east asia in the 90s. The Monsantos of the world will move in and Ukranians won't own anything of their own country. The land will be bought for peanuts by foreign speculators taking advantage of a currency completely in the toilet - perhaps Lviv will again become an ethnically Polish city. If Ukraine achieves their goal of being in the EU they won't be able to prevent the free movement of people and capital - the entire purpose of the EU. 

You can see this in far more developed countries than Ukraine who already own none of their resource wealth, nor any of their own housing stock - that is how liberal democracies work, so you can take this to the bank. 

If they are smart they'll assert their own independence and be a middle power between the west and China - who is actually the only country that can protect them long term from Russia, or from the rapaciousness of a US/EU that wants trillion dollar debts repaid.
