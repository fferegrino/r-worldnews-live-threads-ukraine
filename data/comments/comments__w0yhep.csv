(2) Tourism directly affects the main cities of Russia. Moscow/St. Petersburg  etc. Russia can send young soldiers from the Far East to die and no one will know. A lot harder to explain why the Hermitage is empty. This hurts the government as well as the entire business sector.

Day 144 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today I’m actually not sure if we were shelled or not. Starting at 10pm we heard about 8 extremely loud sounds which did sound like explosions, but the weird part is that they didn’t cause any shockwaves. This leads us to believe that they weren’t explosions, but the work of our artillery. Though we won’t know for sure until tomorrow, for now there are conflicting reports, so it’s difficult to say what it was. 

When explosions from a missile or artillery happen even 5km away from you, you can still feel them through the vibrations caused by the shockwave, and with how loud the explosions we were hearing were, our apartment building should have been shaking non-stop, but it didn’t. We didn’t feel any vibrations going through the building at all, while if something like a missile lands nearby it feels like a small earthquake.

Speaking of missiles, today Russians didn’t fire any missiles at Kharkiv at all, but they did fire some at Chuhuiv, and also apparently shelled it as well, as there were only 2 missiles fired, but people heard more than 8 explosions.

It isn't a particularly important target, it isn't the only way into Crimea, the Russians don't particularly need it to wage war in Donbas or to supply the current frontlines, and Ukraine's tactic for retaking Crimea would be to do so after the Russian logistical machine was already exhausted, but by making frequent reference to it, and seeming to possess (or be close to possessing) weapons capable of hitting it, it forces Russia to assume Ukraine intends to target it, that Ukraine considers it strategically significant, and therefore to expend a lot of forces (including high demand, short supply anti-missile forces) in its defence.

This is just one reason why Cuba has yet to overthrow Communism mind you, but it's just to help illustrate a point.

To take a *current* but *hypothetical* example, a country that bought cheap oil from Russia, like India, could resell the surplus oil at a profit.

> I wrote yesterday that each guided MLRS (GMLRS) rocket cost $135,000 based on some news stories. I dug deeper to confirm, and the cost of GMLRS in 2000 was around $43,000 per rocket. But it’s 22 years later, and the latest contract with Lockheed Martin priced the rockets at $1.1 billion for 9,000 GMLRS rockets and 2,000 cheap practice rounds. Average price is $100,000 per rocket, but given the practice rounds are likely significantly cheaper, $135,000 per actual GMLRS makes sense. That means the bottleneck will continue to be hyperexpensive ammunition. One pod is $810,000 []",1658072123.0,1658066908.0,t3_w0yhep,t1_igikhx4,,1,-23,0,-23,0,0,

Yes.

German ""anti-air"" is also a 30mm autocannon that obliterates ground targets. Why make ""anti-air only"" when it can do both jobs well?

EDIT: It probably should be noted that its more of an anti-helicopter weapon. Most airplanes/jets fly / cruise too high to be shot at with guns. But if a low-flying aircraft comes by, you can bet that the Geopards would take their shot at it.

> anti-armor

Only light armor. 30mm is probably enough for a BMP, but not enough to reliably kill a tank. BMP is of course cheaper so you really don't want to be trading Geopards with Russian BMPs. But the unexpected happens often on the battlefield. Its good to know that your anti-air defenses can defend vs a BMP-2 push unassisted.

EDIT: So the Geopard is an anti-helicopter and anti-light vehicle weapon all around. Helicopters + Humvees + IFVs work together in US doctrine. Granted, the Russians don't seem to be following modern doctrine, but they might. Its a good idea to have one weapon that can handle many opponent's weapons at once.

Geopard handling those vehicles + some Javelin troops to handle the tanks, and you're going to be in a good position.",1658076520.0,1658076037.0,t3_w0yhep,t1_igj2v1c,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Suddenly the use of nukes as an offensive weapon is a reality, and aggressive nations will seek to acquire such weapons to further their goals.  The only way countries will be able to defend against this risk will be to acquire nukes themselves.

Consequently, nuclear weapons will proliferate even more than today, including in countries threatened by Russia (or other nuclear-armed aggressors).  And with such proliferation, the risk of outright nuclear war increases.

*Everyone* understands this—including China, India and yes Russia too.  And they also understand that if they are the ones to trigger this outcome, the rest of the world will shun them for it.

Russia doesn't want this.  They want everyone to cower at their empty threats, not to be an international pariah (even amongst their current allies) with newly nuclear-armed neighbours constantly trying to calculate whether they need to strike first.

So, no.   Russia isn't going to use nukes (even of the ""tactical battlefield variety"", which as others have already pointed out are no more powerful than conventional weapons but with all these attendant geopolitical consequences).

And that's without even considering the escalatory consequences (both domestically and eg with NATO) that using such weapons would entail.",1658042011.0,1658039172.0,t3_w0yhep,t1_ighexkp,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

If the blast radius is reduced to something similar to a conventional bomb (or multiple ones), how is it any tactically different than using conventional bombs which they already have loads of?

So what you’re proposing is basically a use of nukes with similar battlefield effects of conventional ones, while having all the downsides of using a nuke weapon.

The calculus simply isn’t there.

Nukes are meant for deterrence. Using nukes when losing a conventional war means unlocking the pandora’s box, and tells every other nuclear power in the world that nukes are fair game. 

Russia does not want to get into a situation where all other nuclear powers (especially the ones in Europe) will consider using nukes on them.

Also even if the nuke damages are only in Ukraine, and let’s assume that the fallout doesn’t reach NATO nations (which will be an act of war), this means that diplomatically, they’ll get into deeper shit now, that current Russian-friendly nations will be afraid of even their own survival and Russia will be seen as unreliable as they’re nuke-trigger happy. Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for nuke usage when losing a conventional war in a foreign land. Breaking that means Russia loses all little credibility they have left, especially one that relates to the survival of mankind. 

Security concerns still trumps any economic or geopolitical maneuvering. You think Putin is gambling that NATO and EU will be chickens and won’t interfere directly if their survival is at stake? Even Putin doesn’t want to escalate it to that point.

Also Putin and his close circles can take conventional losses in Ukraine while still maintaining their positions domestically. Escalating to the brink of nuclear war means losing their billionaire lifestyles and everything is a real possibility. The madman persona Putin’s been pushing is still a front at the end of the day.

That said, the wider geopolitical consequences would probably not be NATO getting involved directly, but in the use of a nuclear weapon in a proxy conflict.

Even when the US was on the verge of losing in the Korean War, they didn't use nuclear weapons, and they were willing to outright lose rather than to turn nukes from a last resort weapon to another tool. That is what is at risk here. If Putin uses nukes for this non-direct conflict, the possibility of nukes being used in the future by other nations rises drastically, as there is now precedence. The nuclear taboo would be severely if not fatally weakened. Imagine if the US could have nuked Vietnam or the Taliban. If Russia could have nuked Afghanistan the first time. If Israel could nuke Iran. Once you open Pandora's box, there's no closing it.

Current tactic with supplying instructors for our army, I think, is the best one without direct involvement.

This said, I do however find it incredibly stupid that there is a prohibition on some military equipment shipments, like tanks, planes, etc. Like, do they really expect Russia would attack them directly because Poland sent some MIGs to Ukraine? I seriously doubt that. All Russia could do is threaten, and they are not in any way ready for another military operation while war in Ukraine is going on.

The Izium axis was going well until Izium itself was attacked by UAF. This was not very effective in painting the map or capturing cities so it never really made the news - Ukraine just took a pretty much empty forest to the west - but puts Izium (and its bridges and roads) in range of artillery. There is now constant attacks on the supply lines by Ukrainian SPGs. This has also forced the withdrawal of Russia's own artillery units to do counter battery fire. Russia needs more mechanised infantry to really root out this problem, but if they pull any of that back they know Ukraine will counter attack. What they need here is simply more: more men, more tanks, more equipment. If they had more, they could secure their rear and continue forwards.

In the Lysychansk direction, the Russians had a pause to regroup. Siversk should be easy to take (although we said that about Severodonetsk, which Russia still took like 2 months over). Bakhmut likewise should not be posing as much trouble, yet that line hasn't moved for over a month. This speaks more to a lack of leadership and co-ordination. It is pretty much inevitable that Russia will take these two settlements, but whilst it should have been painless they will likely fuck it up to the extent that they take thousands of casualties, again. After that, they have the actual defense line. This is when the Western weapons will come into their own, because it will be then or never. If Ukraine have the weapons ready, then Russia will simply not be able to make progress. Bad terrain for advancing, no roads and railheads that have been systematically sabotaged for 100 miles. This is the sort of push that will require a few million shells to be successful, and progress will be measured in meters per day.

Phase 2: putin orders nukes on alert. Physical steps are taken, certain cars move in and out of parking lots. Bombers are fueled, and either take off or are made ready to. Fuel and oxidizer trucks mobilize. Submarines move to striking distance. Drills of these actions are common but very visible. The ""special alert"" declared at the start of the war was mainly propaganda. 

Phase 3: from alert next is pre-attack actions. Actually fuelling missiles/mating warheads, flight path changes, submarines rising to launch depths. Their system leaks like a colander that can't hold noodles. We'd know.

Phase 4: Deployment. I know nothing about submarine/torpedo defense. Bombers would be intercepted. Cruise missiles can be caught by jets. And missiles are hard to launch in salvos. The most recent/current record holder was Iran's retaliation for the death of a slain Major General. The most common fuel is Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and oxidizer red fuming nitrogen/nitrogen tetroxide (has been for a long time-orange smoke)... this is corrosive so you fuel only when you're about to launch... making synchronized timing very difficult. 

Phase 5: Intercept. In terms of a missile fight, whoever has the most rounds in the air at the same time wins. The attacker needs to swarm to hit a target. The defender has to coordinate with nearby units to maximize capabilities. On top of this are overlapping areas of coverage. The incoming swarm would have to pass through AEGIS, THAAD, PATRIOT, and allied systems one after the other. Each layer depletes the swarm for the next until there are none.

Phase 6: Counter. NATO has troops massed. It'll be a meat steam roller all the way to Moscow in days.",1658044889.0,1658044346.0,t3_w0yhep,t1_ighopgk,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

That's the thing about the Geopard. Its the catch-all jack of all trades vehicle. It may be expensive, but it fits in a lot of combat roles simultaneously.

----------

The only reason to suggest otherwise... is that the Russians have proven themselves incompetent at combined arms. The Russians keep sending units one-by-one without much support for some insane reason. Since the Russians are so freakishly bad at air-support and drone combat, maybe the Geopard's flexibility is useless.

But in theory, (vs say, the USA's army which has good combined-arms doctrine), something like the Geopard is quite useful in theory.

Considering that these systems originate in Soviet times, that's quite impressive. That isn't to say that they might be dated or useless, they are certainly more useful than not having any.

The issue with these S300 batteries is that with the introduction of HIMARS to the battlefield; Ukraine can possible saturate and overwhelm individual batteries. With the quick reload and the range, it actually becomes rather dangerous for these systems to operate and they might be rationing their usage for specific targets (Tochas).

I think Western audiences should not be without any doubt that these are effective systems when used in a particular way.

Its close enough that the Geopard could very well accidentally come across enemy scouts, or even IFVs / Tanks.

That doesn't change the fundamental line of sight tactics behind an antiair gun. You can't shoot the 35mm autocannon over the horizon like a missile system. That means to protect nearby infantry or vehicles, the Flakcannon needs to be close enough to the front to get direct line of sight to the enemy aircraft.

That means that it will be deployed forward, closer to the front rather than at the rear. That's just how antiair guns work.

In such a position, there is a chance that the enemy surprises you, meaning the Flakcannon has a chance to meet the enemy head on in direct fire / engagements.

An enemy capability that needs to have suitable numbers of counter weapons.

When the needs of the military are presented to congress there must be justification to why x numbers of HIMARS are needed.   
If that HIMARS rocket sits in a storage yard it will be replaced nearly indefinitely as long as the direct risk to the nation exists. It will be a forever cost until situations change to require new technology or because the threat no longer exists.  
In this.. it is always a cost negative to have a rocket sit unused. Recycling a rocket is also very expensive. Using a rocket is actually pretty damn cheap. 

So if you USE a rocket... to blow up an ENEMIES vehicle.. you reduce that enemies capacity to HARM the nation which will reduce the NEED for the same amount of rocket storage.

No doubt that's true.

But physics dictates a few issues. If you want to protect your infantry from line-of-sight from Helicopters and/or drones, you need to station the Geopards within line-of-sight of those helicopters/drones (its not a missile system that can shoot over-the-horizon. The Geopard can only shoot at what it sees directly).

I'm not saying that the Geopard will be marching into battle **looking** for BMP-2 or whatever. I'm mostly just saying that the Geopard's weapon systems force it close enough to the front-lines that I'd expect some combat between Geopard and BMP-2.

The horizon is strangely close in the realm of today's combat. Even 500-meters could be enough that the Geopard can't sufficiently protect its infantry from drones/helicopters (if the enemy drone/helicopter is flying low enough in the right kind of terrain).

Its becoming a regional hegemony that's threatens US dominance. It was admitted into the WTO and like everything I have been saying, the USA expected it  to be a nice Liberal democracy, be indepedent and wealthy up to a point.
