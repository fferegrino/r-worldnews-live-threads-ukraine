Edit: source added to support the claim that Lockheed Martin can produce hundreds of ATACMS a year.

>To fulfill those and future foreign orders, the Army has signed at least three contracts with Lockheed Martin since 2018, totaling about $1 billion, for ongoing manufacture of ATACMS, which are ""currently in full-rate production … at a rate of about 500 per year"" at Lockheed Martin's facility in Camden, Ark., according to a company spokesperson, who declined to be named. All are destined for foreign sales.
>
>The limited number of ATACMS is the U.S. military's most pressing concern. While the exact number in the U.S. arsenal is classified, Lockheed Martin has made only about 4,000 since production began, many of them used by the U.S. Army in combat, exercises and periodic testing.
>
>At the same time, nearly 900 have been sold to allies and partners abroad in the past decade — including 211 since the beginning of the Ukraine war, according to the State Department's list of foreign military sales. They have gone to NATO allies, Persian Gulf countries and as far afield as Taiwan and Australia, usually in conjunction with the sale of HIMARS. The administration notified Congress in April of the pending sale of 40 of the missiles to Morocco.

So what can Ukraine do? Well for starters the big danger isn't necessarily the mines but the mines with Russian defenses behind them and artillery behind those. Ukraine has to go slowly and methodically through the fields which makes them extremely vulnerable to Russian artillery strikes. Ukraine also has some (but not tons) of mine clearing equipment. Given these limitations Ukraine's best bet is likely to focus on winning the artillery war so they can slowly go through the minefields without being picked apart.

2. Time is simply up for how long Russia's central bank can prop the Ruble up, which they've been doing since Feb '22, including controlling how and where Rubles are sold on the FX markets. One can only guess that their reserves and favours have run dry and so the Ruble is starting to fall in response.

3. China has changed tack and is slowly shifting to a more and more anti-Russian stance. Without such a major ally to back them, and a clear failure to achieve strategic goals in Ukraine, confidence in Russian stability on the international market is slipping.

4. Russia's big exports are things like military tech (oops) and oil (which has dropped in price again) and so there's just not as much that people want to buy using Rubles, which makes them a less valuable currency to hold.

Honestly if Trump was Putins puppet he was a really shitty puppet by selling the most effective ATGM to a country Russia wanted to invade.

Trump also doesn't have absolute authority to just leave NATO, no American president ever has or does. 

When Russia invaded Ukraine I will also point out Trump came out with his asinine idea of flying US fighter jets to bomb the Russian military in Ukraine and paint Chinese flags on the US jets to make Russia think it was actually China bombing their military. Not really something someone would propose doing who's in Putins pocket.

And a few hawkish Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, have openly called for the assassination of Putin on live TV.

Russia is very dependent on artillery, and they seem to be losing those systems at a brisk pace, if the numbers reported by Ukraine are anything close to accurate.

My impression is that Russia's artillery is getting gradually worse, and Ukraine's artillery and missile defense systems are getting gradually better.  Ukraine also has a much easier job when it comes to supplying their troops.  Russia's position is precarious, and they keep having to route around road/rail/bridge closures and they keep losing ammo and fuel depots.

Meanwhile Ukraine attacked the tanker, so now Russia has the same issues Ukraine does. Ships are not going to want to transport cargo through the black sea due to risk. Brilliant move really. Ukraine is forcing the conditions on Russians that Russians forced on Ukraine. If Ukraine can't ship, neither will Russia. And now Russia's navy can only hide in port. Russia simply cannot afford to lose any more major ships as they lack the ability to replace them. Anyway, another bite to the Russian economy as the black sea is the closest place they can export from to customers in say China.

*He [POTUS] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur;*

The President exclusively has the constitutional power to make treaties (with Senate approval).  However, the Constitution is silent regarding the power to abrogate them.  

During the nineteenth century, government practice treated the power to terminate treaties as shared between the Legislative and Executive Branches.  

At the turn of the twentieth century, a new form of treaty termination emerged: unilateral termination by the President without approval by the Legislative Branch.  Although Congress at times enacted legislation authorizing or instructing the President to terminate treaties during the twentieth century,  unilateral presidential termination became the norm.

The President’s exercise of treaty termination authority has not generated opposition from the Legislative Branch in most cases, but there have been occasions in which Members of Congress sought to block unilateral presidential action. 

In 1978, a group of Members filed suit in *Goldwater v. Carter* seeking to prevent President Jimmy Carter from terminating a mutual defense treaty with the government of Taiwan as part of the United States’ recognition of the government of mainland China.

If your cheaper system is destroyed and trained soldiers killed it obviously can no longer help in the fight, its value for money becomes irrelevant if it can't survive on the battlefield. The US military likes HIMARS because it is very fast and has longer range than 155 mm artillery, it can fire and be gone in a minute or two. Plus the GMLRS rockets for HIMARS aren't actually that much more expensive than guided Excaliber 155 mm round and you get a much bigger bang than a 155 mm shell. Add in the capability to fire ATACMS or its even longer range replacement and it's easy to see why they're gravitating towards HIMARS.

Here is an interview with the second highest officer in the Marine command structure talking about their shift to HIMARS, it's from last year but their reasoning is unlikely to have changed.

One time Congress formally challenged a president's treaty abrogation, (back in 1978) the courts dismissed the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the act.

lol, no. Ukraine is fighting Russia and the country didn't have a functioning military 8-9 years ago. The US military is literally designed to be able to fight Russia and China at the same time if needed. Russia has been so poor after the USSR's failure that Russia hasn't had real large sums of money to spend on military until about 10-15 years ago. A large portion of that spending since then has gone to rebuilding their nuclear weapons. You can see the funding failure in stuff like their Mig-35 which they built 6 of. The US on the other hand has the F-35 which has shown that it can go 20 to 1 in kills against stuff like the F-22 and the US has built a thousand of them. Not only that the US is in the process of buying a thousand of the Valkyrie drones to pair with the F-35.

Sure, Russia has a lot of artillery and anti-air. That isn't going to help them against the US.

>The USA doesn't like long wars for that reason.

>Also, you forget, Iraq was far more.unpopular and Americans were there for 20 years

No, it wasnt. After 9/11 everyone drank the patriot cool aid and initial support for the war was in the 70s% or more. It took years to make it that unpopular. And this was against a guerrilla where the US had already won and occupied the country.

Here the war would be extremely unpopular, from the beginning. Against a state that would exist and be free, among its allies, to drag the US's image into the mud. With them, rightly, accusing the US of the biggest humanitarian disaster and trying to literally starve millions of people out. With US troops and planes, even if very few, dying every so often. It would be an utter mess and Putin would only need to hold out at lost 2 terms befofe it ends.

This is without taking in count nuclear weapons, which Russia could use, again the calculus. Using nukes today is bad for the Putin elite because it would place them in unecessary danger. However here the US is already attacking them to force a regime change, so the calculus change. They are already going to end up killed anyway, so they might as well do suicide and take the US out with them.",False,1691391724.0,t3_15jfr0l,t1_jv3pb30,,8,1,0,1,0,0,
