I couldn't really wrap my mind around it - in school they only talked about Soviet atrocities committed in Germany as a form of revenge. At least that made sense in a brutal, sickening way. But why do this in Poland, the Baltic countries, Hungary and all the other places which were going to be part of the Eastern block? Wouldn't it be better to show some goodwill to the civilian population, to show that they were in safe hands and that this was the beginning of a great new era?  
Eventually, someone pointed out to me that I was very naive. Had I forgot that Stalin was in power?  
The only objective was to instill terror and fear, to subjugate by brute force. No one actually gave a shit about aesthetics.

Day 38 & 39 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday (38th) was again pretty quiet around my area but they just don’t stop shelling Saltivka, they are destroying everything. They continued shelling it today (39th) as well, and they also shelled Slobidskyi district killing 7 people, injuring 34 and damaging 10 buildings along with trolleybus depot. 

Streets in those districts are also full of spent booster modules from Grad and Smerch missiles. While they don’t explode, they will still kill you if one hits you directly. Those things especially love to land on children’s playgrounds. They sure do know their targets well.

We also continue to read what Russians think about recent events and it makes us sick. They just don’t stop foaming at the mouth about how Bucha is clearly fake and how every corpse is actually an actor. They claim that you can see them moving (you can’t, they’re dead), and that Russian soldiers would never do that.

How can you see the evidence with your own eyes and still claim it’s fake? I can’t understand it, this is pure madness. They are denying reality to this extent and for what? They are not even getting paid (well most of them don’t) but they still continue to say that everything is fake while watching fucking Soloviev and believing all of the garbage that he spews. Now they are calling our entire army a terrorist organization on their main channels because we didn’t surrender to them.

They really live in an alternate reality. It was especially evident when Peskov said that he hopes nationalistic mindset in Ukraine will disappear after this war and that Russian language will restore its former positions here. Does he even have a brain? How can he even say this shit seriously?  

You destroy our country, you kill our people, you try to erase Ukrainian nationality and after all of this you think we will start loving Russia? What they have done will have a completely different result from the one they want, it will strengthen nationalism, not weaken it. This will turn indifferent people into patriots. Are they really this clueless?

They really don’t understand how anything works. Russia thinks that it can just beat anyone into submission, but that only works on their own people. I mean Russians even have a saying “Бьет – значит любит” which roughly means “if he beats you, it means he loves you” Russia is truly an abusive partner in the form of a country.

👉🆕 Four or five naked female bodies were found yesterday beneath a blanket on a highway near Kyiv, their clothes on the side of the road. It's difficult to confirm the exact number due to how they were found. Kyiv Police says the perpetrators tried to burn the bodies before leaving. Besides the atrocities found committed in Bucha, there has been many other civilian bodies found partially buried (in Motyzhyn) or in cars run off the road by gunfire. The Kyiv-Zhytomyr M06 highway is reportedly littered with numerous dead civilian bodies

👉🆕 AFU's General Staff confirms that Russian troops have completely withdrawn from the Sivershchyna area of Kyiv Oblast to Belarus, with the state border to Belarus firmly in Ukrainian hands. Ukrainian troops have already symbolically raised the flag in the ""ghost town"" of Pripyat in Chernobyl. JFO troops in the Donbas repulsed 6 Russian attacks yesterday, destroying 4 tanks, 6 armoured vehicles and 7 trucks. AFU air defence units also hit 8 air targets yesterday: 2 planes, 1 helicopter, 1 UAV and 4 cruise missiles

👉🆕 British intelligence in their latest report say Russian naval forces maintain their blockade. They believe Russia still retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing but that such an operation would be considered high risk due to the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare.  They also note that the mines in the Black Sea's origin remain unclear and disputed, but that their presence is almost certainly due to Russian naval activity

👉🆕 President Zelenskyy in his customary evening address yesterday said that all moments matter, and everyone can contribute to the victory of all, that even a warm word and help at the right time makes a difference

**Politics/Diplomacy**


👉🆕 Russia's lead negotiatior Vladimir Medinskiy says new negotations will be held online tomorrow via video link like the previous time. He also reiterates that Russia's position on Crime and Donbas remains ""UNCHANGED"", and that the draft proposal is not ""ready for submission to a meeting at the top""

👉🆕 Poland's deputy PM accuses France and Germany of being too close to Moscow. He condemns Germany for not supplying enough weapons or helping set up a EU oil embargo, saying he is ""extremely dissatisfied"". He also says they are open to the idea of USA stationing nuclear forces in Poland as deterrent

👉🆕 UK's Ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, says that ""rape is a weapon of war"" that is already part of the Russian arsenal, and ""women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families"" is a deliberate act of subjugation and a war crime

👉🆕 UK's FM Liz Truss says she is ""appalled"" by the atrocities in Bucha and other Ukrainian towns, calling the reports of Russian forces targeting innocent civilians as ""abhorrent"". She says the UK is working with others to collect evidence so the responsible can be held to account 

👉🆕 Ukraine's FM Dmytro Kuleba calls the Bucha ""massacre"" deliberate, that Russia aims to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can. He demands new ""devastating sanctions"" from G7, including a complete energy embargo

👉🆕 EU Council President Charles Michel says he is shocked by the ""haunting images of atrocities"" that Russian forces have committed in the Kyiv region, and that EU is preparing new sanctions as well as assisting Ukraine and non-governmental organisations in gathering necessary evidence for pursuit in international courts


**Other notable events**

👉🆕 Vladimir Solovyov, host of Russian TV Rossiya-1, claims on Telegram that the atrocities in Bucha were staged by Ukraine. He says the bodies are ""deliberately laid out"" and claims the corpses are not real, as they move their hands and sit down

👉🆕 Ukraine's former President Petro Poroshenko calls for convening UNSC and UN Human Rights Council to present the ""inhuman facts of genocide of the Ukrainian people by the Putin regime""

👉🆕 Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov published a video on his Telegram purportedly showing SOBR Spetsnaz delivering humanitarian aid from the ""Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation"" to Mariupol citizens. Observant viewers immediately noticed that it was looted Ukrainian-made products distributed

👉🆕 Human Rights Watch has released a report documenting what they call ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty, and violence against Ukrainian civilians"", that the rape, murder and other violent acts against people in the custody of Russian forces should be investigated as war crimes

4a470bfe3eaf149bf1d751291f3779bd,tv0emr,i39k9nr,"So Russia had about 120 BTGs dedicated to the invasion of Ukraine at the outset - not all of those actually got into the fighting, but we can assume a large share did.

The maps produced by the Jomini of the West twitter account (which has been doing great work tracking day-by-day developments and locations of Russian forces) estimated the following approximate disposition of Russian BTGs prior to the retreat from the north:

West of Kyiv: ~15 BTGs (35th and 36th CAA)

East of Kyiv: ~16 BTGs (90th TD and 2nd GMRD)

Chernihiv: ~10 BTGs (41st CAA)

Sumy/Kharkiv: ~29-38 BTGs (1st GTA (20-24 BTGs) directly invested with Sumy/Karkiv, with the 2nd GCAA (9-14 BTGs) to the north)

Donbas: ~25-32 BTGs (6th CAA, 20th CAA, and 8th CAA)

Kherson/Mykolaiyv: 17 BTGs (58th CAA)

Mariupol: Not sure, best guess from the maps is 5-10 BTGs.

Ukrainian estimates are that 50 of the 120 BTGs are currently either destroyed or battered to the point where they need to be reconstituted before they can be operationally effective again. Michael Kofman's tweet thread in the live thread from an hour ago gives a more conservative estimate of 40 BTGs out of commission, which still represents 1/3 of the combat power Russia allocated for the invasion.

There's no way to know how those losses were distributed, but it's reasonable to assume that the Russians suffered greater losses in areas where the fighting has been reported to be more intense (Kyiv/Cherihiv, Mariupol). We also know that the Russians reported losing about ~1/7 of the two Corps attacking near Donetsk, and can safely assume actual casualties might be double that, which would put losses there in the 25-30% range.

So let's do a quick back-of-the-envelope estimate for Russian BTG losses, using Kofman's lower figure (1/3 losses) for areas where the fighting has been medium intensity, and the Ukrainian's higher figure (5/12 losses) for areas where the fighting has been higher intensity:

Kyiv (high intensity): 13/31 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated

Chernihiv (high intensity): 4/10 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated

Sumy/Kharkiv (medium intensity): 10-13/29-38 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated.

Donbas (medium intensity): 8-11/25-32 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated.

Kherson/Mykolaiyv (medium intensity): 6/17 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated

Mariupol (high intensity): 2-4/5-10 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated

That gives us a rough range of 43-51 BTGs destroyed or incapacitated. It also gives us a picture of the difficulty of shifting forces from the north to immediately reinforce the Donbas line of attack: Russia might be able to pull roughly 24 'healthy' BTGs from the Kyiv/Chernihiv attacks and (eventually) redeploy them to the Kharkiv/Donbas front, but they've suffered estimated losses of 18-24 BTGs in those theaters already, so the redeployed forces would really only be replacing what's been lost.

Long story short: given that the Ukrainians will doubtless be reinforcing to the east as well, I'm not sure the Russians will be able to harvest enough operationally effective BTGs from the north to make a decisive difference in the current (mostly) stalemated situation.

(Obviously, these are all rough estimates, and I could certainly be wrong in terms of which areas I labeled medium/high intensity. But I think this is broadly representative of the current situation.)",False,1649017165.0,t3_tv0emr,t3_tv0emr,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

British military intelligence said on Saturday that Ukraine’s air defense capability continues to pose significant challenges to Russian aircraft, despite the invading forces' continued effort to diminish Ukraine's air defenses.

“Ukraine continues to provide a significant challenge to Russia Air and Missile operations. As a result, Russian aircraft are still vulnerable to short and medium range air defense systems,” the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in an Intelligence Update.
Russia has not been able to obtain control of the air due its inability to find and destroy Ukrainian air defense systems, the ministry said. Thus, this inability has significantly affected Russia’s, “ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts,” according to the MOD.

The residents, gathered in large numbers, forced them to retreat

👉🆕 A 29-year old woman identified as 'Liubov', from Kharkiv, where she has lived her entire life with her mother who was bedridden the last 3 years, claims Russian soldiers stole their food, with one of them staying after to rape her. The Russian soldier then stayed a whole week while repeatedly raping her, saying that he ""loved her"" and wanted to take her away to safety. When Liubov refused, saying she couldn't leave her mother, the Russian shot her mother dead in front of her

👉🆕 The aircraft reported shot down over Izyum earlier today has been preliminarily identified as a Russian Su-35 fighter jet by Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko, who also says the pilot managed to eject and has been captured

👉🆕 Accounts from Bucha have emerged claiming that Russian forces used children as ""human shields"" while regrouping. The Guardian reports that in Novyi Bykiv, a village close to Chernihiv, coaches of children were said to have been placed in front of tanks, and that children had been taken hostage in a number of occupied areas in the country to gain cooperation from locals and ensure that Russian troop movements were not reported


**Politics/Diplomacy**

👉🆕 Ukraine's FM Dmytro Kuleba requests that the International Criminal Court sends representatives to Bucha and other Kyiv region towns to gather the evidence of Russian war crimes and says it will be his ""mission for life"" to bring justice to those responsible for the atrocities committed in the Kyiv region

👉🆕 A 3-hour long video from security camera footage taken in a post office in Mozyr, Belarus, shows a non stop flow of Russian soldiers recently returned from the Kyiv region that are sending home what they've looted. The video is available on YouTube and was re-shared by Ukraine's Defence Ministry

👉🆕 Hundreds gathered at the Ukrainian Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, to commemorate the victims of the Bucha Massacre with flowers and candles

👉🆕 2 witness reports from Belgorod, Russia, claim there were two blasts heard in the city today

👉🆕 Kevin Rothrock, investigative journalist and managing editor of the Meduza project, claims that Russia's Defence Ministry TV network reported, two days ago, that Russian marines were ""cleansing"" settlements outside Kyiv to fortify their positions, suggesting that the atrocities committed may have in part been ordered from higher up

👉🆕 Several OSINT groups, Bellingcat and Conflict Intelligence Team, are collecting all footage they can get their hands on from Bucha and other places in the Kyiv region in attempts to find evidence of which Russian units were deployed to the area, to find out who is responsible. Preliminary findings suggest the 76th and 98th Airborne Assault Divisions as well as Kadyrovite and  Rosgvardia units were located in Bucha

👉🆕 It's election day in Hungary, where pro-Russia incumbent Viktor Orban fights to retain his power.

The race is reportedly tight, but slightly in favour of the ruling party Fidesz, and there's also been multiple reports of supposed voter fraud

👉🆕 Many pro-Kremlin social media accounts are trying to sow doubt today of the atrocities in the Kyiv region, saying no Western media had been allowed in so it was probably fake (plenty of Western media reported from there), that bodies were crisis actors (confirmed by many credible sources that bodies are real, dead people), or that the people were shot by Ukrainian forces for being ""collaborators"". One propaganda effort was a low quality video released purported to show one of the bodies driven by had moved their hand. Higher quality versions of the video shows indisputably that no body is moving

👉🆕 Some vital drugs in Russia has becoming increasingly more difficult to find, with one resident of Kazan, Russia's 5th largest city, telling AP that no pharmacy in the city had the blood thinner her father needs. Vrachi.Rf, one of Russia's biggest online communities for medical workers, surveyed more than 3,000 doctors in mid-March, only to show there were widespread shortages of more than 80 medications. Russia's Health Minister, Mikhail Murashko, claims there is no problem with drug availability in the country, and that any shortages are to be blamed on hoarders that have panic-bought

I've also defended russian civillians because the level of state propaganda they are subjected to is large in scale and scope.

But we're a month into this war. In a warzone, word travels among troops. By now russian troops know they are not fighting nazi's, and they've heard how they destroy cities and homes and are not met with flowers. And russian civillians, when you hear parents who have children who *live in Ukraine* tell them on the phone that the russian army is shelling cities, call their children liars and brainwashed...when you see interviews where russians dodge any questions with ""I'm apolitical"", they *know*. They know and they don't speak up and they defend themselves by saying how they could end up in jail prison or get fines. While the Ukrainians, that they dare call ""brothers"" end up dead or with children killed.

Then its time to start holding them accountable. You don't get to ""I didn't know, and I was just following orders"" yourself out of this.

>	Follow up thread on Russian force availability and long-term prospects. The Russian military has taken significant casualties. After redeploying, and pulling additional units from standing formations, it may be tapped out of available forces, for now.

>	If the Russian leadership wants to continue this war it has to make a significant political choice. They cannot sustain a long war against Ukraine as a special operation, and they don’t want to reframe it as a war. This has implications for force availability.

>	Moscow is trying to fight a war with the largest country in Europe without declaring a state of war at home. Ukraine has fully mobilized, and has extensive Western support. Russia may technically have more manpower and materiel on paper, but it is politically inaccessible.

>	The Russian military is not prepared for a long war, and expected this ‘operation’ to be done within days. Now a significant part of the force is exhausted. As a very rough estimate, they may have lost ~30 battalions (not BTGs) worth of equipment.

>	Although the Russian military has a lot of kit, assuming a 200,000 force deployed with more than 120 BTGs involved, separatist army corps, and Rosgvardia, that military now has substantially reduced combat effectiveness.

>	The Russian military has pulled together what they could from the remaining standing force, including bases abroad, and Kaliningrad. There’s now close to nothing left to send beyond those battalions that have recently arrived to support offensives in the Donbas.

>	It is difficult to say what constitutes the current ground force available for the next phase in the war. I don’t like low confidence numbers since they give a false sense of certainty.

>	I would say it is still a significant, but substantially diminished force. Best guess is ~80 BTGs total. I would take that number with a grain of salt, keeping in mind that BTGs are used here as a rough unit of measurement.

>	There is also no evidence of stoploss. The Russian military is taking in 134,500 conscripts this month as part of a biannual draft & releasing those whose terms of service have expired. Since Moscow has not declared a war, it has no political basis for retaining conscripts.

>	So how is the Russian leadership trying to square this circle? There are rumors that they’re offering sizable payouts to those willing to sign a contract, including conscripts getting out of service, and those with prior military experience.

>	There are also cases where conscripts are intimidated into switching to contract service - sometimes given the choice between months of difficult serving conditions and signing a contract.

>	Behind the scenes the Russian military is likely trying to increase manning in formations. These are often manned at ~75%, hence the tiered readiness system with contract-staffed BTGs. Many have heard of Shoigu’s 168 BTG figure. I think this number is technically committed.

>	Brigades and regiments are generally supposed to generate 2 BTGs, and be able to produce a 3rd over time with increased manning. The Russian military expected to raise those manning levels via mobilization in the event of a war - they’re likely trying to do it piecemeal now.

>	By offering substantial amounts of ₽ to get more manpower, the Russian military may fill out some of these formations. In my view, they may then deploy as battalions and entire units, since many unit HQs & support elements are in the war already.

>	There are also auxiliary forces. Syrian mercs, Wagner ChvK, etc. These are not going to make a difference in this war. They can amount to a few battalions more at best. They’re symptomatic of the problem: Russia is short on troops, looking to get manpower where they can.

>	In short, Russia can get more battalions, but without a national mobilization its ability to pursue the war beyond the Donbas looks very circumspect. And it can’t get more units quickly. Right now, the Russian mil has to fight largely with what it has managed to put together.

>	This problem is somewhat unsurprising. The Russian mil was built around the concept of active defense, eschewing strategic ground offensives. It lacks the logistics, and manpower, to sustain this kind of fight in the largest country in Europe.

>	However, if Putin chooses to declare a state of war, conduct national mobilization, the situation becomes a lot more complicated. In that case, Russian manpower and materiel availability would be subject to a decidedly different set of calculations.

>	Would he have the domestic support to do it? Entirely up for debate. There appears to be substantial support for the war within the Russian public, but it is uneven, and extent of true support vs fake poll reporting highly disputed.

>	Conversely, Ukraine is going to need ammunition and more equipment to replace losses, equip reserves. It needs mechanized equipment for counter-offensives. ATGMs and MANPADS alone won’t do. Hence the ask for Soviet equipment from countries that have inventories.

>	I’m sure some folks will say - but Ukraine has captured a lot of equipment. On paper, yes, but it’s going to be a while before this kit is serviceable, manned, and deployed where it makes a tangible difference. A few captured tanks or IFVs do not an armored brigade make.

>	In some ways this is a story of one military which has large amounts of mobilized manpower, but shortages of kit to equip the force, and another military which has large reserves of equipment, but a visible crunch in available manpower without national mobilization.

>	Beyond the current battle in the Donbas, if this eventually becomes a prolonged war of attrition, Ukraine seems overall in a more favorable position, but I think the honest answer is 'it depends.' That's my unsatisfactory conclusion thus far.

>	Some folks below asked about intangibles like morale. The asymmetry between the two armies is quite clear, but this thread is about force availability, not expected performance.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Sunday accused Russian forces of committing ""appalling acts"" in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha and Irpin and demanded that they be investigated as war crimes.

Truss stressed that Russia should not be allowed to ""cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation,"" adding that the UK will play its part in ensuring this doesn't occur. 

Truss committed the UK's full support to ""any investigations by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its role as the primary institution with the mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes.""

Spinning up the public too much via propaganda seems like a double edged sword.  Obviously support is nice, but if you're struggling as much militarily as Russia, does it really help to have the public too bloodthirsty to accept an offramp that Putin may want to take?  High support would help if you need to, say, implement conscription, but wouldn't that support slip quickly if they think you're losing or failing to properly implement your stated goals?

I noticed this when Ukraine bombed the fuel depot, and again when they pulled out of Kyiv.  Normally bloodthirsty Russian posters were aghast.  Seems like they had been expecting overwhelming success and they immediately turned on authorities. Their passion for the war turned equally passionate in their criticism. Had they been indifferent, the lack of progress might have been easier to take, maybe? Their support for the war was not support for leadership and their decisions.  At the surface it appears the same, but on a deeper level, it seems like Putin's cronies have hoisted themselves by their own petard.

""When it comes to our sanctions, we've always said that we will continue applying pressure on President Putin, on the Kremlin, on all of those around him including oligarchs and cronies who are empowering this war of choice against Ukraine, until and unless the Kremlin deescalates, until and unless the violence diminishes, and until and unless these kinds of atrocities come to an end. So I suspect you will very soon see additional pressure applied,” Price told MSNBC Sunday. 

""When it comes to these images out of Bucha, we have already assessed that Russia's forces have committed war crimes. What we're doing, we are collecting information. One, to shine a spotlight on precisely what they're doing, but two, to ensure that all of those who have perpetrated these atrocities and all of those who ordered these atrocities are held to account. That's our mission,"" he continued.

Shocking images came to light from Bucha, Ukraine Saturday by Agence France-Presse of at least 20 civilian men dead and lining a single street. The photos were released the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry regarding allegations of the execution of civilians in the Kyiv region and other parts of Ukraine.

Asked about peace talks, Price said, ""We have not seen any indication yet that the Russians are truly serious about deescalating this war."" 

Price also dismissed reports that the Russian ruble is recovering from the sanctions, saying, ""This is almost entirely artificial. The ruble is on life support with draconian measures that the Kremlin has been forced to take to artificially prop up the value of the ruble.”

Price noted that the government is preventing Russians and others from selling rubles “precisely to establish this floor and ensuring that the value we see reflected on the market isn't actually the actual worth of the ruble today.”

That one soldier that ran over his commanding officer and may or may not have killed him was part of a larger mutiny. 

That mutiny was in the 37th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, which was part of the 36th Combined Arms Army. 

The 36th is the unit primarily responsible for the atrocities in Bucha, one of the three CAA's in the area and, from what I can tell at least, primarily responsible for the war crimes. 

It is entirely possible that these soldiers were aware of what their rear echelon was doing and hated it, or the reverse of that, where they got too out of control because of the killings they had been doing.

The main Russian forces attacking near and north of Donetsk are the 1st and 2nd Army Corps, with 7 total brigades of 4000-4500 troops each. The Russians apparently just disclosed 800 dead and 3600 wounded in those two Corps, which would be the equivalent of a full brigade worth of casualties. But you have to believe that the Russians are understating their losses - if you assume actual losses as double the disclosed number, we're talking about roughly two brigades worth of troops being out of commission. That's 25-30% of the total manpower of those two Corps!

The channel is also hearing that the veterans of the 2014 conflict (who'd be the most experienced troops in that region) suffered disproportionate losses.

That would go a long way to explaining why we haven't seen many significant attacks in the southern Donbas region in recent days - the 1st and 2nd Army Corps are likely mauled to the point where they don't have the strength to do more than hold their positions and launch artillery/rocket attacks.

But Russia doesn't have time anymore. They just freed up tons of Ukrainian troops that are largely intact, and those troops are going to go elsewhere. Their existing troops will be hit by a wave of new troops and their lines will buckle.

So I, and a lot of other people, think that Russia is going to throw the damaged groups into the fray with a roll of duck tape and some bandaids. And they still have strategic goals to get, so they will be launching costly attacks against strong defensive lines with damaged units that are cobbled together at best.

Kharkiv Rape

On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha [not her real name], a 31-year-old woman in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region that Russian forces controlled at the time.

Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother.

At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: “He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door.” A guard opened the door.

The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement.

The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.

“People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three,” Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him.

The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair.

She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear. “While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.”

The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things, so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. “I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me,” she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face.

At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left.

That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. “I am lucky to be alive,” she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal complaint, which they plan to file with Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office.

1. Russia’s ‘mobile crematoriums’ were publicized and there was a consensus (at least from what I recall seeing on OSINT) that the Russians didn’t care about their own troops and planned to cremate their dead soldiers in Ukraine.

2. In the early days of the war [three captured Russian officers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nAvV8jSEpVs) were interviewed and said they were given orders to maintain order and ‘use firing squads’ if necessary. 

3. The tragic aftermath in the recently liberated Kyiv suburbs looks as if the Russians were trying to implement mass murder/genocide but ran out of time. 

My question is this, we’re the mobile crematoriums not for fallen soldiers but for Ukrainians? Rhetoric and recent actions point that way.

Summary Killings, Other Violence

On February 27, Russian forces rounded up six men in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in the Chernihiv region, and summarily executed them. Tetiana, from Novyi Bykiv, which faces Staryi Bykiv, just across the Supiy River, spoke with the relatives of four of the men who were killed. She told Human Rights Watch that on February 27, the bridge between Novyi Bykiv and Staryi Bykiv was blown up, and Russian forces shelled both villages. A column of Russian armored vehicles then entered Staryi Bykiv.

“Most people were hiding in their basements because of shelling, and soldiers went door to door,” Tetiana said the families from Staryi Bykiv told her. The soldiers took six men from their homes:

    They took six men from three different families. One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son … to question him. They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them.

Viktoria, Bohdan’s mother, interviewed separately, told Human Rights Watch that on February 27:

    They took my son, Bohdan [age 29], and my brother-in-law, Sasha [full name Olexander, age 39]. We were in the basement [due to the shelling], so we didn’t see. They went out to smoke. Then our neighbor ran up and said he saw them taking Bohdan and Sasha away, and a few other guys.

Viktoria ran to the street to ask Russian soldiers at the checkpoint what had happened. “They told us not to worry, that [soldiers] would scare them a bit and then let them go,” she said. “We walked away about 50 meters … and heard gunshots. It was about 6:20 p.m.”

Viktoria said that the next day she and her sister went to the meadow and saw the bodies lying by a building there:

    Three were on one side of the building, but not my son and brother-in-law. We walked around to the other side and saw [Bohdan and Sasha, and one more]. They were laying there. There were gunshots to their heads. Their hands were tied behind their backs. I looked at my son’s body, his pockets were empty, he didn’t have his phone, or keys or [identity] documents.

Viktoria asked soldiers at the checkpoint for permission to collect the bodies, but they refused. Heavy shelling continued the following days.

On March 7, Viktoria said, they again asked the soldiers for permission to collect the bodies: “At the checkpoint they told us to go the cemetery, that they’d bring us the bodies.… Everyone [all the neighbors] came, like 75 people.... We buried all of them on the same day, in separate graves.”

Viktoria said that the other four men buried that day were Volodymyr, 40, another Olexander, 40, and two brothers, Ihor, 31, and Oleh, 33.

Tetiana said the soldiers also took all of the villagers’ wood, leaving them nothing for cooking or heating their homes.

On March 4, Russian forces summarily executed a man in Bucha, 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, and threatened to execute four others, said a teacher who witnessed the killing. She said she heard shooting at about 7 a.m. and saw three Russian armored vehicles and four Kamaz [Russian brand] trucks driving down her street. She was sheltering in the cellar with her two dogs when she heard glass breaking, and then her front door being broken down. Voices outside said [in Russian]: “Come outside right now or we will throw a grenade.”

She yelled that she was alone in the cellar and came out with her hands up.

“There were three men outside, two [Russian] soldiers and a commander,” she said. “They took my phone and checked it, then told me to get my [identification] documents and come with them.” As she walked down the street with the soldiers, she saw that they were also rounding up her neighbors and ordering them to walk. She said:

    They took us to where the office of AgroButpostach [a rental storage company] used to be. Right next to the building, there is a parking lot and a small square. They gathered people at that square, mostly women but there were also several men among us, over 50 [years old]. There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia…. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear.

She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone’s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units:

    Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long. Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood.

She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather:

    At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: “Don’t worry. You are all normal – and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.”

She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes. The other four men remained kneeling when she left.

She said that when she was able to leave the town on March 9, the young man’s body was still lying where he had been shot.

Dmytro, 40, told Human Rights Watch that he and his family fled the heavily shelled city of Bucha on March 7. He said that they did not know of any safe evacuation routes, so they walked – wrapped in white sheets and waving white sheets in the air – for about five kilometers to the village of Vorzel.

Once in Vorzel, they sheltered for two nights in the basement of a two-story building, with a group of local residents. Dmytro said that there was a woman with them in the basement who had chest and leg wounds. Other people in the basement told him that she had been shot the day before, when Russian soldiers stormed that same basement and threw a smoke grenade inside. Several people panicked and ran outside, where Russian soldiers fired at them. The woman was wounded, and the people in the basement told him that a 14-year-old child was shot in the head and killed. Dmytro said that the woman died the next day, on March 8. He and several local residents buried her outside the bomb shelter.

On March 4, Russian forces threatened to execute a man and his son in Zabuchchya, a village outside the city of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv. A village resident said that on March 4, Russian forces entered the village, where he was sheltering with 10 other people, including a family from Irpin, in the basement of his home. In a separate interview, his daughter corroborated his account. He said that 13 soldiers entered his house to search it:

    The soldiers asked about my son, 34, who is in the territorial defense. He came out to meet them. They asked who was in the house and then they searched the house and turned it upside down.… In the backyard, they found my hunting rifle and a bottle of gasoline, and they went ballistic.

    The commander who gave orders to others said: “Take them [me and my son] to the tree outside and shoot them.” They took us outside. One of the soldiers objected. They took us back inside and ordered my son to strip naked because they said they wanted to look for nationalist tattoos. Other soldiers also went to houses on our street, including the house of a judge – she had gone and locked the house – and the local council deputy.

    They broke the window in the judge’s house to get in. We saw them taking bags and bags of stuff out of the judge’s house. After that, they left.… I took my family and everyone who was in the basement, and we fled in two cars. My wife and my son and mother, 80, are now staying at my daughter’s house in Khodosivka [southwest of Kyiv].",False,1648990601.0,t3_tv0emr,t3_tv0emr,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

The US will provide $50 million to help Moldova assist with the impacts of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, including supporting programs training and equipment for border management, and efforts to counter human trafficking, according to a news release.

“Today, I was able to see firsthand the way your government and the Moldovan people have come together to embrace Ukrainian refugees — most of them women and children — who have been forced to leave behind everything they have and people they love to flee to safety,” UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said at a joint news conference with the Moldovan prime minister.

“You have welcomed them with open arms. And for this, your hospitality and generosity are now known around the world. I want you to know that, in all your efforts, you have a committed partner in the United States. We know that this assistance will go far in your hands,” she continued.

The US funding will also support “key lines of effort of the Moldova Support Conference, taking place April 5 in Berlin, to advance international support for Moldova's resilience and reform agenda,” the US mission said.

I assume most of these people are trolling, because from where I make an assessment, this war is worse. I'm not just thinking about raw death tolls. I'm thinking about the list of actions performed and the losses per unit time.

WW2 was a six year war on the back of six years of Nazi rule in Germany and seventeen years of Stalin. The holodomor had already happened by the time official WW2 started, taking place from 1932. If we start the clock from 1932 and run to 1945, that's 13 years of suffering.

You can't equate a month long war to a war of 13 years like for like.

What you can do is examine it *pro rata*. What would a month of that time look like? Answer: this is as bad, probably worse. If this dragged on for 13 years it would make WW2 look like toddlers fighting in a sandpit.

In a month, Russia has performed all the actions that were the worst of WW2's atrocities. Genocide. Deportation. Mass murder. Murder of POWs. Mass rape, including the rape of infants. Destruction of civilian cities. Starvation of civilians in cities. Destruction of food supplies including burning farmland and mass shootings of livestock. The list keeps going.

All the time, of course, they're holding a threat over the west that Hitler never had: touch us and we use nuclear weapons.

Right now, yes, WW2 was worse. This, though, will *become* worse if we don't stop it before it reaches that point.

If you like extrapolation, the places this conflict could go are massive. One hypothetical: it's a potential flashpoint for a major conflict, with neighbouring nations being drawn in. Consequences will continue to spread, with Russia's support for Syria falling pushing Turkey, Israel, and Iran into a tough choice: fight each other or take out Assad and turn to fight Russia. Russia's support in Africa will be next, drawing the usually peaceful Chinese into forced peacekeeping operations to defend their interests and assets there. Various -stans break from CSTO, primarily Kazakhstan which is already pulling away from Russia. Along with Afghanistan and Pakistan, they form a new bloc. China and India both get nervous about this and we see a three way tension on the shared border. Incidents like the one a few years back with Indian and Chinese soldiers fighting with clubs happen again. Mistrust grows. One side secretly equips troops there will concealed pistols in violation of the demilitarisation orders. They get used. A full scale war between three powers breaks out, and in the noise China moves on Russian territories as the Russian army gets battered in the East.

""Identifying Secondary Trauma

Overtime, even with vigilance, frequent exposure to graphic content can begin to affect the most resolute investigator. Here are some warning signs to be mindful of in your own life.
  
Look for changes in your sleep, diet and relationships:
  
Are you sleeping more than normal, not being able to sleep, or having nightmares?
  
Have you started to eat more junk food, or has your appetite decreased?
  
Do you spend more time alone, possibly pushing those close to you away?
  
Has your relationship to drugs and/or alcohol changed?
  
Veering from normal habits can be a sign that your open source investigative work might be negatively affecting you. Once you recognize these signs it is time to pause and evaluate your mental health""

Hospitals, schools and residential areas have been deliberately targeted as have fleeing civilians and these are not just one off incidents. To me its clear this is all part of a strategy to demoralise and wear down the resistance of Ukraine. This is sadly no surprise, Putin operates this way - look at what he did to Aleppo for example, if he can't take a city then he surrounds it, before pumping in rockets, artillery fire and creating mayhem.

A week ago Joe Biden said that Putin ""cannot remain in power"" and that was enough to set off useful idiots all over the place who were able to complain that he had misspoken and wasn't helping. Whether he did or not or whether his words were mis-interpreted is moot, it's clear that Putin as long as he remains in control in Russia is a clear and dangerous threat to us all, not just Ukraine. He has sought to undermine the British democratic process and he certainly interfered in the 2016 US presidential election. There is the suspicion that he has also funded some candidates in the upcoming French presidential election. 

The world will be a safer place without Putin in it. 

In an ideal world I'd like to see him face war crimes charges. There is a doctrine in war crimes jurisprudence called ""Command Responsibility"". This allows those who are in command or who are in a position of responsibility to be prosecuted and has been used several times over the years, for example General Tomoyuki Yamashita was convicted under this principle for atrocities committed by his soldiers in the Philippines during WWII. Putin may not have ordered the rapes and summary executions committed in Bucha and elsewhere, he also may not know about them but he and his senior military staff are ultimately responsible for them. 

FTR Yamashita and his second in command were found guilty and hanged. 

Command Accountability is now an established  part of the Geneva Conventions and was last used to prosecute war criminals in the Balkans after Yugoslavia broke up. It needs to be invoked in this war.",False,1649012090.0,t3_tv0emr,t3_tv0emr,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

The first reaction of the EU was energetic and correct, however, the lack of forcefulness in the following responses is proving painful for those of us who believe in the ability of the EU to represent the democratic European soul when It is most needed.

- The European Union continues to feed the Russian war machine with billions of Euros destined to buy its raw materials.

- The Russian goal is clearly the Russification of Ukraine showing results of war crimes and genocide of civilians. It is indispensable to send war material of higher capacity in order to dislodge the occupant from the land (anti-missile, tanks and artilllery, anti-naval).

- If any country stalls these measures (Hungary) should be removed from the decision making, the risk that the ination due to a few will affect the many is the most dangerous in these circumstances.

Human Rights Watch has documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine. These include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022. Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing, and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes.

“The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 people, including witnesses, victims, and local residents of Russia-occupied territories, in person or by telephone. Some people asked to be identified only by their first names or by pseudonyms for their protection.

On March 4, Russian forces in Bucha, about 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. A witness told Human Rights Watch that soldiers forced the five men to kneel on the side of the road, pulled their T-shirts over their heads, and shot one of the men in the back of the head. “He fell [over],” the witness said, “and the women [present at the scene] screamed.”

Russian forces in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in Chernihiv region, rounded up at least six men on February 27, and later executed them, according to the mother of one of the men, who was nearby when her son and another man were apprehended, and who saw the dead bodies of all six.

A 60-year-old man told Human Rights Watch that on March 4, a Russian soldier threatened to summarily execute him and his son in Zabuchchya, a village northwest of Kyiv, after searching their home and finding a hunting rifle and gasoline in the backyard. Another soldier intervened to prevent the other soldier from killing them, the man said. His daughter corroborated his account in a separate interview.

On March 6, Russian soldiers in the village of Vorzel, about 50 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering. A man who was with her in the same basement when she died from her wounds two days later, and heard accounts of the incident from others, provided the information to Human Rights Watch. The child died immediately, he said.

A woman told Human Rights Watch that a Russian soldier had repeatedly raped her in a school in the Kharkiv region where she and her family had been sheltering on March 13. She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife. The next day the woman fled to Kharkiv, where she was able to get medical treatment and other services. Human Rights Watch reviewed two photographs, which the woman shared with Human Rights Watch, showing her facial injuries.

Many of the Ukrainian civilians we interviewed described Russian forces taking food, firewood, clothing, and other items such as chainsaws, axes, and gasoline.

All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation. International human rights law, which is applicable at all times, also applies.

The laws of war prohibit willful killing, rape and other sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Pillage and looting are also prohibited. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.

“Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers,” Williamson said. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.”",False,1648990513.0,t3_tv0emr,t3_tv0emr,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Analysis from Jill Dougherty

The heartbreaking video looks just like the pictures western TV viewers are getting from the war in Ukraine: a grandmother, bundled up in a thick jacket against the cold, stands weeping in front of her wooden house that's smoldering from a rocket that hit her village. “They destroyed everything!” she cries. “Nothing is left.”

But this is the Russian government-controlled TV channel Rossiya24 and, in this report, the soldiers attacking her village are Ukrainian, not Russian. The Russian correspondent calls them “nationalists.” Other reports on the channel call them “neo-Nazis,” “fascists,” or “drug addicts” who use civilians as “human shields.”

Almost all reports of the conflict are from the breakaway Donbas region in Ukraine’s east, specifically the two self-proclaimed “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk, primarily Russian-speaking entities that Russia recognized as independent statelets on February 21.

On Russian broadcasts, the war in the rest of Ukraine, the war most people around the world are witnessing, is largely ignored – the wreckage of Mariupol left in the wake of Russian bombing; the charred skeletons of houses and buildings in Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson, Zhytomyr and other towns decimated by Russian airstrikes; residential neighborhoods in the capital Kyiv, along with their shellshocked, bleeding residents fleeing Russian shelling – almost none of this is shown on Russian TV.

Russia’s available manpower is rapidly depleting and the only way to address the problem is to fully mobilize the population. The problem for Putin is he’s sold the war on the premise it would be a short “special operation”. Mobilizing would mean admitting not only is Russia embroiled in a full blown war with Ukraine, but it went in completely unprepared. At some point soon, he’ll have to decide between mobilization and admitting defeat. The former would piss off a lot of the population and the latter would piss off his most ardent supporters. Either way, he’ll be faced with massive political backlash.  
NATO intervention would solve that problem for him. It would either galvanize the population to support full mobilization or give him political cover for pulling out. Now, Putin pulling out might sound great, but it will just solidify Russian anger against the West and could easily lead to someone worse succeeding Putin.

I demand that international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross be given access to these areas in order to independently document the atrocities. The perpetrators and those who commissioned them must be held consistently accountable.
 
The war in Ukraine is in its sixth week - thousands of innocent Ukrainians have already fallen victim to it. And the killing continues unabated.

Alright, there are still be a sizable number of 'but nukes' or 'not until Russia attacks MY country' posters evident around here, I feel I need to address all of them at once rather than onesie-twosie and wasting my time in sub-threads, where usually by the time I get my response typed they have deleted their comments (or had them deleted).

Let me first start by saying, I do not think anyone taking this line of reasoning is stupid or dumb.  I do think you are ignorant, short-sighted and possibly (some, not all of you) selfish/cowardly.  Now I know the second I've said that I will be told 'well go sign up to fight for Ukraine then'.  Let me address that common (and useless) strawman now.  I don't have military experience.  I would be a burden.  I have no way to get there.  That said if I could help Ukraine in some other way using my skills directly I would be HAPPY to do so.

So let's get to the crux of the issue as to why no one wants to intervene.  Nukes.  We hear it over and over again, either directly with someone screeching it at the top of their ""textual lungs"", or more often hidden behind the rhetoric of not wanting to escalate the situation.  I think everyone can agree that's the reason people don't want to intervene, they are afraid of the nuclear boogeyman.  I'm doing to break this down into the two key arguments:

1) You believe Putin's 'threats' on the use of nuclear weapons.  

2) You don't think the risk justifies the rewards.   

Each of these topics has their own issues and retorts.  So here we go:

**Item 1: Putin will use nukes if we intervene.**  Okay I hear you, he has after-all said he would do just that.  He said he would do that if we sent weapons, called the sanctions an act of war, etc., etc., etc.  We all know Putin lies, but let's for a second assume we believe him here (and there is reason to believe he and Russia would use nukes in very specific circumstances, more on those later).  

The first problem with Putin using nukes is very simple, he will die.   ""But but but he has cancer and is dying anyway"" or ""he doesn't care"".  Okay, fine valid points.  And you'd have a really compelling argument if Putin alone had the ability to make all the missiles go whoosh-bang.  Luckily for the entire world he doesn't have that ability.  There is an entire chain of command that would have to agree to it, and individual soldiers and sailors that also have to push buttons.

One thing many seem unaware of is a very simple fact;  since the dawn of MAD, there have been multiple instances where doctrine, protocol or orders would have dictated launching nukes on all sides (and these are the ones we know of, forget all the other times that are classified).  In **every single instance** where nukes should have been launched/used, they never were.  The chain of command broke down and it never happened.  **There is a 100% failure rate on nuclear weapon use since MAD.** But don't take my word for it:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_nuclear\_close\_calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls)

Now, in the interest of honesty there are two cases where I believe Russia would use nukes and would be 'reasonably' justified in doing so:  1) If we invaded **actual** Russia or 2) if we nuked Russia.  Russia would then rightly use it's deterrent force to ensure that at least everyone else died with them.  Outside of that, the costs to Russia to use nukes outweigh any benefits.  As the WOPR said in War Games ""The only winning move is not to play"" in reference to nuclear war.  Russia, Putin and his generals all know this.

**Item 2:  The risk isn't justified**

This item is based on a fallacious view that the war in Ukraine is Ukraine/regional problem.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  This war is going to cause problems for the entire world.  The longer it goes on, the worse those problems are going to be.  In terms of risks, I believe I have debunked the biggest perceived risk, the threat of nuclear war in addressing item 1.  

Unfortunately even if we remove nuclear weapons (and NCB in general) there is still risk to western personnel and assets in the event of an intervention.  I do **not** deny there is a risk to the west for intervening.  I **do** however maintain the risks are justified when one applies a correct cost/benefit analysis.   

Already this was had cause shocks to the global financial systems.  Minor for now, as the real impacts haven't been felt, but those impacts ARE coming.  Financial instability can often lead to political and social unrest.  There are a large number of countries already teetering on the brink after 2+ years of COVID.  It won't take much more to push some of these countries over the brink.  ""But, so what, I don't care about Gofuckyourselfistan,"" I hear your responses already.  You might not, but when Gofuckourselfisan goes to shit it's going to create a flood of refugees that are going to stress other countries and drag THEM down the hole.

Similar to the financial issue we have energy concerns as a result of this conflict.  These energy problems lead to the same end problems as the financial ones listed above so just replace finance with oil and re-read it.

Then we have the issues of food security for the world.  The UN estimated that **before COVID** one third of the world faced food security issues.  Before COVID and before this war took out 2 of the 5 largest wheat exporters.  One of the largest fertilizer exporters too.  Food is going to be a real problem for many countries, both directly due to shortages and indirectly due to costs for what is left.  This is going to cause a lot of problems in some places.  Where are these problems going to be most acute?  Right now it looks like Northern/Eastern Africa and the Middle East (of course the costs side will impact the entire world, prices are going up today in Germany as an example, go back to financial again please as this is another stressor for finances).  Mass hunger leads to a rash of problems and will lead to more civil wars and radicalization in regions of the world that could have disastrous effects for the west.  Millions (10s maybe even 100s) will die as a direct or indirect result of these food issues.  Starving radicalized people are a threat to everyone's security.  The longer we let this war go, the worse those problems will get.

Not stepping in has one final, really negative connotation for the future security of the west and the world as a whole.  It is going to inspire more countries to become nuclear powers.  For all their problems and insanity, Russia still isn't as insane as certain countries.  Countries that you and I **do not** want to ever have nuclear weapons.  Countries that aren't stable enough to protect them and safeguard their usage (and I'm not talking about NK here, Kim has enough reasons to not want to die to not do something dumb).  However, the message is being sent loud and clear by not getting engaged that, if you have nukes we won't fuck with you.  **This is the wrong message to be sending to the world's despots.**  The more countries that have nukes the more likely someone uses them.  The more likely some religious zealot comes to power and wants to nuke everything to fulfil some prophecy in some ancient text.  The more likely they fall into the wrong hands via corruption, etc. or are used by terrorists or in a false flag.  In short, the more countries that have nukes the greater the chance of a full out nuclear exchange (the thing everyone is afraid of happening and is trying to prevent by NOT intervening).  It's basic math and probability.  As you increase the number of countries in the equation with nukes, the odds start to go up drastically in their usage.

**TLDR/Summary:**

I'm not going to write a summary of the above, because the lazy will just latch onto the very high-level version and attack it rather than the substance that underlies any such summary.  If you really need a summary though it would be this:  If you think it is safer to not intervene, you need to re-examine the realities of what that means and look at a MUCH bigger picture than many look at.  

I have intentionally stayed away from mentioning all the horrible shit in Ukraine because that is an emotional ploy and I'm trying to deal with strategic items here, not emotional.

- Russia don't have to fully invade Kyiv. Their main focus should be Mariupol, Kherson, Odessa and Crimea, to completely take over the Black Sea. By that they made Ukraine become a country without a sea border, and we all know those countries are generally very poor. 
- Already 4m refugees left the country, and I think the figure will at least doubled. There will be a refugee crisis, and EU economy will take a big, big hit in the next few years just like Syria I'd expect, maybe bigger

 >The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that enabled those two powers to partition Poland between them. The pact was signed in Moscow on 23 August 1939 by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and was officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Unofficially, it has also been referred to as the Hitler–Stalin Pact, Nazi–Soviet Pact or Nazi–Soviet Alliance (although it was not a formal alliance).
 
**[German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German–Soviet_military_parade_in_Brest-Litovsk)** 
 
 >The German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk (German: Deutsch-sowjetische Siegesparade in Brest-Litowsk, Russian: Совместный парад вермахта и РККА в Бресте) was an official ceremony held by the troops of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union on September 22, 1939, during the invasion of Poland in the city of Brest-Litovsk (Polish: Brześć nad Bugiem or Brześć Litewski, then in the Second Polish Republic, now Brest in Belarus). It marked the withdrawal of German troops to the demarcation line secretly agreed to in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and the handover of the city and its fortress to the Soviet Red Army.

> Yugoslav partisan leader Joseph Broz Tito summoned the chief of the Soviet military mission, General Korneev, and formally protested. Despite having been invited ""as a comrade"", Korneev exploded at them for offering ""such insinuations"" against the Red Army. Djilas, who was present at the meeting, spoke up and explained the British Army had never engaged in ""such excesses"" while liberating the other regions of Yugoslavia. General Korneev responded by screaming, ""I protest most sharply at this insult given to the Red Army by comparing it with the armies of capitalist countries.""

> According to Djilas, the Soviet refusal to address protests against Red Army war crimes in Yugoslavia enraged Tito's Government and it was a contributing factor in Yugoslavia's subsequent exit from the Soviet Bloc.

>1 Killing members of the group ✅

>2 Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ✅

>3 Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ✅

>4 Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group

>5 Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group ✅

The last thing Russian leadership wants, is for Ukraine and Russia to ever be able to reconcile or be at peace.  The more they provoke anger at Russia by Ukrainians, the more it makes it likely that Ukrainians will counter with their own aggression, or vote-in rightwing politicians who will be ""tough on Russia"".  Or it may even inspire ""lone-wolf"" style terror attacks.  

This benefits Russian ""hawks"" because it will create an endless supply of news stories over then next 20-50 years, to keep the Russian people hating and fearing Ukraine, and supporting future wars and genocidal activity.

Russia is not actually strategically afraid of Ukraine, because they have nukes. So they can literally get away with fucking ANYTHING, because if any of their unfortunate neighbors tries any strategic moves to guarantee their own security; (like taking Russian territory as ""buffer zones"", Securing strategic assets like waterways and ports - etc) they can just nuke (or threaten to nuke).

*The name ""Ukraine"" apparently cannot be retained as the title of any fully denazified state entity in a territory liberated from the Nazi regime. The people's republics newly created in the space free from Nazism should and will grow from the practice of economic self-government and social security, restoration and modernization of the life support systems of the population.*  
*In fact, their political aspirations cannot be neutral - expiation of guilt before Russia for treating it as an enemy can be realized only by relying on Russia in the processes of restoration, revival and development. No ""Marshall Plans"" should be allowed for these territories. There can be no ""neutrality"" in the ideological and practical sense, compatible with denazification. The cadres and organizations that are the instrument of denazification in the newly denazified republics cannot but rely on Russia's direct military and organizational support.*

  
*Denazification will inevitably also be a de-Ukrainization - a rejection of the large-scale artificial inflation of the ethnic component of self-identification of the population of the territories of historical Little Russia and New Russia, begun by the Soviet authorities. Being an instrument of the communist superpower, after its fall, artificial ethnocentrism did not remain ownerless. In this official capacity, he passed under the authority of another superpower (the power standing over the states) — the superpower of the West. It must be returned to its natural boundaries and deprived of political functionality.*",False,1649020720.0,t3_tv0emr,t1_i39kxuy,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Russia engaging in Donbas at this point is going to result in heavy insurgency, to the same level as the US encountered in Afghanistan/Iraq or worse. So, the question becomes how they deal with the insurgency.

The thing that we have seen the Russian army do so far is what amounts to ethnic cleansing. It's highly likely that as they reenforce the Donbas region, they will kill or relocate non-Russian speakers in a bid to reduce the number of possible insurgents in the area to create an ""ethnically Russian"" region they can control.

It also depends on if the troop movements in the north a real retreat or just a pause before another attack on Kyiv. It's highly likely that Ukraine needs more offensive weaponry to not just attack the Donbas region but to venture into Belarus/Russian territory to remove AA and emplacements there to reduce the likelihood of another attack on Kyiv. Basically, they probably need to ensure that the North and East fronts are secure before focusing on the Donbas front in the southeast. I'm not sure that is possible without raiding Russian/Belarus territory to destroy things like fuel depots, AA emplacements, or barracks.

One side effect of the need to strike along the Russian/Belarus border will be that Ukraine will need to build logistic chains to the fronts within contested airspace. This would be a much harder test of the Ukraine regular/irregular armies.

Since no one online has any detailed information about Ukraine logistics, I assume this is what the Ukraine defense and NATO are trying to figure out right now. Basically, what is Ukraine's next step after securing the north and east fronts?",False,1648986718.0,t3_tv0emr,t1_i37hh41,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

If I understood WW1 correctly it would not be that hard to cross no-mans and get into the enemy trench.  It was just extremely dangerous.  Individuals or squads were just killed when they got there. Both sides had to feed soldiers into the front in order to hold the position.    For that matter, there were many breakthroughs in WW1 but no radio communication.  Reestablishing communication took to long and the enemy moved troops to close the gap.  

It would be much easier against an opponent who does not want to be there.  Soldiers holding part of a line could defect.  Imagine a no-mans land where Russians are able to sell ammunition belts and grenades in exchange for vodka, cigarettes, and weed.  Late in WW1 French and German infantry frequently cease-fired in order to replace barbed wire.  Artillery was still firing overhead but they crawled around fixing fences together.  With the wire up their officers could not order an offensive in their section of the front.  

I expect troops with heavy artillery, tanks, and ammunition/supplies should be able to easily thwart a light infantry advance.  The equipment imbalance is not everything though.  It is easy to count barrels and platforms.  Morale is extremely hard to measure.

We’re only connected to Poland by a 60km Suwalki gap, otherwise between Belarus and Kaliningrad. In any kind of proper military confrontation, Russia WILL aim to close that gap. Close the gap and there will be no land connection to the Baltics that isn’t Russia/Belarus. 

The supposed understanding between Russia and NATO was that there would be no permanent troops in the Baltics and Poland. I think with Russia doing what it’s doing, that understanding is trash - we need permanent bases in each of the four countries and we’ve been asking for this for years, and I hope we get them. NATO’s current line in the Baltics-Poland is deterrence, but we need to be able to defend. Current doctrine says that we here have to be able to push and hold for 72hrs before main NATO forces get here, but unlike Ukraine, we’re on a flat narrow strip land, we have no tanks, no Air Force. The only things we have are the same NATO troops (with their equipment) we have here right now + our own military and paramilitary groups. Obviously we have exercised with the idea of 72hrs of protection in our heads, but having more forces, having actual defensive capabilities that do not have to be flown in or sailed in - realistically the only ways to get equipment into the Baltics if Suwalki gap is closed - would actually ensure security for us here. Central and Eastern Europe more south has larger NATO countries on their borders and they can probably also scramble across land. 

I think NATO has been extremely conservative in its actions, if I’m honest. We’ve seen actual war crimes happen in Ukraine. People, who just 6 weeks ago just lived their normal ordinary lives like you and me, and chances are that they may be one of those men or boys or women or girls who have been killed with a shot into their head whilst their hands are tied behind their backs. I don’t think sending us extra people and equipment would be an escalation. Yeah, troop build-up will be visible weeks before invasion happens, but realistically - Western European countries MOST likely will not be having an invasion force coming in from the Atlantic; the Eastern European countries, the ones that joined in 1990s and 2000s - WE are on the front line.

This is a human issue but some nations have been better at dealing with it in the last 50 years than others. Your comments basically excuse Russia in this circumstance and that is quite frankly; horseshit.

Russia went into this war demonising and dehumanising the whole Ukrainian people as Nazis.

This then subtly enables even the most professional forces to do heinous things. And Russia is one of the worst when it comes to raping and looting.

Do you want to know the difference between Russia and the USA in this context? Russia excuses and conceals it, and never admits it while encouraging it at an institutional level.

In the US, it's a crime, sometimes it's been concealed but it is not institutionally endorsed, not in this lifetime.

* Russia pushed back around Kyiv. Some say it is a strategic retreat to move more cannon fodder to Donbas and other eastern fronts. Fact is, the attack on Kyiv failed, and is over with a clear Ukranian victory.
* Russia pushed back right to the Belorussian border in the north.
* The Ukranian flag flies over Chernobyl again.
* Russia finally managed to take Izium
* Russia still hasn't taken Mariupol on the coast, Ukrainians there are last standing as if the fate of the whole country rests on their shoulders. They are making Russia pay for every inch.
* In liberated towns around Kyiv and further afield wherever Ukraine has pushed Russia back evidence of wholesale slaughter, torture, rape and genocidal actions have appeared. I won't give details here, it's upsetting.
* Ukraine is getting anti ship weapons to help defend Odessa.
* Starstreak has proven effective, at least one video of a Mi 28 being cut in half by a Starstreak.
* Ukraine sent two choppers over the border with Russia, about 30miles unto Russian territory and they rocketed a Russian fuel depot. This is the first Air Raid on Russian territory since WW2, but it may be the second one since there are rumours that a recent explosion in Russia at a weapons dump was also because of an air raid.
* Ukraine may be getting more soviet era offensive weapons such as tanks soon.
* They are getting armored vehicles, I want to say from Germany but I can't remember right now.

Conducted by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), it was largely carried out by special agents of the U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps (CIC).

I already wrote from my previous (already deleted unfortunately, account), I hope someone will understand, we are not Ukrainian-style Cossack resistance, not Hetmanshchyna with a popular uprising of the masses. We have no such experience, no cultural code. Our history is full of military coups and [Decembrist’s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decembrist_revolt) movements.

Here, the pure method of the Molotov cocktail against the stick will not work - another mentality - you have to be friends with the stick here.

Unlike in Ukraine, our successful revolution is a story about the humanist protest of an educated minority, which foments an army and in the process(!) gathers a crowd around itself. And that is why some kind of power structure that will support this protest with fire and sword is important here.

And all previous attempts failed precisely because the opposition did not find people in these structures, despised them for their obedience, avoided, although the only way to change something is essentially to reassemble the current (and eternal for our history) humanists-frequently-pro-economic and militarists, giving these factions new blood and, as a consequence, new methods.

Because the tragedy of Russia is not in the factions' very existence, but in the fucking hands they have fallen into as a result of 20 years of selling the country as a resource colony. The people who tried to prevent the collapse of the USSR in the 90s were not so much for COMMUNISM as for preventing the situation where the country falls into the hands of greedy psychopaths who turn a huge territory into a resource colony.

Because the tragedy is not in the form of government or regime itself, but in who ends up in power and for what purpose.

And now we can all see how it ended.

And for a lot of them, more the further west in Russia you go, they **know**. They know and they are aware. And thats when ""15 years in prison and large fines"" starts being convenient. Fact of the matter is that the russian authorities do scare people with this, but its rarely employed to its full extent. Moscow and St Pete's demonstrators wwre usually just held for half a day then possibly given a fee, and usually one easily overcome.

And yet, his commanders still gave these orders. For someone so supposedly cunning and strategic, this kind of behavior is brutish to the point of flying in the face of the mythos that Putin and his regime has been cultivating domestically and abroad for 20 years now.

How Kyiv Has Withstood Russia’s Attacks
By Anjali Singhvi, Charlie Smart, Mika Gröndahl and James GlanzApril 2, 2022

Russia has more troops and more firepower. Why has it failed to seize the capital?

KYIVDnipro RiverMariupolKyivNew York City65 SQ. MILES325 SQ. MILES305 SQ. MILESApprox. location of fighting
Kyiv is the ultimate prize for Russia: the heart of Ukraine, and the seat of a government it has sought to replace. For weeks, Russian troops have pressed in on the city from both sides of the Dnipro River.

But the bigger the city, the more difficult it is to seize. And Kyiv is enormous — larger in land area than New York City, and five times the size of Mariupol, which Russian troops have been trying to capture for weeks.

Russia vastly underestimated Ukrainians’ resolve to defend their homeland. And a Russian military trained for open spaces has also struggled with basic realities of urban warfare. Even a finely orchestrated military would be challenged by the block-to-block fighting required to secure Kyiv. The Russian army has failed to even surround it.

Urban Combat
The campaign went wrong on Day 1, when Russian helicopters assaulted the Hostomel airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv and were met with stiff resistance.
Because the military failed to hold the airport, it couldn’t quickly build up the airborne forces needed to invade the capital.

The next day, Russia sent a small force directly into Kyiv anyway, seemingly intent on quickly toppling Ukraine’s government.
But fighting for a major city like Kyiv is notoriously difficult, bloody and time-consuming.

There are plenty of places to hide. Opposing forces can camp out in tall buildings. Rubble hides fighters as well as standing structures do.

A column of Russian trucks and tracked vehicles managed to move straight down Peremohy Avenue, a main throroughfare leading to the center of Kyiv.
Tanks and other armored vehicles are useful to armies attacking cities if they are well supported by infantry and air power. But this column was largely on its own.


KYIVBELARUSOuter ringInner ringApprox. Russian
positions, March 30Supply linesBrovaryIrpinBucha
Several vehicles were taken out from above before the Russians were forced to retreat.

Russian leadership was deluded that Ukraine would collapse at the first sign of fighting, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky would flee, said Nick Reynolds, a military analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.
“That was a catastrophic failure to understand Ukrainian society and the Ukrainian state,” Mr. Reynolds said.
Even outnumbering Ukrainian fighters by 10 to one might not be enough to take the city, given Russia’s inability to coordinate its ground forces with intelligence, air power and engineering, some analysts said.
“You need to be good at this,” said Scott Boston, an analyst at RAND who studies the Russian military and land warfare. “And I don’t think I have any real evidence that Russia has trained to do large-scale urban warfare.”

Encircling the City
After the disastrous initial attempt on Kyiv, Russia resorted to a different strategy: encircling it.
An outer ring would block crucial weapons and supplies from getting in. An inner ring would seal off opposing forces and provide a solid base for a more robust attack.

But the Russian offensive stalled without completing either ring, preserving Ukrainian supply lines.

Even in places where Russians got closer, they had few major routes to enter the city.
That predictability is part of what makes a well-defended city so difficult to capture. Key lines of attack can be blocked, fortified and barricaded, said Anthony King, the author of a book about urban warfare and a professor at the University of Warwick.


BELARUSBrovaryHighway M01
Ukrainian forces relentlessly attacked Russian positions along major roads. Lt. Tetiana Chornovol, the commander of an anti-tank missile unit, said she blew up a Russian tank near Brovary.
“We look for firing positions where we can see a stretch of road,” Lieutenant Chornovol said, adding that “we know a column will drive on the road” eventually.

In a fight outside of Brovary last month, seen in footage released by Ukrainian forces, Russian tanks were sitting ducks, ambushed and destroyed by the Ukrainian artillery fire and anti-tank missiles.

Even if the Russian military had entered the east side of the city, another defensive resource loomed: the Dnipro River, which splits the city in two. Bridges further limit the Russian advance.
“It’s easy to see when they’re coming across,” said retired Col. Liam Collins, who has served as a military adviser in Ukraine. “Ukraine would blow bridges at the latest time possible to maintain resupply.”

After crossing one of the bridges, Russian forces would still need to climb a steep slope to get up the western side, which acts as natural cover for the center of the city.

Among the biggest surprises of the battle is that the Russian military has never fully controlled the airspace over the capital.
Ukrainian forces concentrated their air defenses in the city, and they used the urban terrain to provide cover, said Michael Kofman, research program director in the Russia Studies Program at CNA. The Russian Air Force has been mysteriously absent, he said.
“It became, in some ways, mutually denied airspace,” Mr. Kofman said.

The Russian advance was also weakened by a series of puzzling logistical failures.
Thousands of troops advancing west of the Dnipro River had to follow a narrow road. Lacking a railway, they trucked in supplies from Belarus on convoys that were repeatedly ambushed.


KYIVLine of Russian advanceSumyCounterattacksBELARUSFlooded areasApprox. flooded areasUkrainian counterattacksChernihiv
Ukrainians appeared to further constrain the Russian advance by blowing up bridges and dams, flooding areas north of Kyiv.

The Russian army got close to Kyiv in suburbs northwest of the city. But in some of the most critical battles of the war so far, Ukrainian forces stalled the advance, ambushing columns of armored vehicles and causing heavy losses.

Russian troops east of the river struggled with their own supply problems. An advance from the north failed to capture the city of Chernihiv, leaving Ukrainians room to fight north of the city.

A separate, fragile advance from Sumy — some 175 miles to the east — never secured a consistent line of attack. It was subject to frequent, debilitating counterattacks from Ukrainian forces.

The stalled offenses around Kyiv reflect Russia’s wider strategic failures planning the war, analysts said.
Numerous lines of attack across the country stretched the military too thin. Soldiers were thrown into battle without enough support. The smaller Ukrainian force was vastly underestimated.
“It’s really been kind of astonishing, in the sort of the cynicism, the stupidity with which the operation was carried out,” said Mr. Boston, the RAND analyst.

On Tuesday, Moscow promised to reduce the intensity of its military activity around Kyiv, in effect acknowledging that its advance toward the capital had stalled. Ukrainians reclaimed a series of towns outside the capital, signaling at least a partial Russian retreat.
Both sides have taken heavy losses and the fight for Kyiv could still restart. Russians could dig in, keep Ukrainian forces pinned down and besiege the city. Air attacks could destroy civilian infrastructure and kill thousands of people. Or the Russian army could try to muster forces to attack the capital once again.
But for now, Russia’s prized target appears out of reach.

If you try find middle ground with him or try to negotiate in good faith it only causes him to see you as weak and he then tries to take advantage of you.

The trouble with that is it only works if both sides care about the level of damage and are willing to actually break ties.  Europe is showing right now that the idea is basically useless against a Putin style autocrat.  Putin will use any suffering caused by sanctions to rally his people against the evil west, and neither he nor the top Russian leadership with suffer in any personal way.  On the other hand, democratic nations have to face their voters, who aren't always concerned with international issues, especially when facing very direct personal consequences of said policies.

These were the people whom the West had hoped to peel away from Putin by imposing the sanctions. But now, according to Rustamova, they are turning against the West, feeling offended by the punishment and defensive of their country, and their president. “Russian society, my sources tell me, has also rallied in support of Putin’s actions under the pressure of propaganda and under the consequences of sanctions,” Rustamova wrote. “In a situation where, as it seems to them, the whole world is against Russia, its citizens “will hate the West and consolidate.” 

>One source who is very familiar with the thinking in the Russian government told me that, though “there is a lot of splintering of the elites and a lot of people feel misled and betrayed, they feel misled and betrayed for different reasons.” The source added that “Putin’s supporters are devastated and feel a little betrayed [by the announcement at Istanbul]. The commander in chief made a commitment to go all the way.” Despite some of the grumbling and resignations we’ve seen coming out of the Russian government and state media, the source said, “I think that for a lot of these people, as ridiculous as it seems, this was a labor of love.”

Whether or not you like Biden, his diplomatic prowess in this has been truly impressive.  The ""attrition"" defense phase, and the buildup, the diplomacy, perfectly executed.

That being said NATO really needs to step up if they want a victory here--UA requested M270s, F16s, Bushmasters, S-300s, and Mig-29s, and hasn't gotten much of this (I think they got the Bushmasters).  They need the gear to counterattack.  That means armor, air power, etc.  If NATO had the guts that'd also mean contractors.  A few gifted Patriot batteries around Kyiv operated by mercenaries under UA command, for example.  Make Russian networks fair game for white hat hackers by special law.  Etc.

Machievelli mask on, it's a missed opportunity for NATO in that without being *at* war, they get to reduce their primary opponent.  *What are NATO tank fleets there for, if not this exact purpose?*  It makes sense to dump as much weaponry and as many little green men into Ukraine as the country can possibly hold.

So I’m struggling to understand what military effect that “galvanizing” the Russian people would have.

Galvanizing a western nation would be bad—you’d have more people volunteering for the army, and in an already effective military with good training, you’d be able to churn out decent troops in a matter of months.

Since Russia already doesn’t have this, all they’d get is more warm bodies, which to an extent is effective, but Russia already has plenty of warm bodies in the military and reserves.  Warm bodies are not the problem.

Galvanizing a western nation would make the people okay about things like rationing, shortages, and higher prices in order to support the war effort.  Russia already has shortages and high prices and they have to be okay with it or Putin will cause people to disappear who criticize him.

Galvanizing a western nation would make them quickly turn regular industry into war manufacturing.  To the extent possible, Putin can already do this (who can criticize him?) but that isn’t going to magically give Russia raw materials to manufacture, nor is it going to solve a corruption-laden bureaucracy where so much is already skimmed off the top.

In other words, I see not stepping foot into Russia in order to appease western powers, but not for the reason that it’s going to “galvanize” Russians.  That might come into play if the Ukrainians were going to invade Russia and push to Moscow—you’d have civilians trying to kill soldiers with any weapon they had and resisting to the last man for hundreds of miles—but entering a minor part of Russian territory in order to complete a pincer movement to liberate Ukrainian territory?

Plain wrong. Some of the stuff the baltics wanted to send into ukraine had to be approved by the german government as they were former NVA material. This was heavily delayed as noone wanted to deal with it, but thats not ""actively blocking"" other countries from sending any aid at all.

> Then they eventually changed their mind and sent lethal weapons from like god knows when, and it was basically all just scrap.

You mean pretty newish Panzerfaust 3 and Stingers, vehicles, fuel etc.? The Strelas a bit later were specifically *requested* by the ukrainian government despite having been retired from usage 10 years ago. ~500 were discarded after checking for faults and the rest of the 2700 has been send to ukraine.

> They also refuse to boycott the oil supply

The issue is mostly gas as it cant be substituted without major conversions, not oil (although the latter is also imported, but with way less dependency). Theres a high chance pretty much the whole german industry will collapse with a sudden stop of gas deliveries. Atleast get your resources right while blindly hating.

I do see a scenario that works and essentially flips the decision. One where we make clear that we will intervene in Ukraine, but no more. We will drive Russian troops out, but will not cross the border or fire across it unless fired upon first. It's risky but it's not implausible. Russia suddenly loses the ability to use any SAM sites or SRBMs on its own territory because any one of them would start WW3. The outcome aimed for is a rapid, relatively peaceful Russian retreat - troops that stand their ground or fight back are obliterated. Essentially, the current Ukrainian plan but with combined arms, air power, and the full NATO might tipping the scales even further. A flat out demonstration that Russia is outclassed at *every* turn, that their forces are utterly useless against NATO.

Why?

The goal is to demonstrate not that Russia can't *start* a nuclear war, but to make it explicitly clear that if they did, they would *lose*. Because, truthfully, they would. The West would be hit hard but Russia would cease to exist. It's not MAD but RAD: Russia's Assured Destruction.

This is actually not true. The US ended it's official relationship with Taiwan in 1979 by act of congress in order to open up trade and relations with China. Here is a link: https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-taiwan/ 

Then in 2018 Pres. Trump, when we began the trade war with China, signed a bill passed by Congress into law, The Taiwan Travel Act, that allowed high level US officials to maintain official contacts with Taiwan again. The law was worded in such a way that just over two years later...

In 2020, Mike Pompeo and the Trump Administration on Jan 11th, 5 days AFTER the failed Jan. 6th insurrection, announced that the US would be lifting it's limitations on maintaining a relationship with Taiwan. They made this official policy and then handed it to the Biden administration to deal with the fallout. 

So no treaty with Taiwan to be allies at all. Period. But who the US government recognizes as the true representative of China? From 1979 to 2018 it was Beijing.

We have values, principles, that we think are worth defending. At least we ought to. Who *are* we if we can watch such cruelty and injustice, and not do everything in our power to stop it? Are we not guilty in our indifference? What's the *point* of being an alliance of the most advanced and powerful countries the world has ever seen if our strength can't be used for good? Do we just sit in our cozy homes heated by Russian gas and pat ourselves on our backs and say ""good job for staying out of the war, at least we are safe and sound""?

Too many people seem to equate NATO intervention with inevitably starting WW3. But that risk, in my personal opinion, is extremely low. The by far most likely outcome is that Russia backs down. Simply having NATO troops on the ground in an ""observer"" role would likely send Russia packing rather than risk a confrontation. 

The risk is not zero of course. But there's *also* a risk associated with doing nothing. What's happing now, or is already happening since 2014, or even more accurately since 2008 is eerily similar to 1938-39. A ruthless dictator consolidates his power. Roots out opposition. Ramps up his war machine. Starts grabbing land in the name of protecting ethnic minorities. The world watches and does nothing. Confidence increases, the narrative changes to securing land that ""should"" belong to us. We know what comes next. Consider: Michael Kofman just reminded us that the main limitation for the Russian military right now is political: Since they refuse to admit that the war is war, they can't mobilize their army. They have large amounts of equipment in reserve but no manpower. That could change at any moment. My point is that the world must make it clear that wars of aggression can not be tolerated in the 21st century. We must demonstrate that we are ready to act, or WW3 *will* happen. By Putin's hand, or his successor's.

Personally, I don't think Ukraine *needs* NATO troops. They certainly don't seem to expect it. But there is a case to be made for it, and it is stronger than some seem willing to admit. Western politicians are extremely risk averse, and I appreciate that, but I think most people overestimate the risks of escalation (omg nukez!) and don't want to think about the very real costs of doing nothing.

Countries normally sacrifice only one of the trinity in order to achieve the other two.

The New York Times recently published an opinion piece by Nobel prize winning economist [Paul Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman) titled [Wonking Out: The Curious Case of the Recovering Ruble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/opinion/russia-ruble-economy.html), which explores this decision.

Professor Krugman posits that the exchange rate may be such an openly visible yardstick of economic performance, its stability so essential to the Russian government's veneer of economic competence, that they're willing to sacrifice all else in order to maintain it; other statistical measures of economic performance can be hidden or buried or manipulated, but everyone can see the exchange rate—so its maintenance is paramount to the propaganda effort, reassuring people that all is well (albeit that, in fact, these efforts are exacerbating the very problems they're attempting to hide).

It's a mobile force that can strike in multiple areas along the south of Ukraine and it effectively ties down many garrisons of troops that could otherwise be redirected to the front lines.

It is also a longe range mobile fire support platform (missiles and things) that can effectively support multiple areas at once.

As Ukraine makes any invasion South, while that fleet is at sea, no area they take is safe and any enemies surrounded on the coast can be reinforced.

Even when they take the ground, they then need to use even more forces to fend off a possible amphibious assault.

And finally and most importantly of all, it has the potential to open sea route access to Ukraine, and most of the worlds supply is run through shipping. This makes it easier to get weapons, equipment and other things to Ukraine. This is not to mention a lot of Ukraine's trade pre-war was via sea. To empower economic recovery, they need these trade lanes open so they can export the goods they produce.

While people and land are important, Sea is hyper important for supply and Air is hyper important to cover your land forces but both do a bit of each.

Scholars agree that the majority of the rapes were committed by Soviet occupation troops. The wartime rapes were followed by decades of silence. According to historian Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it.

China is engaged in ""controlling"" populations via forced sterilization and the destruction of cultural elements with the Uyghurs - calling that a genocide is not universally accepted but shares much in common with them at the very least. The key trait of genocide versus other war crimes is that it's targeted, a matter of policy with the express intent of complete destruction of a race, ethnic group, or nationality, and it has to be systematic.

But not necessarily of ethnic Ukrainians, this has taken place in Russian-speaking portions of the country. Many of those ""evacuees"" are ethnic Russian and some probably support Russia. Ethnic Ukrainians are likely the vast minority of those evacuated. I will say one very distinguishing factor is that this has happened in frontline towns rather than occupied territories and it has a military objective. We have seen some of the accusations previously lobbed (that Ukrainian papers were being destroyed and Ukrainians were being sent into random Russian towns) as not true and at least one Ukrainian family from Mariupol was able to just choose to leave and head back home. Many are not able to leave because their bank cards don't work and they are sent to refugee areas - we don't have really insight into the conditions in those areas right now, though.

We know what the goal of this war was, control of Ukraine bringing it back into the fold and ensuring a buffer against the West. 

Russians aren't just killing Ukranians because they think Ukranians don't deserve to live. They aren't rounding up and killing every Ukranian they see. This is a political war with political intentions. Are the Russia invaders committing horrific war crimes and killing civilians intentionally? Yes, undoubtedly. But the idea that Russia would take over Ukraine and then just start killing every Ukrainian citizen isn't based in reality. 

As we are all aware, Putin thought they would be welcomed with open arms and minimal life lost in a week long war.  Does that sound like a genocidal plan to you?  Is the goal of the invasional the death or displacement of every Ukranian? Are Russians killing every Ukranian citizen they see? No. 

Things can horrific and evil without mislabeling them. Sometimes thing just don't pass the eye test. And if you compare thus against what the Rohingya, Tutsi, Armenians, Cambodiana, Poles and Jews have suffered as part of genocides it doesn't hold up.

So the first objective is to end Nato’s expansion. Two other objectives have been added: one is the demilitarisation of Ukraine; the other is denazification, because there are people in the Russian government concerned with the rise of ultra-nationalism in Ukraine to the extent that they think it is beginning to resemble Germany in the 1930s.

Genocide is an internationally recognized crime where acts are committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. These acts fall into five categories:

1 Killing members of the group ✅

2 Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ✅

3 Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ✅

4 Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group

5 Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group ✅

There are a number of other serious, violent crimes that do not fall under the specific definition of genocide. They include crimes against humanity, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and mass killing.

In a full launch scenario on both sides, roughly 12k nuclear missiles could eventually be launched. But not all of those are deployed (attached to delivery systems), and it's not certain there will be conditions for secondary launches.

So, the US has 1,357 nuclear warheads ready to deploy, and Russia has 1,456. France and the UK add another 400. Each of those a magnitude of order stronger than those used in WW2.

The only one who is qualified to offer such an opinion is Fiona Hill, who was a member of the US National Security Council as an expert on Russia. However she has not as far as I can find stated anything to the effect that MAD is something that can be chosen and disregarded at will. She has said that Putin's threats should be taken seriously, however she also recognizes that his statements are posturing designed to dissuade the west from getting involved in this conflict. She has also stated that Putin considers Nuclear Weapons an instrument that he can use, but again says nothing that challenges the principle of MAD. Here's her full comments on the subject across two interviews:

First Interview:

>EZRA KLEIN: What does somebody with Putin’s psychology — how do they react to this kind of quagmire that he’s now in?  
>  
>FIONA HILL: Well, first of all, he’s going to double and triple down on the military side of things. And he has very deliberately put his nuclear card on the table. That’s a way of playing it, right, because it certainly gets everybody thinking — whoa, he’s in a corner, what’s he going to do? So he’s going to nuke us to get out of it? He’s saying yeah — yeah, no, that’s what I’m thinking. I’m thinking about doing things like this.  
>  
>EZRA KLEIN: Do you take that seriously?  
>  
>FIONA HILL: Well, I think we have to take it seriously, but we have to deal with it with the calm, collected — which we’ve done so far, which is like, OK, you’re really going a bit too far here. Here, you have scenes of old ladies and children preparing Molotov cocktails, and you’ve already gone nuclear. There is a kind of a disproportionate, asymmetric element to that book, which is classic Putin. We’ve seen them now shifting some of the narrative for their internal purposes, and also to anybody else who’ll listen.  
>  
>And there are, of course, many people who pay attention to what Putin says, and buy his propaganda that the Ukrainians were looking to try to get a nuclear weapon. I mean, basically he’s making stuff up. And that’s the whole point there, because he’s trying to kind of shift the rhetoric. Because if you make it nuclear, it’s not, again, about Ukraine and Russia, and what Russia is doing to Ukraine. It suddenly becomes U.S., NATO, nuclear powers, permanent five at the U.N. Security Council — of the nuclear powers, China, U.K., France, Russia, the United States.

Second Interview:

>Reynolds: And then there’s the nuclear element. Many people have thought that we’d never see a large ground war in Europe or a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, because it could quickly escalate into a nuclear conflict. How close are we getting to that?

Basically, what President Putin has said quite explicitly in recent days is that if anybody interferes in Ukraine, they will be met with a response that they’ve “never had in \[their\] history.” And he has put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. So he’s making it very clear that nuclear is on the table.

>Hill: The thing about Putin is, if he has an instrument, he wants to use it. Why have it if you can’t? He’s already used a nuclear weapon in some respects. Russian operatives poisoned Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium and turned him into a human dirty bomb and polonium was spread all around London at every spot that poor man visited. He died a horrible death as a result.

NATO has not been proven irrelevant as a defensive pact, because it has not been called upon. The only time that it can be deemed relevant or irrelevant is if a NATO member is attacked.

There is a lot of discussion about what NATO can do, but the answer is nothing. It's not an army or a force. It's a collaborative agreement between a set of states that only act in unison in very particular circumstances.

NATO peacekeeping missions were created as an answer to the misguided calls that NATO should intervene in wars and the misguided arrogance of especially Western nations that they should act as the world police. But NATO members can't be forced by NATO to cooperate with peacekeeping missions.

The security assurances in that document only referred to intervention in the event of nuclear attack or threat of nuclear attack, and the “assurance” offered was to appeal to the UN, where we have seen Russia has absolute veto power, rendering that approach useless. All signatories of the Budapest Agreement did adhere to it, except for Russia. The problem was that it was a piss-poor arrangement.

Ukraine is seeking security assurances. Are you really unaware that is what Zelenskiy has been working hard to do? They’re building a new, non-NATO coaltion. Ukraine is acutely aware that the only reason they were vulnerable to the current invasion is because they *weren’t* *already* a member of such a coalition. Do you think Poland or any of the Baltic states worry as much about Russia invading? By saying security assurances are meaningless, you’re saying NATO is meaningless, which is absurd. Ukraine doesn’t share your view of “we can only do this by ourselves”. At all. They know that assistance/threat from many other countries is the only thing that will deter Russia from invading again in the future.

49. Other documented cases appear to be linked to the military presence in densely populated civilian areas, such as towns near the contact line, and general impunity. A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by eight to 10 members of the ‘Azov’ and ‘Donbas’ battalions in August-September 2014. The victim’s health subsequently deteriorated and he was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.

Mental disability... cruel treatment, ""rape"" (probably anal penetration with objects) i guess - because he was suspected to work for russian side. 

The other cases are nowhere close to the extremity of russian crimes we see written about today. And not related to Azov battalion - at all.

The other document doesnt even have a single case like that.

 >An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi) primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery (delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads). Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs. Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target.
 
**[Soviet submarine K-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-19)** 
 
 >K-19 (Russian: К-19) was the first submarine of the Project 658 (Russian: проект-658, lit: Projekt-658)  class (NATO reporting name Hotel-class submarine), the first generation of Soviet nuclear submarines equipped with nuclear ballistic missiles, specifically the R-13 SLBM. The boat was hastily built by the Soviets in response to United States' developments in nuclear submarines as part of the arms race. Before she was launched, 10 civilian workers and a sailor died due to accidents and fires. After K-19 was commissioned, the boat had multiple breakdowns and accidents, several of which threatened to sink the submarine.

https://www.quora.com/Do-Russians-view-themselves-as-culturally-European

Yes, most Russians consider themselves Europeans of Slavic descent.

There are lots of superstitions that – especially Westerners – like to associate with the word “Europe”. Russians are generally much more rational. Europe is a continent, a geographic area, and Russians know much more about the boundary of that continent than any other nation.

The boundary between Europe and Asia goes through the Ural and Caucasus mountains. The former is in Russia (I have been to Asia 100+ times because when they drove us to the Eurasian border in 1988, I didn’t know what to do so I was jumping back and forth), the second is still in the Soviet Union and Russians have been and remain very important over there. So the currently used geographic definitions of Europe vs Asia were basically invented in Russia and they were used by Russians before they were accepted by much of the world.

Russians also use the adjective “European” for the white race and almost all of them belong to this set, as they learn it.

But then there’s the cultural interpretation of the word “European”. Well, Russians know that Europe is a very diverse continent culturally and it doesn’t really have a unique culture or a unified political attitude etc. In particular, they sensibly distinguish Europe and the European Union. The former is substantially larger than the latter. So the Russian Wikipedia on Europe lists the Russian-Belorussian bloc as being basically “on par” with the European Union.

An important well-defined question has been whether Russians wanted and could have been accepted by the European Union. The answer seems clearly No right now – Russophobia is widespread in Europe and Russians are skeptical about many Western attitudes and commitments and values. On top of that, Russia as a member of the EU would be too large a member and it would severely shift the balance of power.

But that’s just how it looks in 2017. In the 1990s, soon after the fall of communism, the Russian entry to the European Union was rather seriously considered by many important people on both sides. It just hasn’t happened and the EU and Russia diverged from each other. But because the Russian politics is mostly decided in Moscow which is an Eastern European city, one must say that these divergences of Russia away from the EU are basically internal changes inside Europe. They are not relationships between Europe and someone else!

Moscow simply is a European city just like Brussels, Berlin, or Paris, and whoever denies this statement is already playing propaganda games.

A majority of the territory of the Russian Federation belongs to Asia which is a different continent than Europe. The Russian Federation obviously has important relationships with Asian countries. But at the ethnic level, the Asian part of Russia doesn’t really matter because a big majority of the people in the Asian part of Russia are descendants of Russians who came there from Europe – see History of Siberia.

Some stuff Ukraine alleged is true. There are literally filtration camps, Russians forcibly evacuated people from Mariupol to Russia who did not want to be there. They are definitely targeting anti-Russian (i.e. Right Sector or other militants) Ukrainians for reasons currently unknown. What there is not evidence of:

1. That they are somehow imprisoned or trapped, or that their papers are confiscated. This person literally just left the ""refugees"" and went to family living in Russia. Many people are, however, unable to leave because they lack the money to do so - Russia is not providing them routes back to Ukraine, you are on your own and their Ukrainian bank cards don't work. That is obviously not acceptable, just as forced evacuations are not acceptable. But still not genocide nor does it imply that Russia intends to hold these people forever as hostages. Many of the evacuees to Russia are Russian-speaking and lived in the Donbas region during the war, there is a good chance a lot of them are pro-Russian themselves.

2. That phones are being confiscated as policy. Clearly they are not.

3. The ceasefires are not all sabotaged by Russians, the UA government press releases have been happening regularly. [Like these.](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3424469-ukraine-russia-agree-on-six-green-corridors-for-evacuation-of-civilians.html) [Or these.](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-cities-bombardment-continues/31733661.html) There have been breakdowns in ceasefires, especially in Mariupol, but most of them have now been successful especially recently. 

4. Russia has never said it wanted to restore the Great Russian Reich or whatever ""starting with Ukraine."" Not even implied that. Certainly many commentators have accused him of it, and maybe they're not even wrong about what he wants, but that's not what he said or ""basically said."" What he has talked about for years is that Ukraine and other states should never have been allowed to have referendums to establish independence after the Soviet Union collapsed, which is a particular take he is fond of, but that doesn't mean he intends to reverse it.

5. You are missing the important part in that definition, which is ""...the **intent** to destroy."" If they are not intending to wipe out the Ukrainian people or otherwise depopulate the country, it is not a genocide. The intent is extremely vital, and we have not seen that because we haven't seen a systematic program of extermination. Like, contrast this with quinessential genocides in Germany or Rwanda, where they would pick out every member of an undesirable group and kill them either right there or in camps so they can be dealt with in the most cost-efficient manner.

Yes, as a tank man. That includes all the duties a tank man has to perform and the skills. Literally learning how to operate a tank does not take 6 months. Most of what those 6 months are for are, learning how to read maps, using communications, learning how to drive a tank, strategy and tactics. Ukrainians would only need an explanation on how to operate the tank. Huge difference. 

> So you want to take at minimum 400 tankers from the frontline and about 200 mechanics for even at the sheer min a month and thats a crashcourse

Ukraine has many more tankers than tanks. There's a reason why they aren't being recruited. It would be really easy to send 400 recruit notices to people who haven't been recruited.

Then once again, it wouldn't take a month to show someone how to just operate a tank. Especially since they already know how to operate a tank. 

Ammo and spare parts are an issue, but not if they get sent along with the tanks. 

Mechanics are a little harder to train but since scheduled maintenance isn't a priority here, it would not be much of a problem.

> They can either be shooting russians with t72s in as little as a few days
