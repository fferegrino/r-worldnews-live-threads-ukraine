Over the last five days, Russian and Ukrainian forces have probably been fighting for control of the P66 highway, north of the Russian-held Luhansk Oblast town of Kremina.

The P66 is a key supply route for the northern section of Russia’s Donbas front from the Belgorod region of Russia.

Its use has been disrupted by Ukrainian artillery since October, but if Ukraine were able to secure the route, if would highly likely further undermine Russia’s defence of Kremina.

There’s only been two ways we’ve learned anything about Mariupol—the mayor’s advisor sharing what the residents tell him (he’s outside of Mariupol), or the local news agency ‘0629.’  It has been the *only* Pro-Ukraine news agency that has continued its local Mariupol coverage.  And it was only a start-up, having a niche audience, as the only local news in the Ukrainian language in Mariupol. 

They’ve been on the brink of shuttering, the staff is so low; but for now, they’re just taking a short sabbatical. They posted:

> *An Editorial: 0629 left 2022 behind, with heavy losses.*

> Part of our team left the profession. Some was for the defense of Ukraine.

> The team was reduced to a quarter of its size.

> We lost almost all of the company's assets. Laptops, printers, headphones, computers—all of that was in our office, located in the ‘Center for the Development of Startups in Mariupol’ building.  The center was completely robbed, including all our property in the office.

> We lost our advertising department because our business model was based on advertising revenue from small and medium-sized businesses in Mariupol.  Now, there’s no more Ukrainian business there, thus no advertising, therefore no sources of funding.  As a result, for the first time since the creation of the newssite, we are financed exclusively by international support. The USA, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia has so far helped us survive in these difficult times.

Day 313 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a mostly quiet day, but as usual Russians launched a bunch of Shaheds at our cities during the night. There was a confirmed hit on one of Kyiv’s energy infrastructure facilities, but the vast majority of drones were shot down. Most drones were aimed at Kyiv, but there were also some that targeted other cities, and I’m pretty sure all of them were intercepted this time.

While Russians try to destroy our infrastructure, our forces are actually hitting them where it hurts. A lot of Russians are saying that casualties in Makiivka are in the hundreds, it’s pretty insane how basically an entire battalion was wiped out in a single strike because of their incredible stupidity. Who thought that it was a good idea to make barracks and an ammo dump in the same place? Apparently, they also had some vehicles out in the open around that school, which were also destroyed in the strike. It’s like they are sabotaging themselves.

If even their MoD is saying that 63 people were killed, it means that the real number of casualties is just catastrophic. When Moskva sunk, they said there were no casualties, and back then about 300-400 people died on it, there were only a couple dozen survivors. Now Girkin is saying that the casualties are in the high hundreds, and he is usually pretty accurate, so I’m inclined to believe him. It’s so bizarre that a fucking international terrorist/war criminal is the most truthful and reliable person out of them all. It’s honestly pretty weird that they even let him talk at all, he goes against all the lies that their propagandists spew.

About two weeks ago, they apparently forcibly evacuated the elderly civilians who lived there.

Edit: just noticed, the bottom of the article notes that Russia’s forced evacuation of civilians was mentioned in the General Staff briefing, Dec 15.

But you say ""Uh, Erek, don't you think the Ukrainians have factored that in to their estimates?"" And my counter argument is that Ukrainian estimates have been high since before they released this information.

No it didn’t.  This war started on August 23, 1939 when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union sign a non-aggression agreement and a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The fighting began on September 17, 1939 when the Soviet Union invades Poland from the east.

There where initially three expansionist aggressors in WWII.  Japan and Germany were defeated.  The Russian remnant of the Soviet Union is still trying to conquer its claimed sphere of influence.  This is World War II Chapter 99, The Beginning of the End.

If you consider WWII to be just a continuance of WWI that started July 28, 1914, and count the Cold War and the many skirmishes like Korea and Vietnam, I will wager $100.00 that 500 years from now history books will call this the 100 year war like we do the war in the 14th to 15th century.

There is a couple of indications that Ukraine is at least in the ball park though. Early in the war, there were a couple of leaks/mishaps where Russian numbers were very close to Ukrainian estimates at the time.

If it was one leak I would have considered it unreliable but IIRC it happened at least twice, a few weeks apart.

And even a KIA:WIA of 1:2 is extremely biased towards KIA, so even at 1.5, you could be right.

The best argument against Ukrainian estimates I have seen is based on the concept that Russian IFVs were largely undermanned with infantry.

But you would think that wouldn't result in much of a difference when we've been seeing more infantry combat for months, making it possibly easier to identify KIA with drones/ISR.

You maintain the central position tying everything together. As everyone is broken into factions, no one faction is strong enough to seize and hold power on their own and the infighting and self-directed power-lust maintains distrust enough that this remains the status quo. 

Then you have your network of spies rooting out any groups banding together to form a cohesive unit strong enough to challenge you. If a coalition looks like it is forming you only need to kill one leader and do your best to make it look like one of the co-conspirators did it,  enough to splinter the faction. Rinse and repeat as necessary. 

Problem is, that's a super shitty way to run a government, with the players always looking over their shoulder and focusing on personal gain.

High impact ground to ground missiles Russia used nearly 90% of their prewar stock, they have managed to replace ~10% (as far as Western intelligence can confirm). They still have plenty (6000) of S300 surface to air missiles that are stupidly expensive to use for limited effect on ground targets - but they are using them as such. The arsenal of these is way harder to guage because estimated total stock would have included many that are deployed all over Russia for their intended purpose (protecting air supremacy over Russia). A whole bunch of drones have been launched alongside missile barrages making it harder to determine exact numbers in a barrage. Russia is also fielding missiles past their shelf life and using nuclear capable missiles with no payload.

It is clear they are low on the best missiles for the job and having trouble replacing at a reasonable rate. They are not launching as many as often of any of their stock and if they had an abundance they would be using them to clear Ukraine defense in depth with regularity to break up front lines with limited anti missile protection. Instead they are hitting power stations and random civilian terror targets.

They will have missiles of some variety and drones to fire forever though so I wouldn't expect them to ever ""run out"". They reportedly have limited production capacity as well to slowly refill some stock.

The point isn't ""but why can they still launch barrages if they are so low?"" but ""how often can they launch how many to what effect"" and as long as it is ""less often, fewer missiles of quality, to lesser effect"", they are ""running low"". They will never reach zero stockpile with zero means to replenish.

What people aren't taking into account is rate of production. Just because Russia depletes its stock of missiles, aka ""runs out"", doesn't mean they're not making more. How many a day can they produce? Unknown but if it 5 then they can't simply fire 5 missiles at Ukraine and not expect them to be shot down. So they build up some stock, and use Iranian drones to saturate air defense before they launch their current inventory.

tl;dr: Russia isn't going to run out of missiles because they keep manufacturing them. They may run low on inventory which means they can only use them at the rate they're produced, or they can save up and launch more at once (which means bigger gaps in between these attacks.)",False,1672654184.0,t3_1012q2w,t1_j2lrgpd,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Also, since Russia has nukes, THEY have to be worried about OUR escalation. Every cruise missile and ballistic missile launch looks to NATO like what could be an attack, so the chances of an accident are high. It's not NATO that will suffer for a mistake, it will be Russia when we retaliate.

“Trust, but verify” was a Reaganism that Obama clearly adhered to. In two elections the opposing rhetoric about him was that he was extreme, and would flood the country with free abortion vans, latte trucks and of course triage by death panel for older voters.

But he was much more restrained. Maybe partly (to his detriment) due to these optics. But in total we got a cool hand, responsive economic growth and level-headed, intelligence-driven foreign policy. He could walk and chew gum simultaneously. And my kids will have health coverage for the rest of their lives. Thanks Obama.

One guy, the other guy who brought us public health coverage btw, said in a debate that Russia was our primary concern. He got laughed out of the room, by his own party as well. The party of Reagan, unconcerned about Russia. Imagine it. The seeds of their total capitulation to Putin were already planted.

Reagan today would be pounding the desk demanding more aid for Ukraine. He’d be sending tanks. He’d be training pilots. He’d be firing up factories. He’d rattle a museum wall’s worth of sabres against Putin. He might even push just a bit too far in words and action. McCain would probably try to steal a plane.

That party has forgotten themselves.

Obama’s party has not. His actions against Russia would be proactive, bipartisan, and effective. Putin’s road hasn’t shifted because of Obama. Nor Trump or Biden. He was always going to do what he was going to do. Thank fuck we have a level-headed leader in DC, much like Obama.

Certainly you can characterize this war as *revanchist*, but the Russian state was quiescent for too long to say this is a continuation of WWII. Putin didn't take power for almost ten years. The Yeltsin government certainly didn't seem very interested in imperialist expansionism; the question is probably moot since it didn't possess the means in any event, with the much more urgent and immediate problems at home.

RF doesn’t remove its lightly injured men a good bulk of the time.  Injured men keep fighting, disadvantaged, get killed.  Those who are taken for care have to go back, soon after starting to be on the mend.  (They have to take their own bandages, there’s very little med evac.) Russia truly does not care about their men—not their wounds, not them as a person.

Ukraine, however, takes men out dutifully.  Often it’s just if they *might be* injured (concussed).  And, no soldier is allowed back to his unit until brings official discharge papers (medical clearance) signed by the supervisor-doctor.  Ukraine doesn’t have soldiers with mangled limbs—they’re professional—and they care about their men.  Because of this, people can be away longer than want to be.  They’re mandated to stay in rehab centers.  For example, every interview of a  returned  Azov POW I’ve translated has said same thing, they want to be redeployed.  They’re in their mandatory convalescence in a rehabilitation center, though, sometimes for months. 

So with Ukraine not using injured men to fight, their deaths are low (estimated to be about 1/3 of RF’s), but their overall battlefield losses (totals) due to injuries are just as high.

Conversely, RF has high death rates, but lower-than-accurate wounded rates bc they don’t pull the wounded out.  (“Have a concussion? Too bad, smoke a cigarette.” “Got shot in the finger? you didnt need it, anyways! Besides, we taught you how to tie a tourniquet.”)  basically, the Russian contribute to their own losses bc they don’t have a solid med evac plan. 

But another contributing factor is Russians constantly shoot at themselves!  Terrible coordination, no comms, both think the other is the enemy.  I read about this constantly in Ukrainian press, on the Russian channels, and int’l press.  With one knowledgeable expert saying it’s possible RF’s friendly fire has caused as much as 1/5 of Russian losses. 

One humorous story I posted a while back—was reconnaissance commander, small team.  In north, around March.  The whole team was captured bc concussed (can’t recall cause of concussion, either mortar or mine).  They were stripped and beaten by the Russians for a few hours, tortured, before the Russians decided to tie them up, loot their boots and winter clothes.  Initially wanted to take to middle of field, dump them, “shoot at them like rabbits” as they tried to run away.  The commander of the UA group of captives—who by then had injuries to his spine, broken ribs, broken jaw—exploited the Russians’ obvious disorganization and hatred for each other. [Explained that these units were Buryat, Bashkirs?, Chechens, and a Belorussian PMV. And it was clear they all hated one another.  So it wasn’t completely obvious that the Russian-on-Russian attack was accidental.] He somehow coaxed them to take the recon team to their brass, as trophies, that they’d be commended.  The Russians liked that idea, all set out for the brass,
all go out in convoy of tanks and armored trucks, but some split off saying going back to their positions.  Then, the convoy is shot at by other Russians, the tanks hit the other tanks.  The Russians in the convoy tanks stuck head out of tank—all inside were dazed, concussed—he could see the captives in next vehicle, not by the barrage, asked the barefoot, handcuffed and noosed Ukrainians, “brothers, help us”—the absurdity calling them “brothers” after beating them, and stealing from them, making them ride without clothes in March ... the recon unit hopped out... and ran 10 miles barefoot back to UA-held territory.",1672680512.0,1672650784.0,t3_1012q2w,t1_j2lzc07,,2,20,0,20,0,0,

Few foreign legionaries died, though many were injured from panicked fleeing into the night. This was probably a stroke of luck - maybe missile defense or targeting luck. Many of the other buildings on the rather large base were hit, and many young Ukranian officers died that night.

It sounds like there were many reasons to believe that installation was a 'juicy' target; it is possible (though unnecessary) that the foreign SIM card thing was just an excuse to make what is an obvious target seem clever. The Ukrainians paid a heavy price in that strike, which is thought to be composed of 30-40 *Kh-101* cruise missiles.

/u/Nvnv_man made a great comment about differences in medical care, definitely worth the read. Medical care would absolutely influence the numbers of deaths and I imagine that Ukraine is doing an alright job there (I have a buddy who is working as a medic over there and he says while it isn't perfect it is adequate). 

I do imagine that the numbers Ukraine puts out are propaganda to some extent. This is a modern war, the internet has effectively become another domain of warfare plus online presence/perception does play a role. I imagine the Ukes want to keep a good perception in the eyes of the world so they can continue to receive aid and materiel from NATO/other allied nations. To some extent, I think it plays the dual purpose of ""we are smoking you motherfuckers like crazy, go home"" and ""we are using the stuff you are giving us well, give us more.""

However, I imagine the degree at which they are fudging the numbers isn't super far off from reality. It is absolutely undeniable that Russia is getting their asses handed to them in just about all ways. Logistics? We blew up your base with an artillery strike. Tanks/AFVs? Blown away by Javelins and all other ATGM systems you have given us. Infantry? Bombed with grenades from drones. So, I imagine just from the open source stuff we have seen and the efforts of organizations to organize all of that data into a coherent way we are seeing that the casualties on the Russian side have to be fucking horrendous. 

Now, in terms of Uke casualties I imagine that their casualties are pretty similar. Once again it is a modern war and the quote that has been bouncing around my head is ""modern war consumes ammunition, material, and, worst of all, men at a frightening rate."" However, I imagine that because the Ukes have a better system of treating them (actual casualty care, people who know what they are doing, not just leaving people to die, etc.) they are probably having less deaths. So, they are almost certainly having a rough go but overall I imagine their losses would be less than whatever numbers the Russians put out. 

In any case, I imagine the losses are nothing short of horrific for the Russians and the Ukes are taking similar casualties but having better outcomes for those casualties.",False,1672653732.0,t3_1012q2w,t1_j2lzxpz,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

Amnesty International researchers found the remains of a military vehicle in the courtyard of the bombed university building.

International humanitarian law does not specifically ban parties to a conflict from basing themselves in schools that are not in session. However, militaries have an obligation to avoid using schools that are near houses or apartment buildings full of civilians, putting these lives at risk, unless there is a compelling military need.

First I would dismantle the Kerch bridge, even if it's only temporary. But having an access point directly to Russia is a weakness of Ukraine wants to reclaim their sovereignty. Give the citizens a few months to a year to decide whether they want to stay in Crimea or leave via that bridge before it is dismantled. 

It would then be treated similar to how China treats Hong Kong, with leadership positions being available to candidates vetted by the Ukrainian government. They could set the rules, but I would suggest no one who was originally a Russian citizen should be allowed to run, or at least any citizen who has come from Russia in the past 8 years for sure. In addition to this the Ukrainian army would have an increased military presence in the area as well. 

All of this would be intended for the short term, perhaps 2-5 years. Whatever it takes to ensure that the seeds Russia tried to plant here don't take root, or get weeded out. I say ""intended for short term"" so that they can extend it if this insurrection problem still remains. 

I know that increased military presence and vetted officials sounds like it would make for a bad time for the citizens, but I would hope such measures could be coupled with an attempt at reconnecting with the people of Crimea. I'm not sure what was so terrible about the place before that people thought they needed to join another country, but maybe the government could work on those concerns more diligently than they were before.

Personally I would like to see Tartars given a larger amount of influence in that region, or maybe Ukraine as a whole as they are evidently a group that likes to be targeted. But that's a tangent I can get into some other time.

But if things go well and Crimea can be rid of Russian corruption in that short time then after that they could go back to traditional elections once again without any vetting or other restrictions.

According to treaties - Russia has limited amount of nuclear warheads for cruise missiles (around 900 for cruise missiles , torpedoes and nuclear tipped depth charges combined). They developed Kh-102 which is  much improved over Kh-55 and basically moved the warheads from Kh-55s to Kh-102s. They could upgrade those Kh-55s to Kh-555s (added fuel tanks, changed guidance system, conventional warhead, etc) but someone noticed that the Ukrainian AA defense is very effective against cruise missiles (only between 8 and 13 percent of launched missiles will reach their targets - that 13% is based on Russian reports), so instead of pretty expensive and difficult conversion (Kh-55 warhead is just 130kg, conventional warhead from Kh-555/101 is over 500kg, which means the balance is totally different; Kh-55 is basically a big fuel tank with a lot of things put inside of the space with the fuel - like wings for example) they will just put a concrete ballast and send it as decoys, saving those new guidance systems and warheads for Kh-101s, which have an order of magnitude bigger chance to hit it's target.

Listen. Russia has not been able to improve the living standards of their own citizens, do you think the people in occupied territories will be living a good life, or living at all, considering what we've seen so far?

  
""Ukraine foreits territory"" is not a diplomatic solution, considering RUS sees that as a win and will plan on another incursion a few years later.

Obama said he will bomb Assad if Chen weapons were used. But when they were first used, instead of calling his generals, he called…putin. He talked to putin and accepted his offer to peacefully destroy Syria’s chem weapons. As a result of the call, he called off the air strikes that he promised would take out Assad. 

The air strikes were planned and ready to go. Obama got suckered - Syria is still producing poison gas today.

I have no idea what the actual numbers are and i am interested.  Maybe Ukraine really is setting some sort of record for low casualties from heavy bombardment.  We can recognize that as an extraordinary achievement.  Historically that much steel kills a lot of soldiers and suddenly this year we have something different. 

There are tank battles, people are shooting rifles, sometimes airplanes and helicopters make an appearance before getting shot down, there are land mines.  It probably adds up to lower numbers than the artillery.  But we will not know until books are published after the war.  If Ukraine has new tactics that resist artillery that tactic does not remove the other causes of losses.
