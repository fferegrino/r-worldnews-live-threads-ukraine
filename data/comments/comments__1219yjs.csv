The announcement by Mateusz Morawiecki comes ahead of a planned visit by EU Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, to Dezamet on Monday.

Seventeen EU member states and Norway this week agreed to jointly procure ammunition to help Ukraine and to replenish their own stockpiles, the European Defence Agency said.

Dezamet, which produces ammunition for artillery, mortars and grenade launchers, is one of PGZ group's more than 50 armaments enterprises.

""This plant can count on new orders and funds, we will be launching new production lines at this company and the others to produce ammunition,"" Morawiecki told Radio RMF when asked about Breton's visit to the factory.

""We want to multiply the output severalfold as quickly as possible,"" he said.

It‚Äôs funny that they said that this was their response to the DU tank rounds that we will be getting along with Challengers. So, they constantly threaten to end the world with nukes, but then they also claim that they actually care about the environment?

***about the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine***

*Preparations*

> Preparations for it are underway, including, on the line of contact. We have already written about hunting for Russian artillery; about the actions of small and mobile assault detachments of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pologi area; special ops and army units operate on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region.

*Penetration points*

> Keep in mind‚Äîthat there is no solid and unified front line or line of Russian defense. There are ‚Äòchains of strongholds‚Äô, and ‚Äòpositions in the most dangerous directions‚Äô‚Äîfrom the point of view of the generals. Therefore, mobile detachments of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (as, by the way, Russian ones) can penetrate far beyond the formal front line.

*UA crossing the Dneiper to take the Left Bank*

> The Dnieper‚Äîwhich General Surovikin portrayed as an insurmountable barrier‚Äîis not a barrier for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian army has fast river boats with high firepower that can deliver troops across the river. Also in the fall, work was carried out to select the places for future crossings. The reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are concentrated in such a way that they can be in the place of deployment in a few hours and go into battle. Therefore, the transition from defense to offensive and very active battles can be quick. Individual officers in the RF Armed Forces understand this and do not expect anything good. The generals and group commander Valery Gerasimov report to the top about their readiness to repel any strike, but in fact‚Äîaccording to our General Staff sources‚ÄîGerasimov knows that the Russian troops will have to hastily retreat. It is possible that the command will begin to withdraw them in some areas in the coming days.


*Russia‚Äôs defects*

> Russian military retain control abilities, but every day they lose more and more in efficiency. Chaos constantly grows, in decisions and in orders. Due to multiple factors: first, the poor training of officers; second, a sharp reduction in officers with combat experience (fall and winter losses affects); third, because of the lack of communication between divisions and headquarters. The lack of constant communication leads to friendly fire, suicide orders, delays in deployment and getting into position, and much more. The troops lack transport, including trucks. This stretches the transfer of reserves and ammunition for days instead of hours.


*Russia‚Äôs shortcomings can lead to paralysis of control*

> In the context of a large-scale offensive, which is quite possible to expect from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all these problems can lead to the fact that the situation gets out of control [for Russia]. Especially if the Armed Forces of Ukraine inflicts not just one, but two blows from different directions. In their repulsion, not one grouping will be involved (which are half withdrawn to the left bank, anyways, like in Kherson in the fall); but actually, over 70,000 people, subordinate to different headquarters, who will not be able to coordinate their actions or make quick decisions. The result of such a paralysis of control is usually the collapse of the front and defeat.

> Plus, this time, there wont be slowpokes in the Armed Forces of Ukraine‚Äîwho, back in the fall, did not capture large groupings of Russians due to their slowness.

*Why Russia will lose Kherson left bank*

> By the way, for some reason the RF Armed Forces is sure that nothing has changed in the Kherson direction since then and that there is no serious threat from that side. Therefore, the defense of the Russian army on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region resembles a sieve and will not withstand serious blows. This will add chaos and also bring closer the likely collapse of the front in the event of Ukrainian offensives",1679731519.0,1679731201.0,t3_1219yjs,t3_1219yjs,,0,48,0,48,1,0,

1.	China wanted/was ok with Russia trying to take Ukraine as that would either, strengthen Russia or make the West invest a lot of resources and maybe even people in the conflict. That would allow China to try and take Taiwan without much practical reaction
2.	US/NATO didn‚Äôt take the bait, didn‚Äôt commit troops and is using the conflict to ramp up the military industrial complex. Is also using Taiwan to show they‚Äôre ready to counter China in the region and keeping China at bay in the conflict
3.	China now sees they have to play the long game and is starting to replace Russia as regional leader while securing very good deals with Russia


Considering how much Russia is moving under China‚Äôs wing, it‚Äôs possible China can use this to broker a peace deal with Ukraine. This will:

1.	Free Wagner to do their bidding in Africa (might be complicated now that Wagner is considered a transnational criminal organization but not sure how that translates in practice)
2.	Free Russia‚Äôs brains to focus on development that benefits China
3.	Improve China stance in the world diplomatic stage. Other countries could turn to China to resolve their conflicts

If that‚Äôs the case I wonder what‚Äôs going to be the West‚Äôs move to avoid that China benefits so much from this. 

Rebuilding Ukraine and having access to their resources will be a good thing for the West. But I wonder if it wouldn‚Äôt be China getting the best end result.

I think the Ukrainian command had a very good touch on the tactical realities on ground and were seeing the future. This is the third similar major offensive against Ukraine, they are experienced in this stuff.

The defensibility of terrain in the vicinity of Bakhmut at the side Russia is currently on is poor (this of course was why Ukraine had to slowly creep backwards too). We have all seen the clips of open spaces with shallow bits and crumbling trench walls. If you go over the east and cut the M03 towards Pokrovske, that location is the lowlands.

Most of the gains at this area can be lost at a moments notice and i think you can see it in the Russian hesitency of attempting to advance any further towards the less fortified directions. This position has become a dead end for mighty russia and they butchered their troops for nothing. Unless they are willing to commit a lot of new troops.

One of the main reasons Russia invaded Ukraine was to create a land bridge in eastern Ukraine from Russia to Crimea to better supply it with water and supplies, so they can keep control of it and under Russian influence. Especially one of its naval bases that influences the area greatly.

If Ukraine disconnects the land bridge in their counter offensive, keep the Crimea bridge out of commission, shut off the canal again, and keep boats/naval resupply out of they way then Crimea becomes a ticking time bomb.

Ukraine may not even have to invade right away. They would just have to wait until the area becomes so unstable and drained of resources it implodes.

Crimea resupply becomes much more difficult. Odds increase that defenses will not hold, retreats and consolidation will occur to defend an ever shrinking territory.

Harrassment will continue from air and sea, but unlikely in any effective measure to change the outcome.

Muscovy forces could be taken prisoner in large numbers not seen yet which would be a huge public PR blow. Really depends on to what extent they try to bolster and hold out in such a bad situation. Or they could cut their losses and plan a more orderly retreat early under UA long range harrassment which would save a lot of troops and equipment.

Russian anti-western sentiment is a boogeyman that really makes no difference.

The educated/informed know this is an offensive invasion into Ukraine that started in 2014; the nature of the defenders isn't relevant so long as it's on Ukranian soil.

The neutral/apathetic don't care, or don't want to be impacted, but will fight anyway when called upon because 'what choice is there?' They wouldn't suddenly volunteer to head off and die -- they'll begrudgingly go when told. 

It's not possible to inspire more anti-western sentiment than their propaganda already creates. It doesn't depend on truth. The audience that consumes it already believes NATO pilots are operating in Ukraine.",1679722194.0,1679721042.0,t3_1219yjs,t1_jdl1kue,,1,48,0,48,0,0,

Can you imagine what it's like for them to have to live in exile for their safety and someone, who may have never lived in Russia, tells you to your face that Russia is either OK or they try to equate Russia with other more free and democratic societies?  

There's a talk with a Q&A session on Youtube featuring Garry Kasparov and Julia Ioffe called [Starr Forum: The Trump-Putin Phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBsC9ey_H-s). It's from 2017. In that someone tries to equate America and Russia. To his credit, Garry Kasparov doesn't ignore the question. If you're interested I do recommend watching it to hear Kasparov.  

Regarding this subject and the propaganda Russia feeds to people, Russia has been playing this game for *many* decades. They were already doing it before the fall of the Soviet Union.  

Here's a quote you may find interesting. It's from an article in the Guardian titled [‚ÄòThe perfect target‚Äô: Russia cultivated Trump as asset for 40 years ‚Äì ex-KGB spy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book). It's by Yuri Shvets who was a KGB agent:  
>‚ÄúThis is an example where people were recruited when they were just students and then they rose to important positions; something like that was happening with Trump,‚Äù Shvets said by phone on Monday from his home in Virginia.  

If you look at this timeline on Wikipedia from the article [Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Before_Donald_Trump's_2016_candidacy) you will notice that the KGB had targeted Trump back in 1977 (see that Guardian article for further details) as a potentially useful tool. He was just one of many they identified and cultivated in the hopes that in the future even a select few of them would prove useful.  

Another quote from that same Guardian article:  
>Unger describes how Trump first appeared on the Russians‚Äô radar in 1977 when he married his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech model. Trump became the target of a spying operation overseen by Czechoslovakia‚Äôs intelligence service in cooperation with the KGB.  

>Three years later Trump opened his first big property development, the Grand Hyatt New York hotel near Grand Central station. Trump bought 200 television sets for the hotel from Semyon Kislin, a Soviet √©migr√© who co-owned Joy-Lud electronics on Fifth Avenue.

>According to Shvets, Joy-Lud was controlled by the KGB and Kislin worked as a so-called ‚Äúspotter agent‚Äù who identified Trump, a young businessman on the rise, as a potential asset. Kislin denies that he had a relationship with the KGB.  

>Then, in 1987, Trump and Ivana visited Moscow and St Petersburg for the first time. Shvets said he was fed KGB talking points and flattered by KGB operatives who floated the idea that he should go into politics.

>The ex-major recalled: ‚ÄúFor the KGB, it was a charm offensive. They had collected a lot of information on his personality so they knew who he was personally. The feeling was that he was extremely vulnerable intellectually, and psychologically, and he was prone to flattery.

>‚ÄúThis is what they exploited. They played the game as if they were immensely impressed by his personality and believed this is the guy who should be the president of the United States one day: it is people like him who could change the world. They fed him these so-called active measures soundbites and it happened. So it was a big achievement for the KGB active measures at the time.‚Äù  

While I've quoted those parts just to save people time, I do invite anyone who is interested to please read that Guardian article and see that timeline on Wikipedia for details of how the KGB go about playing this game of influencing people and turning them into useful tools to be exploited.

First off, don't forget that China is *far* more interested in Taiwan. China is looking at the reaction to Russia and how the global partnerships and organisations work and can be used to China's advantage, or at least hinder others to China's advantage, with respect to Taiwan.  

As soon as a peace plan from China was announced, western leaders and reporters had already mentioned that such a plan wouldn't favour Ukraine. It was thought that such a plan would actually bog down other countries in places like the UN and give Russia time to do whatever they needed.  

What China and Russia do both agree on is that, as they see it, having America in charge of the world is bad for them. It gets in the way of China's plans for Taiwan, and we all know what Russia thinks of America and the west sanctioning the hell out of them. They don't want a powerful western alliance. Russia in particular would much rather have things done through the UN where Russia has veto power. Outside of the UN Russia can be ignored so far as power and influence goes compared to the western nations.  

It's really this imbalance of power as they see it (China and Russia versus America and the west) and their ability to take land and get away with it (Russia and Ukraine, China and Taiwan) that binds Russia and China together.  

The peace plan so far is just a diversion.  

One rather problematic area to watch out for is in the UN regarding China using their massive influence and hold over southern nations to get them to vote their way in the UN.  

Do not underestimate the influence China has over southern nations. A diplomat said recently that they know that doing deals with China is bad for them, but they have no choice. Western investors withdrew and raised rates. The southern nations are facing hard times with climate change, high grain costs and very high artificial fertiliser costs. The diplomat said one country was already having to subsidise the cost of fertiliser for farmers. They don't have the money to cover all of their bills and projects before this, so this means making even more difficult cuts.  

This is where China comes in.  

They're the only country who are consistently investing desperately needed money and resources. The diplomat was begging for western investors and nations to come back so they can work with them rather than China. They know they're selling their children's future to China, but they currently have no choice if they want to survive their current crises and problems.  

That gives China an awful lot of leverage over those countries. Just imagine what would happen to those investments and resources if those countries voted against China in the UN.",False,1679790351.0,t3_1219yjs,t1_jdoeu2r,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

It took several years for the Germans to introduce an equivalently mobile MLRS system on a truck or half-track, which was itself just a reverse-engineered Katyusha copy.

They both concede that the attrition rate *was* about 7:1 for the first several months, but it had recently decreased, and during their visit appeared to be 1:1.  There's a ton of caveats to their reports.  But the 1:1 ratio was for a period of a few weeks and has since gone back up in Ukraine's favor.  Some of the caveats are that R,Lee and Kofman didn't visit command, wouldn't have been privy to the actual casualty rates because Ukraine would never give them those to release on Twitter, and are basing those numbers antecdotally based on what they heard from people in the area.  Their take on the Bakhmut strategy was controversial and opposed to the entire Ukraine command, and most NATO advisors who had access to the actual intelligence reports..  And, frankly, in the last week or so, it seems to have been proven to have been in error.

Edit: to add that they were proven to be in error as they wrote AFU should ckncede Bakhmut 2 weeks before thr Russian offense slowed.  Literally, 2 weeks after their trip report, the Russian army is culminating and Ukraine is victorious.  They were suggesting Ukraine concede at the cusp of victory after an 8 month long siege.   The thing is, te Twitter OSINT nerds don't have access to the actual intelligence.  Not to disparage them.  They just don't.  Their perspectives are interesting, but flawed, as they will never have the full picture.  Ukraine command has the real numbers.  Russia has the real numbers.  They're not releasing them.  

Also, the attrition point they discussed was only in Bakhmut, one of 5 major points of advance.  To conflate that with total attrition rates is bonkers.  And attrition rates in Bakhmut only turned when Russia took the pincers in early Feb.  Those pincers positions gave them access to the high ground and allowed Russians to fire down on Ukrainians.  Well entrenched Ukrainians, but still.  Russia could never envelop because we now know Ukraine had sizeable forces in Chasiv Yar in the highlands.  Trying to close the pincers was a suicide mission.  AFU command knew this (grunts in Bakhmut may not have).  AFU command could also probably see Russia was on cusp of culmination at this point and likely saw pincers as a last minute desperate push.",1679777248.0,1679775766.0,t3_1219yjs,t1_jdnr324,,4,3,0,3,0,0,
