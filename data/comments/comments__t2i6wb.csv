>Two Danish journalists who live in Ukraine—and who have contributed dispatches about the war to The Daily Beast—were shot Saturday while reporting near the Russian border. The Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which was employing reporter **Stefan Weichert** and photographer **Emil Filtenborg Mikkelsen** as stringers, reported that both of them were taken to the hospital and “are out of danger.” The pair were wearing bulletproof vests while in Okhtyrka in the northeastern part of the country. “This is an ugly reminder of the dangers journalists in Ukraine face every day to document the horrors of the war,” Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, said on Twitter.

Before I hand over to my colleague, Jem Bartholomew, here is where the situation currently stands:

Russian troops entered Kharkiv in Ukraine’s north-east about 8am on Sunday, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister and other officials said. It is the country’s second-largest city.

The Ukrainian army said it shot down a “winged rocket” fired at Kyiv from a Belarusian Tu-22 aircraft this morning.
Russian president Vladimir Putin made a brief televised address this morning, marking his first public remarks since Friday. Putin referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special operation to provide assistance to the people’s republics of the Donbas” and saluted the “heroism” of Russian special forces fighting in Ukraine.

The Russian delegation claimed it was “ready for talks” with the Ukrainians in Belarus, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russia news agency RIA Novosti. Zelenskiy rejected the claims.

Google has said it is pausing monetisation of Russian state-funded media and barring the outlets from running ads across its services, according to a statement seen by Reuters.

Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday.

There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows.

The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment – reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender – may still be alive, according to Ukrainian officials.

Britain is preparing a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said.

Truss said there would be “nowhere left to hide” for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin.

Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia’s national drink in a show of unity with the people of Ukraine. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice”.

Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reported.

A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: “The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.”

33 mins old as of now:  


Russian troops entered Kharkiv in Ukraine’s north-east at about 8am on Sunday, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister and other officials said. It is the country’s second-largest city.  
The Ukrainian army said it shot down a “winged rocket” fired at Kyiv from a Belarusian Tu-22 aircraft this morning.  
Russian president Vladimir Putin made a brief televised address this morning, marking his first public remarks since Friday. Putin referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special operation to provide assistance to the people’s republics of the Donbas” and saluted the “heroism” of Russian special forces fighting in Ukraine.  
The Russian delegation claimed it was “ready for talks” with the Ukrainians in Belarus, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russia news agency RIA Novosti. Zelenskiy rejected the claims.  
Google has said it is pausing monetisation of Russian state-funded media and barring the outlets from running ads across its services, according to a statement seen by Reuters.  
Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday.  
There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows.  
The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment – reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender – may still be alive, according to Ukrainian officials.  
Britain is preparing a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said.  
Truss said there would be “nowhere left to hide” for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin.  
Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia’s national drink in a show of unity with the people of Ukraine. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice”.  
Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reported.  


  
A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: “The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain.

Katie Prescott, Business correspondent

Excluding certain Russian banks from the Swift system used for trillions of dollars-worth of transactions will hit the economy hard - and in the words of the White House, it will make the country rely on ""the telephone or a fax machine"" to make payments.

This is only a slight exaggeration. There are workarounds to Swift but none which are as efficient.

Only one country has been cut out in the past - Iran - which resulted in it losing 30% of its foreign trade.

Picking certain Russian banks will ensure the sanctions have the maximum impact on Russia, while preventing too much impact on Europe.

European businesses will be able to continue to collect money owed, and buy Russian energy.

Other measures are equally powerful. Curbs on Russia's central bank will stop it using its currency to limit the effect of sanctions.

Russia has been building up a cushion of foreign currency to protect its banks, but this new measure will significantly decrease the reserves available.

The impact of these measures may take a while to show - but they do express an immediate intent from Western nations.",False,1645952670.0,t3_t2i6wb,t3_t2i6wb,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

* Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.

* Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

* The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

* If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

* Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.

* Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees.

Oh man, we're seeing a lot of planning failures here at the PLT and SQD level.  
  
Situation: We see a unit of Russians conducting what is most likely a movement to contact in an urban area. Dispersion of 15-25m between vehicles, and 2-5m between personnel in a Squad, Soldiers moving in columns. They take fire from what sounds like a DShK (.50 cal US equivalent). Russian Soldiers in contact disperse and find what cover they can along a linear danger area (LDA). 3 vehicles positively ID'd in the video indicate a Russian Platoon, and the vehicles they are using (Tigrs) cue us in to contract rather than conscript Soldiers. In the last couple of seconds of the video we see crew served weapons on top of the vehicles engaging contacts to the 9 o'clock of the formation, while a Russian Soldier fires either a GP-25 (40mm grenade launcher) or RPG-7 (HE munition) at a building to the 6 o'clock.  
  
Observations  
  
Movement Technique. When enemy contact is likely, units should use a bounding overwatch technique where one maneuver element establishes a base of fire overwatching the movement of the unit bounding past them. Once the moving unit reaches its intended area, it establishes a base of fire and indicates for the unit to the rear to bound up to establish its base of fire. These units then do this ""leap frogging"" repeatedly until they reach their limit of advance. Here we see the Russian forces utilizing the traveling technique, usually reserved for when contact isn't likely, to move into an urban area with expected enemy forces. A terrible mistake, as each building is likely enemy contact.  
  
Reaction. The vehicles firing to the 9 o'clock, while the Soldier engages to the 12 may be indicative that these Soldiers may not be trained in even the most basic of contact drills: providing the distance, direction, and description of enemy forces. Considering the most likely layout of an ambush, the Soldier firing to the 12 o'clock probably isn't engaging a target of any meaning.  
  
Dispersion. The spacing of vehicles may be excused as them wanting to provide cover for each other, but the spacing of the dismounts is not. The lethal radius of a grenade is about 5m, and the injury radius is 15. If Ukrainian forces engaged with an AGS-40 (Automatic Grenade Launcher), or a claymore, this Platoon's combat power would be destroyed and would require reconstitution.  
  
As we can see below, the results of poor tactics. From alleged Spetsnaz of all units! You can come to your own conclusions about Russian capabilities, but I have come to mine.

I found this as a comment on another post. I just want to help share this.
Urban warfare tips from a former Marine.
I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can’t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.
For the defenders of Kiev, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :

1.) Stay out of the steet.

2.) Stay out of street.

3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.

4.) Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.

5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.

6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.

7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.

8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last.

9.) Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.

10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle.

11.) Never fire from the same window twice.

12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it.

13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.

14.) If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.

15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. 

16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.

17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.

18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.
 19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.

20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.

21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.

22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.

I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.
Glory to Ukraine.
Edit: A few extras.

23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.

24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.

25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.

26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.

27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.

28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.

29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. 30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long",False,1645945326.0,t3_t2i6wb,t3_t2i6wb,,0,66,0,66,3,0,{'gid_1': 1}

The top military brass will either

* Follow his command and take whatever will be left of Kyiv
* Or they'll stage a coup and assassinate Putin.

Why I think that

* This invasion has already taken much longer than they have anticipated. Everyone fell in line to Putin's plan, but as it starts to go haywire allegiances will shift. 
* They cannot financially continue to fight much longer.  
* Nervous Putin at the meeting with Oligarchs yesterday. 
* Sanctions are intensifying and growing in numbers. Oligarchs are not happy. Companies are also applying sanctions downstream, and the general public are not going to be happy at all.
* Big lines at ATMs show Russian people are losing faith.
* TOS-1s rolling deeper into Ukraine
* Ukraine's tweet about Russia's new propaganda about UA setting off a dirty bomb in RU.
* Growing unrest within Russia. Growing protests. A government official went against the war yesterday, and the number will grow. 
* International outrage intensifying. A short invasion would have escaped the general public's attention span, but this invasion, largely due to the response from Ukraine has everyone in the world paying attention. Putin will want to appear strong.

* Emphasising the role of neo Nazis in Ukraine, who may be CIA backed. As far as I can tell they're real but play no more of a role than neo Nazis in most Western countries. 
* Raising NATO expansion as raising security concerns for Russia, but never really elaborating on why, save for the America saying they wouldn't do it in 1991.
* Trying to say that Putin isn't a cartoon villain (as if we don't have recent experience of leaders making extraordinarily bad, shortsighted and selfish decisions) so the invasion MUST make sense on some level, right?

We’ve seen it before in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Syria, and Georgia. But because the media has taken so much interest in this only now is Reddit following the lead. 

Putin just wants to inflict severe damage to infrastructure, to civilians, and interrupt daily flow. He does this in stages kind of like a chess game. Right now he’s moved his pawns in attack position and quite frankly, sacrificing them. These images and reports you see of captured young and clueless Russian soldiers, and old armored vehicles that are out of fuel is just to a) draw out Ukrainian forces b) deplete and exhaust them and c) lull them into a false sense of achievement. 

The real invasion and attack has not began yet. If Reddit had taken anything Putin did seriously in Syria they would know that he has no problem bombing high density civilian areas including hospitals and has no problem using illegal munitions including chemical warfare. We haven’t seen anything yet. The sad thing is that no one else is going to get directly involved so as not to invite possible worldwide conflict. The material support Ukrainians receive will put up a fight but Russia just wants to wear them down. Putin is not concerned about losses and he will suffer tremendous loss. His end game is to restore balance to his waning superpower. I just hope that all the Ukrainian civies can get out or find a way to protect themselves before it gets worse.

2. Ukraine has gas reserves on the western and eastern side of the country

gas reserves in the black sea just south of Crimea

natural gas for western Europe which means less reliance on Russia for   
gas, less money for Russia and more reason for NATO and the EU to   
welcome Ukraine
4. Russia's population is declining. If he waits longer then Russia will have less population to attack with

Putin's fear of Ukraine becoming a dominant supplier of gas to Europe   
along with joining Nato is why Putin kept threatening Ukraine, which has  
 scared off oil companies from feeling safe to build/maintain facilities

2. Ukraine has gas reserves on the western and eastern side of the country where Russia has interfered (see Donetsk and Luhansk area) as well as gas reserves in the black sea just south of Crimea
3. The gas reserves mentioned above would make Ukraine a good supplier of natural gas for western Europe which means less reliance on Russia for gas, less money for Russia and more reason for NATO and the EU to welcome Ukraine
4. Russia's population is declining. If he waits longer then Russia will have less population to attack with

Putin's fear of Ukraine becoming a dominant supplier of gas to Europe along with joining Nato is why Putin kept threatening Ukraine, which has scared off oil companies from feeling safe to build/maintain facilities to extract this resource and cause Ukraine to focus their money on defence instead of growing economically",False,1645952021.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymdx1f,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

https://twitter.com/berojag59060636/status/1497850283434528771?t=LKfRJevSKrBp2U_Eg9aYUQ&s=19

They are using rpgs and LAWs to attack a building, but note the line of destroyed RU vehicles to the left. With the kind of weaponry in large quantities, I'm sure the UA is just looking for juicy targets to use them on, which would make the city a trap for tanks. Might just be more effective to use infantry and go block by block. 

It's a game of rock/paper/scissors. Anti-tank infantry kills tank. Tank kills infantry with small arms. Infantry with small arms kills anti-tank infantry. So if UA has a lot of infantry with anti-tank weapons, RU will be forced to just send in their own infantry to take them out. Another thing: these sophisticated anti-tank weapons are expensive, valuable, and very crucial to countering Russian tanks. It has been shown time and time again, across multiple conflicts, that infantry will expend their antitank ammunition in firefights with other infantry. It's a lot better for Russia to have the UA expend their antitank ammo on infantry firefights than have these munitions used against their tanks. You can see how much antitank ammo is being expended in this video, and they are clearly targeting a building, not a tank.

Edit: it looks like the RPGs they are using were looted from that very same convoy, so it's not much of a waste to just shoot the enemy's own shit back at them",1645953733.0,1645952611.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymhqu5,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

6d9e33847aff625a59d9eb2cd1cf5f43,t2i6wb,hymexl0,"I have some theories on why Putin chose to do this and maybe one, a few, or all are true 

1) By sending in the young and inexperienced first, they are able to learn how the enemy will behave, and also wear out the enemy before sending in more skilled individuals 

2) Putin knew that support for this war in Russia was going to be incredibly low and needed to use as many people as he could so he didn’t give a hint in the media that this war was going to happen so that he could easily trick a bunch of conscripts into (forcibly) signing papers and entering war

3) he is actively choosing to kill the youngest men because he knows they are more outspoken/democratic than the older generation 

4) he’s getting the benefit of psychological warfare on Ukrainians by throwing unsuspecting young men into war. Ukrainians find out these are just young boys who don’t want to be there and they feel guilty about killing them and it plays with Ukrainian morale

5) Putin is playing on the fact that in Russia there’s a rule that if a Russian soldier elects to turn themself in, that they’ll be tried and maybe executed back home. It puts the young men in a situation of not wanting this war, but knowing that fighting, winning and surviving is the only way they’ll be able to get back home. 

6) He is purposely hardening & traumatizing the youngest adult generation with war and getting the “strongest” out of them

I personally think Putin is creating his own death with this decision. There are going to be so many devastated friends and families.… but at the same time Putin knows he is no longer in control of convincing his citizens to fight for him when he wants and that’s not okay with him… with this war he has been able to ban Facebook in the namesake of “war” and I’m sure has been able to put in place other restrictive things to bring Russia back to the more repressive/obedient country he wants. He knows Russia is falling from within and this war allows him a chance to smoothly take measures that gets him closer to the old Soviet Union.

Oh also! He’s sending in Russian troops with cars that run out fuel and don’t have more fuel so that once they get to the city or close, they run out and are forced to stay and fight cause they can’t turn around once they realize that they’ve been tricked. This is at least my guess on why they’re doing this. So many reports of Russian vehicles running out of gas",1645950658.0,1645950154.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymbv0x,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

And the Eastern branch near Konotop is still far away and some units there are logistically cut off. With some conscripts abandoning their vehicles and tanks  due to a lack of fuel and rations.

The assault has already started since daylight this morning, Ukrainians expected the push as Estonian MP leaked probably NATO intel corroborated by purported Russian social media leaks from Kremlin insiders. That Putin demanded to force an end to this and wants Kyiv by Monday.

Russian VDV generals didn't want to do it as they realize this would mean sacrificing the VDV. Ukrainians acted on this public intel and yesterday attacked into Bucha/Hostomel to disrupt their staging area near Hostomel airport. They also shelled the crap out of it with tons of fires breaking out near the airport. They also ambushed a section of Chechen OMON and killed the Chechen right hand man of everyone's favorite Chechen warlord.

So today the VDV immediately attacked with armor that was pouring down yesterday. They did lose some as Ukrainian armor mounted a raid into Ivankov yesterday which is the choke point from the 2 roads their using to come down from Belarus. So VDV lost some armor, men, and supplies but got significant amount through already including Pantsir-M.

An hour ago the Ukrainians retreated back and blew the Bucha-Irpin bridge to stop VDV armor from crossing. This is gonna be a blood bath for VDV cuz they only have light armored vehicles to assault a fortified city with ATGMs. I mean you don't even need ATGMs when an RPG-7 can kill VDV armor.

*Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.*

*Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.*

*The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.*

*If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.*

*Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.*

*Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.*

*The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!*

*Spread this information so the world would realise how important it is to assist Ukraine right now and without hesitation! It is difficult for Russia, but it is difficult for Ukraine as well if the West does not provide meaningul support!*",False,1645949302.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymddx4,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Their current strategy is failing so he may just start leveling city blocks - at least that’s the general worry.

I don't want reddit propaganda telling me about the ace Mig-29 pilot ""Ghost of Ukraine"" with zero evidence and fake videos of ARMA 3 gameplay that shows ""russian aircraft"" being shot down in Ukraine, there is so much propaganda going on and even when someone disproves something they get downvoted because the propaganda gives Ukrainian's ""hope"".

The reality is that Ukraine has legitimately purchased weapons and has been given small amounts of training and weaponry as an exercise in soft power by the West, because Ukraine has been at risk of Russian aggression for a long time.

So Putin demanded the army force an end to this.

This is probably why Ukrainians counter attacked into NW suburbs yesterday to disrupt the VDV build up. 2 hours ago the VDV armor counter counter attacked to support Spetsnaz and OMON already there.

There was bombing in areas around the city and heavy fighting in the west part of Kyiv (at least, if I remember correctly it was the west) where a 6 year old ended up being killed. And missiles were launched from Belarus.

Kharkiv imo is a weird situation; troops have entered it (seems to be lightly armoured) and seem to not be the most organized. There is fighting going on, but russian equipment is being destroyed and left behind.

Zelenskyy also recently put out another video, so he's still alive.

They are a cult only in the sense that they are hermetic for the most part and a subset of the hindu faith, trying to assuage the suffering inherent in the human condition as best they can in their lifetimes. But they do not boast, nor advertise about the multitudes they've helped because they don't do it for more members (outside of those who show a commited interest to service to others and join longterm), praise or corporate funding. 

So, sounds a lot better than a lot of other ideologies out there to me, particularly Scientology or y'know a great deal of all the others. The Catholic Church can sometimes be similarly dependable, but not at the same level & consistancy (And the Hare Krishnas are less likely to rape you if you go by the numbers it seems.)",1645950504.0,1645950282.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymb1ya,,3,19,0,19,0,0,

>The Moscow stock exchange had suspended trading earlier on Thursday but when dealing resumed, stocks went into free-fall.
The MOEX index plunged as much as 45% before recovering slightly to close down 33%, while the RTS index — which is denominated in dollars — ended the day with losses of 39%. The crash wiped about $70 billion off the value of Russia's biggest companies.

That was before things escalated even more.  Now Russia is getting cut off from SWIFT which is going to cripple their banking systems, and a large majority of the foreign exchange reserves that were saved up by the Russian Central Bank have been held primarily in US, UK, and other EU banks---and now all that's going to be frozen.

They will face a wholesale currency and economic crisis pretty quickly, and I wouldn't be surprised if the MOEX/RTS falls another 20-50%.  The bank runs in Russia have already started as everyone is pulling all their money out.",False,1645948769.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymc5yt,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

So I would put it in this way. Reddit is not representative of Russia. (or really the US or any country). Reddit is a very left-of-center hivemind and I think it's great in a lot of ways. Especially here because they are right to denounce Putin.

But...again...they are not representative of the majority of society. Hence why this place blows up when Trump, Boris Johnson, etc. comes to office. They don't like it so they think it cannot happen.

Anyways. As for Putin. He is wildly popular in Russia outside of some increasingly progressive groups in the major cities (Moscow & St. Petersberg). He's spent the past 15 years consolidating his power among every leader of his constituencies and they have done the same. What you end up with is a pyramid scheme of leadership but it is one with deep repercussions for backing out.

So while some intellectuals, advocates, etc. may have the right to speak out even now, they ultimately are under local governments. Those local governments will appease them to an extent, but they report up to a higher leader who may make some appeasements as well, but this gets watered down before it gets to federal levels where Putin oversees things.

Change happens SLOWLY in Russia. So even those who disagree with this war nominally know that someone above the someone they are under will be angered. It may take days, it may take weeks, but the thumb comes down on them.",False,1645949953.0,t3_t2i6wb,t1_hymdpv0,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

You will talk to a recruiter after you call.

Tell them what you’re interested in. My thing was Electronics. You’ll go to MEPS and take the ASVAB, then they’ll sit you down and tell you how you did.

If you score high enough, you can get into the field you’d like, if you score low, you’ll get pushed toward a field the government feels your capable of, it’s all good either way.

Just sign on the dotted line.

Then you get to go to boot camp, which is shitty, but actually very necessary.

After that you get training in what ever it is you agreed to do, that’s pretty fun.

Then you get to go to your command and that’s when the real fun begins.

The armored vehicles are your cover, and you're their's. They keep you safe from bullets, you keep them safe from enemy infantry.

> You advance infiltrate forward, confirm its safe then you bring forward the armor as a support unit. 

You don't ""infiltrate"" a city when you're bringing armored units down main st. There's no stealth involved. In real life, people don't respawn on an objective point after switching to an anti-tank class because there's an armor unit nearby.

>If you advance with the support unit, wouldn't you be at risk from being ambushed in other directions?

That's why you advance with the infantry supporting you, dismounts have much better situational awareness. And if you come under fire from a building, the armored units can render the walls around windows moot as cover.

>I mean they were obviously watching from all directions when they advanced in the video but that seemed to be to be higly dangerous to do in an environment where you don't really have any intel other then everyone wants to kill you possible.

What the fuck else are you supposed to do? You're not going to get intel by just waiting around.
