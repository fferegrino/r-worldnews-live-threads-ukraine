The Finnish foreign minister said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “changed very much the security landscape in Europe,” adding that it also changed the public opinion on NATO membership.

For the first time ever the majority of Finns support a NATO membership,” he said.

Haavisto told reporters that the country is in close contact with the Swedish Foreign Ministry as Sweden also considers joining NATO. He added that he is in talks with European partners and the UK as applicant countries are not covered by security guarantees.

From CNN’s Katharina Krebs in London 

Ukraine forced Russia to reduce its targets to an operational and tactical level and is entering a ""long"" phase of war, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said in a statement posted on Facebook on Friday.  

""In order to win it now, we must carefully plan resources, avoid mistakes, project our strength so that the enemy, in the end, cannot stand up to us,"" the defense minister said.   

Reznikov said that after the initial Russian attack on Feb. 24, Moscow was expecting that Ukraine would capitulate in couple of days and the Kremlin would establish a new Russian system in Ukraine.   

However, Reznikov said, the “Ukrainian army and the entire Ukrainian population repulsed the occupiers and thwarted their plans.” 

According to Reznikov, an important change also took place at the international level. 

""In a month, Ukraine achieved integration in the field of defense, which could not be achieved for 30 years. We receive heavy weapons from our partners. In particular, American 155 mm M777 howitzers are already deployed at the front.

**The Suffering of Crimea’s Tatars**

(...)

*Tatars are Turkic-speaking Muslims who have lived in Crimea since the 13th century. Russian rulers have persecuted them for almost 300 years. One of the greatest tragedies in Tatar history was their genocidal expulsion from Crimea by Josef Stalin in 1944. About 200,000 Tatars are said to have been forcibly deported to Central Asia by the notorious Soviet secret police, the NKVD, in cattle cars. According to estimates, half died before they even reached the inhumane labor camps where the Soviets forced them to work and dwell.*  
  
*Tatars were allowed to return to Crimea in the late 1980s, but most did not go back to their homeland until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. In 2014, Tatars faced Russian aggression once again, when Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army annexed Crimea.*  
  
*In 2022, many Tatars have helped Ukraine defy its invaders. This is the latest Tatar struggle for freedom from Russian imperialism. The memory of pain and a history of repression form the basis of Tatar support for Ukraine’s defense, though Muslim neighbors with similar historical experiences — like some Chechens — have openly joined their oppressor’s side.*

In a press release published on Friday, the UK government said the sanctions were intended to target ""Putin’s financial network, tightening the vice on the President and his inner circle.""

The UK has now sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and 100 entities from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, according to the release.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:

We are exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin’s luxury lifestyle ... We will keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin’s aggression until Ukraine prevails.""

Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast who was first linked to Putin more than a decade ago, was also included in the sixth proposed package of European Union sanctions, according to two European diplomatic sources. Putin has denied he has or had a personal relationship with her.

The UK Foreign Office said Kabaeva ""has risen to become Chair of the Board of the National Media Group, reportedly the largest private Russian media company"" and ""previously sat as a Deputy in the Duma for Putin’s United Russia.""

Ocheretnaya, who divorced from Putin in 2014, has been included in the latest UK sanctions as she has ""benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities"" since the divorce, according to the government press release.

Others included in the UK's latest sanctions include Putin's first cousins Igor Putin and Mikhail Shelomov and the President's first cousin once removed, Roman Putin.

Day 79 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was pretty quiet again, but sometimes we still hear a sound that resembles both our own artillery and incoming shelling. We keep hearing that even right now, but I’m pretty sure it is indeed our artillery and not shelling. A good indication of it being our artillery is that there are no reports of shelling right now, when there’s actual shelling it gets reported immediately.

It does feel good knowing that 80-90% of explosions we hear are from our own artillery, but we can’t get too careless, because the other 10-20% of the time we hear explosions, they could still be  from incoming shelling.

There was something interesting in today’s report from our army. They said that our forces in Petrivka and Ternova were shelled by Russians. Those 2 settlements are not yet officially liberated, and this might be the indirect confirmation of them being liberated. 

If Petrivka is liberated that would mean that Mykhailivka, Butenkove and Cherniaky are also liberated, or at least that Russians stationed in those settlements are now encircled. And Ternova being liberated would mean that we have now reached the border with Russia, which was already being hinted at from multiple official sources.

It is also being reported that Russians are actively trying to get their forces out of Kharkiv region. Must be their newest feint, as Russia would never retreat, they are too strong for it. 

The fact that their politicians in State Duma are already saying that they should designate Poland as their next target for “denazification” is just so fucking funny. They are struggling so much in Ukraine, yet they think they can go against NATO?

And they are also changing their goals so often that it’s impossible to follow. They started the war by going straight for Kyiv, and successfully feinting out of the entire Northern front half way through. Then they said that they actually just wanted to liberate Donbas all along. After that they said “no, actually we want to liberate the entire Ukraine”, and now it’s “Poland, you’re next after Ukraine”.

Vadim Shishimarin will appear before the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine back in February. He is accused of killing a 62-year-old man in Ukraine’s Sumy region, according to the country's prosecutor general's office.

The investigation alleges that Shishimarin fatally shot an unarmed civilian who was riding a bicycle along the roadside in the village of Chupakhivka on February 28. According to the prosecutor, Russian troops drove into the village in a stolen car with punctured wheels, after their convoy came under attack by Ukrainian forces.

When they saw a man cycling home while on the phone, one of the group ordered the sergeant to kill him so he would not report them to the Ukrainian army. Shishimarin allegedly fired a Kalashnikov several times through an open window at the civilian’s head, prosecutors say.

“Shishimarin is currently in custody. Prosecutors and SBU investigators have gathered enough evidence of his involvement in violating the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder,” Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said in a statement on Facebook.

If found guilty, Shishimarin faces from ten years to life in prison.

When asked to comment on the trial, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday he has ""no information"" about the case. 

""I have no information about this court session or about this case. I don't know if this is true. I have no information at all on this,"" Peskov said during a daily call with journalists. ",False,1652449073.0,t3_uoj8gy,t3_uoj8gy,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

The review assessed the changed security environment following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and what NATO membership would mean for the Nordic country. It concluded that “Swedish NATO membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a deterrent effect in northern Europe.”

Sweden is expected to decide on whether it intends to join NATO soon, after the leaders of neighboring Finland announced its support for membership on Thursday.

The report, presented in Stockholm by Foreign Minister Ann Linde and Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist alongside party representatives, states that “Russian provocation and retaliatory measures against Sweden cannot be ruled out during a transition period in connection with a Swedish application for NATO membership.”

“There is a readiness to respond to Russian threats, but it is not possible to eliminate with certainty all the risks of Russian retaliatory measures,” it added.

The report added: “If both Sweden and Finland were NATO members, all Nordic and Baltic countries would be covered by collective defence guarantees. The current uncertainty as to what form collective action would take if a security crisis or armed attack occurred would decrease.”

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated his offer to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine should be the starting point for any discussions, Zelenskyy told Italy’s RAI 1 television in an interview shown in Ukraine on Friday.

“As president, I am ready to talk to Putin, but only to him. Without any of his intermediaries. And in the framework of dialogue, not ultimatums,” he said.

Ukraine and Russia have not held peace talks since March 29, although Russia's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky was quoted by Interfax news agency on Monday as saying peace talks were being held remotely.

* Russians are making some progress in the Severodonetsk area after their attempted river crossings got smashed. After taking Rubizne (directly north of Severodonetsk) a few days ago, the Russians apparently now control the last village between Rubizne and Severodonetsk, after it changed hands repeatedly for a few days. Russians apparently were probing the outskirts of Severodonetsk yesterday, but there's no indication that they have anywhere near the forces needed to seriously threaten the city.

* Near Popasna, to the south of Severodonetsk, the Russians managed a minor advance to the north, advancing ~5 km to the village of Komyshuvakya. Again, no indication that this will lead to any sort of true breakout, but it's another fire that the Ukrainians will have to shift forces to put out.

* In more positive news, in the Kherson area, the Ukrainians apparently managed to push about 10km south on the northern front of that area, south of Kryvyi Rih. (Note that the channel made clear that they haven't been able to confirm this - at this point, it's still ""something they're hearing"", not ""something they know."") Not a strategically significant advance, but still notable because the Russians have spent the past few weeks digging in and preparing their defenses in the area.

I sorted by latest first. 


The first filtered tweet claiming the sinking of the Makarov was made on 3:04 PM CST May 5th. https://twitter.com/aleksandrimus/status/1522306201698152449?s=20&t=DskwNxhzi4VaJPDMtWdbcg

Essentially, there is evidence and counter evidence proving the sink didn't sink up until May 7th when Ukrainian presidential advisor Arestovych claimed the sinking was fake.

That being said, people still think Makarov is sunk.  


#Conclusion


We have learned it is really really hard for OSINT to verify whether ships at sea are operational. Russia is deliberately using fog of war tricks, and Ukraine is too. There are two other ships that could be disguised as the Makarov. However, there are no other ships that were like the Moskva, so it was easier to prove that it sunk.

Erdogan says Turkey 'would not welcome' Finland or Sweden joining NATO

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining the Nato.

“We are currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this,” he said.

“We don’t want to commit a mistake,” he added. “Scandinavian countries are like guesthouses for terrorist organisations. To go even further, they have seats in their parliaments too.”

Erdoğan’s comments were primarily directed at the militant group the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, although they appeared to encompass the communities of Kurdish origin in Scandinavia as a whole.

Accession to Nato requires consensus from all member countries.

Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora, with the community considered to be one of the largest outside of the Middle East. Prominent Swedish citizens of Kurdish origin currently include six members of parliament. The Turkish authorities are yet to provide any evidence for their claims that the parliamentarians in question have links with the PKK or similar groups outside Sweden.

The Kurdish-speaking population of Finland was estimated at just over 15,000 people as of 2020, less than 1% of the population.

Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries. Despite this, Turkey recently decided to withdraw from a scheduled Nato military exercise in Athens in May due to disagreements with Greece.",False,1652454335.0,t3_uoj8gy,t3_uoj8gy,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Under the rules of the sale, the Javelin missiles have to be stored in western Ukraine, which is far from the frontlines of the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the country (the Donbas region) against pro-Russia separatists. 

In short, the Javelins were essentially provided to Ukraine under the condition that they not be used in the conflict zone.""

""A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets river – even though they’ve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down bridges near Severodonetsk.

“The advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,” Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. “We still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.”

Zhdanov says it’s “very important” that his side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets.

Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a bridgehead and advance in the direction of the river’s estuary, Zhdanov explains. This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they attempt to cut off Ukraine’s whole eastern Donbas region.

The order for soldiers to gain this territory came from the very top, Zhdanov adds.

“They are advancing so hard because it is a political task, because Putin has ordered it,” he says.

As we’ve been reporting today, UK defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia has not commented.""

7170dafe3af07ca1ae3bb0bbf7ef3905,uoj8gy,i8f1smc,"What you need to understand is the gain in precision decreases with distance with most artillery ammunition.  Sometimes you can narrow the areal with guided assistance such as from Orlan drones, but basically you're talking about exponentially large dispersion fields the further away you are.  Outside 5-6 km most artillery is utterly useless for hitting a precise target.  Such artillery functions best when it is used en masse to shell an area with hundreds of shells hitting randomly within their scope.  This is Russia's strategy now as it was in the second world war.  So anyone can shoot at any distance; they just have worse chance of hitting after a certain distance.  

But things like PGKs adapt munitions for distance precision.  Fins on the rockets, GPS, etc.  The trade-off is they're expensive.  Dumb ordinance is essentially free, just metal casings and incendiary; guided munitions can be USD 5K - 75K *per shot*.  Canada gave some Excaliburs at $70K each.  You get to hit a target 50km away within a radius of 10m, *or* you can shoot thousands of shells at the same target with a target radius of 300m with an M777 to get the same guarantee at the same price.  It's a choice of strategy and a question of resources.  When people talk about the M777 having a specific range, what they're really saying is beyond such and such a range it isn't worth using.  You could always point and try, but it'd be a crap shoot.  

The expensive, precise munitions Ukraine is being given are one strategy, and Russia's firing at random until everything is leveled is another.  Both can be effective, although obviously one of these methods results in high collateral damage and takes time.  

In reality, the majority of both sides' munitions are of the regular variety.  Ukraine just has this extra option for precision strikes when they think they can afford it and also at the advantage of out-ranging the enemy.  Blowing up a pontoon bridge, for example.  But they aren't likely to use these sorts of tools against individual armored units.  Enemy artillery, perhaps, but not most vehicles.  

So it's more that Ukraine has a limited set of ace cards they can play to hit important targets at distance.  It isn't the bulk of their artillery.",False,1652419957.0,t3_uoj8gy,t1_i8ev8ho,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

The key difference is that the accuracy of their cheap shells drops significantly after about 5 km, at 40 km is already +- 300 m from target. This is why their ideal usage is to achieve high concentration, when you're firing from 300 guns to a village accuracy no longer matters, you're looking to raise to the ground.
Now, in Ukraine they're no achieving the concentration they would like, neither getting as close as they would like.

When the USSR collapsed, it had opposition parties.  It had a freer media than Russia has right now.  It had the looming opportunities of open economic relationships with Europe.  Gorbachev's McDonald's commercial - who would make it today?  It also broke up into states that already existed as political sub-entities.  Same names, same administrations.  They each had a vote in matters of Soviet dissolution.  These are crucial differences.

There were efforts made through generations to ensure unity, and while ex soviet republics had their authonomy that allowed them to break away from the USSR, Russia, as an entity, never had any cracks in society that would breed separatism. 

Ethical majority in Siberia are Russians, those small amount of minorities don't see themselves independent because they live with Russians for generations (as analogy, imagine American Indians would start talking separatism - they don't have own land to claim as own, and they are way too integrated together with other ethnicities to break off). So, ethnical separatism is off the table, imho.

BUT

But saying that all: there is an issue Siberia always had with Moscow. Taxes. All corporation offices were always in Moscow so all petro/gas taxes went to the capital.

People always saw it as unfair and that Moscow is like a vampire. That without Moscow they would be rich regions.

Some corporations ended up moving their offices to Tyumen. But I imagine it still can be a problem, especially now, when Siberia will basically have to feed the war effort.

So, as much as I doubt separatism, there is still a possibility for some discord, which can grow up in who knows what, given the war and economical collapse. 

I guess, we will see

If it does, countries are put in a situation of using nuclear deterrence as a first and not last resort; if they fight a conventional war, win or lose, they will find their territory annexed under threat of nuclear retaliation
 
Ukraine has to call the bluff and the West must support them. I can't even imagine the can of worms opened if China sees ""occupy and threaten nukes"" as a viable expansionist practice. Nobody can accept a world where a nuclear arsenal is carte blanche to annex neighboring countries on the basis of whatever flimsy bullshit the invading regime can spin. Conflicts will immediately turn into games of nuclear chicken, and eventually someone won't turn the wheel in time.

But if Russia *does* make this threat, how could they not carry through with it? Not only would they be shown as wielding an inept conventional military, but unwilling to use their weapon of last resort. But what then? If Russia does use its nuclear arsenal to stop Ukraine from retaking annexed territory, they've crossed every red line NATO countries have set for their own active participation in the conflict.

The ratchet keeps tightening. There is only one off-ramp from escalation, and that is the removal of Putin from power.

Yes that means taking a shit position for either side. It’s the starting point. 

“Give up territory so that Putin will stop” well, that does not imply that Putin would have accepted either as his desire was to take ALL territory. Since ukraine does not like that deal either, they reject.

Think of it like a boxing match. When a fighter gets knocked down, the ref checks with the fighter “do you want to continue? If not this is what it will cost you to stop” 

As the war dynamics changes and the contexts changes, the cost to stop or pause fighting changes. So each time macron reaches out, it’s checking to see if Putin is ready to stop yet, and providing him the means to do so. That doesn’t mean that Ukraine would accept because they don’t necessarily want to stop, so the cost for Putin would now have to change in Ukraine’s favor.

If Russia was steamrolling Ukraine, the idea of ceding territory to stop the fighting would be highly attractive, wouldn’t it?

It seems people who keep referring to Chamberlain don't realize how stupid it is. At that time the war had NOT started and Chamberlain was trying to appease to PREVENT it. Now there is total war and the goal of appeasement is to STOP it. How are these situations comarable? It's not like countries advocating for dialogue are not helping Ukraine anyway

IMO the comparison with WW1 Germany is much better. Complete humiliation of Germany and crazy reparations led to the rise of Nazism and to WW2.

You're not understanding the process.

The Senate is a **slow**, deliberative body. On purpose. They always take a fuck-ton of time. 

It is very, very rare for bills to be passed 'quickly'. You can only pass a bill quickly if all 100-members of the Senate agree to it **before** the debate. 

If even **a single** person brings up a concern, then the full debate process starts. EDIT: Furthermore, Senate debate is **infinite** in scope. All members can take as much time as they like (well, until 60 Senators vote to shut them up). We in the USA like to say... ""The Senate is where bills go to die"", because these guys always take so long to debate ...

> and he would just sign executive orders

Executive orders are the things that Presidents can do without consulting Congress.

But Congress controls the money of the country. The President can only do things with the money he was already given by Congress.

------

The Ukrainian aid was asked to be passed by May 19th. President Biden is confident that he has enough money to keep helping Ukraine until then (maybe a little bit past then actually). This $40,000,000,000 aid package being delayed till May 19th, or even later, probably won't affect any plans.

There were $Billion+ bills passed weeks ago to help out Ukraine until now (as I'm sure you've heard of the many M777 weapons and other equipment we sent in). This bill is a longer-term effort. There's no rush, because... well... so much money is still available in Biden's pocket that there's no need to worry (yet).

The last few bills were 100-0, ""unanimous"" from the Senate. That's why Ukraine got so much money and so much aid so quickly over the past few weeks. The $40,000,000,000 package is a bit bigger, and Rand Paul wants to be the ""bad guy"" to initiate a full debate, rather than just rubber stamping it through ""quickly"" again.

-------

It only takes 1 senator to force a debate on any issue. That so much aid got to Ukraine without debate is already unprecedented. Still, Rand Paul has said some rather... pro-Russian things before. I'm not surprised he's the one asking for a full debate.

I'm guessing the $40-billion aid package passes 90+ to 10, at least. Maybe 95 to 5 when its all said and done. The USA is overall very unified on this, but this $40-billion number is bigger than all the other aid packages put together. Its only natural that some people are worried about the money.",1652484031.0,1652483608.0,t3_uoj8gy,t1_i8ifs7w,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

No one seems to know for sure what’s going on but they have severe capital controls on using foreign currency.  Specifically they are forcing 80% of foreign income to be converted to Rubles, a lot of currency previously was converted to Rubles, the interest rates made the Ruble very attractive and ultimately they probably burned through foreign reserves in order to prop it up.  Plus they essentially froze selling for foreigners on their stock exchange.  So basically a lot of restrictions on activities which make the MOEX and Ruble look good.  

I’d like to point out that a strong Ruble is awful for Russians that need to convert dollars to Rubles.  If I make $1 and it only buys 65 Rubles instead of 140 like in Feb/March, that means I have 75 less Rubles than before.  Meanwhile bread used to cost 50 Rubles and now it’s 70 Rubles.  So the inflation is there for everyone but the currency deflating hurts anyone being paid in dollars.

The question is whether this can continue…that we don’t know.  It does seem they’re on track for the worst economic decline in decades at -12% at best for 2022 and 2023 will also be a decline.  Many expect this number to be even higher as countries continue to disconnect from the Russian economy.  

So basically, we’ll see.  Signs point to a lot of long term pain for Russia but they may not be feeling all of it right now.

As long as it can be rotated precisely, and things like muzzle velocity are known values, it's basically just a big dumb rod with an explodey bit at one end. If it takes the calibre of artillery shell you have available, it's essentially much of a muchness which you use. The only thing that really makes a difference is that better howitzers have a longer lifespan before the barrel wears and deforms. There's some consideration for accuracy, but a smaller area of likely hits (the CEP) is factored by the ammunition and other variables too.

The things that make it effective from day 1 are the aiming and targeting systems, and good ammunition.

Ukraine has *excellent* artillery targeting systems, possibly right now they are the world-leader, consider that the US is likely watching their successes with it *very* closely because it's a radical departure from traditional Western artillery command. They've done for artillery what Uber did for taxi services - highly digital, highly decentralised, highly connected. 

As for ammunition, they also now have stuff like the Excalibur shells which can be aimed in flight, and they're switching to newer, and generally superior NATO standard ammunition. The deal is that Ukraine has a lot of howitzers but they're all in 152mm Soviet calibre. Nobody really makes ammunition for that except Russia... who actually maybe just have huge stockpiles and terrible new output. So, once they're out of 152mm ammo in Ukraine, that's it. What they need are lots of new howitzers, as many as possible, in 155mm NATO, the ammunition that can be supplied to them.

Better ones will last longer or give a marginally smaller CEP, but they don't need German OR US howitzers, they need German AND US howitzers and indeed any others they can get too.",False,1652462097.0,t3_uoj8gy,t1_i8h0s56,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

*Kallas fundamentally rejects the idea that an end to the conflict should be sought at any price. “I think what everybody has to understand is that peace is not an ultimate goal if it means that the aggression pays off,” she says. “What I mean by this is that when you say ‘OK, let it be peace and everybody stays where they are’, it still means that Russia has taken a big part of Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine being a sovereign, independent country. So it means that aggression really pays off.” If this happens, she adds, it will only be a matter of time until Putin acts again: “If Russia is not punished for what they are doing, then there will be a pause of one, two years, and then everything will continue: the atrocities, the human suffering, everything.” She adds that it will not just be Ukraine at risk of an emboldened Putin.*

None of the armband games played by Russia have ever been successful, not even the Russians claim a win using that tactic. Part of the reason for this is Ukraine has been incredibly successful with using shibboleths the instant they suspect something odd, which is the benefit of many Ukrainians speaking Russian but almost no Russians speaking Ukrainian.

Macron is Putin's off ramp, that's his role in all this.  If and when Putin throws in the towel, it will be Macron taking that call.  Putin wants out, he's been saying so to Macron.  Otherwise why would Putin discuss this offer?  If he was really in it for the long haul why would he consider a negotiated peace?  

Zelenskyy's way too smart, and disciplined, and in tune with others to just talk shit like some mean girl in a random interview.  The way I see it, Zelenskyy let this go in the interview not to spar with Macron, but to be the bearer of bad news to Putin so Macron doesn't have to.  Preserving one good (OKish) relationship with Putin is what the Allies need to bring this to a close.  The endgame gets much more tricky without it. 

Macron is string betting.  He's dangling carrots out there for Putin to test his reaction, which must have been very, very favorable.  So favorable in fact that the only way you put the breaks on it was for Zelenskyy to publicly take a fat steaming dump on one of his allies and also to low key insult Putin in the same breath.

No, it had to happen since Italy can't become energetically independent from Russia yet, but it's there regardless. One of the major parties in the parliament received money from Russia some time ago, this means there's like 3 more that did and never got caught.

Edit: i didn't watch the news today, make it 2 obviously pro Russian parties.

Public opinion is really split on the matter and the parliament is the weakest (politically, not literally) it's been in a long time, with that power being held by the best PM in also a long time.

IIRC the Black Sea submarine fleet consists entirely of Kilo-Class subs, so if they're speaking the truth all of their subs are probably capable of underwater VLS missile attacks. The Kilo-class can spend almost two weeks submerged, so in theory they'd never have to surface to carry out an attack and RTB.

2. Finland doesn't want Karelia back, Poland and Prussia don't want Konigsberg back, and Moldova don't want Transnistria back. That's because the Soviets deported all the previous inhabitants of those regions and replaced them with ethnic Russians, which means that reclaiming those territories would involve assimilating rural Russians, who are, culturally, mediaeval peasants, into liberal democracies.
3. Geopolitically, Ukraine will emerge from this war stronger, whereas Russia will emerge from it weaker. The longer the war goes on, the stronger this effect is. The Ukrainian people are suffering, but a Ukrainian victory will be far more effective than a NATO victory in reshaping Ukraine's future.
3. Putin is not playing the game that the West is playing. He is a mediaeval king, extracting riches from a peasantry that genuinely needs the protection of a warlord. He started and won the Second Chechen War to demonstrate his capability as a ruler. This is one of the key sources of his legitimacy. Winning a war is the mediaeval king's equivalent of a modern politician winning an election. Russia being defeated by NATO would be a far lesser humiliation than Russia being defeated by Ukraine. The pretenders to the throne are already plotting their accessions. It is not enough for the Russian Army to give in and go home. Putin's *casus belli* is imperial restoration; a simple defeat and capitulation will only strengthen this idea in the Russian people (*e.g.* Germany after WWI). Putin's imperial project can only be achieved by the spiritual defeat of the Russian people (*e.g.* Germany after WWII).

I've never heard of the term ""Keynesian narrative"", but I guess it has to do with Keynes book on the Versailles treaty in which he claims the peace was unjust, economically unsound for the whole of Europe and would lead to resentment in Germany and cause the country to seek revenge. 

1. The economy of Germany was destroyed the first years after the war. Big unemployment, huge war debts which had to be repaid caused hyper inflation. Hard to see anyone saying the Versailles treaty had nothing to do with this economic crisis. It took a turn for the better first when they got favorable loans from foreign countries towards the middle of the twenties. 1928 when the economy was ok the votes went to parties in the middle. 
2. 1929 the economy went down again in Germany, but this was hardly Germany's fault as the great depression started in US and then spread around the world and especially to Europe. 
3. But the humiliation of the Versailles treaty was certainly not only, and I would argue not even primarily, because of the debts Germany was forced to pay. It was all the conditions on how big military could be, the land they lost, that France could occupy parts of Germany if the treaty wasn't followed and that Germany had to take sole responsibility (with her allies) for the war. Now historians argue on how harsh it really was (I think the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty Germany made Russia sign in 1918 was harsher) and how important it was for the rise of the Nazis. But it certainly had some impact and Hitler and the Nazis often brought it up and used it to get the German people to unite behind them.

To sum it up; Germany did not f up their own economy in the interwar period and historians believe the Versailles treaty had some impact on the rise of the Nazis although it is a still continuing discussion how much.",False,1652467776.0,t3_uoj8gy,t1_i8h64nw,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

There's the NATO-establishing, '[Washington Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm)' which states, Article 8:  
> Each Party declares that none of the international engagements now in force between it and any other of the Parties or any third State is in conflict with the provisions of this Treaty, and undertakes not to enter into any international engagement in conflict with this Treaty.  
  
IANAL, but I read this to mean, ""you could join NATO, Finland, but we wouldn't invoke Article 5 if you're already in an international conflict."" So the main reason you're joining would be voided if Russia were to attack before joining.  
  
There's also the '[Study on NATO Enlargement](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_24733.htm), which has the following:  
> 5: New members, at the time that they join, must commit themselves, as all current Allies do on the basis of the Washington Treaty, to:  
> > unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security; settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations

It's now used by extension to refer to words or phrases that will be mispronounced by an out-group, or even to references they won't understand. So for example, in the Pacific theater of WWII, when Japanese spies would pretend to be American or Filipino military personnel, the sentries at check points would have unrecognized people say ""lollapalooza"" as a test.

Looking it up on Wikipedia, the shibboleth they're apparently using in Ukraine is паляниця (IPA: pɐlʲɐˈnɪt͡sʲɐ, pronunciation respelling: pah-lyah-NIH-tsyah), which the Russians pronounce more like IPA [pɐlʲɪˈnʲit͡sə] (pa-lih-NEE-tsuh). The three differences:

* Pronouncing <и> /i/ like in Russian, rather than something closer to Russian <ы>

The US, for better or worse, absolutely smells blood in the water.  Their longest geopolitical foe has made an unforced, disastrous error, and they sense an opportunity to make it a fatal one at absolutely rock-bottom prices, as far as geopolitics go.

They will continue to give Ukraine as much military aid as they need to continue to grind the Russian army into the dirt, and if you haven't been paying attention, once the US decides to pick a side in a conflict, there's very little ANYONE can do to dissuade it.

$40 billion in aid is roughly worth 7 years of Ukraine's annual defense budget.

It's like half of Russia's entire annual defense budget.  That is a staggering amount of money, and the US can literally just casually toss it in because its economy absolutely dwarfs both of them.  The F-35 cost TRILLIONS.  $40 billion to utterly destroy one of the two nations it was designed to fight off is thrift-store cheap.

Zelensky, frankly, doesn't really need any of Europe's permission at this point to keep fighting, no matter how much it's appreciated and he's made that clear that he values their help.

This is very naive.  There is no guarantee of that at all, and in fact I think that the fallout of this war will likely bring decades of turmoil to pretty much all of Europe and basically any country that borders Russia, which is a lot.

I agree that the west is obligated to help Ukraine, a fledgling democracy, from Russia, but the fact you think we are better off, as well as your characterization of war in your comment, really just leads me to believe you are the exact type of person I was mentioning in my comment who don't have the background geopolitical knowledge to even begin to comprehend the direction the world takes from here, especially as it seems there is a real possibility Russia may not even exist as a Eurasian nation anymore.

The  Flying Tigers were organized while the US was neutral but took 7 months to get operational, so they entered combat after the US entered the war, flying for China against Japan. They expanded to 200 fighters and 66 light bombers.

American, Canadian British (and those of 12 other nationalities) veteran pilots were recruited by Israel to create an Air Force to aid in the fight against Arab forces in 1948. 70 % of the flyers were foreign.

Edit: Yep diesel is above $2L in Aus. But still the difference in 91 petrol is huge. I guess NZ is a bit further away, but $1.20L difference.......",1652424328.0,1652424003.0,t3_uoj8gy,t1_i8f63k1,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

So they tried to spearhead into Kiyv and take out the government as fast as possible. That didn't work as initially planned so Russian command had to make a decision. Double down and send in new troops (which they did have ready near the borders) or retreat and refocus efforts on more sustainable objectives in the east.

They did that, they started pulling back their units on the edges. The Ukrainians started pushing forward into these spaces.

Their original plans were too optimistic and didn't take into account a prolonged slugfest of a fight. So their logistics was inadequate to begin with. Resupplying was very difficult too and made harder by pro-active Ukrainian SF units laying down ambushes behind enemy lines. All while they'd already taken a brutal beating. Russians did have reinforcing BTG's ready near the border but decided against throwi g those away too.


So the Russians announced on the 25th of march (1 day after that article) that they ""would start focussing on Donbass"". Since their army group on the northern front started retreating soon after that. 
You can take it from me that they had been planning the retreat. Like actually planning the operation for a bit of time. Hell, NATO battalion level operational planning (country dependant) can take a week, and this was like two levels up. 

Operational planning on that level is not done overnight. Army group size... I wouldn't be surprised if they started 2 weeks in advance. Why? Because a properly planned out operation is insanely detailed and complicated. I know enough about such processes to confidently estimate that.

So it's my assessment that the Russians started working towards and creating the conditions required for a proper retreat. Logistics starts getting ready. Analyses are being made. Smaller units spread out on far east and west flanks start to getting pulled inward toward the main force to prevent becoming isolated later on.

Russians on the edges of west and east flanks start drawing back. Ukrainians move in in the abandoned positions to take back their land while claiming to having liberated the villages for morale and propaganda purposes (sensible, as any army would do).

The problem is that even the most trusted correspondent is a mere witness whose memory and perceptions affect the reliability of the stories they tell. Not everything is on video or picture, and even you agree that visual media evokes an emotional response but doesn't always tell the entire tale. It can be reframed, put into different contexts, or even be misleading (see: Russian media showing TB2 video of the attack on Snake Island and saying it was Russian forces attacking). There's very little that is objective truth, and even our own senses deceive us. Ask a Russian about this story and they'll probably say Ukrainians did it or it never happened at all - even if it's on video.

My entire point on pressing you wasn't to say you're wrong, because frankly I agree that we shouldn't take tweets like these as fact. I do think you should be more aware as to what standards you personally hold evidence to. As humans, we can draw inferences and conclusions about the likelihood these things happened, even if we don't have a Richard Engel showing us video of things he saw. Eyewitness accounts, evidence of other confirmed atrocities in Bucha, evidence of rape and murder of children in other parts of Ukraine, plus a historical pattern and practice of rape and civilian violence as a terror tactic are the reasons I think this is more likely true than not. We will eventually learn all about what happened, and you'll probably get your wish for pics or video - but even then that won't tell the entire story. 

ETA: Even Shireen's death is subject to question despite the media evidence. Israel says she was caught in Palestinian crossfire, witnesses say it's *more likely* she was killed by IDF.

They haven’t made it in. You have to understand that the odds of them getting in are slim. But if they do get in, you really have to understand that they’d better have a 100,000 \[soldiers\].
