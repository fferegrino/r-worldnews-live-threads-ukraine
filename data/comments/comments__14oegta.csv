“The previous week was full of captures, in fact, prisoners were taken. This day is unremarkable – only 1 prisoner, but there were also 8-10 prisoners per day.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-02-23/index.html

""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he's afraid to lose bipartisan support from the United States, following what he called ""dangerous messages coming from some Republicans.""

“Mike Pence has visited us, and he supports Ukraine. First of all, as an American, and then as a Republican,” Zelensky said in a news conference with Spanish media in Kyiv on Saturday. “We have bipartisan support. However, there are different messages in their circles regarding support for Ukraine. There are messages coming from some Republicans, sometimes dangerous messages, that there may be less support.”

Zelensky said that regardless of who wins the next US Presidential election, maintaining bipartisan support is ""the most important thing for Ukraine.""

During the same news conference, Zelensky was asked if he fears for his own life, to which he replied that he thinks ""it is more dangerous for Putin"" due to the Russian president's growing number of international adversaries.

Some background: The topic of whether the US should continue aiding Ukraine against Russia's invasion has created a rift among the Republican party.

GOP presidential candidates are split into two camps: Isolationists, particularly former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who believe the US is too involved in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to fend off the Russian invasion; and hawks, including several former Trump administration officials, who argue for an even more aggressive posture toward Russia. Both sides are warning that if their positions aren’t heeded, a world war could follow.""",False,1688298122.0,t3_14oegta,t3_14oegta,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

Wounded soldiers are supposed to be stabilised and sent to the nearest military field hospital. After triage, hey are meant to be sent to regional hospitals in the occupied territories or in Russia, depending on the severity of their injuries.

3/ In practice, only officers are reportedly sent back to Russia; soldiers and NCOs are being treated within Ukraine. Particularly since the Ukrainian counter-offensive began, medical facilities there are so overwhelmed that schools and kindergartens are being used as hospitals.

4/ Even within Russia, hospitals are overwhelmed by injured men. Russia's decript health care system is a further obstacle: there are no computers, everything is done by hand and it reportedly takes 45-60 minutes to deal with each man. There is no digitisation of records.

Right now, both Russia and Ukraine say that the ZNPP will be sabotaged. 

On July 5th, the Ukrainian staff in the ZNPP will have finished evacuating. The sabotage will happen on or after that date. 

The sabotage will likely either be blamed on the evacuating Ukrainian engineers or it will be blamed on the Ukrainians who waited until after the evacuation. Even though obviously it is Russia who will do the sabotaging. 

During the sabotage, there will likely be a hydrogen explosion that will contaminate the local area and the river. This means the flooded parts of Kherson will turn radioactive. 

The Ukrainians in the bridgehead near Kherson will likely retreat back over the river since it will become radioactive. 

This explosion won't be a meltdown though. Instead the nuclear rods will be largely intact. However the cooling pools will probably evaporate. This will cause Reactor Number 5 to meltdown within 72 hours. Reactor Number 5 is currently the only reactor in hot shutdown. The other five reactors are in cold shutdown, and have 5-7 days before they meltdown. 

The sabotage explosion will likely create numerous leaks in the cooling pools, destroy the water pump system, and turn the immediate area very radioactive. This will make refilling the pools more difficult. 

Ukraine and its international supporters will have 72 hours to prevent the meltdown, or things will become much worse.",False,1688320202.0,t3_14oegta,t3_14oegta,,0,-33,0,-33,0,0,

If we take a look back at the last half year, we rightfully concluded that Russia is a spend force - their offensive capabilities have more or less been exhausted.

Russia is right now still holding the line, but taking heavy losses in multiple places, and their supply chains are being heavily targeted.

Russia, especially under Putin, has been intentionally stovepiped and siloed.  Power is never really centralized in one area or collaborative group (such as the military), as that risks one side being able to wrest control and keep it.  Thus, every part of the government has been Balkanized.   (As an example, internal security and intelligence isn't just under the FSB, but also with the GRU, portions of the MoD, private forces, etc.).   Adding to the mix are oligarchs and their money, who also stand to gain or lose by choosing sides.   With that fractionalized support, it means you have to be able to get all of those pieces of the puzzle behind you.   If you have a 100-piece puzzle, a bit easier.   But if you have one of those 1000-piece puzzles that are identically cut and without a border, it's a harder proposition.  On top of that, there's the possibility that if you don't have enough support, you and your supporters are going to get curb-stomped once you show your hand.  That's the main reason why Putin's regime has been relatively stable.

As far as Priggers goes, it could have been two things.   Maybe he saw enough support in circles that he dealt with (or got assurances from his buddies, etc.) that he figured he had a square chance at being able to increase his stake enough to either overthrow or take over portions of that puzzle, or take over outright.

Quite a bit. If they continue to lose equipment at the current rate, they can probably sustain the war effort for another 12-18 months at least.

> can their industry keep up with the rate of losses they are suffering?

Not currently. But they have some time still to adapt. It was recent news that Uralvagonzavod, the (only) company that produces Russian tanks, has switched away from all other forms of production to fully focus on tanks.

I think previously their output [has been estimated](https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/how_many_tanks_a_month_russian_uralvagonzavod_can_produce_really-5921.html) at 20 tanks per month, plus 8 refurbished. There are some other plants owned by the Ministry of Defense in Russia that can each refurbish up to 17 tanks per month, which have to draw from old stock. 

It's unclear how much they can ramp up production at this stage. But I think we should assume that Russia will do whatever they can to at least match tank losses. Now that they are on the defensive, they won't really have so much need of tanks to begin with, and I think currently they are losing them at a rate of about 100-150 a month. 

So they would need a big step up in production to match that rate. Especially as the supply of tanks to be refurbished continues to dwindle, though satellite counts suggest they have anywhere between 1000-1500 relatively modern tanks left that could be refurbished. Still - we must assume that as Russia continues to takes steps towards a full war economy they still have room for improvement in this area.

As for all the other equipment.. I haven't seen any good estimates for that. Apparently artillery barrel production is also an issue for them, but they have a lot more artillery in stock than they have tanks.

At the rate things are going however, I would wager that the Russian government is going to run out of money before they run out of equipment.",False,1688319408.0,t3_14oegta,t1_jqej1be,,1,25,0,25,0,0,

>Answer:

>Given the fact that the Polish leadership today 
The answer: Taking into account the fact that the Polish leadership today is made up only of patent degenerates, the request to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland threatens only one thing. Such weapons will be used. Finally, to the delight of all the crazies (even with the understanding that the final decision will be made by the morons across the ocean).

It absolutely wouldn’t matter to the apathetic Russian population, they never believed they had a say anyway. And they live in a Truth-less existence. What’s another lie?

1. Republicans in general (56%) are supportive of the US assistance to Ukraine.
2. Republican Senators are almost unanimously supportive of Ukraine, and the majority of House Republicans are as well. So any anti-US assistance to Ukraine would result in public shaming of House Republicans.

But there's also another problem:

* When Biden was faced with responding to Russia's invasion, he chose to take the perspective that this is a European conflict and Europe should be leading the way in deciding how to handle the conflict. The EU+UK's economy is similar in size to the US, they've got nukes and jets and all manner of advanced Western weapons. Even if the US dropped all support for Ukraine, the EU has more than enough capacity to make up the difference.

One more thing:

* Trump's re-election is likely slim at this point. After being indicted for federal crimes, regarding his treatment of classified information, his support is declining. It's more likelly that Pence or DeSantis gets wins the ticket. So if Biden loses, the US will have a more 'traditionally' conservative president.

I think what Putin wants at this point is for Ukraine to be unable to reclaim significant territory from Russia and for the current battle lines to remain static for years, until Ukraine exhausts either their supply of troops or the equipment they need to attack effectively.  He wants western equipment to get destroyed, and for NATO to decide it's not worth sending more, and then for the current contact line to be the new defacto border.

Russia seems to be mostly succeeding at holding off Ukrainian attacks or slowing their advances to a crawl, and the longer this goes on the more elaborate their defenses and minefields will be.  On the other hand, I think Russia is losing equipment and troops at an unsustainable rate, and Ukraine keeps getting more and better weapons to replace what they're losing.

I'd also argue that the cost of doing nothing and allowing Russia free reign to conquer its neighbors would have done as much or more to encourage dictators and developing countries to get nukes.  In a world where the strong are allowed to conquer the weak with impunity due to the threat of nuclear weapons, what do you think regionally strong countries are going to do?  What do you think countries like China or Iran are going to do knowing they can militarily expand as much as they want so long as they threaten nukes?  What do you think weaker countries who want to defend themselves from strong neighbors are going to do?  Allowing an expansionist Russia is a trigger for a world-wide nuclear arms race.  Then every tin-pot dictator on the globe with historical grudges or delusions of grandeur will have them or start seeking them.

It's scary either way.  Inaction is at least as scary as action.  The best case scenario is that the U.S. support Ukraine while not allowing the war to escalate towards nukes or expanding into other countries, and that Ukraine wins, while Russia either stays together (Either under Putin, or a different leader), or if it does balkanize, does so in a way that the U.S. and the west can use economic and diplomatic incentives to help denuclearize or democratize (As it did successfully when the Soviet Union balkanized).

At the time, Russia had annexed Crimea with no repercussions whatsoever (aside from a few sanctions), and there was no concept of western weapons going to Ukraine except to fight as an insurgency (the public plan by the US at the time). The most helpful intervention offered in the first few days was evacuation of Zelenskyy, which he (badassedly) declined. At the same time, Russia was zooming past civilian centres and heading straight for Zelenskyy/Ukrainian parliament, with plenty of footage of underresourced Ukrainians getting out of the way (eg the border guard running from the Russian blitz, some of the earliest footage we had).

Nobody could have predicted Russia fucking up so badly or their military being so eroded, and nobody predicted how well the Ukrainians would dig in after a series of major fuck-ups by Russia. *Then* the weapons started being offered, but at the time Russia had an easy walk into Ukraine who had fuck-all support from anyone else (but Russia rushed far too hard, lost some key battles and got fucked up when they tried to reinforce their blitz).

Blaming the west/politicians was due to the limpwristed response to Crimea (also Georgia, Moldova etc.) that enabled Russia to fully invade a number of years later with a far superior army. And when it happened, it was crickets from everyone (politicians) other than stern words and sanctions.

Even now the west is dragging its feet (F16s could have been roaming the skies months ago), however Ukraine has more than proven itself. It wasn't until Ukraine showed resistance that Russia started mowing down civilian centres for the sake of it.

Pistorius and Blaszczak made a deal two months ago for that. Two plants were to be built in Gliwice and Poznan, being a joint venture by KMW, Rheinmetall and PGZ \[Polish Armament group\]. Germany said 'We'll pay for the repairs of all the Leopard 2 tanks.'. The response of the PGZ was 'Aight. We'll charge whatever we want then. A problem analysis will cost 100k then and we take NO responsibility for the reparations.' to which the response was 'Bruh. A problem analysis costs 12k and the company doing the reputation usually \[always\] takes responsibility.'

So Pistorius is in a shit position, thanks to the PiS party. He's under pressure as those tanks are vital for Ukraine but he also can't yield to Poland's outlandish demands, otherwise he'll come under fire at home for getting pulled over the barrel.

> A combination of homophobia and anti-globalism within the alt-right has produced the concept of ""globohomo"", a variant of ""Cultural Marxism"" alleging that media and business elites seek to impose a homogeneous ""uniculture"" on the world, and to weaken populations by promoting feminism, sexual freedom, gender fluidity, liberalism, and immigration. ""Globohomo"" stands in for global neoliberalism, which is believed to be responsible for replacing a diversity of local cultures (especially white, Western culture) with generic consumerism.

The story continues to be interesting because you have to speculate or use your imagination to fill in the gaps. It's like a book that's missing an important chapter.

Pringles was not particularly shy when making angry public proclamations, so I am guessing that his private conversations with Russian administration and officials were far more intense. 

If anyone in Russia was formulating a plot against Putin, Pringles must have drawn their attention. I guessing (again) that during the last few months he came across a group that had ""a plan.""

Pringles ""March to Moscow"" seems odd by itself, but would make perfect sense if it was part of a larger plot.

EDIT: In other words, it almost seems like Pringles was *expecting something to happen* on his march to Moscow. This could be a planned assassination, an uprising, a mass resignation, or something equally important. When, whatever it was, did not happen, he folded.

But when the advertisers started coming back in 2012 the corporate execs in the organizations do what corporate execs do everywhere when they see the profit line increase, started congratulating themselves and figuring out what their bonuses should be.

In a world where we have infinite information at our fingertips it’s weird to legitimately “not know” but if western journalists and commentators had leaned into the uncertainty instead of leaning into “inevitable Russian occupation” I legitimately think more aid would have come sooner and many lives would have been saved. Hell even if HIMARS had arrived just one month sooner Sevredonetsk and Lyschansk could potentially have been saved and many of Ukraine’s best troops that were lost early in the war would be working on the counteroffensive right now meanwhile Russia’s logistics and defenses also would be weaker.

The view that Ukraine wouldn’t resist ended up getting people killed and we are still seeing the consequences of that today.

The problem is, though, that thousands of experts and non experts are claiming all kinds of different things for different reasons.

If he said so, did Milley say this to push allies to send more aid? to spread misinformation to Russia? To temper expectations because you should always underpromise and overdeliver? Because if he's right then it's good he was being cautious, and if he's wrong then it doesn't matter since the success will speak for itself?

Or is it because he truly believes it to be true? In which case the question becomes, does his belief reflect reality? He's probably better informed than most of us, but even then he's been wrong before, and as a general you must assume the more pessimistic scenario's, because if you're an optimist and it doesn't come true that's problematic.

I don’t know about you, but there will be too many dead Russians by the end of 2024 for anyone thinking about ‘stopping’. There’s no going back what there was before. This isn’t some liberal hippie fantasy where if things stop everything will turn out flowers and peace. 

If you noticed, a lot of European countries have decided to use Ukraine as an excuse to remilitarize. All those weapons and increased capacity to used those weapons isn’t going to go away. The Western military industrial complex is invested. To say that it’s only the U.S. and Britain that is pushing is silly. Europe have found their own reasons, and the worse Russia is hurt, the more reason they have not to back down.

Russia either has to scale back its plans (which it probably is doing since they've barely gained ground from their first major push from east to west) or admit that they've failed to meet their objectives.

Russia was always going to steamroll Ukraine to some extent but they've ran out of puff and had to dig deep. Mining your own territory (annexed) isn't a sign of someone that intends to keep pushing.

In my opinion, I don't think Ukraine will succeed in reclaiming all territory. Russia will be ethnically cleansing all captured regions (evidence by Mariupol and apartments given for imported Russians just like Crimea). It will come to a point where Ukraine will only be trying to liberate land in name only, there'll be very little Ukrainian culture/ethnicity left.

So at some point Ukraine will need to cede these territories to Russia and look for a peace deal. Although, Russia will undoubtedly demand unrealistic conditions.

Jfk could invoke whatever he wants as justification for blockading the USSR but he wouldn't be able to go saying ""Monroe Doctrine"" in a war.

""The USSR might nuke us from Cuba"" is a hell of a lot not of a reason to give up a soldiers life than any 1800s foreign policy document.

As I said at the start, war is **politics**, and if you're asking people to give up their lives you'll need a pretty good reason.

You need to give people a *reason* to be willing to risk their lives no matter the country, no matter the time period. 

Russia's reasoning is, well, bullshit. Transparently so, ""die in Ukraine because the US blockaded Cuba in the 60s"" is not the hallmark of a sane human being.
