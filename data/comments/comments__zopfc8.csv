Day 298 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another pretty quiet day for us with no missile or drone strikes, or at least it was quiet up until now. Just recently an air raid alert was triggered for most of the country, because Iranian drones are in flight right now and we are unsure where they are headed. There are reports saying that at least one Shahed has made it to the Kyiv oblast, so they might be targeting Kyiv again.  

They have been launching those drones at us since around 11pm, and they are still doing it more than 3 hours later. Though thankfully I don’t think even a single drone has made it to its target as of yet, at this point our air defense is really good at dealing with Shaheds, so they very rarely manage to hit their intended targets. 

Unlike here in Kharkiv, it wasn’t quiet at all in Belgorod today, as our forces were hitting some targets around it, and it looks like one of the missiles was intercepted and fell inside the city, though most of the missiles did make it to their target. I’m actually not sure what was used in this attack, because aftermath doesn’t quite look like it was from a Tochka-U. Russians were saying that AGM-88 HARM was used, because they apparently found its fragments, but I don’t think they posted any photos of them.

They have very little of what we see as Kremlin-issued propaganda, and near nothing from any perspective outside of Russia. Mostly just death announcements, production announcements, etc. 

Even so, the comments sections absolutely massacre their leadership with mockery—not just the trite “everything going according to plan, eh shoigu?” but the daily announcements of investments in a new weapon, new factory, or a newly occupied territory—meanwhile they live in dumps, they say. 

One piece had Peskov saying laughably ridiculous things—that won’t be annexing Odessa or ‘Chernigov’ because the new territories of Russia are now occupied and must be liberated and there is the focus”—which is so preposterous that even the Russians can’t stop laughing. (“Maybe they’re not Russian.” “What other territories will become part of Russia, but are still occupied?”)  Or that plots in Crimea will be given as rewards to servicemen—“whose plots? The ones our fleeing Russians can’t sell? Or the ones Ukrainians will take back? Or, lemme guess, you only give them to fallen soldiers, and they’re nontransferrable.”

This week, this random newspaper did run a version of an international story of Zelensky’s 3-pt Peace plan.  

Under the comment section, top comments were:
> look how competent Zelensky is, and how incompetent our ""leaders"" are.  and it is with our tacit consent that we have such rulers. more precisely, they have us

ISW believes that there is a continued and growing divide between the DNR and the Wagner Group.

They wasted their resources by frontally attacking the city, most notably at Opytne and East. Even Russian propagandists are getting dismayed. 1/7


Their local gain at Yakovlivka, which should have been their main thrust in order to be successful, comes way too late to make a difference. Ukrainian troops still control the areas north of this town and reinforcements from Kherson are positioning. 2/7

Moreover, they already falter at the southern part of this operation and even fall back, which emphasized once more how obsessed Russians are with Bakhmut itself. They want it so badly that it will be their undoing, as I predicted it. 3/7

Which brings me back to what I was assuming in the beginning of this offensive on Bakhmut. 
Russians had to muster considerable forces and resource to launch an operation of this magnitude and they fail by every metric. Time is basically up. 4/7

So in order to quote Mike Ehrmantraut:

Here's what's gonna happen:

Russians will continue to run like lemmings against Bakhmut maybe even taking a few parts in the east and south, up to a total halt. Then, Ukrainians gonna dislodge them. One by one, mercilessly. 5/7

In the meantime we will see the next major Ukrainian counteroffensive happening, I guess it will start in January and it will go until March. I'm fairly sure where it will take place, without saying it directly, but I left enough bread crumbs in my feed to point it out. 6/7

This counteroffensive will be for Russians devastatingly worse than anything they have experienced before in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliya or Kherson. It will break their neck when it comes their moral. The Russian military will be standing TKO. 

Then comes the Endgame! 7/7

300be0d91722518a684ba16013b786b5,zopfc8,j0pctiy,"- On one of the directions, the collective solyanka from a bunch of different formations had to replace the rifle company for the night. The task is to keep the defense against the so-called ""meat waves"".

- Wagner's group drives hundreds of prisoners, who were recruited in Russian prisons, directly to the positions of the Ukrainian military. They don't count casualties, so putting 10, 50, 100 or more people just running around in a matter of minutes is not a problem for them.

- This partly resembles the tactics of the First World War, partly - the Second, and specifically - the methods of the Soviet army under the leadership of military commander Zhukov. Enemy positions are simply pelted with meat — thus depleting the enemy's ammunition and weapon resources.

- If you don't have anything to shoot - you're out of ammo or your rifle is out of order - they win because they chase more and more people.

- The first two waves started at night. They weren't too long, I only used two magazines for the FN FAL rifle. In such a situation, you don't even see who you're shooting at - you just fire in the direction of the concentration of enemy forces. The first wave was repelled in a couple of minutes. The second also.

- The third started in the morning and turned out to be unexpectedly difficult.

- In about 10-15 minutes, I used up almost the entire supply of 7.62×51 cartridges. The rifle heated up and smoked from all the cracks, it began to wedge - two cartridges were jammed in the chamber at the same time, and the third one went halfway out of the magazine. I barely had time to recharge and dig out the stuck.

- AKs of my comrades were also wedged - for such intensity, all this good is clearly not very calculated. If the FN FAL, even smeared with clay, continued to work anyway, the AK-74 in the nearby trench was so flooded that it could not even be disassembled

- The battle lasted almost an hour - in the end, the wave broke, not a single mercenary ran to our positions. For some reason, they didn't even shoot at us - they just ran through the forest, and we tried not to let them get too close

- Two bodies of Wagner prison recruits lay near the trenches. I don't know how they ended up there - either someone dragged them out of the forest to search, or they just ran so hard that they didn't notice the trenches and were killed there.

- One of them looks to be about 60+ years old, his equipment and clothes are extremely poor. This is not surprising, considering the number of people thrown to the meat by Wagnerites.

- Later, Russian LNG units started shooting at the positions — the shells whistled piercingly right at us above our heads and fell somewhere far behind our backs.

- We were lucky, and none of the calculations hit, and later they were suppressed by our mortars. Perhaps the Russians were aiming somewhere else, but for hitting tanks or mortars in the rear, we would see a canopy fire, not a direct aim.

- I can't say whether it was bad learning of LNG calculations or some cunning plan. The last time I went through something similar, the local commander encouraged me with the following words: welcome to the infantry!

- Infantry is the backbone of any army, and the better it performs, the more successful any ground operation will be. The shooters face the most difficult tests and the harshest conditions. Cold, wet, clay, the need to act boldly and quickly.

- At last I got so tired that I began to see houses behind the trees that were not there; in the intertwining of the branches he discovered forms similar to animals and human faces, and towards the end the sky, visible between the branches, turned into a colored mosaic in pastel tones.

- Commanders, especially artillery commanders, have to shake things up from time to time, hear the whistling of shells and explosions of mines nearby, shoot in all directions and hide in a hole.

- This will sober you up a bit and force you to treat your work more responsibly, because artillery tasks on the third line can be relaxing. You can forget what war is, if you don't visit ground zero for a long time. There, I immediately understood the value of infantry fire support

- And I was also convinced by practical experience of the convenience and pleasure of using the FN FAL rifle. It is a pleasure to fire from it. And also - it lies in the hands as if it should.

- Only the cartridges for it are unpopular, so for large-scale battles you should take a whole backpack with you at the rate of 20 stores per day. Because when they run out, no one will drive them to you. Because not everyone even understands what kind of caliber this is, and they offer 7.62 for a Kalashnikov machine gun.",1671366533.0,1671366185.0,t3_zopfc8,t1_j0pblap,,1,136,0,136,0,0,

>The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. He said, “Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the square.” But he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house, and he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house, and they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them.” Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him, and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.  Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.” But they replied, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came here as an alien, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.”

In case it is not obvious, Sodom and Gomorrah are not destroyed for consensual homosexual relationships. They are destroyed because people wanted to publicly gang rape God's messengers. Those are not the same things. 

And so far, the US and UK are pretty good about the, 'no publicly raping angels bit.' In fact, we extend that to everyone generally, divine messengers or not. We're even working to trying to get rid of it in the private sphere too.

Ukrainians have a lot of wounded of which about 50-60% were lightly and could return to duty. Of course they are still counted as casualties but not irretriavable.

Maybe. Nobody, not the west, not Russia, not Ukraine knows for how long and for how much the support for Ukraine will last.

A guy get's heavily wounded. If he was in a NATO army, he'd probably get good battlefield medicine, a team to get him out, an airlift, and a top of the line hospital. he'll probably make it.

Instead, he's in the russian army. Does he:  
- get left by his unit at the front line, slowly bleed out, and counted by UA spotters as a casualty?  
- get left by his unit, manage to waddle away to go hide in a ditch or in the forest, and die out of sight of any UA spotters?  
- get taken by his unit back to the field hospital,get no basic care, die anyway?

It's reliable in the sense that it's incredibly easy to use with minimal training, and incredibly easy to fix with minimal tools. Likewise it's very easy to disassemble completely in the field with only basic tools so broken guns can be easily stripped for parts which can be cannibalised and collated to build working guns.

Remember it was introduced in an age where the US was fielding the M1 garand and then M14, the UK (and its empire) had the Lee-Enfield (and had yet to start toying with the ultimately dropped EM1 and EM2), Kar98 (or at least Mauser) derived rifles made up a big chunk of Scandinavian small arms, etc.  All small capacity rifles which had the trigger group set into the stock, and one piece furniture with a stock that ran into becoming the fore-end as a single piece of wood. If you smashed up the furniture it took significant time to disassemble, and likewise you could not access mechanical parts in the trigger group without removing all the wooden furniture.

Contrast that with the AK where the stock fixed onto the back of the receiver with a butt joint rather than a shaped curve or enveloped it. You could remove the stock without having to work it around the trigger and likewise you could access the moving parts without removing the furniture. The pistol grip and front handguard were separate parts too, where Western designs prior to 1960 were as mentioned, one piece furniture.

While I disagree with the idea that we should punish Russia by politically isolating it into the stone age, the platitudes people are saying here about Germany and Versailles are historically incorrect.

Germany was very much the bad guy of World War One. The war was chiefly engineered by four people. Those people are Conrad von Hötzendorf, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, Leopold Berchtold, Austria's Foreign Minister, Heinrich von Tschirschky, Germany's Ambassador to Austria, and Kaiser Wilhelm II, Germany's Emperor.

I mean ""engineered"" literally -- all four of these people were very aware what was likely to happen, and they took steps intentionally in order to make sure that the events would fold out the way they did.

When Austria's heir apparent, Franz Ferdinand, was killed in Bosnia, Austria's Hötzendorf and Berchtold were given fairly wide lattitude to decide how to respond by Emperor Franz Josef. Josef was not very disappointed by Ferdinand's death (the two men were politically opposed and personally alienated from each other) so he gave control over the response to Ferdinand's assassination to his military and foreign policy chiefs.

Ferdinand was killed in Bosnia, an occupied territory of the Austrian empire on the border with Serbia. These two men, Hötzendorf and Berchtold, wanted to annihilate Serbia, a foreign country, as a show of strength, since the assassins who killed Ferdinand were Serbian nationals. They knew that attacking Serbia, however, would trigger a defensive pact with Russia, so they lobbied Germany for help.

The problem was that if Germany entered the war against Russia, that would trigger another defensive pact between Russia and France. Austria lobbied Germany for help anyway, believing that Germany would agree. And Germany was even more in favor of such a war than Austria was.

Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II wanted Austria to purportedly ""annihilate"" Serbia. He passed many messages to the Austrian officials through his ambassador, Heinrich von Tschirschky, essentially giving Austria a blank check of support. In the view of the German emperor's inner circle, they wanted an excuse for a war with France and Russia as soon as possible, believing that neither geopolitical rival was properly prepared for such a contest.

Wilhelm II was mostly a piggish nut job. He was aloof, poorly read, highly egotistical and temperamental -- essentially the youngest, most pig-headed and narcissistic of all of the Great Powers in 1914. Many historical comparisons have been drawn between Wilhelm II and Trump, in that both men were similarly boorish, crass, impatient and allergic to details. Wilhelm II was also a war monger. He had colonial and prestige ambitions against France and Britain.

Wilhlem II wanted a flash war against these two nations so that he could grab territories off of Africa. Germany had a very large navy in 1914. It wasn't enough to take on Britain directly, but he thought they had a chance of it. Therefore, Wilhelm was not only OK with a war against Russia and France, but he also endorsed the war plan to invade through neutral Belgium and drag in Britain as well. He truly thought that Germany and Austria could take on three Great Power rivals all at once -- because he was an idiot.

So, long story short, over the course of about a month following Franz Ferdinand's death, Germany's foreign policy officials helped Austria deliberately craft a response to Serbia that made it impossible for Serbia to accept a peaceful resolution. This was done conscientiously, in order to drag Russia, France, and then later Britain all into a war in which Germany would quickly crush everyone and reign supreme as the chief hegemon  of Europe. This belief was economically and militarily delusional and driven by base, evil instinct.

_____________

The myths of WW1 get worse when we get to Versailles. People often say that Germany was punished overly harshly. Actually, it wasn't. The reparations the Entente demanded were actually proportionally less than typical for a losing-side great power for a war of that scale. Several wars had been fought in the last 100 years where the reparations were much higher.

Even worse, most people don't know that Germany actually paid off all of its war debt by the early 1920s. Those famous scenes of people buying bread with a wheelbarrow of cash because of the inflated Deutsch Mark? Yeah, that only lasted for about a year, 1919 to 1920, and the it was over. America's Wall Street came in during the early 1920s and bailed out Germany's debt, and the French gave Germany back economic control of much of the Rhineland, Germany's chief economic bread basket. By 1925 Germany's economy was roaring again. Hitler didn't even attempt his coup, the Beer Hall Putsch, until after Germany's economy had already recovered in full.

Hitler was part of a movement that championed *revisionist* history about Germany. They lied to the people about how the military had been betrayed and how the German people had been impoverished. Neither was true! And by the late 1920s, Hitler's movement was on the back heels. People did not like the violence and instability of German national socialism. The communists actually had a far greater share of the votes than the Nazis.

Things never went well for Hitler until the 1929 stock market crash. Germany was plunged into real, legitimate poverty, and people got pissed all over again. The Nazis won a few elections, lost some other big elections, but in 1932 struck an alliance with the German conservative party, and Hitler was made chancellor. Within one year, 250,000 people were in political camps.",1671378847.0,1671377315.0,t3_zopfc8,t1_j0psx5d,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

Right. This is exactly what US officials (e.g., Milley) feared would happen especially after watching all of Afghanistan fall to the Taliban in a week due to corruption. Ukraine, as much as it's improved over the past decade, was still rife with corruption at the start of the war (they're going to have to do more to meet EU standards soon and will have to go even further if they want to get into NATO).

The fact that Ukraine didn't succumb to bribes, payouts, traitors, thieves, etc, really demonstrates exactly how far they've come but it was a legitimate concern.

The Ukrainian army received a ton of training by the West (e.g., the Green Berets) and they wholeheartedly embarked on a total transformation of their military. Once they established that they weren't going to succumb to bribes/corruption, that they had the will to fight, and that they could fight effectively despite being outmanned and having fewer tools, that's when opinion really shifted.
