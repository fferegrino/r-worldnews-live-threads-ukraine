Day 227 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a quiet day; there were no missile strikes and no kamikaze drones sent at us. In the missile strike yesterday they destroyed a gym and a car wash. They didn’t aim at the hospital directly, but it still sustained some damage. Only 1 person was injured and thankfully there were no deaths. They most likely did hit an ammo dump, which is surprising; it’s the first time during this war that they managed to do it in Kharkiv. I’m almost certain it was due to some traitor leaking info to Russians, and not because their military intelligence is good.  

Crimean bridge being blown up is just amazing to see, this was one of the best things to happen in recent times, and just on time for Putin’s birthday too. It’s so funny seeing Russian sympathizers saying that blowing up that bridge is a war crime, and that it’s terrorism because 3 people died, even though they obviously weren’t the target. Where were those people when Russians killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol? Where were they when over 30 civilians were killed by Russian missiles in Zaporizhzhia last week? So killing those civilians wasn’t a war crime, but destroying a vital bridge, which is a valid military target, is a war crime?

Just a bit over an hour ago, at 2:15am, Russians fired about 10 missiles at Zaporizhzhia, and those rotten bastards aimed at civilians again. They deliberately aimed at apartment buildings, there are already photos and videos from the place that was hit, and entire sections of those buildings collapsed. We don’t know how many casualties there are yet, but those buildings were full of civilians. Only a couple of days ago they also fired missiles at apartment buildings in Zaporozhzhia, that time they killed 13 people, including 1 child, and now they did it again, the fucking scum.",False,1665276200.0,t3_xyitey,t3_xyitey,,0,169,0,169,1,0,

After the annexation Ukrainian army is insanely motivated to make as much progress as possible right now, as well as pushing before winter and fall rain begin to hit. They’re also going to want to take advantage of the time before the partial mobilization can actually be brought in which has been said to be about two months.

On top of that they’re also taking advantage of the chaos of collapsing front lines and routing of Russian forces to positions in flat areas with no fortifications.

Now add to that taking advantage of temporarily limited supply lines in the south and we’re looking at quite the situation.

Not to mention the economy of Russia is really hurting right now. Russians have been making a massive run on their banks since the partial mobilization at a rate of 30 million USD every hour since it occurred. This could be one of the most important changes. If Russia decides to go for a full mobilization it could snap their economy in half. This could even be preventing Putin from making that decision (which would likely have fairly limited benefits for their army).

I think the next few months are going to be a *very* interesting time in this war with some more massive shifts in the tide for Ukraine. Obviously Putin could grow desperate and further [gamble for resurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_for_resurrection) with a desperate attack of some kind, but that would not change the tide of the battle and only further solidify the western and European response.

I really hope something terrible happens to Putin soon and we can see and end to this conflict. Especially one where Ukraine doesn’t have to enter a heavily defended war ready posture in perpetuity.

So they said – decide for yourself if you want to go or not.” 9/ Eighty percent of the battalion refused to go. The attack went ahead anyway with those who volunteered, but it was a disaster.

In fact, sometimes they’re true, and they haven’t realized yet they need to be lying about it.  One example of that was early on in the war, when Russians initially admitted to bombing the Mariupol Theatre, and said that a defector/traitor told them that Azov were there (apparently were, *prior* to it being used as a shelter—but just for storage, and immediately took out equipment when city said wanted to use for shelter for residents—Russia’s info was out of date)
—then Russia u-turned and said they didn’t attack it, ‘Ukrainian nazis’ attacked it.  Essentially the exact same thing happened with the maternity hospital. 

It’s that when something that takes adequate investigation to make a determination, but is announced as definitive 90min after happened by those not even present—it’s unlikely to be credible enough to be relied upon.  Here, they need to actually investigate to determine whether it was a truck bomb, an arrival from air, arrival from sea, a train bomb, explosives affixed to structure of bridge, a bizarre accident. (The only time I’ve seen such quick yet credible investigation + announcement—was indeed definitive and shown to be credible—was not even by the Russians—was by the FBI, the Boston Marathon attack.)

Antonivskyi Bridge in Kherson is a post tension concrete girder. The concrete deck is part of load bearing the structure. Entire cross section of the bridge is used for longitudinal load distribution towards piers. The deck is thick and difficult to penetrate as we have seen.

The Kerch bridge on the other hand is a traditional steel girder with concrete deck. The concrete deck is only 200mm thick. The deck just transfers the load from traffic to the steel girders. Very easy to puncture with HIMARS. The total collapse of the steel girder might be more difficult to achieve because it is almost impossible to hit it from the side but without the carriageway it is impossible to use it anyways.

The railway bridge is similar. It has traditional steel girders with concrete deck on top of which there is traditional ballasted track.",1665256542.0,1665253798.0,t3_xyitey,t3_xyitey,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Who benefits the most from massive explosions caught on video?

Cable news. You know this is true. And who in cable news has been - quite *conveniently* - building himself cover as a pro-Russian shill?

That's right: Tucker Carlson. Big booms get views for people like him. He has the motive, the means (nobody would be surprised to see him hanging out in fascist Russia, and he's got a lot of cash), and the opportunity. Where was Tucker when the bridge went up? In bed? Likely fucking story. He's got no alibi.

The answer is right in front of us: Tucker blew the bridge for the Nielsen rating bump. If I were Russia, I'd be asking some hard questions about our relationship. I'm sure the FSB would like to talk to him.

ATACMS while supersonic still take travel time.  If fired from the closest Ukrainian-controlled point, somewhere in Zaporizhzhia, maybe 350-400km away, traveling 1km/sec at maximum velocity, it's still taking 6 minutes to reach the bridge.  

OTOH if the train was somehow the target, then it has to be a drone attack or internal attack.  I don't think a missile 6+ minutes away can hit a moving target; and they would surely fire more than one if they were to try.  

Just saying these two theories:  train or missile, seem to be mutually exclusive.  

Combinations of delivery system and target can still be drone+train, drone+bridge, ~~sabotage(bomb)+train~~, or missile+bridge.

https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1578635731811303426?t=Xir_lxtlrtZWHQC6Q2FIyg&s=19

Stop at 33 seconds and then pause and play frame by frame. You can see the explosion originated below the bridge as the shockwave and fireball are ejected under the bridge to the left. 

Probably what happened is a drone boat loaded with thousands of lbs of explosives was loitering under the section waiting for the train to be overhead. With an explosion that big, the entire sections of the bridge were lifted off the piers and fell into the sea. The explosion was also big enough that the train was engulfed in the fireball and ignited. 

The boat seems to have been under the right causeway in this video which would explain why the other segment was not destroyed. This theory also explains why multiple road segments fell, something you would not expect with a truck bomb.

The thing is explosions are directed by things like water or concrete. If the explosion came from the roadway, the force on the bridge would be primarily down, the direction the bridge is designed to carry a load. The majority of the force would therefore be directed straight up in the air.

If it was a drone boat, now the explosion is stuck between the bridge deck and the water. Water is like concrete against impacts and explosions, it does not compress and it takes a lot of force to move it. So the majority of the explosion is directed up, away from the sea and towards the bridge deck. But bridge decks are not designed to resist a load pushing upwards from below. In fact, many of them sit on load points with just the force of gravity holding them in place on the pier. If there were a sudden, enormous, explosion below the bridge, it could toss multiple sections of deck up in the air and cause them to come tumbling down off their piers. 

Based on the shockwave under the bridge in that video and the way it collapsed, it seems like the explosion was from below.",False,1665239084.0,t3_xyitey,t3_xyitey,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Reference at 0:35: [https://twitter.com/flash\_news\_ua/status/1578635731811303426?s=46&t=f5HPKlQkCIsCvRp05johWw](https://twitter.com/flash_news_ua/status/1578635731811303426?s=46&t=f5HPKlQkCIsCvRp05johWw)

I posited at the time that this suggested a bomb boat filled with low explosives (along with the apparent ""wake"" from the under-bridge footage).

Looking at it again, I came up with another theory.

If you look at the upper left quarter, you can see that, just as the bloom from the bottom-right explosion clears, there is immediately another plume of fire from under the rail bridge. Also, you can see a second plume vending down and out from that point, and what appears to be flaming liquid pouring from there. This suggests the tanks *instantly* ruptured and caught fire, to within a frame or two of video.  
  
This suggests a targeted sabotage, with two demolitions explosives placed with precision on the two of the three bridges. The one on the right would be to break the bridge and collapse it into the strait, while the second would be the incendiary to touch off the train. The explosives would be triggered simultaneously by remote. However, I'm not confident infiltration teams could get enough explosives in place to create the fireball that broke the road bridge without someone noticing.  
  
A third possibility is that ***both*** techniques were used simultaneously: A planted demolition to precisely destroy the fuel train, and a remote bomb boat with low explosives called in from distance during the night once the charge was set. Rig both to the same detonator, wait until the boat hits the bridge and pop them both.

I'm willing to admit I'm a moron.

1. There are two collapsed bridged sections, not one. In that satellite image I suggest the explosion occurred under the ""cleaner"" section of the bridge, not under the ""scorched"" side. The satellite image is here: 
https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1578834056594485250

2. Many people commented about significant scorching from the top. However, on the close-up video is appears the scorching is not that significant. Here is the really close-up video
https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1578638416194912256

3. The scorched top section of the bridge appears to be from the unlucky car that traveled in the opposite direction and caught fire. As can be seen in the video of the explosion at 0:37 the car continued traveling away from the explosion for some time before burning out completely. See at 0:37 here https://twitter.com/JimFraserUk/status/1578635759627603969

4. The explosion occurred literally at the lowest possible point of that bridge, the closest possible section to the water. The truck explosive wouldn't necessarily require proximity to water, but the boat obviously would. Here is the horizontally filmed video showing how close to water the bridge is that point:
https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1578652017475473409

5. That picture from underneath the bridge that everyone is sharing was taken not from the main pillar (the one that barely holds these two damaged sections) but from a side pillar overlooking the main pillar. This section shouldn't have seen the explosion. The other section ahead did. One needs to swim to that main pillar ahead and take the picture from underneath there.

https://i.redd.it/15dpxuh6xms91.png

1. The surface charring of the road surviving eastbound lanes is immediate after the explosion, it wasn't deposited later, and indicates the fireball was above or on the bridge surface.

2. There is a dent (2) in the surviving eastbound span and drawing the perspective lines using the surviving bridge elements shows that the center of the dent is lined up with where the truck was one frame before the explosion.

3. Railings are bent away consistent with an explosion on the surface of the westbound lane. 
https://i.redd.it/dtjhtirs5js91.png https://i.redd.it/czn8qrqy5js91.png

4. The underside of the surviving eastbound lane is unharmed https://i.redd.it/7r73yabt3ns91.png

The boat theory has some serious problems explaining the damage on the upper surface. Missile attack theory needs to come up with a missile capable of carrying a warhead this big. Both need to explain the coincidence of how it seems to have exploded right on the truck.

Look at approx 0:35; the smoke plume immediately after the blast is coming from screen right, and from *under* the bridge, not on top as if it were a bomb truck. There's also a lot more flaming debris thrown into the sky on the right side that then drifts down and left.

It might be that the bomb boat theory might have legs. Possibly a lot of low-explosive - low in this case meaning more of a ""push a lot of heavy stuff"" explosive than a ""reduce it to powder"" one (ampho?) - to lift the road bridge off its pylons, as well as an incendiary component (thermite?) to set off the fuel train? Drive it to the right location at the right time and take out everything at once.

Wild guessing, of course.

Edit: looking at it again, there is another theory. If you look at the upper left quarter, you can see that, just as the bloom from the bottom-right explosion clears, there is *immediately* another plume of fire from under the rail bridge. Also, you can see a second plume vending down and out from that point, and what appears to be flaming liquid pouring from there.

This suggests that another likely scenario would be a targeted sabotage, with two demolitions explosives placed with precision on the two of the three bridges. The one on the right would be to break the bridge and collapse it into the strait, while the second would be the incendiary to touch off the train.

A third possibility is that *both* techniques were used: A bomb boat with low explosives to kill the road bridge, and a planted demolition to precisely destroy the fuel train.",1665213667.0,1665211660.0,t3_xyitey,t1_irhpsqs,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

58990867d95fa644c4a83aa257164091,xyitey,irjuyol,"See rules 5 and 12. 

1)	Putin is obsessed with Russian security.  Every nation regards their security as a top priority.   But with Russia it reaches manic proportions.  Putin is obsessed with the risk of a nuclear first strike against Russia, and the idea of NATO nuclear weapons in Ukraine is traumatizing.

2)	Putin is paranoid and conspiratorial.  He sees American involvement everywhere.  Everything is just American propaganda.

3)	Putin has a sense of higher mission.  He identifies his will with the destiny of the nation.

4)	Putin is not personally aggrandizing.  His palace and extravagance are not due to personal desire for wealth, but are a reflection of Russian greatness.

5)	Putin lies.  All the time.  It’s not pathological, it is a primary tool of state.  He sees language as a political tool and it is strange and irresponsible not to use it strategically, regardless of the “truth” which has no intrinsic value.  And frankly, he assumes everyone else is the same.

6)	Putin was traumatized by the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia and Kosovo due to its potential parallels to a potential intervention and dismemberment of the Russian Federation.  He sees it as a “blueprint” for what NATO wishes to do to Russia.

7)	Putin is over-emotional but not rash.  He focuses on rage and indignation and it eats at him, but he doesn’t do “knee jerk” reactions based on it.

8)	Putin trusts no one’s motives.  In his mind, there is literally no such thing as altruism or social motivations.  Everything is about personal gain (power or money) or being a tool of either Russia or a foreign power.  No one is independent and values don’t matter.

9)	Putin mistrusts the internet viscerally.  “Your internet is sheer disinformation and manipulation.”  He does not use it at all.  He does not watch videos or read internet media, he will only view PRINTED screen captures of this content provided by various agencies.

10)	Putin does not believe legitimate political opposition exists, anywhere.  There are allies, enemies, and traitors.  There is no such thing as a constructive or well-intentioned disagreement on single points within the context of broader cooperation.

11)	Putin is both extremely pragmatic and extremely not pragmatic.  His big ideas are rigid, conspiratorial, and over-emotional in his DIRECTION, but his means of achieving those are extremely pragmatic, open, patient, and flexible.

12)	Putin is a talented chameleon.  He can appear to be anything you want him to be 1 on 1.  Environmentalist, humanitarian, strongman, reformer,

13)	Putin masks authoritarianism and ruthlessness in layers of legalistic, procedural, and bureaucratic language.  But beneath that is authoritarianism and a mafia-like “understanding”.  He would never say “kill this man” but instead he would speak in very bureaucratic terms to provide plausible deniability.

14)	Putin believes he is superior to the majority of other leaders, and he sees only winners and losers.  There is no such thing as mutually beneficial negotiations.  Being willing to give up portions of something are either a sign of weakness or a stalling tactic to get the rest later when you are stronger.

15)	Putin considers all former areas under Russian Empire control as “territory”.  Not nations, not states, but rogue areas, under the evil influence.  He sees them as temporarily “lost” territories that should be managed as current Russian Federation’s existing autonomous regions.  He literally does not believe that these are “non-Russian” regardless of the population makeups.",1665261599.0,1665260169.0,t3_xyitey,t1_irjucop,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

ETA: And like someone at an old folks' home stuck in a chair watching Fox News all day, I think his self-created reality bubble only accelerated his disconnect. He created a world full of yes-men and happy answers, and has lost any ability to realize he's being bullshitted and led along.

Now a sabotage team could have planted a bomb on the train or on the tracks and used the fuel in the tankers to juice up the damage. It could also have been typical Russian poor safety and not properly maintaining rail cars that are probably getting more use than ever.

The road span dropping as well would seem to suggest large charges must have been on it so that would seem to lean towards Ukrainian's doing it but maybe the shockwave from the initial train blast was enough to unseat a few of the supports so down it went.

Whatever happened this is a major blow to already overstretched Russian logistics and for the civilian population in Crimea in general.

So in that you have a little furnace effect in that the air being drawn in to the centre of the fire is heated to a high temperature before it burns releasing more heat, and the fuel itself is also heated before it burns.

Whilst steel melts at 1300ish c, it is often over looked that it softens at 538 c , so the engineers are certainly going to have genuine cause for concern.

Concrete loses 60–75% of its compressive strength at 600 °C so that is going to be weakened for sure. But this has to be balanced out; bridges are made several times stronger that they have to be as a safety margin and concrete is a fairly good insulator with a high thermal heat capacity so whilst the rails will be affected, the structural beams might not become hot enough to become significantly weakened.

 >A boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE,  BLEV-ee) is an explosion caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that has reached temperature above its boiling point. Because the boiling point of a liquid rises with pressure, the contents of the pressurized vessel can remain liquid as long as the vessel is intact. If the vessel's integrity is compromised, the loss of pressure and dropping boiling point can cause the liquid to rapidly convert to a gas and expand rapidly. If the gas is combustible, as is the case with hydrocarbons and alcohols, further damage can be caused by an ensuing fire.

Does that give them a warhead that's not a quite small 250kg while also increasing the range more than 2x-3x what it was?

Those two things don't make sense, they just don't add up. You can't get bigger warhead AND further range on the same rocket by ""hacking it"". Rockets are very efficient.

There's a reason there's one ATACMS in a HIMARS pod vs 6 standard rockets, you need a shit ton of fuel to get the range, and that's with a not bridge-destroying levels of explosives. The HRIM 2 isn't all that much bigger in explosive warhead.

Structural failure of reinforced concrete often occurs when the effective tensile strength of steel reinforcement is lost through heating.”

Distance from missile to bridge: known quantity.

Speed of missile: known quantity.

Path of track: known quantity.

Using these 5 variables you can calculate when and where to launch a precision missile to hit your target. It's just math, frankly it's not even difficult math. If Ukraine had intelligence on the location of the train and how it operates, they can strike it.

This isn't complicated, we intercept ballistic missiles going far faster than the speed of sound using the same concept. Hitting a train chugging along slower than a car is child's play.

Also consider the fact that trains are ludicrously long. Typical trains are a mile long, not exaggerating, they can be much longer. You don't even have to be that accurate to hit it. You have half a mile of leniency, minimum, to work with.

No, you can however see how you can only see the fireball [on top of the freeway](https://imgur.com/a/lRylYvu).

>The explosion was also big enough that the train was engulfed in the fireball and ignited.

The truck sending actual shrapnel into the train is more likely to have caused the tanks of the train to rupture than a fireball.

>The boat seems to have been under the right causeway in this video which would explain why the other segment was not destroyed.

Another thing that explains it is the fact that the truck was on the right causeway and not the left. Also, why would a bomb under the right causeway have shorn off the railings [on top the left causeway](https://twitter.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA/status/1578727080493486081)?

>This theory also explains why multiple road segments fell, something you would not expect with a truck bomb.

It actually explains it even less because how could that explosion have left the support pillars completely unmarked by the explosion, but allowed it to bring down adjacent spans in a way a truck bomb couldn't have?

>If the explosion came from the roadway, the force on the bridge would be primarily down, the direction the bridge is designed to carry a load. The majority of the force would therefore be directed straight up in the air

And an explosion from the roadway is point-blank on the bridge whereas an explosion from a boat is like thirty meters under it. Also, a bridge is likely not typically designed to withstand the force of possibly 30 tons of explosives.

>If it was a drone boat \[...\]

Yes, if it was an enormous drone boat that somehow was unnoticed by radar or surveillance, loaded with many, many tons of explosives. But there's nothing that suggests it's a drone boat as opposed to the truck in the video.

>Based on the shockwave under the bridge in that video

The other thing is if the explosion came from below, it would have likely been more localized to one span.

What matters is that the support beam under the section of road was the target, that wake is seen under the bridge in the direction of the blast, that this was the road into Crimea and you can't have a truck filled with explosives enter it from the Russian side, or any side, because the bridge has been operated by military personnel since the start of the war and all vehicles are subject to inspection.  Etc. etc. etc.  Not to mention they wouldn't let a remotely-driven truck (in Russia? please.) on the bridge, unless you're adding to this it's some suicide mission.  C'mon.  

Even in the narrative that this is somehow related to the infighting between the intelligence agencies, or the intelligence agencies and the military, or any other factionalism, nobody could get a truck on that bridge without a trail of payoffs someone would have found out about before the truck had finished crossing.  And it did cross.  It went the whole length of the bridge before the explosion occurred, very near the Crimean side.  

Not to mention blowing the bridge doesn't help any of the factions unless they're able to lay blame for it, which would mean just as much ridiculous expensive nonsense would have to be done in the course of the investigations to plant evidence.

Not necessarily. The truck could have been triggered remotely and the driver unaware that it's been rigged to explode, or possibly even its specific contents.

After today's stream on the blowing up of Crimea bridge I received quite a few nasty comments. That moved me to clarify my stand and my cause. There it is.  
  
Doing this channel I have a cause and a mission.  They are to stand up and tell the world out loud the truth about Russia and about tragedy that it is causing firstly to Ukraine and then to itself destroying itself.  My cause is to tell the truth, give news and information from inside Russia, to inform whoever interested and be the best ambassador of good Russian people that are remaining.  
  
My position:  
  
1)  I don't feel joyous about any attack, whether it be done to Ukraine, Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Mongolia or Kathmandu. Or any other country. Any attack, no matter what kind of, is a loss of human life and a human tragedy.   
  
2)  I do not support what Russia has been doing attacking Ukraine starting February 24th.  
  
3)  I do not support hysterical claims of many Russians made today, October 8th ""How could they do that? Ukraine has really crossed the red line today"" etc. I think that Russia crossed the red line on February 24th.   
  
4)  I believe that Ukrainians have a right to protect their Motherland. But them striking the Russians, the building, etc does makes me neither happy nor joyous. This is a tragedy happening between the two countries and there's nothing happy about that, regardless who strikes who. I am a Christian and any loss of human life hurts my heart.  
  
5)  Ukraine is the country where my father was growing up, with my relatives still living there. I spent about a year in Ukraine and love the country admiring its people.   
  
6)  I am Russian, born and raised and will remain so. As much as I am Ukrainian. My mom's ancestors come from Ukraine.   
  
7)  Ukrainians hitting the Crimean bridge scares me and makes me sad because I understand that this move will lead to another escalation from Russian government. What that escalation might be I am scared even to think about.   
  
8)  If you think I am a robot without feeling and emotions and I never make mistakes then you are very wrong.   
  
9)  In my reporting I try to be unbiased showing you the unfolding events. Today I tried to give you unbiased news about the bridge blowing and how Russian media was reporting it.  If you thought I'd be dancing around with joy about it, you were watching the wrong guy.

That's because contrary to how it may seem, taking a photo/video doesn't happen instantly. Instead, the camera scans across the entire screen very quickly.

The result of this is that things on one side of the screen are actually ""older"" than things on the other side of the screen. This can lead to something known as ""partial exposure"", where light (traveling at the speed of light, much faster than the shutter speed) hits the camera midway through it taking a video frame/picture. The effect is that half the scene is lit in a different way than the rest of the scene. Here's a great video demonstrating the effect with a flash of lightning:

https://twitter.com/307Mod/status/1045366144838717440?t=bNwL55-vOkTuyEwaCRvQlQ&s=19

So it is perfectly reasonable that you will have a frame of video with **both** the light from the explosion **and** the truck. The truck exploded midway through the frame, but it has already had its picture taken and the camera wasn't going to go ""back"" to scan those pixels (again, this is digital not film). The light from the explosion hit the camera after the truck's picture had been taken, and thus you could see the light from the explosion appearing to come from somewhere else.

Seems clear to me, that the truck was absolutely not the source of the blast. (there's also video of an inspection of what's supposedly that very truck, and an inspector DOES look in the back - doesn't mean he wasn't bribed or that the payload wasn't adequately disguised. . . ):
https://nitter.net/ryan_trollip/status/1578725523907149824

I suppose if PrSM is too far-fetched. (it is). Then it could have been a Tochka.  Ukraine seems to be very good at aiming those missiles, and I think the range of that missile is credible (while the explosive payload is not).

In that last pre-blast frame, it's hard to tell if there's a contrail coming straight down on that truck (or if it's an artifact of the wash-out from the light of the blast), but the very next frame is total wash-out from the flare of the explosion: except you see a brilliant horizontal line across the bottom of the frame, about 1/5 of the way up. And that line coincides with the roofline of the trailer.  I tend to interpret that as a REFLECTION of the flash, off the flat surface of the roof of the truck.  Which also would say that the origin of the blast is in front of, and roughly at the same altitude (or just above) as the roof of the truck.  ie. an air-burst.

Then, after the flash dissipates enough to start showing image again, it's pretty clear that the fireball is expanding, centered about 1/3 up the frame.  From this angle - that blast had to be an air-burst, about 30-40 feet ABOVE the truck. But I have to be mis-interpreting this, because that makes no sense, because I don't know how any small missile warhead would be able to detonate that far off the deck, and end up destroying 3 sections of bridge. 

The other issue is we don't have any acknowledgement by Russia that air defense radar picked up an incoming missile.  You'd think they'd have a 5-10 minute warning of something like that.",False,1665258721.0,t3_xyitey,t1_irjotae,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

And also add the fact in that typically trains are over a mile long. It's not exactly a hard thing to hit.

The long part of the road that is broken as has no burn marks most likely collapsed after the explision because of structural collapse. 

This would also match what we saw on other CCV (large explosion above the road) and would explain why the train cought fire.

My money is on the truck theory. Most likely the bride also wasn't up to standard and had strucural issues on it's own.

If you let it cool in this uniform state, it's annealed/tempered and becomes pliable again.  To harden metals, you heat it up and quickly cool it so the outside crystals shrink and the metal becomes harder, but more brittle.

I don't know the design specs of the original steel, but I'd imagine that more ductile steel is better for absorbing stresses in a bridge.  The issue becomes that having the bridge lose the stresses that were keeping it in place can cause the bridge to shift and so the original geometry may no longer be in spec with the stresses on the bridge, accelerating metal fatigue.

What I see is ether two missiles independent of one another striking the bridges from the top down. Or set charges from below the bridge which would have been a remarkable special forces feat, considering the security protocols in place on this vital long span structure. Also the Russians I am sure have check points on ether side of the separate bridge spans. Specifically looking for any explosives in a truck or vehicles trying to cross the bridge.

There's a reason why fuses, primers, propellant, and shells are stored separately and assembled prior to firing.

The high explosive RDX bursting charge in the shell is extremely stable. You can melt it, burn it, hit it with a hammer, toss it off of a roof, it's not going to detonate unless it's hit by a supersonic blast wave from a detonator.

The low explosive propellant bags are prone to degradation but they're not particularly shock or temperature sensitive. However, they are extremely flammable and must be handled with care.

Primers are very sensitive by design, but aren't particularly powerful, nor are the detonators in fuses.

To be honest, the people I take bigger issue with are the people who are treating the war like a spectator sport - making jokes about it, and going ""haha thousands of people died today pogchamp"". It just feels rather psychopathic to not treat this war with anything other than sombre despair at the pointless waste of human life this war has been.

Like this bridge incident, I look and think it's great from a Ukrainian defence perspective but I can't feel like joking and memeing about it because in the footage I see a bunch of small civilian cars getting caught up in the explosion.

&#x200B;

And for steel the general rule is that you get either tough steel or hard steel. Gers for example are really tough steel with a really thin layer of hardened steel on top to make the teeth last longer.

&#x200B;

one key difference between hard and tough is the way you can form it. Or the way it behaves when force is applied. While tough steel generally breaks harder it can be formed quite easily. You can see this with nails. They bend in every direction but actually breaking it off is not easy. Hard steal on the contrary can be formed a little bit temporarly but then breaks when you get over a certain threshold. A knife's blade will bend to a certain degree but will after this break off. Permanently bending a knifes blade is almost impossible.

This is essentially the difference between elastic and plastic deformation. One is temporarly, where the given object will \*boink\* back into form while the other one will leave your object permanently changed.

&#x200B;

in the case of construction steel you woule HATE to have material that deforms plasticly easily. How you achieve this? One part is thermal processing the steel (like you know from those blacksmiths dropping glowing blades in water). The other one is mechanical ""cold"" deformation. Here you take the steel and pull it in (roughly) the desired shape at still reddish glow. This stretches out the forming crystal structure in the material along the desired beam form.

Now there is a thing called recrystalization. This means that when you give enough thermal energy to the established crystalstructure of the metal it will start forming back into a more natural (and therefore less hard, more tough) structure. This will result in the stealbeam experiencing plastic deformation at forces that before the RC wouldve only given only elasitc deformation. The part of the bridge that was exposed to the explosion and fire will bend more easily then the one that wasnt. This means that in best case with every. single. Train. The part will bend downwards a bit more. Until the Tracks on top breake of and the train derails or the entire thing collapses. Whatever comes first

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

now the big Q is if the heat of the explosion and burning off was enough to set off enough RC inside the Beams to get them to slowly bend away from their desired job. Just as i do with mine =)

Because you can clearly see the railings blown out in the CCTV footage.

>It doesn't clearly show what happened to the railings I referred to.

What you refered to, is the railings of collapsed section. Well, part of them anyway. Those get bent all kinds of ways during the actual collapse, not the explosion. The ones that got damaged from explosion clearly seen in the CCTV footage.

>because the exact path of the blast shockwave through a complicated structure from beneath it is not predictable. Remember Hitler and his table? Most of the shockwave from beneath was travelling to the ""left"" but some was reflected from the sturdy concrete structures.

The comparison with Hitler is seriously lacking. Besides, the briefcase was pushed aside behind the fat leg of the conference table and that's what deflected the blast from Hitler, sparing his life.


>Please answer my question too. How come at 0:24 in that close-up video https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1578638416194912256 you can see that the outer railings on the collapsed sections (that are much closer to the truck) are NOT actually bent significantly at all?

That's an easy answer. First of all they are bent, but most important is that we can't reference the exact position of the truck in relation to the aftermath video. Those railings could have been bent during the collapse, inwards or outwards. But what we can do, is relate to the CCTV footage showing exactly the section that got damaged directly from explosion. And that shows railings literally hanging from the sides of the bridge, blown outwards.

In any case, it really seem like a stretch and too much of a coincidence to suspect explosion from underneath, when it's already known that truck was not inspected properly on the checkpoint, that driver got the delivery order over the internet, and that truck happen to pass in exact place and time of supposed underneath explosion on the almost empty bridge.

Which second of your video shows the inner railing that I was referring to (The one bent inwards in my video)?

> What you refered to, is the railings of collapsed section. Well, part of them anyway. Those get bent all kinds of ways during the actual collapse, not the explosion. 

Once again, how do you know that they got bent during the actual collapse, not the explosion? 

You are repeating again and again that the inner railing got bent because of collapse rather than explosion but offer no evidence. Which second of your video shows the inner railing that I was referring to. (The one bent inwards in my video)?

If you can't find evidence, you can't make that claim.

>> Please answer my question too. How come at 0:24 in that close-up video https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1578638416194912256 you can see that the outer railings on the collapsed sections (that are much closer to the truck) are NOT actually bent significantly at all?

> That's an easy answer. First of all they are bent, but most important is that we can't reference the exact position of the truck in relation to the aftermath video.

if you can't reference the truck position in relation to the aftermath video it  implies you don't believe the truck explosion caused the damage you are seeing in the aftermath video. At the very least, you must admit the truck explosion must have been very close to the damage it caused, or the entire truck hypothesis must be discarded on the spot. 

If the truck is close to the damage then the railing are close to the truck explosion since the railings are close to the damage. And they aren't bent outwards. 

>  And that shows railings literally hanging from the sides of the bridge, blown outwards.

I presented the close-up of the railings bent inwards and not bent either way significantly. 

> In any case, it really seem like a stretch and too much of a coincidence to suspect explosion from underneath, when it's already known that truck was not inspected properly on the checkpoint [...] I don't believe in that much coincidence. Ockham's razor.

I am applying the same Occam's razor. 

* The explosion happened at the lowest section closest to the water. Truck can explode the bridge at any height, while the boats obviously can't. This by itself can Occam-razor the truck explosion out.

* The railing bending pattern. Some railings that are literally on a collapsed section sticking out of water and are not bent significantly at all, some are even bent inwards suggesting a shockwave pattern more complicated than a surface explosion. You either have to believe the not bent railings were magically fixed when they fell down, or the explosion wasn't the surface.

So they chose to explode the truck on the lowest possible section, the best spot for a boat, and later when falling the railings in close proximity to the truck explosion gets unbent because of the fall?

You can't just assert stuff out of thin air. If you say it is a truck explosion, you have to make a case with evidence and I have to find holes in your case to make it ""unproven"". 

The same applies to me too. If I say it is an explosion from underneath, I have to make a case with evidence. Until then it is unproven.

The issue is that particular CCTV video doesn't really distinguish between the two competing explanations as both explanations make similar predictions regarding what that particular CCTV would show. 

I think the other CCTV below shows the explosion much better and does allow to differentiate but I lack expertise for making any definite assertions.

> I'm yet to see any kind of evidence of underneath explosion. And i mean any. Opposed to what can be seen on the CCTV. 

If you like CCTV please do take a look at https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1578640392966131712

At 0:35 I can easily the explosion is underneath the bridge. The hot explosion gases are obviously seen under the bridge on both sides but I lack expertise to assess whether this is conclusive evidence or some weird behavior of explosion gases and blast shockwaves.

GSM works on triangulation. But the source is obviously much closer and importantly closer to the ground. Most of the time in excess of 3 towers. X,Y,Z to the meter. 

Professional DGPS systems utilise both the GPS network and then triangulate for additional accuracy with the GSM network.

A lot of what you are saying is old information. Like how GPS is 20-25m off. That was because of Selective Availability because the military didn't want other countries to be able to use it. Selective Availability was ended by Bill Clinton. That is why GPS is now mentioned as having a much better accuracy than the 20-25m that it used to have in the 90s.

It is so much better that cell phones have not supported GSM since 2G. Since 3G onwards everything switched to UMTS. It uses cell towers to get a base location then the cell phone will know which GPS satellites are in the sky. It then uses those signals to get a location. The cell tower is no longer part of the triangulation beyond the first ""where am I"" request. Google Maps gets the data from the cell phone of your location. So if you are still using a 2G signal then it would work like you are talking about but that is pretty rare now. UMTS can still use the towers for triangulation but it is only done when needed, like if for whatever reason you are not receiving enough signals from GPS satellites to get a location but that would be unusual situations.

Back to the ""provide accuracy meters in excess of GPS."" If you was talking about DGPS before then you are correct, DGPS can give better accuracy than what GPS can.
