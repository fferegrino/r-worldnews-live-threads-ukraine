Day 25 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

First half of the day was really quiet, weirdly so, probably the quietest it has been since the war started. But after that we started hearing our artillery‚Äôs fire really frequently, sometimes the sound appears to be extremely close. We did hear Russian shelling as well but not as frequently as our artillery doing its work.

Our governor said that all of the attempted attacks by Russians were repelled and it looks like it‚Äôs the truth as we heard the sound of fighting coming from the routes that were said to be under attack and it was quiet after that.

Yesterday our mayor talked about the scale of destruction that happened so far. He said that out of around 8000 residential buildings 650 were damaged or destroyed, which is just about 8% of all residential buildings, they most likely include anything from a small house to high rises, for example our building has 576 flats and there are a lot this exact type of building around our city.

This is the level of destruction that was caused with no active fighting within the city, last time they breached our defense was on February 28th, after this they never managed to get inside the city again. And this is just the damage done to residential buildings, if you include everything else it will go even higher.

And you know what‚Äôs funny? When people show Russians photos from destroyed Kharkiv they say that it‚Äôs fake, and not just fake but that those are photos from Syria. Apparently I live in Syria now, that‚Äôs news to me, but if they say so then it must be true. And of course they say that there are Nazis running everywhere on the streets and oppressing Russian speaking people. 

Yeah, right, we are a majority Russian speaking city. Our mayor even exclusively speaks in Russian every time he appears on the news or in public. Nobody here was ever oppressed for speaking Russian, but if Russian media says so then it‚Äôs the truth. Seriously, Russians now think that they are experts on life in Ukraine, they know us better than we know ourselves judging from their words.

What the fuck were they thinking bombing the only cities where people were actually pro-Russian? I‚Äôm absolutely serious, people here were very sympathetic to Russia before this started but now everyone here despises Russians. 

This was a real revelation for us, we thought that Russians were good people, we had friends and family from Russia, so them coming in to destroy our country was a real surprise. After the invasion every Russian we have known has shown us their true nature. 

We will be cutting all of them from our life now, they are real monsters. Don‚Äôt think that they are innocent, they‚Äôre not. They unquestionably eat up their own propaganda and think that they are liberating the world from Nazis (regular Ukrainian people). A lot of them openly say on social media that they will annex eastern Ukraine and make it part of Russia and then they will give the remaining cities to Poland (???). A lot of them also want USSR to return, especially older people. Their way of thinking is completely fucked up.

The areas Russia lobs off can't vote in the next elections, leading to pro-Western reformers (Proshenko and Zelensky) to victory.

*From CNN Staff*



The Russian military claimed on Sunday that it had launched a series of strikes on military targets in Ukraine employing¬†hypersonic and cruise missiles¬†on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

US officials have also confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat.

It's late Sunday night in Kyiv. Here are more of the headlines from Sunday in the Russia-Ukraine conflict:

**Zelensky: ""I'm ready for negotiations"" with Putin, but if they fail, it could mean ""a third World War""**:¬†Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he is ready to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but warned that if any negotiation attempts fail, it could mean the fight between the two countries would lead to ""a third World War."" ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war,‚Äù Zelensky told CNN‚Äôs Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview Sunday morning.

**More than 900 civilians killed in Ukraine, UN says**:¬†At least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured since the start of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Sunday. The OHCHR added that most of the casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. In a statement, the UN body detailed the 902 deaths as ‚Äú179 men, 134 women, 11 girls, and 25 boys, as well as 39 children and 514 adults whose sex is yet unknown.‚Äù

**Mariupol struggles to learn more about art school bombing**:¬†An advisor to Mariupol‚Äôs mayor said in an update on the art school that was bombed by Russian forces in the last hours that city officials are struggling to learn more about how many people were hiding in the school that was acting as a shelter. Petro Andrushenko wrote on social media: ‚ÄúSo far, there is no exact operational data on how many people were hiding in the shelter or the number of casualties. I expect we will have it later today. But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from.‚Äù An earlier estimate from the city council put the number sheltering in the school building at 400.

**White House says Biden has ""no plans"" to visit Ukraine this week**:¬†White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there are ‚Äúno plans,‚Äù for US President Joe Biden to travel to Ukraine this week as he heads to Europe for snap emergency summits.

MAZURENKO ALYONA - MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2022, 00:29

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that next week new sanctions will be imposed on Russia, which attacked Ukraine. 

**Source:** Kuleba's Facebook video

**Direct speech:** ""New sanctions are needed and they will be next week. 

A separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãour work these days is to push out those international companies from Russia that have not yet realized that they need to leave. These are not only some food companies (Nestle, Danone), but also point companies, without which Russia will not be able to make its own missiles. 

Some take offense at us for putting pressure on them, but now is not the time to take offense. Time to make a choice. You are on the side of good or on the side of evil. "" 

**Details:** Kuleba urged not to feed the aggressor's economy. 

According to the Minister, he is sending his colleagues a list of specific sanctions that Ukraine needs.

Net effect being I think oil is gonna start decreasing in price as the Saudis overpump, which is going to catastrophically implode the Russian economy even more.

Edit: yeah this makes lots of sense the more I think about it. Saudi‚Äôs get weapons concessions from the US the US had been hesitant to send, and the Saudis get an opportunity to economically destroy another oil producer

Interestingly he meant it for domestic consumption and didn‚Äôt post it on Twitter. I am doing him a favor by translating the main points [(thread):](https://twitter.com/polijunkie_aus/status/1505560092649099272)

‚ÄúSome Chinese demand China to follow the West and condemn Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is naive‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me be candid today and explain the strategic importance of Russia to China‚Äù

‚ÄúOn the surface level, China and Russia support each other diplomatically, on Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, HongKong. But more importantly, is our back to back strategic alliance‚Äù

‚ÄúChina, rather than Russia, is America‚Äôs major strategic competitor. America‚Äôs focus now is on Russia, but as Mike Pence said, give it some time they will refocus on China. And when that day comes, we will thank Russia for being our ally, or at least being neutral‚Äù

Russia‚Äôs war takes it to the forefront of competition with the US, temporarily replacing China, giving us breathing space to regroup after Trump‚Äôs brutal trade war. Two powers resisting US hegemony is better than one‚Äù

‚ÄúA no-limit partnership with Russia will have strong deterrence effect on US policy, making it harder for US to move for final showdown with China, with Russia‚Äôs supply of energy, food and other raw materials‚Äù

‚ÄúIf war breaks out in Taiwan Strait or South China Sea, China‚Äôs conventional capability can already surpass US. With Russia‚Äôs hostile nuclear force, it will be difficult for US to leverage its nuclear deterrence against China ‚Äú

‚ÄúA strategic alliance btw Russia and China is mutually beneficial and reinforcing, providing deterrence against Japan and India‚Äù

‚ÄúIf US can drive a wedge btw Russia and China, Putin will face certain defeat, and China will be next. We will go back to the old days of being anti-Russia and anti-US at the same time‚Äù

‚ÄúSome say why not take the chance to repair relations with US? Its goal for Russia is to disarm, but its goal for China is to completely stop our development and prosperity, make us a client state like Japan and Korea, buy its weapons, and remain only a cheap source of product‚Äù

‚ÄúChina will avoid conflict with US not proactively challenge US, but will use our power to force US to accept peaceful coexistence. Russia is the most important partner to achieve this goal. That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt abandon Putin during this war. This is in our long term interest‚Äù end

*P.S. I find it most amusing that while the Chinese Government tells the world repeatedly that China is neutral on Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, Comrade Hu is busy speaking the quiet part loud*

*The fatal flaw of Hu‚Äôs value free realist view of international relations is: Russia will assess future situation (Taiwan) the exact same way, based on its calculation of maximising its own interest, rather than repaying the debt China thinks it owes*",False,1647813313.0,t3_tiv67w,t3_tiv67w,,0,52,0,52,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Are Putin's days in the Kremlin numbered?  The expert indicated the date and the reason

Vladimir Putin has Parkinson's disease, and by July his immediate environment will remove him from power, says French specialist on Russia, Alexandre Adler, who shared his thoughts in an interview with RMF FM.  The historian knows people from the closest circle of the president of the Russian Federation, and his removal from power is to be demanded, among others, by  Russian Defense Minister.

The war in Ukraine is not going according to Vladimir Putin's plan, and the Russian offensive has been stopped.  According to Adler, a few of Putin's closest associates want to remove him from power, but they are waiting for the right moment.  Among them are Russia's intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu and Russia's ambassador to the Vatican, Alexander Avdeev.


Adler: Vladimir Putin is sick with Parkinson's

 According to Adler, Putin's popularity will drop significantly after the unsuccessful attack on Ukraine.  His associates will wait for the right moment to remove him from power.  The reasons are to be, among others  health problems of the president of Russia.  - Putin has the best doctors, takes about 10 medications a day, and when he shows up in public, you don't see he's sick.  His hands aren't shaking at all.  But there are mental changes - explains Adler in an interview with RMF FM.

According to the Americans, the information about Putin's illness is a leak controlled by the dictator's immediate entourage.  In this way, they want to prepare the ground for the events that are to take place in the coming days.  According to Adler, Putin is to realize that his associates want to remove him from power.


One of the scenarios is supposed to indicate that Naryshkin will rule after Putin.  According to Adler, the attack on Ukraine was related to a planned palace coup in Russia.  In this way, Putin wanted to increase his popularity.  At the moment, there is no indication of such a turn of events.  Reports indicate that Putin has become more impulsive and nervous.

 As Adler points out, the key figure is the Russian defense minister who is responsible for the final decision to use nuclear weapons.  Adler believes that Shoygu will not carry out Putin's order because he wants the war in Ukraine not to turn into a global conflict.",False,1647823510.0,t3_tiv67w,t3_tiv67w,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

> Holy shit, someone on Russian state TV just said that they want to escalate to using nuclear weaponry!

So the outlet for Russia‚Äôs single most jingoistic and extravagantly nationalistic voices said something dumb? Colour me surprised!

They say that sort of thing literally all. the. time. They did before the invasion, they will continue to do so in the future. Anything that some talking head says on Russian media should not be considered a pretext for something world-ending.

> New false flag has been announced. Fuck.

I wish I had gone back in time to document every single time a false flag has been announced and then taken by this thread to be a dramatic escalation/casus belli/sign of imminent nuclear war. This has happened *so goddamn much*, and most times nothing has come of it.

> All it takes is one accident or bad decision by NATO and we‚Äôre in WW3.

The entire goal of NATO and specifically the US is to avoid WW3 and MAD. It‚Äôs not as simple as it was in the world pre-nuclear weapons. One accident will not start war; there are almost certainly methods in place to de-escalate in a situation like this. And furthermore, a body run by the collective minds of the best intelligence and strategic agencies in the world can‚Äôt really make ‚Äòbad decisions‚Äô as such, or at least it‚Äôs incredibly difficult for them to do so.

The U.S. doesn‚Äôt seem particularly afraid of nuclear war, by the way. The NYT reported after the legendary ‚Äònuclear deterrence on high alert‚Äô announcement that [the US did not change their internal nuclear threat level.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/us/politics/putin-nuclear-alert-biden-deescalation.html)

> People said that Putin wasn‚Äôt going to invade Ukraine, and look what happened‚Ä¶

Define ‚Äòpeople.‚Äô Just about every government across the world came out and said that Putin was 100% unquestionably going to invade. The only ‚Äòpeople‚Äô that said that were a few niche loud voices, mostly on these threads. 

In any case, I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain the difference in severity and escalation between Putin invading Ukraine and Putin using a nuclear weapon on a NATO country.

> I‚Äôm sure everyone said before WWI that ‚Äòno way we‚Äôre going to war over an archduke‚Äô and WWII that ‚Äòno way we‚Äôre going to war, it‚Äôs just a local conflict in the Sudetenland‚Äô

COMPLETELY different situations. Completely. For multiple reasons. Most historians believe that WWI was almost inevitable anyway due to the rampant militarisation happening globally at the time; both conflicts had a messy and complex system of alliances that brought the world in, far more complex then ‚Äòtouching NATO = death, not touching NATO = you‚Äôre fine‚Äô; nuclear weapons and MAD didn‚Äôt exist in either conflict. To give just a few reasons.

> I feel like people who have [x slightly optimistic take] are in denial. We are in WW3 and nobody‚Äôs acknowledging it.

This is a classic fallacy on Reddit. Comments like this always seem to pop up once an hour as some sort of self-fashioned ‚Äòreality check takedown‚Äô for redditors, and they always get a big response. Optimistic takes are no more or less accurate than pessimistic ones. Common view here that the worst case scenario will always come true, and unfortunately those people think that their views have been confirmed by how COVID has gone up til now.

Also, by that same standard, there are multiple conflicts since WW2 that we could have labeled WW3. If your standard is ‚Äòforeign countries supplying weapons and other resources to a nation while not getting involved themselves,‚Äô that is.

When Europeans think of wwii, they‚Äôre thinking of the actual cost of war. The destruction of cities, the desperation, the mass, indiscriminate death. And the horrors still resonate, with terrain permanently changed by bombings and trenches, and how undetonated bombs are still found all over the place. 

Americans, for one, have a much shorter memory. Two, wwii was mostly a positive for us. A time of unity, strength, and war with just cause. Nostalgic, really. And afterwards, our path to global hegemony was set. In some ways, I think it has the same feeling as the revolutionary war. 

We don‚Äôt have any point of reference for being invaded, not‚Ä¶ever. The only thing that comes close is Pearl Harbor, or 9/11. Even typing the first paragraph, the only thing that comes to mind is movie clips, not actual anxiety. 

So, when Europeans are thinking of WWIII, they‚Äôre thinking of existential threats. Americans are thinking, perhaps subconsciously, of another new beginning. 

The American fear is not of a world war, but a war with *Russia*. That‚Äôs the Cold War, the looming threat of nuclear annihilation. Honestly, I think that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much hand wringing abt nukes in this thread.

This game has been on the top of Twitch and Youtube for the last few years and is a HUGE moneymaker for this Russian-based company. It's an FPS made by Russian developers (and a head developer known as Nikita, who happens to like weapons and guns a lot).

The game's theme/story arc is focused around an evil Western/American corporation known as TerraGroup, and a Russian government military force is made to investigate this evil TerraGroup. You can choose to play either as the Russians or the Americans. Obviously it's fiction - but it's interesting. The game is **incredibly** realistic, and honestly some of the footage from the war in Ukraine looks like it can be straight out of Tarkov, from the gun types to the gun sounds to the general architecture of the buildings and land.

Some of the devs include former Russian special forces guys according to Nikita. The game even has it's own popular [mini-series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9OIT7W24V8), where some of the actors are also possibly former/retired Russian military guys. [They also cooperate with Ars Arma](https://forum.escapefromtarkov.com/topic/90316-the-beginning-of-cooperation-between-battlestate-games-and-ars-arma/), which is a Russian tactical gear manufacturer and provides gear to Russian special forces.

The game, and the head devs, used to post Tweets daily. Sometimes even talking about political issues.

Since the invasion, they've gone completely rogue. No posts, no updates, no opinions. Nobody is saying anything. It would be strange to me if the heads of this company were very pro-Putin, while capitalizing and profiting from a primarily western market, and I don't know what to think because it is a game that I used to enjoy.

Russia has practically zero combat power to expand their invasion beyond Ukraine‚Äôs borders, overall soldier morale is low, and they‚Äôre currently struggling with supply lines. The army would collapse if they attempted to expand further, and Putin‚Äôs men know this. 

For those saying NATO doesn‚Äôt want to risk an all out escalation with Russia, Russia is not suicidal. As hard as it is to believe, there *has* been some strategical reasoning behind each choice Russia has taken thus far. Yes, most of them are based on horribly flawed calculus, but if you observe Russia‚Äôs overall behavior domestically and internationally, they‚Äôre fully aware that sending nukes is sure to be apocalyptical for themselves and they are desperate to avoid ending up in that position. Hell, they were too chickenshit to even launch one of their own hypersonic missiles at a valuable target, instead wasting it on some random Ukrainian farm structure in the middle of nowhere. 

That said, Russia can still rebound in their local invasion to an extent, seeing how they‚Äôve seemingly succeeded in their siege of Mariupol (let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, the city is a total horror show) and could secure its port, and they are having moderate success overall in the Donbass region. Their forces are currently being pushed back in other regions like Kyiv, but it‚Äôs hard to tell yet if this signifies an absolute victory for Ukraine or if Russian forces are retreating at least in part tactically. 

So despite Russia‚Äôs obvious limitations, this war could still have devastating effects strictly constrained within Ukraine, for Ukrainians. They need help. The numbers of weapons and aid the West has been pledging to send, which, while certainly promising, and impressive at least on paper, will most likely help ensue an eventual Ukrainian victory *at the cost of dragging out the war.*",1647829422.0,1647828884.0,t3_tiv67w,t3_tiv67w,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

I fear that keeping Russia in a stalemate will result in Putin feeling humiliation.  We know the bastard's a killer and has no shame so he would likely do more (WMDs).  I would like them to evacuate as many unable or unwilling to fight to the border.  There are still 41-42 million people in the countryside.  Perhaps the West can offer to drop sanctions on Food and fertilizer in exchange for an exit from the cities for all civilians and return of all those in Russia.  Give them any Russian prisoners. That's a win win win.  The world needs the food and fertilizer (and starving migrants are just another crisis needing more fuel and food from Europe), trapped Ukranians are freed, and Russia does get some cash flow and their citizens are not punished as much.  Once the vulnerable are out get as much equipment out over weeks and then evacuate the cities.  What's there other than symbolism?  Let Russia have it.  Then begin guerilla warfare in earnest: strike at them and disappear.  Chemical and biological weapons less useful in a dispersed population. The West will supply you indefinitely.  Just a thought and of course the Ukrainians know their country better than I.  However the meetings and other crap are just stall tactics by Russia.  I love hearing serious ideas.

When I look at who benefits most from this war in Ukraine, I see mostly China - and to a lesser degree the ""old world"" powers of Europe, France, UK, Germany.. Committing the USA, and democratic states in Europe to a long and brutal war benefits China in every sense. Cheap oil from Russia, weakened US influence in Asia, particularly in the South China Sea and  a ""look over here"" opportunity for other soft influence in the South Pacific and Antarctic. China has manipulated an irrational Russian President, playing on his deluded dreams of returning Russia to a powerful state by violence.
On the other side, The British, French, Germans and probably a powerful component of US politics think Putin, a Wiley and capable player that manipulated US elections and outfoxed Europe into becoming reliant on Russia's oil, has finally fucked up. The Ukraine war is unwinnable for Russia. They will probably beat Ukraine into submission, but will fight an insurgency for decades, with the insurgents financed and supplied by the West - who will escalate and de-escalate, threaten and back down, run the information war with the aim of bleeding Russia dry. They will succeed. The fact that a lot of Ukrainian lives will be lost is a price they are willing to pay - they have had and lost empires, been invaded or invaded others and rebuilt on shifting sands of power and influence for centuries. China is a relatively new player in world politics but is learning quickly - it will be interesting to see how they balance their desire for economic and military power with an increasingly hostile grouping of democratic states - it is a dangerous game, when their vassel state pawn, Russia, is a formidable nuclear power.

During this time, the Russian army has turned many peaceful cities into ruins, destroying more than 3,500 pieces of civilian infrastructure. Tens of thousands of ordinary people were wounded, more than 5,000, including more than 100 children, were killed. It is impossible to calculate the exact number of dead. This criminal aggression must be stopped, and the perpetrators must be punished.  
>  
>None of the stated objectives of the ""special operation"" have been fulfilled, the Ukrainians have rallied together and are fighting back in a united effort against the aggressor. Hundreds of units of Russian military equipment have been destroyed, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been wounded. 560 were taken prisoner, and more than 11,000 were laid to rest in Ukrainian soil. No one is in any hurry to retrieve the bodies.Radina will leave you, son. Always.

>The Russian economy is destroyed. What's ahead is default, isolation, poverty and hunger, which will make the dashing 1990s look like a fairy tale by comparison.

I'm not sure who's holding back negotiations. If Ukraine is demanding territorial integrity, then i think they are being too unrealistic. If Putin wants full demilitarization (no troops), then i think he's being unrealistic.

The problem is that Putin is completely satisfied with the status quo. Yes, they are losing units, but that's because they are still going on offensive. If they decide to hunker down into defensive posture, they're losses will greatly diminish.

Today it became known about another terrible crime against humanity committed by the racist occupation forces ‚Äì the shooting of 56 elderly people in Luhansk region.

In the town of Kreminna on March 11, the Russian occupiers cynically and purposefully fired from a tank at a home for the elderly.

56 residents who lived to their old age in the house died on the spot. The survivors, 15 people, were abducted by the occupiers and taken to the occupied territory in Svatove to the regional geriatric boarding school.

It is still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy to bury the dead old people.

This is another act of horrific genocide ‚Äì the extermination of the civilian population of Ukraine. For every such crime, for every innocent life taken, the leadership of the aggressor state must be held accountable in all the severity of international criminal law.

I call on the International Criminal Court to take this fact into account in the investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the Russian political and military leadership.

I ask UN member states to speed up the establishment of the Special Military Tribunal. Racist criminals must bear full responsibility for the atrocities in Ukraine!

Also, Russia has an easy time reinforcing Mariupol by sea, by train and road from the infrastructure they firmly control in rebel territory and in Crimea.

- States they are not looking to escalate, there will be no direct engagement
- Hints the mission may take place outside of NATO framework, even though it will be conceived of and discussed upcoming NATO summit
- Gets upset when asked the very simple question: ""How is it going to work when NATO and Russian troops inevitably come into close contact""? 

Best guess, these NATO countries intend to send a peace keeping mission to Ukraine, but do it OUTSIDE of the NATO framework, meaning they can't invoke article 5 if they get attacked while inside Ukraine. But probably they want to keep the right that if Russia retaliates by sending a couple missiles to some Polish cities for example, they can invoke that. Hence also his remark that it would be ""complicated"" in terms of international law. 

While I really think it's an interesting idea. I just don't see how Russia is going to interpret this as anything else than a NATO intervention. There's every chance that in order to prevent it they will up the ante and just state it's NATO wearing a disguise trying to enter the conflict and that they reserve the right to retaliate however they see fit, including on NATO countries. Then NATO has to make another choice, either lose face or continue, which would then put Russia in the position to lose face or escalate.

The relations between the allied forces went sour very very quickly and it was apparent that the former allies (that is USSR vs UK, USA, FR) would‚Äôve quickly come to blows between themselves if the whole continent had not just had a 6 year war, which destroyed a large share of Europe and killed and displaced millions. It was the threat seen from the USSR and its influence in East Germany and *from* east Germany that pushed the allies in west Germany to quickly decide to envelope west Germany into the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù fold not some innate desire for Germany to be quickly put back into the good graces. Yes, there is truth that lessons were learned after WWI and Germany wasn‚Äôt humiliated in ways it was post-WWI, but the mood in west Europe certainly wasn‚Äôt all ‚Äúlet‚Äôs teach Germany how to be a good and proper European state‚Äù. Western Germany was deemed as crucial for rebuilding Europe due to the natural resources in the land - had that fallen to Soviets, rebuilding Europe would‚Äôve been much much more difficult and a slower effort. Military wise, ussr was seen as a threat and w-Germany needed military protection and reinforcements but nobody was going to let w-Germany have any power in protecting themselves, so allies agreed that W-Germany could join NATO on the condition that allies themselves, mostly the US, would put its bases there (IIRC that‚Äôs basically the start of Germany hosting US armed forces on its soil), also because this relieved French fears over German re-militarisation. Plus there‚Äôs the fact that although supposedly Germans who had been working in high positions in Nazi germany were not supposed to have positions in new W-Germany, many still ended up being in positions of authority because there simply weren‚Äôt really replacements for them (again, I may misremember) so the people, who knew about things already, were quickly also the ones who worked in the new and democratic  west German government and municipal authorities.

Nukes on Ukraine would draw in Poland, out of self preservation. Of that I am confident, though note that I am simply an observer, I have no access to classified information.

A Polish response means their troops move into Ukraine. They also back a Belarusian coup, where the military, either with Poland's direct or tacit support, overthrow Lukashenko.

The combined forces of Poland, Ukraine, and potentially (though not requiring) a flipped Belarus, absolutely kerb-stomp Russian forces out of Ukraine, potentially further...

Why would this be effective? Put simply, Russia cannot retaliate. None of their aircraft would reach Poland intact. They could try their supersonic bombers but just don't have enough. So, the only retaliation on Polish soil would be missiles. Here's the rub. Even if NATO left Poland in the cold militarily, there are tons of US assets in Poland. There's no combination of missile strikes that hit Polish military installations without them also impacting US bases. Nuclear, even on civilian centres, is out unless Russia wants a retaliatory US strike, and conventional munitions targeting Polish bases will overspill anyway. The only turf on which Russia can safely strike Polish forces is Ukraine. Ergo, a Russian military defeat via conventional weapons as Poland + Ukraine easily overwhelms the full force of the Russian armed forces.

So, Poland could in theory attack in response to Russian escalation and be all but untouchable in return. If Putin was stupid enough to respond, he pulls in all of NATO and it's game over.

This all discounts the additional caveat that China is duty bound to defend Ukraine from nuclear aggression as part of a 2013 trade deal.

Despite the siege being in place and the widespread destruction the Russians have incurred heavy losses in material, soldiers, and experienced officers.  The only reason they're trying this trick is b/c they know that they WILL take heavy casualties if they try and take this city by force.  The Southeast is pretty much the only part of the Russian campaign that's been able to build momentum, but at the cost of a metric ton of blood.  The separatists especially are a big part of the assault force here, and they only have about 25,000 guys in total that are supposed to be participating in the entire campaign.  Bare in mind they've probably shouldered the majority of the fighting alongside the VDV have also endured horrific casualties.

Urban fighting is the most difficult type of fighting that an offensive army can undertake.  Urban fighting in a destroyed city is even more dangerous.  Maps are useless b/c artillery dramatically changes the landscape, defenders have any number of places to hide in buildings, wreckage, subterranean sections in major cities, and any forays by the attacker into the city are limited by how much ammunition the units have.  Defenders are able to identify chokepoints to maximize carnage, have ammo stores built up in the city, and can actively scavenge supplies off of dead enemies who bring their own supplies into the city to survive.

You add up all of those advantages, and then throw in the Russian military issuing a blanket death sentence and you've pushed someone into a corner.  A cornered animal will always bite at you if you don't leave an alternative, and the Russians are doubling down on the brutality that has characterized their entire battle plan.  Which unfortunately for them only pisses off the Ukrainians even further to fight onward.

The Russians were counting on being able to wrap up Mariupol quickly so that troops could be freed up to advance further West to capture the coast.  A prolonged battle in the city is going to not only push that timeline back, and will cost them valuable manpower they will need to maintain the sieges they're implementing.  The Russians could've bypassed the city entirely while leaving the siege in place, but their dear leader is too thick headed to let people openly resist him.  So he'll try and make the city an example.  He think he's achieving some military victory, but he's actually creating an Alamo situation.",False,1647822855.0,t3_tiv67w,t1_i1gyue1,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Horrific, but relatively contained.

The invasion of Ukraine, on the other hand, has huge ripples economically, geopolitically, and militarily. It's an attack by one nation on another, surrounded by some fairly substantial economies.

Ukraine was really an emerging power in Eastern Europe, something of a tech hub, like Estonia too. It had a much more global economy than 1994 Rwanda, and it's a *major* wheat exporter, the ""breadbasket of Europe"", and it has a lot of natural resources including as yet underutilised gas and oil. The response has been much more global too. Rwanda was not a proxy war, nor did it put Russia and the US at loggerheads. This has the potential to overspill in a way Rwanda never did.

Castle Bravo was an ill-fated thermonuclear test, which was about 15 Megatons (it was supposed to be only 6 MT). 

Some of the islanders who were relocated after the 1954 test, were moved back in 1970. Later, they found that the well was contaminated with high levels of Strontium isotopes, and the people had absorbed high levels of Cesium 137. Not necessarily deadly, but, definitely caused higher incidence of cancer and other health problems. 

Hiroshima was 15kt. So Castle Bravo was about 100x larger.  That's more along the lines of a ""Strategic"" weapon. (especially typical in the Chinese arsenal). 

The US M388 was a very small tactical nuclear device with a yield of about 20 tons (equivalent of TNT). (I don't believe there's anything like this deployed by any side today).

The natural reasources (probably more the extraction and refinement capacity in the Rhineland) did play a role, but in general I think it was more just because of it being the geographic and political lynchpin in the entire conflict between east and west. 

Notably, France, the UK and the US had been parliamentary democracies for a while - enlightenment humanism having essentially informed their political foundations. Germany contributed a lot to those philosophical foundations, too - then tore them down with all its might for 12 years... but afterwards was a still a natural candidate for integration into a liberal-democratic order - especially since it was pretty well known that Russia/the Soviet Union was *not* going to follow that path, and has gigantic geopolitical ambitions.

Not sure why you'd be downvoted, though - that was pretty much spot on.

Of course Germany didn't change all on its own. It's pretty evident that such a radical break, rebuilding and critical reflection at the past of one's own nation doesn't happen unless enforced by overwhelming outside force... no other country I'm aware of has done that (and Japan wasn't forced to).

The issue of fears of German re-militarization were even alive and well in 89/90, if you look at the talks between e.g. Gorbatchev, Shevardnadze and Baker. The west convinced the USSR to allow a reunified Germany into NATO in order to prevent its isolation which might lead to independent re-militarization - noting that neither the USSR nor France are happy with that idea.",1647828240.0,1647825944.0,t3_tiv67w,t1_i1h350g,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

His thesis is that after the initial emissaries got sent out, the were able to successfully modernize, beat imperial russia in a humiliating fashion, and then start to successfully take over the entire region.

Russia's problems here are very, very deep and centuries longstanding.  This is not an issue of a single anti-western leader.

As others here have stated, to recreate a scenario like the rebuilding of Germany will likely require:

* Complete and unconditional surrender of Russia.
* The West (whatever that might be) runs Russia... *entirely* for decades.
* Complete control of state media combined with education/propaganda/whatever-you-want-to-call-it to dispel the last few decades of state-driven propaganda.
* Control and usage of education of children in Russia.  Let's not be shy about it.  Call it de-programming.  Call it programming.  But we would have to *control* a nationwide cultural-level reinvention.
* Massive control and elimination of corruption at all levels.  Again, tied to the above - this has to be instilled deep into their culture.  The past ways have to be destroyed.
* Probably will require wealth and income caps.  The current billionaire class will need to be eliminated.
* Ease Democracy in slowly.

This is nigh to impossible.  But that doesn't mean we should trick ourselves into thinking a ""pro-western"" leader in Russia is going to help much.

It is very strange how there were rumblings of an invasion way back in December. 

However for an invasion supposedly planned way in advance, there has been an astounding lack of preparation and maintenance on equipment. From the way the Russian forces have acted so far, there has been no clear plan B except to seemingly shell civilian areas. The original plan was to force zelenskiy‚Äôs administration out of Kyiv in three days. 

Based on these two facts above, at the best it was malicious compliance, at the worst it was straight up sabotage. 

How Russian forces managed to lose so many people is demoralizing for them as they expected to take Ukraine quickly and with minimal losses.

Additionally, there was rumors a while back that Putin had fired some staff relating to the fact that the invasion was going poorly. If we take that at face value, we can probably assume that they were not 100% with Putin‚Äôs plan.

Even though that is the case, I believe shoigu pretended to be fully on board with Putin‚Äôs plan and drew plans that he knew would damage Russia‚Äôs credibility. 

It seems that Putin also sought advice from the Chinese government, as the timing was too coincidental (the invasion occurred just a few days after the olympics). With China wanting to see how the west would react, they probably allowed Putin to continue but only after the olympics had finished. This could be a test case for China and Taiwan in the future. 

Back to my main point, shoigu has committed a very low number of troops if the goal was to gradually take Ukraine. It didn‚Äôt seem like he was planning on a plan B at all if Russia couldn‚Äôt take Kyiv in three days. So basically shoigu committed to a plan that he knew would fail, leading to the current drawn out situation we have now. I have no idea why Putin has not sacked him yet, but maybe him being unwell is true and that unofficially a military junta led by shoigu and gerasimov has effectively taken over the internal running of Russia.",1647825537.0,1647825319.0,t3_tiv67w,t1_i1h3gu4,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

It makes sense that the oft-cited geographical ""safety"" of the US and its lack of history with city-razing wars at home would lead to a somewhat different perspective on relative threats - thank you for clarifying! 

To clear up potential remaining confusion on my part - if I may try to recapitulate your point in my own words: You were wondering whether this lack of conventional military threats and lack of ""living/visible memory"" of the destruction of modern war is to a significant extent a driver behind the many questions on these threads asking and voicing fears about nuclear exchange - to the potential neglect of more currently pressing issues, i.e. the horrors of conventional war currently being waged in Ukraine 

(sometimes my reading comprehension isn't too great - is that a fair summary?)

In which case - yeah, I'd agree that might well be a driver. 
But don't discount age-distribution either - for many people on here, this is their first time being confronted with the rather direct possibility of military escalation between Russia and the West - and nuclear annihilation. 

Plus - while I think at this stage nuclear exchange is still a very unlikely outcome, the threat level has definitely risen a lot since this began - and it is rightfully an *existentially scary thing* (not just to people ""new to this"") - made worse by voices diminishing it by arguing for further escalation.",False,1647834995.0,t3_tiv67w,t1_i1hjrel,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,\[3\] and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, American president Franklin D. Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.  In general, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under Roosevelt, a stance that is widely considered a major error in their strategic thinking.

There's some lines you have to risk... everything really. If you want to have a society that stands for what is good, you actually have to stand up against evil. Not just talk about it, or let lesser countries sacrifice their people. You have to be willing to risk losing to win. And the longer you ho hum and let all your allies get salamied up, the harder that will be when you are the last one standing.

I get it. We live in a society where it's hard to imagine war, or nuclear war on our doorstep. We have more to lose than we have ever had. Not only because of nukes, but also because of how advanced and comfortable our societies become. Most couldn't imagine not having running water for a week. 

The thing is, mutually assured destruction is anything but assured. Odds are, this would be a conventional battle. And if Putin really thinks he's going to lose, he would need the ones turning the keys and don't have bunkers in the Urals to be okay with it. He would also need to nuclear arsenal to be as fearsome as it's claimed, similar to how the Russian airforce and tank army was to be. 



Still, maybe he would do that. Maybe people would turn the keys, maybe the arsenal would be everything it's claimed. It would still mean we did the right thing. If we only ever fight overwhelming evil when we are CERTAIN we will win, we will lose it all anyways.

The US is sending tons of weapons over, but that doesn't mean that if Russia attacked their base in Germany where probably a lot of these weapons are coming from that NATO wouldn't be invoked.

I also think that attacking troops that are not actually fighting you would also trigger NATO. An army attacking the army of another nation is definitely an attack on that nation.

Prove me wrong. Prove otherwise. My source is below.  Please read before replying.

‚ÄúHow were the Taliban formed?
The group was formed in the early 1990s by Afghan mujahideen, or Islamic guerilla fighters, who had resisted the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979‚Äì89) with the covert backing of the CIA and its Pakistani counterpart, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI). They were joined by younger Pashtun tribesmen who studied in Pakistani madrassas, or seminaries; taliban is Pashto for ‚Äústudents.‚Äù Pashtuns comprise a plurality in Afghanistan and are the predominant ethnic group in much of the country‚Äôs south and east. They are also a major ethnic group in Pakistan‚Äôs north and west.‚Äù

Every contract soldier, hardened separatist, and conscript soldier will only further erode the Russian Army's ability to function.  Russia is huge and win or lose in Ukraine their ability to maintain Putin's standard of ""national security"" will be undercut.

Turkey joined in 1951. I think the text concerning Turkey may have been written that way because Turkey was not, at the time, considered fully ""European"".

I've read quite a few opinions on this, and the gist seems to be that it doesn't matter if Hawai'i is *technically* part of NATO. 

1) A country can choose whether or not to invoke Article 5. It's not likely that the US would do this if some small (crazy) country attacked Hawai'i - the US would handle it themselves.

2) Any attack on Hawai'i would almost certainly be part of a much larger war involving the US, and so would trigger Article 5 itself.
