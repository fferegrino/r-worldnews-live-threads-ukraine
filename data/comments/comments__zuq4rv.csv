Day 305 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Surprisingly today was actually a pretty quiet day and the expected big missile strike didn’t happen, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t happen in the next couple of days, because it almost certainly will. They still have the New Year’s Eve to ruin, and I doubt they will miss that chance. They still were trying to scare us by flying some of their bombers in Belarus for a couple of hours during the day. 

As soon as it was reported that the bombers were MiG-31K it was already apparent that they do not intend to do a missile strike today. That specific plane carries their “super-weapon” hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which they are very proud of. They used like 5 of those missiles total during this war, and at least one of them straight up malfunctioned and landed somewhere in a field in Russia. Yeah, a “very scary” weapon, that doesn’t work even though it’s one of their best and newest weapons.

The recent news/rumors coming out of Kreminna frontline seem promising, and our officials are hinting at something happening there right now, some are even suggesting that our forces might already be in the town itself, which would be amazing, but we definitely need to wait for confirmations. Kreminna being liberated right now would be one hell of a Christmas present. Merry Christmas everyone!

> 📌 Over the last three months, fatigue has clearly accumulated, the optimism has visibly gone, and in its place has come despondency. Not anxiety yet, but sadness and disappointment.

> 📌 Very pronounced misunderstanding, why Ukraine does not surrender, why there is no internal debate about the need to surrender, they are doomed. As it seems to him, the further this all drags on, the more there will be wasted casualties on both sides, and the more expensive will be the ""price"" of a future Russian victory, which he still believes in, and this upsets him greatly.

> 📌 The same misunderstanding applies to the West: is the desire to crush Russia so strong that they will fight to the last Ukrainian? Disappointment and pain that everything is not going the way it would seem logical to him: there is no increase in disagreements between Western countries, no rise of a more conservative and nationally oriented domestic Western opposition, no rebellion of the masses and so on. So it's all kind of there, but too slow.

> 📌 The war with Ukraine has finally become perceived as a civil war: Putin blatantly blames the Americans for ""first pulling us apart, dividing us, and then pitting us against each other. Another very revealing phrase: ""No one wants the unification of the Russian people. There is a sense of fatalism, doom, and loneliness. It's been a long time since Putin has shown himself to be like this. Or maybe never.

> 📌 Nevertheless, he is not ready for any kind of peace. ""Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war"" - this phrase should not be taken as a change of position and willingness to negotiate, it is more a manifestation of internal shock at the fact that the West so ""consumes"" ""our"" Ukraine (yes, that is how he sees it), multiplied by emotional rejection and lack of understanding of external hostility - we came to save, historical truth is ours, but the justice will not prevail. He does not blame himself for anything.

> 📌 An important evolution: if at the beginning of the war it seemed to Putin that now he took everything into his own hands and reshapes the world, now he feels himself again as a victim of circumstances - the war as a result of systematic efforts of the USA, which brought Russia to this ""stage"" of fratricidal war.

> 📌 There is no regret for his own actions. ""We had no other way out"", ""we can't retreat""... All this is uttered already with sadness, but without any doubt that it is necessary to continue. ""Chicken Little by Little"" is his view of how Russia will behave in the coming months. That is, to slowly crush and strangle Ukraine, avoiding large-scale fighting. One senses a readiness for a protracted confrontation. Although there is a ""bitter"" emotion about the human casualties, but in his perception the existence of Russia is at stake, and therefore there is no stopping.

> 📌 There is a noticeable sense of guilt towards the military. The fact that he has to throw them into the ""furnace"" of the war clearly causes him moral pain, and much more pronounced than his sense of responsibility to his mothers. But, of course, he puts the main blame on the West - if they had not supported Kiev, everything would have been over by now.

> 📌 He is clearly ""wound up"" with an emotional attitude towards the patriots. His words about being moved to tears by the patriotism of young people are clear evidence of how his administration has generally learned to hit the right strings. But at the heart of it is an emerging sense of guilt that he got millions into this war and that it went the way it did. This feeling ""asks"" for collective solidarity and constant external support. Otherwise the burden becomes unbearable. Perhaps that's why everything ""truly patriotic"" touches him so much - it makes him feel lighter.

> 📌 Lastly, there is a clear division in Putin's perception of the real patriots, for whom he has a very reverent attitude and reverence, and the non-patriots, whom he sees as a threat. This, of course, lays the foundation for the development of a more developed and ruthless system of distinguishing between ""friend"" and ""foe"", as well as mechanisms of protection against the latter.

Putin seems insurmountable in Russia, in total control.  More Hitler than Mussolini, if I'm to try for a comparison.  So that would suggest continued war and folly, with the destruction of Russia and perhaps Ukraine the only way this ends.  

Western appetite to support Ukraine seems healthy at this point, but not ravenous.  The whole endeavour is built on the backs of the Ukrainian people; even with more weapons, how much longer can they unilaterally shoulder the burden.

>	Contrary to the conclusion of the Venice Commission, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has approved a law criticized by judicial activists for undermining the independence of Ukraine’s Constitutional Court (CCU).

>	On 20 December, he signed law Parliament-approved law #7662 about the competition to select candidates for the Constitutional Court. Earlier in the day, the Venice Commission published its conclusion on the draft law, in which it stressed that:

>	The Advisory Group of Experts, which will vet candidates for the Constitutional Court, should include an additional seventh member from among international experts. This seventh independent expert will allow counterbalancing political influence on the commission.

>	**The decisions** of the Advisory Group of Experts **shall be binding**. **Under no circumstances can a candidate who has received their negative assessment become a judge of the Constitutional Court**.

>	The draft law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada currently provides for **six Advisory Group of Experts members, three of whom are independent experts**, and the rest are appointed by the President, Ukraine’s Parliament, and the Congress of Judges, and no decision can be made without the vote of the latter.

>	lThis is a clear signal that the [Venice] Commission insists on European values and principles of the rule of law, and no one will give Ukraine a discount because of the war and other circumstances,” said Mykhailo Zhernakov, Chairman of the Board of the DEJURE Foundation.

>	His organization has called on international partners to not delegate members to the AGE and on Ukrainian MPs to amend the law immediately:

>	In its current version, the law on the “reform” of the CCU does not take into account the recommendations of the Venice Commission and the calls of civil society. It also threatens democracy and European integration.

>	The President’s Office already controls five judges of the CCU. Soon three appointments under the Parliament’s quota, where the Servant of the People party has a monomajority, and two appointments under the quota of the Congress of Judges will take place.

>	If these appointments take place under the adopted and signed law, which does not ensure independent selection, as early as in spring, the political authorities will fully control the Constitutional Court. This is a direct threat to democracy in Ukraine.

>	The newly adopted law also violates Ukraine’s international obligations. The reform of the CCU is #1 among the seven priorities related to obtaining the EU candidate status and opening accession negotiations. The decision of the European Council to grant Ukraine candidate status clearly states that the reform must take place in accordance with the recommendations of the Venice Commission, which the law signed by the President ignores.

>	The law on Ukraine’s Constitutional Court: required for Ukraine’s European integration

>	On June 7, the European Commission recommended granting Ukraine an EU candidate status on the condition that the country will further implement a number of important reforms related, in particular, to the rule of law, oligarchs, corruption, and fundamental rights. At the same time, the French President stressed that if not for the war, Ukraine would not have received this status. On June 23, the EU finally granted Ukraine candidate status.

>	On November 23, the Venice Commission issued an urgent opinion on the draft law on improving the procedure for selecting candidates for the position of a judge of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on a competitive basis. The adoption of draft law No. 7662 is one of the seven EU requirements for Ukraine’s progress toward the European Union.

>	On December 13, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law No. 7662 as a whole. According to human rights activists, the current version of the document contains risks of usurpation of judicial power.

Unless I'm missing something, I'm not seeing the issue. The panel will have 6 members, 3 foreign independent experts, and 3 Ukrainians. The international commission wanted a seventh independent member to make it 4-3 independent-Ukraine. I'm not sure that's fair considering it IS Ukraine's court. I think 3-3 is fair considering the purpose is to determine suitability for being a judge.

So the foreign commission wants control of the selection process. I don't think that's fair. And I don't buy the stalemate argument. If the vote is 3-3, the tiebreaker should be to maintain the status quo, and vote no.",1671973175.0,1671971275.0,t3_zuq4rv,t3_zuq4rv,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Russia bombs Ukrainian electric infrastructure and somehow believes the thousands upon thousands of miles of main gas lines and main electric grid lines are protected by some ghost of Stalin?

They are big deal that they were totally off the table to move missile defense systems to Poland, let alone Ukraine.

Apparently people told stories about the patriots ever since like, gulf war type period, in that part of the world. It’s seen as a huge deal symbolically.

I hypothesize that it’s a big deal that Iran is going to try to give Russia ballistic missiles, and the patriots, as I understand, can be used at higher altitudes than other systems.

I surmise also that it’s a big deal because at some point Ukraine runs out of s300 missiles and the US basically said, ok we’ll stake your air defense of your sovereign country when Germany backed down to Poland requesting patriots be sent to Ukraine. Now another country will be like well the US gave them patriots so maybe just a few IFVs are ok.

I surmise also that this is Salami tactics to slowly upgrade Ukraine over time in tiny increments. Something seen as a big step, when taken as a series of tiny steps is less escalating than a big chunk. You don’t give them 20 HIMARS all at once, you give them 3, then 3 more, then a few more.

The guidance enhanced version is particularly effective because the missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. 

Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.

The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

Drivers and teams qualified to handle any other combination of both explosives and propellant on a flat bed truck are also qualified to handle the HIMARS/MLRS missile pod.  All parts of the logistic line are regular diesel mechanics, railway workers, and seapersons.  

The public description of the M31 testing included drop testing from absurd heights.  You could drive the forklift to second floor of a parking garage and drop the pod on the truck and crack the truck's suspension system but the warhead won't explode and the missile might still work.  

It is very possible that there are complications that i know nothing about.  However, whatever those complications are, that complication is a flaw and a missile without that flaw is superior.  Lockheed Martin as a corporation has some flaws but their engineers are really good.  The business end will latch onto any excuse to make the system more expensive.  If they can add a few $ thousand per missile and make it immune to stupid teenagers then that money gets spent.

Otherwise - they will not be fast tracked and can go through the very, very lengthy process of trying to clean up and prove that you are clean enough.

Just because they are in a war does not get them an automatic pass into the EU, they have to prove they are worthy and can manage the massive amount of funds that would pour into the country when accepted, without stealing most of it (as Romania and Bulgaria have done). They have to prove that their judicial system - ESPECIALLY THEY CONSTITUTIONAL COURT - is and will keep being independent and not suddenly change direction the moment a populist government takes power.

Proper education is absolutely the most effective and important defence against propaganda and the only thing that makes a functional democracy work.

That’s why places like Russia and China struggle. If you put propaganda into you school programs you are forever dooming your children to being unable to discern fact from fiction.

In the case of Russia and China, that is what the government wants.

The problems arise when you then expect those children to grow up in interact with the rest of the world in a positive way.

I need to be clear what “good” education means in this context. It’s teaching your children to look not at what is said, but to look at the motivation of the person who is speaking and asking questions why this person might have these views. It is teaching your children to gather information from several sources and look at each source with the skepticism until you can see patterns.

This doesn’t exist in simple propaganda. It doesn’t exist in religion (which is why religion has a limited role in politics), and it certainly does not exist in bad faith actors like Putin or Trump.

Yes. I agree with you, regardless of age, education is far more important.

The issue I have is media was much simpler prior to about 2005 when social media became a major source of news. There were limited sources. People in their 60s were already 40 something at that stage and relatively set their ways. There are, of course, plenty of exceptions.

I initially brought the drug to his attention after seeying mentions of it online , and tried it like, 4 times ? All amazing, but i always ended up in no time with a huge rash all over my face.

And one of the side effects being some very nasty skin necrosis or some such it always put an end to the experiment, that and feeling my head had a localised fever as time progressed.
