Russia is cutting off vital infrastructure in its efforts to break Ukraine, Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on a visit to Kyiv Saturday. 

In comments made at the International Summit of Food Security held in Ukraine’s capital, Morawiecki said Russia had “overestimated its own military potential and already knows that victory on the battlefield may not be achievable.” 

“Therefore, Moscow is reaching for other methods to break Ukraine. Instead of fighting soldiers, Russia is bringing death, starvation and hypothermia to civilians,” he continued.
  
“These methods of total warfare have long been in the Russian arsenal,” Morawiecki said, on what is the 90th annual memorial day for victims of the Holodomor, a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of people during the winter of 1932-33. 

“Russia is fighting to rebuild an empire and knows that an empire is built on bones and corpses of innocent people. Exactly like 90 years ago during the Holodomor times,” he added. 
Morawiecki’s comments come not only as the world faces a global food crisis escalated by Russia’s war, but as many Ukrainians are deprived of heating, water and electricity amid Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure.

Day 276 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a pretty quiet day; we had no missile strikes or drones this time. Some movement of the Russian S-300 launchers was spotted in Belgorod, which is what usually happens before a new missile strike, but nothing happened in the end. They did shell a school in Kupiansk today, and just in general that town is getting hit a lot recently. They pretty much always start destroying any place that they have lost, same with Kherson now.

Did they already run out of the Iranian drones? They have barely used any in recent weeks, at most sending only 5-15 of them at a time, usually along with a missile strike. This is basically nothing compared to the first weeks after they got them, when they were sending them at us non-stop and there were warnings about Shaheds being in the air all the time, but now it almost never happens anymore.

Here in Kharkiv we are still getting some blackouts, today half of my district was without electricity for about 6 hours starting from 10-11am depending on the location. Those are probably planned blackouts to stabilize the grid, but they are not the usual scheduled blackouts that last for 3 hours at a time, which will apparently already resume next week. 

What is really surprising and amazing is that power in Kherson is already getting restored, and it has barely been 2 weeks since it was liberated. Today the critical infrastructure is already being turned back on, with civilian housing getting electricity next. I thought it would take far longer to restore electricity in Kherson as Russians destroyed the energy infrastructure there before running away, but the fact that it is already basically restored is mind blowing.

[Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/us-military-intervention-afghanistan-ukraine-war/672265/)

> American military aid to Ukraine has been remarkably effective, especially in comparison with the long, ill-fated U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan. A recent statement by General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, helps explain why. “Ukrainians are not asking for anyone to fight for them,” Milley said. “They don’t want American soldiers, or British, or German, or French, or anybody else to fight for them. They will fight for themselves.” The Ukrainians want only the means to defend themselves against Russian invaders, he said, adding that the United States would provide support “for as long as it takes.” By providing advanced weaponry and reliable intelligence, the United States and its allies have allowed Ukraine to inflict large losses on Russian armed forces and roll back earlier Russian territorial gains.

> America’s failure in Afghanistan, by contrast, seemed so complete in 2021 that it may have encouraged Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The American response to this year’s crisis—providing a high level of military support without deploying American forces—is not just the best way to help Ukraine secure its independence and thwart Putin. It also offers a model for how the U.S. should define its international military involvement.

>Although the decline of U.S. power has been significantly overstated in some quarters, America’s economic decline relative to the rest of the world is real. Economic strength and technological strength have become more dispersed around the globe, and over time military strength is likely to follow the same pattern. This is one reason avoiding boots-on-the-ground interventions will become ever more of an imperative. The presumption that the U.S. needs to deploy ground forces in a fighting capacity if it wants to achieve meaningful results from interventions has been evident again and again since the 1980s. Yet the reality has often been the opposite. The more the U.S. takes over and inserts its own forces into a conflict, the more expensive and, in most cases, counterproductive the intervention becomes. Such conflicts are also more polarizing for American society—as U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan demonstrates. Meanwhile, avoiding ground wars but relying on financial aid, advanced technology, intelligence, and even diplomatic coordination and outreach is something the U.S. actually can do effectively.

> The shambolic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kabul—after two decades of effort, many billions of dollars, and many civilian and military deaths—ended one of the most counterproductive and wasteful interventions that the U.S. has ever staged. Americans had lavished resources on the official Afghan army, but it put up only the meekest of resistance to the advancing Taliban before melting away. Some Afghan soldiers even changed sides. Within days after the U.S. departure, the Taliban, which the Americans had deposed in 2001, returned to power—making the U.S. look demoralized and indecisive to, among other observers, the Russian government. When combined with an ongoing American strategic pivot toward emerging conflicts in East Asia, the outcome in Afghanistan seemed to preclude a strong U.S. intervention on Ukraine’s behalf. Indeed, many commentators argued that helping Ukraine would be pointless, because an American commitment would not make a material difference in stopping the Russian assault.

> But in fact, the U.S. has helped the Ukrainians not only resist the initial onslaught, but begin driving Russian forces back. Washington has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with a range of equipment, including both supplies for individual soldiers, such as body armor and small arms, and large, sophisticated weaponry, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. Ukrainian forces are also receiving expedited training and regular support—from outside Ukraine’s borders, notably—on how to maintain and repair American-made military equipment. The extensive real-time intelligence cooperation between Washington and Kyiv has given the Ukrainian military the ability to strike vital Russian facilities quickly and effectively.

> Impressively and somewhat surprisingly, the kind of intervention that the U.S. has overseen in Ukraine has helped reinvigorate NATO. The alliance, which seemed close to moribund a year ago, has a renewed sense of purpose and will soon gain two strategically important members: Finland and Sweden. Being a member of NATO now looks like a great strategic asset—as Ukraine’s desire to join it demonstrates. Western assistance for Ukraine has been so effective that some voices are now arguing Ukraine must be restrained by the U.S. and forced to negotiate, lest the war become too embarrassing for Putin.

> The differences between America’s roles in Ukraine and Afghanistan suggest a rule for the future: The United States should avoid direct fighting overseas to the extent possible and should intervene in wars only to support peoples and nations that want to fight for themselves. Ukrainians have fought for their country with tenacity and skill, mastered complex weapons systems at their own initiative, and maintained high morale. The U.S. is aiding them, but it is the Ukrainians—everyday soldiers, senior generals, civilians under bombardment, top government officials, and diplomats marshaling international support—who are ultimately determining their own fate.

> Although the 2001 U.S. intervention in Afghanistan received early support from multiple Afghan factions, U.S. forces bore the burden of exercising military control as time passed. The abortive attempt to create a new Afghan army yielded a force apparently lacking independence of thought and action. The same seems to have been the case for the U.S.-backed Afghan government, which was unable to command the loyalty of enough Afghans to hold power without American military support.

> Sadly, the U.S. frequently forgets lessons from history. In Vietnam, the U.S. ended up sabotaging its own efforts by gradually sidelining the army of South Vietnam and regularly undermining the South Vietnamese government’s legitimacy. In replacing local forces, American military leaders reasoned that more U.S. involvement would achieve key goals, without appreciating how the deployment of more American personnel reshaped and complicated the conflict.

> Many of America’s greatest Cold War successes derived from helping one side in a conflict rather than sending U.S. troops to fight. In the 1980s, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, American aid to the local mujahideen was extremely effective in helping them repel a far more technologically advanced military power. Elsewhere, aid to dissident groups opposing communism in Eastern Europe paid off handsomely. Basic support ultimately helped make the struggle for political rights in Eastern Europe impossible for a declining Soviet Union to manage.

> While the downsides of direct deployment of U.S. troops have grown clearer, the benefits of showing restraint and scaling American intervention to help others fight for themselves have grown. The lessons of Afghanistan and Ukraine should inform American planning about, for instance, how best to help Taiwan defend itself against a future invasion from mainland China. As the Ukrainians have shown, American equipment is often generations better than that of other powers. Decades of heavy investment in satellites and other intelligence-collection devices have allowed the U.S. to provide support in a variety of ways. The war in Ukraine proves that the U.S. can provide more effective strategic aid than any other country in the world—without necessarily having to rely on sending its own troops.

>The Ukrainians want at least four systems that the West has not provided and is unlikely to: long-range surface-to-surface missiles known as ATACMS that could hit Russia and Crimea; Western fighter jets; Western tanks; and a lot more advanced air defense, said Mark F. Cancian, a former White House weapons strategist who is now a senior adviser at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies.
>The ATACMS, with a range of some 190 kilometers, or about 118 miles, will not be given for fear they could hit Russia; the tanks and fighter jets are just too complicated, requiring a year or more to train in how to use and maintain. As for air defense, Mr. Cancian said, NATO and the United States deactivated most of their short-range air defense after the Cold War, and there is little to go around. Producing more can take up to two years.

But the US has thouands in stockpiles and it is likely the war will go on for more than a year, so why not start the process now? UA should have spare manpower so even if the training is useless it should not harm the war effort.

1. ATACMS will likely be given once the fight actually comes to Crimea, probably first on a case-by-case basis. With logistics running full-tilt, the current Pentagon argument against delivery is quite simple: a pod is a pod, and six smaller rockets can effectively engage and eliminate six targets instead of one. 
2. Training has already started on F-16s, so sources have said. But this as stated will take time. But starting training makes no sense if there is no intention on making them available the the time comes. 
3. Abrams tanks are very complex and thirsty, true, but more so about twice as heavy as the MBTs in use now. In a muddy terrain this is not good, and the roads and bridges aren't up for them, so getting them to the front would be tricky too. Overall it's a logistics problem again, not desire. Being mechanically complicated is not the most important issue (but still a true statement) 
4. And as for air defense, we're creatively throwing everything we can at it. HAWK missiles, for example, may be outdated but seem a good fit for drones and cruise missiles, so we're pulling them out of wherever they've been mothballed. 

One thing the US does extremely well is understanding that war is made from big complex systems — their logistics is top-notch. If six smaller rockets is more efficient then that is what you should use. And information is part of that system too — *say* what you need to say to present the appearance of not attacking Russia directly, but I have no doubt when the time comes the next useful weapon will be given and the proper justifications presented. Will PATRIOT missiles get sent? If the missile strikes continue (they will) then probably, if the logistics and crewing can be made to work. But maybe by back-channels somehow to keep up appearances. They're expensive and complicated and state of the art.
