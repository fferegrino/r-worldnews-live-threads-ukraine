Day 13 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today that same sound from yesterday of a nearby tank or artillery shooting at something continued, we can hear the sound of the shot itself but not of the impact/explosion, and distant sound of explosions also continues even now as I’m writing this.

After talking with our relatives from Russia again today it looks like our words might finally start to get through to them now, but that’s because their acquaintance’s husband who was conscripted into Russian army to invade Ukraine actually returned and told them what happened firsthand. 

I don’t think they are conscripting quite everyone just yet as apparently he previously fought in Syria, so he was already experienced. Well, first thing is that when he was being conscripted they told him that he was going to take part in training exercises but instead he was sent to war.

He told them that he was part of a fuel convoy which started with 30 fuel trucks, but only 6 of them actually returned back, the scale of destruction is just insane, so much senseless death. Apparently he also told them that he won’t be returning to war after this, which is great.

Hopefully with more people returning back both dead and alive Russians will finally start to see what is really happening in Ukraine because right now from the looks of it most people there either don’t understand what is really happening here, believe the propaganda or even support the so called “special military operation”.

All good points although as has been discussed numerous times on here, I'm assuming Zelenskyy knows it would not help anyone to sacrifice himself along with Kyiv for whatever reason. I'm assuming that he only went outside for the video from this morning because they somehow knew it was safe.

From this article (generally I think it's silly to make comparisons to people when people should just be allowed to be who they are even with similarities, but I think it worked very well for him to play into the comparison by actually quoting Churchill to the House of Commons earlier).

>Russia is likely rapidly exhausting the manpower it can readily use to generate additional effective combat power even as its forces lose combat effectiveness in Ukraine amid high losses. Russian efforts to mobilize more manpower can bring more people into Russian combat units, but those people are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated to generate large amounts of new combat power.

&#x200B;

They also need to leave a percentage of possible military deployments across their huge-ass country, both to support their police in case protests continue to escalate, and probably just out of irrational paranoia of ""The West.""

There's definitely a lot of people that can be forced to go to war, but don't confuse that for ""keeping their best units for last"" or as if they can quickly mobilise them.

I want to share with you some of that stuff so that you can help report comments that engage in this misinformation and help mods across reddit stay on top of it:

**Most common forms of misinformation seen on Reddit**

* Claims that Russia is ""denazifying"" Ukraine.
* Claims that Ukraine isn't actually being invaded. It's just a peacekeeping/security effort.
* Statements undermining the sovereignty of Ukraine. For example: ""Ukraine does not exist. It is part of Russia and always has been.""
* Statements that the Ukrainian people overwhelmingly support this move by Russia and are welcoming it with open arms.

And stuff about NATO and the US, like:

* NATO/US/EU has invaded pretty much the whole world
* NATO/US/EU are imperialistic, Russia is one as well, so fuck them both
* NATO was trying to border Russia, so Russia had to invade Ukraine

And ""whataboutism"" like:

* Did you care about when the US invaded Iraq?
* What did you do for Syria when they were bombed by your country?
* America has been invading and bombing countries for years. Why does everyone care when Russia does it?

&nbsp;

**More advanced misinformation compiled by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russia-ukraine-conflict-top-10-war-myths-newsguard)**

*Please note that the fact-check is in italics.*

* “Russian-speaking residents in the Donbas region of Ukraine have been subjected to genocide.” *The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has found no evidence of this.*
* “Polish-speaking saboteurs attempted to bomb a chlorine plant in Donbas.” *The video of the “attack”, for which there is no evidence, was recorded days before it is alleged to have taken place.*
* “Ukrainian forces bombed a kindergarten in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, on 17 February 2022.” *The shelling came from Russian-separatist frontlines.*
* “Russia did not target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine at the start of invasion.” *One day after the invasion, Amnesty International documented at least three Russian military attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine.*
* “Nazism is rampant in Ukrainian politics and society, supported by authorities in Kyiv.” *The candidate for the far-right nationalist party, Svoboda, won 1.6% of the vote in the 2019 presidential election.*
* “The west staged a coup to overthrow the pro-Russia Ukrainian government in 2014.” *There is no evidence supporting the theory that the 2014 Maidan revolution in Ukraine was a coup orchestrated by western countries.*
* “The US has a network of bioweapons labs in eastern Europe.” *The claims are based on a misrepresentation of the US Department of Defense’s Biological Threat Reduction Program.*
* “Nato has a military base in Odesa, southern Ukraine.” *Foreign military bases are not permitted in Ukraine.*
* “Crimea joined Russia legally.” *The UN Assembly declared a 2014 referendum that backed Crimea joining Russia was illegitimate.*
* “Modern Ukraine was entirely created by communist Russia.” *Russia and Ukraine’s shared heritage dates back more than 1,000 years.*",False,1646791624.0,t3_t9w3ci,t3_t9w3ci,,0,77,0,77,1,0,

>The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

Let's look at these in the context of the current conflict; specifically the Russian antagonism/Putin himself.

**(1) The Moral Law**:

This war, aside from satisfying the megalomania of one man, is at the expense of the sovereignty of an entire nation. Ukraine in no way has shown any form of brinksmanship or foul play toward Russia. Further, and perhaps most importantly, Russia's continued bombardment and indiscriminate shelling of civilians shows a complete lack of moral distinction in this conflict. The insincere attempts at ""diplomacy"" further degrades any standing here. It all makes it a hard cause to fight for, and this is obvious among Putin's ranks.

**(2) Heaven:**

Generally speaking, given the countryside, this time of year is far from ideal to transport armored vehicles and groups of people. The thawing temperatures allow for mud and increased resistance to travel. This is worsened by sporadically cold temperatures, blizzards, and so on. See the *Rasputitsa.*

**(3) Earth:**

The Ukrainians occupy a natural position of strength in that they are fighting a defensive battle. They know their land; they know the crevices, nooks and crannies hidden away that the Russians will take for granted. Further, urban warfare settings are prevalent in this conflict and the increased surface area here allows for all kinds of ambushes, lures, and traps. This inherently puts the Russians at a disadvantage, despite all their firepower.

**(4) The Commander:**

This is perhaps one of the areas where in some aspects Putin succeeds. He has experience himself in the realm of war; at the very least asymmetrically using his tools to achieve his goals. This in and of itself is a display of competency. His use of disinformation and propaganda is nothing to be underestimated. What is lacking in Putin is his disregard for human life, inability to process outside criticisms, and, at least recently, a completely distorted view of the world. This, ultimately, goes hand in hand with Putin's lack of any Moral Law (see above).

**(5) Method and discipline:**

The Russians have an obvious advantage in terms of hardware, but their apparent inability to coordinate their assets seems to reflect a weakness in military structure. This could stem from greed, corruption, lies, embezzlement, and so on. These problems are not uncommon when dealing with autocrats who bury their heads in the sand about actual conditions on the ground; about the actual gap between their ideas and reality. This is clearly hampering the war effort for the Russians.

Long term, I have no idea how things will pan out. This is just my attempt at trying to measure the situation we find ourselves in. As always, Slava Ukraini.",1646799378.0,1646798624.0,t3_t9w3ci,t3_t9w3ci,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

People are more focused on the conflict in Ukraine because:

1. Russia is a global super power and it invaded a sovereign European nation. This represents a huge threat to Europe and to America who has long viewed Russia as an existential threat.

2. Russia is a nuclear power - the largest in the world. Lots of people are really concerned that nuclear weapons could be used as this escalates. 

3. Russia has a lot of economic power and is tied up into the economies and trade of many countries. Conflict in Russia and Ukraine impacts the global economy far more than Yemen and Syria. 

4. The conflicts in Yemen and Syria are both Civil Wars, which means that other nations are reluctant to intervene and cause wider war. This also contributes to a feeling that we, the public, can't do much to help. 

5. Ukraine has really driven the narrative on social media, translating many of their videos and posts into English, and appealing directly to Europe and America. Stories like the Ghost of Kyiv (yes I know it's not real), Snake Island, etc are all creating viral moments online. They've even gone so far as to ask civilians around the world to come and fight for them. 

This doesn't mean that what's happening in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, etc isn't also massively concerning from a humanitarian perspective. It's just that most people don't view it as a threat to themselves or their way of life.

b57af58767877e25520d53a46ff3882e,t9w3ci,hzxzxru,"""If you’re hoping that the instability that Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine has wreaked on global markets and geopolitics has peaked, your hope is in vain. We haven’t seen anything yet. Wait until Putin fully grasps that his only choices left in Ukraine are how to lose — early and small and a little humiliated or late and big and deeply humiliated.

Why do I say that defeat in Ukraine is Putin’s only option, that only the timing and size is in question? Because the easy, low-cost invasion he envisioned and the welcome party from Ukrainians he imagined were total fantasies — and everything flows from that.

Putin completely underestimated Ukraine’s will to be independent and become part of the West. He completely underestimated the will of many Ukrainians to fight, even if it meant dying, for those two goals. He completely overestimated his own armed forces. He completely underestimated President Biden’s ability to galvanize a global economic and military coalition to enable Ukrainians to stand and fight and to devastate Russia at home — the most effective U.S. coalition-building effort since George H.W. Bush made Saddam Hussein pay for his folly of seizing Kuwait. And he completely underestimated the ability of companies and individuals all over the world to participate in, and amplify, economic sanctions on Russia — far beyond anything governments initiated or mandated.

When you get that many things wrong as a leader, your best option is to lose early and small. In Putin’s case that would mean withdrawing his forces from Ukraine immediately; offering a face-saving lie to justify his “special military operation,” like claiming it successfully protected Russians living in Ukraine; and promising to help Russians’ brethren rebuild. But the inescapable humiliation would surely be intolerable for this man obsessed with restoring the dignity and unity of what he sees as the Russian motherland.

Incidentally, the way things are going on the ground in Ukraine right now, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Putin could actually lose early and big. I would not bet on it, but with every passing day that more and more Russian soldiers are killed in Ukraine, who knows what happens to the fighting spirit of the conscripts in the Russian Army being asked to fight a deadly urban war against fellow Slavs for a cause that was never really explained to them.

Given the resistance of Ukrainians everywhere to the Russian occupation, for Putin to “win” militarily on the ground his army will need to subdue every major city in Ukraine. That includes the capital, Kyiv — after probably weeks of urban warfare and massive civilian casualties. In short, it can be done only by Putin and his generals perpetrating war crimes not seen in Europe since Hitler. It will make Putin’s Russia a permanent international pariah.

Moreover, how would Putin maintain control of another country — Ukraine — that has roughly one-third the population of Russia, with many residents hostile to Moscow? He would probably need to maintain every one of the 150,000-plus soldiers he has deployed there — if not more — forever.

There is simply no pathway that I see for Putin to win in Ukraine in any sustainable way because it simply is not the country he thought it was — a country just waiting for a quick decapitation of its “Nazi” leadership so that it could gently fall back into the bosom of Mother Russia.

So either he cuts his losses now and eats crow — and hopefully for him escapes enough sanctions to revive the Russian economy and hold onto power — or faces a forever war against Ukraine and much of the world, which will slowly sap Russia’s strength and collapse its infrastructure.""

For **ANYONE** still suggesting that NATO ""just get in there already"".  We get it, you are frustrated, and think the world isn't doing enough.  It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  

The problem is, besides the fact that NATO is a **defensive** alliance, you really don't understand what Nuclear war would mean.
**Even a limited exchange** is enough to cause world wide famine and death.  A full scale exchange would probably end the human race.  **Including killing all the people in Ukraine.**


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

The Google Resources link to the petition, with the explicit statement that no one was forced to sign it, was sent out via email.*

>ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FROM THE STAFF OF ST. PETERSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY

>Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!

>At this difficult time you and our country, we are writing to you, a graduate of our University, with words of sincere support. We understand what a difficult and momentous decision you have had to make, and we wholeheartedly approve of it, realizing that you had no other choice.

>The voices of “pacifists”, who for many years ignored the ongoing war, the voices “for peace” and against the government, are ringing out loudly in our society. Unfortunately, this has happened more than once in our history. All the wars that Russia lost, Russia to itself because of internal disorder. In 1854, when the European coalition surrounded the empire from all around, at that time the Russian educated audience toasted champagne to our defeat. And so it was in 1905, when many opposition figures wished Russia to be defeated in the war with Japan because victory would have strengthened the Nicholas regime, which they hated. Will we really make the same mistake again?

>At historical moments of crisis, society must unite. It is unacceptable to take actions that lead to division. Unity should not be reflected in sympathy for extremes, which we see in a rapidly polarizing society, but in an understanding of national interests, in unwavering adherence to them. Calmness and a balanced and rational assessment of the situation must now become the basis of all our actions.

>A realistic view of the current situation in world politics makes us certain that the Russian government and army are not marching against the brotherly Ukrainian people but are defending not only the national security of Russia, but also the security of the entire world.

>We deeply mourn all victims of the conflict that has been going on in Ukraine for 8 years now and hope for a speedy end to it. We express our support to your policy aimed at demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, establishment of peace and restoration of friendly relations between the brotherly peoples of Ukraine and Russia!

>Respectfully,

The next few days are likely to be crucial as we are going to see whether Russian forces will be in fairly good shape to attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv, given the physical and psychological hammering in a state of confused disorganisation.

&#x200B;

I was **so pleased** earlier today when Poland announced they were finally ready to hand over the MiG's, because I assumed that it had meant the US and Poland had talked it over. After all, *Antony Fuckin' Blinke*n had publically said that getting those jets to Ukraine while addressing Poland's security gap was one of the US's primary priorities regarding Ukraine over the weekend.  I had genuinely assumed that NATO had grown a spine and was essentially just saying to Russia, *""I fuckin'* ***dare you*** *to start World War III over some old-ass Warsaw Pact jets.""*

&#x200B;

But now it sounds like the above was political theatrics because the US didn't wanna be seen like they were cock-blocking the deal, and so Poland, understandably not wanting to be seen as the bad guy, punted it back to us.

&#x200B;

All the while people are dying.

&#x200B;

Like, if it's not possible, that's fine!  I can totally respect if defense analysts and political analysts and the intelligence community have all come to the conclusion that **for some insane reason** Vladimir Putin is willing to end the world over 30 outdated aircraft that *may not even have a significant impact on the war.*

&#x200B;

But if that's the case, let's at least all be honest about it, say no, and then renew focus on figuring out what we **can** do to help Ukraine instead of dicking around with all of these embarassingly cowardly, backstabby politics.

The Dictators Handbook and All the Kremlin’s Men are two books that go really well together and also destroy almost any hope I have for productive regime change. Best case scenario another, possibly more violent actor ousts Putin from within his cabinet, but seems very unlikely. Less risky to let Putin fail domestically beyond what a police state can reasonably control first; which in Russia hasn’t happened for nearly 100 years. Stalin died a natural death.

As long as you can scare the populace into submission it’s business as usual; if they speak up you just have to beat them more, kill a few, disappear a few, rape a few, and they’ll quiet down. It’s not like they’re armed and organized.

The idea of popular revolt that gets so much traction in the minds of people who’ve only known liberal democracy is more just a fantasy in such places - revolts are only allowed to proceed with the blessing of security forces; and even then usually just to swap out sociopaths with one more favorable to military interests. This is also why practically every time the west has tried to instigate regime change via sanctions it has failed (see NK and Iran). Sanctions are a liberal democrats idea of what could cause a populace to rise up; and they would be effective under a democracy, probably. Despots just don’t have a strong incentive to care and the people living under them not the resources to change things.

The sanctions will hit regular Russians hard, the ruling class a bit but they’ll still be rich, and probably won’t result in meaningful change except insofar as to ensure that Russia becomes a Chinese client state.

They may prove a benefit in controlling the populace: austerity breeds hate and now the ruling class can point at the west whenever questioned. Long term it may cause larger conflict with the west.

**I think it's safe to blame Putin for Putin's folly**. Autocratic system? Blame the autocrat. Reading the room and my own feelings, currently we all blame Russians for Russia's mistakes, and Russia's leader especially for Russia's mistakes. In the future, I am sure mountains of paper will be written finding a way to demarcate blame onto Western leaders.

**Some blame game is warranted**. Global capitalism is flawed, especially the gas guzzling aspect. On normal days, it is consciously amoral, run by 'canny' businessmen who enjoy and constantly justify being amoral.  I think it's a tragedy Russia liberalized and privatized under the aegis of neo-liberals obsessed with the Washington Consensus, as opposed to New Deal Democrats or (gasp) west European social democrats. Russia exchanged one corrupt plutocratic system for another. At no stage was militant nationalism challenged as a governing ethos. At no stage was Russia's great wealth made accountable and under the control of the people. At no stage in the 1990s was such even considered a priority in Washington.

But at the end of the day, Russia must be blamed. Advisors from the West only had so much sway. The Kremlin made choices in 1991, in 1999, in 2014, and in 2021. Russians like Yeltsin and then Putin led Russia out of the 1990s into the 'stable' 21st CE, where Russia traded liberty for stagnation. Millions of Russians chose their fever dreams of chasing old imperialism to make Russia great again.",1646838296.0,1646799264.0,t3_t9w3ci,t1_hzx3vbv,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

They visited Russia, then part of the Soviet Union, because the high school offered it as a language. She could talk for hours about the amazing places she visited, trading gum to  local kids for war medals, how beautiful the Soviet subways were compared to the US, seeing Red Square at night. But she would always mention seeing the first McDonalds in Russia. Not just the lines, how different it was seeing a part of the West actually be there and how big it actually was. How local people reacted to it. Even today when she talks about it, you can tell how jawdropping that moment was for those living during the coldwar.

I guess your comment also made me nostalgic about listening to her, those conversations made me want to visit Russia one day and experience it myself. Though that seems more unlikely each day with deteriorating US relations.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""very angry"" when he learned that the Vinnytsia airport was shelled with very expensive rockets, Bellingcat investigative journalist Hristo Grozev said on a joint TV channel.

 At the same time, he expressed the opinion that Putin does not get the full picture of the ""failures"" of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine.

 ""For example, the fact that almost 100% of the population has a negative attitude towards the Russian occupiers, most likely, does not reach him, because people vertically are afraid to report it to him,"" - said Grozev.

 He also said that Russian propaganda now works very effectively for Russians, but ""literally from scratch"" for foreign audiences.

They have the capability of mobilizing hundreds of thousands more, however there is a difference between a small engagement, which Putin is trying to keep this as, and a war which would involve mass mobilization. 

A comparison is the US in Vietnam. We never actually declared war. That was always considered a special troop deployment which gained in size over time, especially under LBJ, but it was never meant to be treated as a real war. The US more than had the capability to fully level or conquer Vietnam, but mass mobilization is on a whole other level than assigning a few divisions and supporting units.

Putin will likely, and if he wants to win swiftly, assign more divisions.

You almost haphazardly affirmed the position anyway. Yes, westerners care more about the Ukrainian conflict because it affects us somewhat more directly, sure, undeniable. However, an unfortunate nature of the western world is half-acceptance of policy and involvement that directly impact developing nations; often ignoring the wants or needs of the citizens we’re invading, occupying, sanctioning or undermining.

*when I say “we” I mean the collective mindset of western people- an average Jane or Joe*

So yes, the truth is we don’t really care in any significant way because we believe ourselves to be more civilized, progressive, and a structured society while *those people* are not. Therefore, our actions aren’t “all that bad” and can be seen as “helping the good ones”.

While racism is not the only reason why the western world has stirred-up, ignored, and exploited the crises of developing countries, it is a root cause and an overlooked factor today and why our interests and perceptions of Europe vs. Asia vs. Africa are vastly different.

Actions that the western world takes here vs elsewhere needs to be criticized because often we are very involved. You may think it’s not tasteful but most people here at least aren’t exactly involved in any meaningful way and afaik talking heads who have made such arguments and postulations are not advocating for Russia’s actions and still very anti-imperialist.

The question going forward, past this conflict, is how much more should we hold our governments accountable for the real and existential threats they pose to developing nations. What can we do to help or what should we discontinue doing.

I think rallying behind Ukraine is great, I’m happy that many people are being vocal about it. Some may continue to protest western involvement but many may not and may continue to actively condone non-western societies.",1646797267.0,1646797030.0,t3_t9w3ci,t1_hzxc6z6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

You’re absolutely correct that in terms of security, strategic and economic impact etc this conflict affects us more directly. It’s a bigger deal to us personally. But I haven’t actually seen anyone argue it’s not.

However, when it comes to empathising with victims, it’s no different from the other 56 conflicts happening worldwide right now and yet several media figures and politicians have implied that ‘civilised’ or ‘blond haired’ victims are more worthy of our empathy. There’s no way to cut that that isn’t racist.

The outrage at civilian casualties is absolutely right, but some of its coming from the same politicians who funded Saudi Arabia cluster bombing Yemenis. That’s not a strategic concern, it’s a humanitarian double standard and should be called out, not to detract from 
Ukraine but in the hope we can also learn to behave more ethically in other conflicts.

The differing treatment of refugees fleeing different war zones also has nothing to do with nukes or strategic dangers - again its a double standard that needs calling out in the hopes we can show the same compassion to other peoples in future (and in fact now as we’re also hearing many reports of prejudice against Africans and Asians fleeing Ukraine so it’s very relevant).

your feelings are 100% valid. through this entire invasion, I’ve oftentimes put myself in someone’s shoes that I read/hear/see about.

The Russians are mostly giving commands in the clear. The US is passing tons and tons of info from tons of assets. The Russians really haven't had an AWACS presence.

Ukraine has seized more assets from the Russians than their defense industry makes in 8 years!

I suspect a good chunk of that is heading to kyiv and being set up. The Ukrainians might out Zhukov general Zhukov. Defense in depth.

They will know the position of every Russian asset. Every bridge between them and downtown is likely rigged to blow to cut them off from resupply and retreat.

The Russians are gonna try a bombing campaign but are out of precision munitions so they can't easily support an attack when it's happening. I also don't think they've been waking artillery fire during an advance because their doctrine has been in the toilet.

Putin wants to claim kyiv soon. To take it easily would requires days or weeks of intense shelling reducing everything to rubble.

Granted, the West has many evils. As an American, I think of Afghanistan and Iraq, among many other sins. The thing is though, Russia can't just toss this out there and commit war crimes that are even worse. Even if they were just ""equally worse"" compared to American/Western acts, that still throws the entire argument out of the window. How can one claim to be morally superior even as they commit to acts that are just as bad, or arguably worse.

""They're taking a tough face, sanctions can be dealt with."" Either this is ignorance or straight-up support for Putin. Russian propaganda is rampant, particularly in the actual Russian population. I can excuse ignorance, but I cannot excuse active support for Putin's regime. Not every Russian citizen spouting these lines are ignorant, and therein lies the problem. There are more than enough true believers, paid actors, trolls, etc. that it really muddies the waters. I feel bad for the Russians that have been tricked and aren't ~~smart~~ informed enough or able to access information accurately to see through the haze of propaganda. I feel even worse for the ones that have been above it this entire time, and not only oppose the war, but Putin's regime as well.

EDIT: I was thinking of this comment and wanted to change a line about Russians being ""smart"" enough to see through propaganda. I decided that that remark was unjustifiable and insulting to the Russian people, who are not our real enemy. Russia is a country of great innovation and her people's contribution to the arts, sciences, society, politics, and general human advancement have been remarkable. I apologize for that remark.

Putin's government has mirrored the USSR in terms of censorship, state media, and general control over news/information. It is unfair to blame many Russians for their tepid support of Putin and general ignorance of the war, as well as ignorance of his totalitarian regime. Many Russians see through this and stand opposed to Putin; meanwhile, many Russians don't have access to other forms of information, and instead are preyed upon by Putin's many arms of manipulation. 

This has happened across many societies and governments through history. It is unfair and wrong to place so much blame on the Russian populace, who have endured a great amount of hardship, going back to the USSR. I believe in my heart that if all Russians could see the true nature of what was developing in Ukraine, as well as the nature of Putin's regime among many other things they were lied to about, there would be immediate change. Having said that, there are many Russian citizens who do share the blame for this catastrophe, the continued leadership of Putin, and many other problems across the years.",1646808611.0,1646806655.0,t3_t9w3ci,t1_hzxwqn6,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

In 261BC Ashoka attacked Kalinga, to round off his borders. It was an independent and prosperous kingdom It was a slaughter, 150,000 dead and the population enslaved. It caused so much suffering that Ashoka repented of war and became a Buddhist and spent the rest of his life spreading ahimsa (non-violence). Wikipedia has a nice write up on it

“No war in the history of India is as important either for its intensity or for its results as the Kalinga war of Ashoka. No wars in the annals of human history have changed the heart of the victor from one of wanton cruelty to that of exemplary piety as this one. From its fathomless womb, the history of the world may find out only a few wars to its credit which may be equal to this war and not a single one that would be greater than this. The political history of mankind is really a history of wars and no war has ended with so successful a mission of peace for the entire war-torn humanity as the war of Kalinga.

Today's lasted about 11 hours with some shelling being reported, but it mostly held.

Russia is also likely regrouping, resupplying and lumbering toward Kyiv and preparing for Odessa if things fall through with a current move to end hostilities.

Axio (linked below) has a story that these ceasefires are being done to give Zelenskyy time to think over a proposal from Russia. If he declines then things will light up worse for Ukraine.

Russian issued cards can't be used outside Russia and vice versa. So effectively, you can't use them to transfer money across the border anymore.

They aim to move on Dnipro and force the eastern defense of ukraine to retreat or collapse. From there they can force a capitulation of Mariupol, unite the forces from Crimea that moved east, the forces from Donbas, and the forces from the northeast. If successful it will also greatly improve the Russian logistical situation. 

Forces from Konotop and Sumy have also skirted around those cities and moved across sparsely populated land to the eastern suburbs of Kyiv and that city will soon be pressed on three sides. Though it us beung transformed into a fortress. 

Ukrainians are holding the urban centers fiercely, but the Russians are advancing on multiple fronts outside the cities to achieve their objectives. They are not committing forces to prolonged urban assaults on the city cores and seem content to maneuver for positioning and lay siege. 

It is a far more violent slog than the Russians expected, but they are adapting to the state of the battlefield. 

Good news for Ukraine is they still contest the skies and are making it very difficult to move along major roads or around the city centers. Mykolaiv stands as a bulwark for Odessa, but who knows for how long. However, the city administrator in Mykolaiv has called for tires to be piled at every intersection ready to be set ablaze because they anticipate a push to take the city and the shipyards and port at its heart. If that city falls the way is clear for a landing of Russian amphibious forces to link up with the army and move on Odessa. 

By any realistic standards this war is still young. It could develop in a whole lot of ways. And no doubt the Russian plan for victory was wildly optimistic and completely bungled, along with the Ukrainian defense being well organized and intensely supported by outside actors. But you are right. The Ukrainians cannot stabilize any fronts outside urban centers.

There is no precedent for this - especially as the Korean War was far from US borders.

Here's what we know right now:

1. The US and Poland have been discussing this for a few days, but it was pretty unclear if it would move forward.

2. Today Poland announced that it would send its fleet of planes to Rammstein Airforce Base in Germany for the US to do what they want with it.

3. The US seemed surprised by this update, especially because it was so public.

4. The US responded that this isn't ""tenable"". It's unclear if the deal that's been discussed previously will hold up or not. That is - if  the US will replace the Polish planes with newer ones and then give the older ones to Ukraine. 

5. The reason for all the hesitance here is because it could be seen as an act of aggression by Russia, so Poland wants it to be clear that these are no longer their planes. Likewise, the US wants to be clear that they aren't the aggressors.

Children died btw. Soldiers too. Russians and Ukranians. Western companies are leaving Russia en masse. Why? Bec they don't want to do business with an autocrat, like Mr. Putin.

In the 1970s, the US supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war with weapons and money. A brutal dictator by the name of Saddam Hussein, an Sunni, came to power over the mostly Shiite and Kurdish nation. When the war with Iran was over, he turned those same arms on the people within his country who opposed him. Kurds were subjected to torture and genocide. It has long be suspected that Sarin gas was used on multiple occasions against them. Then, in 1990 Saddam ordered the invasion of neighboring Kuwait, who many western nations were friendly with. The US and a vast coalition launched operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to defend Kuwait and push the Iraqis back to their country. It was a humiliating defeat of what was supposed to be the 4th best army in the world. Saddam capitulated, but was always angry with the humiliation. Then, 9/11 happened. Thousands of Americans were murdered in a jihad against the US. Vengeance was the order of the day, and for most Americans it was reasonable to believe that any Islamic nation could have been supportive of it. Intelligence at the time was reporting that Saddam may have funded the attack. That, and the idea that he may have had chemical weapons such as the Sarin gas reportedly used on the Kurds were enough pretext for most Americans to be comfortable with an invasion. No WMDs were ever found, but Saddam was a bad guy and most people don’t feel bad that he got the rope. Was the US wrong about him funding 9/11? Absolutely. Was it a war that didn’t need to happen? Sure. That does not make it anywhere near the same thing though.

His phrasing makes it sound like the existence of these labs was called a conspiracy theory but the [state department literally has a section on the embassy website for it](https://ua.usembassy.gov/embassy/kyiv/sections-offices/defense-threat-reduction-office/biological-threat-reduction-program). The conspiracy theorists are claiming that these are weapon labs and look at how Knowles carefully crafted his tweet so it could be read that the video clip is confirming *that* if someone didn't really watch it. 

A biolab is a biological research lab. These labs exist, in part, to research wild diseases to help develop therapies and treatments for the next avian flu, swine flu, covid, etc. Diseases, like animals and plants, are different all over the world. You need labs where the diseases are. It is part of the reason strong alliances between friendly nations around the world help all of humanity thrive. 

What these labs do not do at all is make biological weapons. Michael Knowles is using the weird scary 'biolab' word without any added context, so the audience can leap to their own conspiratorial conclusion. 

The presence of biolabs in Ukraine is concerning right now because Russia has shown a disregard for collateral damage shooting at the nuclear plant and there are concerns about what they would do to a building containing infectious disease samples, particularly if it creates an opportunity to make the West look irresponsible. You can view exactly what the US and Ukraine collaborate on at those laboratories [here on the US embassy website](https://ua.usembassy.gov/embassy/kyiv/sections-offices/defense-threat-reduction-office/biological-threat-reduction-program/), it's nothing apocalyptic but probably also not anything you want getting released by a cruise missile impact. This is one more example of how Russia's bloodthirsty invasion recklessly puts the world beyond Ukraine at risk. 

[FactCheck.org has a good overview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/social-media-posts-misrepresent-us-ukraine-threat-reduction-program/ar-AAUwO1q) of how this has been spun into a conspiritorial lie on the internet by Russian propagandists and attention seekers who want to stir the pot. People like Michael Knowles are intentionally trickle-truthing this for their own benefit, and Russia would *love* us to think Ukraine was studying biological weapons with US involvement. 

Occam's razor. The simplest explanation is generally right, and the simple explanation would be these labs are for exactly what they say they are for and what 3rd party auditors confirm they are for and what every allied nation's biolabs all around the world are for. Even if the US was making biological weapons, why would they do it on Russia's doorstep? We have a gigantic desert in the Southwest US. And we already figured out a long time ago biological weapons are not an ethical or even a highly effective way to make war.

It gives Putin political capital on multiple fronts and he stops losing pilots who need a lot of training and are often well paid and connected within Russian society. It gives Putin an excuse to escalate.  It makes all of the anti-aircraft weapons we've sent useless. And most of all it keeps Ukrainian air resources from flying. Every Russian plane and pilot that is killed or captured makes Putin's life exponentially harder than any infantry or ground resource he could lose.

 >The lead–crime hypothesis is the association between elevated blood lead levels in children and increased rates of crime, delinquency, and recidivism later in life. Lead is widely understood to be highly toxic to multiple organs of the body, particularly the brain. Individuals exposed to lead at young ages are more vulnerable to learning disabilities, decreased I.Q., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and problems with impulse control, all of which may be negatively impacting decision making and leading to the commission of more crimes as these children reach adulthood, especially violent crimes.

The main point for me is that Kozyrev sees little risk for nukes. For me personally it is also interesting to get this probably accurate insight in how Putin thinks.

""Euromaidan 2013-14 was run by the west"" - it's not a far stretch. If you already believe that the West is capable of supporting such actions (which we are), it would be very hard to tell whether or not this was genuinely Ukrainian or heavily West-controlled. The world wouldn't look very different for either of these options. It suits Putin to be sure that the West is behind it.

""Neo-nazis"" - like many places, a violent alt-right exists, and no matter how we spin it, the Azov brigade is a very dark chapter in modern Ukraine. I'd say that neo-nazism is there but as a totally insignificant factor for the country as a whole. It suits Putin to think that this factor is big and defining.

""US and EU weak"" can be guessed from ""I took Crimea, what did they do? Some small sanctions. Our Winter Olympics was held with great success afterwards. We can handle sanctions.""

The Russian consulate assumes there is a coup going on, especially after some general goes on TV to make an address about what's happening. Since in Russia a leader being shot at and then a general speaking to the public would basically mean there was a coup. And they freak out and almost do something drastic. I forget why a coup would actually be bad for them since they didn't like Reagin, but there was some reason, maybe the general was even more hardline. But the main characters, since they've been living as Americans for years, understand that's not how it works in the U.S. and calm the consulate down saying there definitely wasn't a coup.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Another reason not to: our action would have enormous consequences for others. We should be responsible for what this action could do to other countries.

>They depend on humans for care and companionship/familial bonds and the same goes for humans to animals. 

Read above, most dogs are more than capable of finding sustenance and packs among other dogs. Its why there are packs of wild dogs in other countires, pets who stop being pets either die or become successful strays. Again, they're animals, they don't have intelligence or compassion or love so they won't seek to help out other suffering dogs unless those dogs can help them, they cant learn better and they cant be better, theyll alwyas be animals who are inherently selfish. Humans are compassionate and intelligent and loving and creative, they have the ability to go far beyond basic instinct if it means bettering themselves and orhers, which is why I'd gladly see the entire dog population of Ukraine wiped out in an eye blink if it meant this war never had to happen.

Ukraine is actually better off (in terms of sovereignty) with the eastern Donbass region being annexed under a broad ceasefire in the region... and close international monitoring.

That should be a logical concession from Ukraine... as it was the pretext for the invasion as originally laid out by Putin.

Crimea is a different story. This is part of Ukraine. Period.

All this other rhetoric about de-militarization and de-natzification and Ukraine never being able to form any strategic alliances with any other country or ""bloc"" is just posturing by Russia. 

It's tramples sovereignty, is unreasonable and not internationally ""enforceable"" in any way other than through future threats of military action. E.g. ""You spoke to Germany about a possible alliance... we're now going to bomb Kyiv again!"". What sort of bullshit is that.

The crown prince faces multiple lawsuits in the U.S., including over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.

...

> The Emiratis share Saudi concerns about the restrained U.S. response to recent missile strikes by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen against the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, officials said. Both governments are also concerned about the revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which doesn’t address other security concerns of theirs and has entered the final stages of negotiations in recent weeks.

...

> Biden also publicly castigated Saudi Arabia over its protracted war in Yemen and cut off the flow of some weapons Riyadh could use to target Houthis. The president also reversed a move by his predecessor that put the Houthis on America’s official list of global terrorist groups, a move that Saudi leaders said had emboldened the Yemeni force and thwarted efforts to broker a cease-fire.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

 >The Dunning–Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. The Dunning–Kruger effect is usually measured by comparing self-assessment with objective performance. For example, the participants in a study may be asked to complete a quiz and then estimate how well they did.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

9e53909880154b85e945831b914bf5ad,t9w3ci,hzx2bzq,"**Radiation Exposure and Cancer Risk**

Exposure to low-levels of radiation does not cause immediate health effects, but can cause a small increase in the risk of cancer over a lifetime. There are studies that keep track of groups of people who have been exposed to radiation, including atomic bomb survivors and radiation industry workers. These studies show that radiation exposure increases the chance of getting cancer, and the risk increases as the dose increases: the higher the dose, the greater the risk. Conversely, cancer risk from radiation exposure declines as the dose falls: the lower the dose, the lower the risk.

Radiation doses are commonly expressed in millisieverts (international units) or

 (U.S. units). A dose can be determined from a one-time radiation exposure, or from accumulated exposures over time. About 99 percent of individuals would not get cancer as a result of a one-time uniform whole-body exposure of 100 millisieverts (10 rem) or lower.1 At this dose, it would be extremely difficult to identify an excess in cancers caused by radiation when about 40 percent of men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetime.
  
**Risks that are low for an individual could still result in unacceptable numbers of additional cancers in a large population over time.** For example, in a population of one million people, an average one-percent increase in lifetime cancer risk for individuals could result in 10,000 additional cancers. The EPA sets regulatory limits and recommends emergency response guidelines well below 100 millisieverts (10 rem) to protect the U.S. population, including sensitive groups such as children, from increased cancer risks from accumulated radiation dose over a lifetime.

The phone you type on, the house you're in, the task food you eat, the media you enjoy, and all the emotions you feel towards those things are all human, inherently human, and so beyond complex in their intricacy compared to a dog that its simply a miracle they communicate with us as effectivelyas they do, onlt us turning them more obedient and centered around humans cound do that to them (again, thats somethingonly humans can do as well. Without us, dogs wouldnt exist, so humans have rights to them as a species). I don't hate animals, I'm stating a fact in their comparison to humans. Why do you think they're kept as pets and not treated as equals in our society legally? Because they are good for nothing but pets, if you work livestock then they're good workers, but dogs are not people. 

If you put a person in a situation where it was their family member they loved vs a dog they loved in a burning house, they'd choose the family member each and every time. Why? Because humans are objectively worth more than dogs. 

Reddit doesn't like this because people here by and large have faced an over average amount of human rejection in their life, therefore they attach themselves closer to an animal that cannot reject their emotions because it does not have the cognitive function to do so. Combine that with a continue lack of human interaction, and a projection of what your mind wants in a real human relationship on to a non human, and people start convincing themselves dogs are really equal to people.

This is the problem with people with stupid fucking opinions. Someone brings up that it's stupid and then they say ""oh, so what now you get to decide what i do and don't do? Well now I'm gonna double down and do this even more!"". 

Let's take your example about donating to trees. If you gave $50 to an organization going in to kyiv to bring out trees instead of $50 to one going in to get out people, you are an idiot and emotionally out of touch with humanity. Instead of doubling down, maybe you should realize it's a war, everything will be destroyed, humans are the most important thing to save from destruction, so all human effort should go towards people. 

Pointing out how asinine a position is is not gate keeping. That's like saying I'm gate keeping the constitution because I think one person shouldn't be able to own 20 automatic rifles. Sure you could hit me with ""well its MY paycheck so I'll do whatever I WANT because I CAN!"" , but as an adult you're expected to use your brain and measure compassion and ask yourself. ""I CAN do this thing, but maybe I SHOULD do something else"", you have the measure a situation given the context and not just apply a blanket of reasoning to the same thing no matter what situation. We all love dogs, but should I be sending my money to dogs when this same money could gurantee food finding its way to the mouth of a starving war refugee? 

>Like I said and you ignored, if you really wanna help, go volunteer to fight. No? Then shut up.

I ignored because arguing ""unless you are giving all you have to something, you don't really care about it!"" is one of the most disingenuous arguments there is that you are purely trying to use as a sad excuse for a ""gotcha"". I have no combat or medical experience so if i did join and fight id almost certainly get some poor ukranian killed due to my negligence, i know where I'm needed and when I'm needed and that's the homefront, donating. By your logic, all the men and women who worked in factories during ww2 aren't real supporters because they didn't go off and fight. But maybe you should take some time to walk outside and witness the sun moving in real time, because it's only been 2 weeks. This war will last for a while longer and anyone who isn't there now could certainly find themselves there by summers end based on how deep the west wants to get into it. 

And lastly, dogs are stupid animals that are not and will never be worth the same value as a human.

Everyone. If someone legit donated money to the rats of Ukraine while people are suffering they're a stupid bastard. Same as anyone who donates to a dog while people are still being killed. Gatekeeping would be if I started saying who can and can't donate, and to what specific organizations by name.

Ukraine had the chance to stay a neutral country like Swiss. They could do buisness with Europe and Russia.  
Problem: The entire government people  are puppets of the US. ( you can google it too - its no secret  )  
They dont do what is best for their citizens, they do what the US tells them to do.

The US would never allow Mexico or Canada or Cuba to join China or Russia military aparat.  
They would never allow  foreign military stuff anywhere near their borders, right?  
So tell me why Russia shall allow it?

You're taking this personally for understandable reasons, but it isn't about not valuing Ukraine. We have a responsibility to the human race first and foremost and getting into a war between two nuclear powers is not what anyone wants, including you, even if you can't see that right now.

Look at what Putin is doing to your country. If NATO gets involved and the nukes are on the table where do you think they're going first?",1646797861.0,1646796818.0,t3_t9w3ci,t1_hzx7si0,,5,10,0,10,0,0,

He's been very careless with classified info, especially considering he's on the Intel committee. I'm very suspicious of him asking this question in the manner that he did. He phrased it to set up expectations in the minds of those listening.

**He's on the Intel Committee.** He already knows the answer to this question. Why did he ask it?

The concern from our side seems to be that Russia is setting up a false-flag scenario in order to release something and blame it on Ukraine/NATO.

There are certainly biological research labs in Ukraine, just as there are nuclear reactors in Ukraine. They are not a 3rd-world country. They do research and investigate diseases. Some of them are going to be associated with the US in some way, even with the US military, because of concerns that Russia might attempt to release something, like Covid-19, in Ukraine, what with them being right on the Russian border. They probably monitor that pretty closely. 

The problem here is with the way perfectly normal operations are being represented, as if the US and Ukraine are collaborating in producing biological and chemical weapons be used against Russia.
