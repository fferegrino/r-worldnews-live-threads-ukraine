Both because of the improper and wasteful use of its forces, and because of considerations on the scale of the war as a whole, in which a fierce battle (still ongoing) over a small town in the Donbass is neither general nor decisive, it is operational/tactical in nature and results only in mutual heavy casualties of those fighting.

Putin refuses, he wants at least one oblast in full.  Gerasimov was impressed with the “fortress Bakhmut,” and wants to do the same to their controlled territory.  

> According to sources in the Russian Armed Forces, Gerasimov and Sergei Surovikin prepared a detailed report for Sergei Shoigu and Vladimir Putin, in which they **propose to stop senseless offensive attempts and go on the defensive along the entire line of contact**. 
The transition to the defense, in their opinion, will allow them to accumulate reserves of equipment, train personnel and ensure their rotation, prepare for a large-scale offensive when the army is really ready for this. 

> “In January, reports of officers were launched, who shared their thoughts on how this mess could be turned into an army. People started talking. A whole year!  It took a year for them to realize issues!” Says a source at the [field] headquarters. 

> According to sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation [in Moscow], the proposals of Gerasimov and Surovikin reached Putin and Shoigu, but the transition to the defense will not happen quickly. Allegedly, Putin demanded full control over at least one region [oblast] of Ukraine, after which, he is willing to give approval to change the strategy.

> The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation have not been able to solve this [personnel] problem over the past year, and many senior officers understand that in an attempt to completely capture the Donetsk, Luhansk or Zaporozhye regions, the Russian army will lose people and equipment without any benefit, but will not achieve the goal. 

*A Staff Officer has shocking prediction in his dismissal of these plans:*

> “Gerasimov may have understood something, but definitely not everything. He doesn’t come down here. What transition to defense? It would be necessary to withdraw troops to the line from 2015—at least that way, something could somehow be held. 

> **When the Armed Forces of Ukraine go forward, we will not hold them in the south, we might not be able to hold them in the east, either**. Literally a week ago, there was a situation when the Ukrainians almost destroyed our entire defense near Avdiivka. **As soon as Ukraine has the resources and men to attack, we will lose** ***all*** **the territories** for which we have been losing men all year. How long will it take Gerasimov to understand this? And how much will our Supreme Commander need [in order to realize]? They learn from the blood of our soldiers, from our blood. And they learn slowly, like repeaters [students who had to repeat a class],” says an officer serving in the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine [field HQ].",1678003213.0,1677998383.0,t3_11imxyy,t3_11imxyy,,0,130,0,130,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 5 March 2023  


* In late February 2023, Russian mobilised reservists described being ordered to assault a Ukrainian concrete strong point armed with only ‘firearms and shovels’. The ‘shovels’ are likely entrenching tools being employed for hand-to-hand combat.  

* The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologised in Russia. Little changed since it was designed in 1869, its continued use as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterise much of the war.  

* One of the reservists described being ‘neither physically nor psychologically’ prepared for the action.  

* Recent evidence suggests an increase in close combat in Ukraine. This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.

With the end of winter and the start of the spring thaw, I’m noticing much of the Russian narrative is now about this war becoming frozen as Ukraine cannot attack Russia and gain ground - which remains to be seen.

As usual, the Russians are trying to deflect attention from their own failings.

Over the past 2 months Russia have, by their own declaration, launched a massive assault on Ukraine. 

In this time, they’ve lost ~800 troops a day for 60 days, or about 48k troops trying to attack Ukraine and break their lines. 

Russia has achieved no gains in Kremmina, Vuhledar, or Kupiansk. They’ve moved forward barely a few miles inside Bakmut.

That was a comment left on this same worldnews thread 28 days ago and it had 44 upvotes. It's possible Ukraine withdraws from Bahkmut in the coming days or weeks and it's possible that Bahkmut holds out and Russia is unable to take the city in the coming days, weeks or even months. I would encourage people not to read too much into small developments and especially resist the urge to project what you think is about to happen. War is inherently one of the most unpredictable series of events and it's incredibly easy to underestimate the role of The Fog of War as well as Friction (as defined by Clausewitz).

'Let's just throw enough people forward', 'eventually we'll break through', that's just sheer helplessness and stupidity.

From today's point of view it is hard to believe, but there was a time when soldiers ran towards each other in orderly rows, lined up and then shot each other row by row.  
This was called warfare, somehow the Russians remind me of this time. As a soldier you know hours in advance that you are going to die if put in the front...

There will come a day even for a dictatorship built on lies without free access to information, when the number of dead can no longer justify the results.   
At least I hope so. There were already tensions in some regions of Russia during the mobilization, at some point the boiling point will be reached.  
Rising poverty, lack of manpower (as many men dead or permanently wounded) in rural areas, for what?

The sanctions set everything back years, will reduce economic performance for years to come, industrial know-how from other countries lost without the possibility of catching up in any way in the short or medium term.  
The other ex-Soviet states are watching closely what is happening, the distrust and open rejection of Russia has never been greater. Russia's own military is humiliated before the eyes of the world, weakened for decades to come, and will hardly function as a deterrent.  
The U.S. has gained ground and confidence, NATO has never been stronger or more united, Finland and Sweden are strengthening the alliance.

I would say - good job, absolutely nothing more can be accomplished except keeping the dwarf in power. For now.

Russian conscripts/mercenaries since the start of the war have mainly come either from ethnic minority villages or prisons.  To the xenophobic Russian majority, this hasn't been such a bad thing.  Russia has been suppressing its minority populations for hundreds of years and throwing them into a meat grinder only helps to create more ""living space"" for ethnic Russians in the east.  Sending prisoners off to die in the Wagner mercenary helps the Russian budget as they no longer have to house and feed criminals.  To many Russians, this is a win/win situation.

That said, ethnic minorities account for less than 17% of the total population in Russia and their numbers are likely dwindling quickly at this point.  Likewise, Russian prisoners are no longer signing up for service as they've heard about the low chances for survival.  There's no real way of knowing what percentage of minorities/prisoners have been killed in the war, but it's safe to assume that they have died at a far greater rate than ethnic Russians.

This means Russia will soon have to start conscripting ethnic Russians if they want to continue fighting in Ukraine.  The problem for Putin is that ethnic Russians hold most of the power in Russia and once this group starts bleeding, support for the war, and Putin, will probably decrease rapidly.

Modern Russian war strategy has always centered around throwing bodies at the enemy until they run out of ammunition and energy to repulse them.  This is what they are doing now.  The problem for Russia is that they don't have the limitless human resources they had 70 years ago compared with their opponent.  

Ukraine's population is one-third that of Russia, but by most accounts they have been managing their losses far better than Russia.  It's also expected that an invading force will generally lose three times as many troops as a defending force.  Combine this with problems in transporting and arming troops due to distance and sanctions, and it seems likely that Russia is in a losing position long term.

That meant Putin had to center his war strategy around a blitzkrieg kind of push to overwhelm Ukraine before western supplies could even the playing field, aka ""3 day operation.""  Of course that didn't work, but he hasn't been able to come up with any alternate plan, so the past year has seen multiple 3 day operation plans that become less and less effective.  

All this has led to Bakhmut, which has effectively been a 3 day operation repeated over the course of several months.  The Russian plan has been to overwhelm Ukraine defenses by the sheer number of bodies that can be thrown at it.  It looks like they might finally take the town, but at a cost that is unbelievable to societies that value human life, and at a cost to Russia that is probably unsupportable.

Bakhmut does have some strategic importance, which is obvious in the fact that it has taken Russia so long to overwhelm it.  It's a great defensive location and will allow Russia better access to transport in the region.  That said, it wasn't strategically worth the cost of lives and munitions put into it.  Not even for a country that puts so little value on both of these resources, like Russia.

Ukraine has probably already left Bakhmut by the time this is posted, but its also probable that they won the battle, simply because of what it cost Russia to take it.",False,1678004637.0,t3_11imxyy,t3_11imxyy,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

>No military in a democratic society can keep sending wave after wave of soldiers to near-certain death to gain another few hundred yards.

This one is via Google translate. It was posted by Osechkin 17 hours ago, I haven't seen anyone translate it yet. A ""drg"" is a raiding party.


> we needed our own ""Russian Bucha"", which would copy the effect of the Ukrainian Bucha and psychologically block it in the memory of the Western layman. Similar things are planned with the highest degree of secrecy, although for a number of indirect points involvedin the operation, specialists receive guidance on exactly when and what will approximately happen. In the end, it is necessary to prepare reactions along the chain of events, provide for a number of factors, think over instructions, etc.
Important markers that this year have been particularly evident in our work:

> - Whatever happens, if we did not prepare it ourselves - no reactions and tough actions. The airfield was blown up, Nord Stream was pierced, even though Bryansk was squeezed out - if we didn’t plan and implement it ourselves, then in the worst case, Peskov will send to the Moscow Region or us for answers;

> - If we are planning something ourselves, then the performers must be in a hurry so that a pompous official reaction to the event does not happen before the events themselves.

> So, a rather formidable appeal by Putin V.V. for today it was ready, legislativethe base, as far as I know, is worked out. The case remained for the manifestation of an inhuman terrorist attack.

> At least one refrigerated vehicle entered from the Kursk regiontor with the bodies of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of the Russian Guard and OMON were withdrawn from the selected territories, a completely safe corridor was made at the border (no one planned to walk along it, but it was required so that later none of the border guards would testify that they had not seen anyone in his zone responsibilityeverything went smoothly). Interaction with the media has been worked out a priori, statements about civilian casualties, shot hostages, etc. prepared, n.p. was chosen (according to my information, the main coven should have been in one settlement). ""Enemy UAVs"" were supposed to destroy all cameras at the ""crossing the border of the DRG"" with pinpoint accuracy. In addition, there could be no ""retreat"" of the DRG in the plans: they went in, beat up the locals, scattered leaflets, but the valiant special forces immediately burst in and during a short effective clashkilled every single terrorist. Media, corpses, paintings, evidence,The President makes the only possible statement, the whole country is united in the need to repel the terrorists.

> And now some obscure, Russian people by passport burst into this impeccable plan. They fit perfectly at a time when a hole was kindly made in the border (we did), when it is impossible to call law enforcement agencies at the site of a future special operation, where there is no one at all. Yes, they arrived a little earlier, but in such a situation it was already difficult for the organizers to figure it out. Secrecy is a double-edged sword.

> ""One death is a tragedy, millions of deaths are statistics."" These words of Stalin are a standard informational rule: individual stories are always needed against the background of the statistics of an event: a little girl who dreamed of buying a toy for her mother on March 8, but was brutally killed by a Ukrainian DRG, a grandmother burned alive in the courtyard of the house, etc. Now I gave examples, not specifics. And the leadership was lucky twice: firstly, that they slowed down our DRG by the time the ""stray"" calmly went home and the National Guard began to catch up, and, secondly, they did not start tearful stories about the dead civilians quite in advance. It would be inconvenient. Although what else can be spoiled in this operetta?

> But there were already instructions on what and how to comment,how to direct your contacts among journalists and bloggers, what information can be passed as a source to contacts in Western media. And now so many people in the system understand the essence of what happened that the organizers should be a little offended.
But from this we draw the first main conclusion:

> - THE PERFECTLY PRECISE TIME AND THE CALM OF THE FLIGHT DRG COULD NOT BE A NORMAL RANDOMNESS. These were not specialists, they went as if on a holiday, they could take a g\*p\*y camp with tambourines and buffoons with bears in both directions - and they would have passed with the same result, but precisely in this corridor of time. They came out so on time that by the time we began to understand something, it was already too late. And the one behind this ""action"" perfectly knew the whole plan to the details. And to have a tolerance of this level could be a few. Which of them leaked and why? And to whom? It is clear that everyone will blame the Anglo-Saxons and their Ukrainian puppets, but real questions remain.

They aren't particularly intelligent, they are all just a bunch of caveman, so it wouldn't be a particularly hard feat. The conventional army is in charge of the nuclear arsenal, but nukes are completely useless against an ""enemy"" that comes from within russia (that's the achilles heel of nuclear weapons, they are useless vs non-state actors). If the West covertly helped those mercenaries take control of the kremlin, which they are capable of since the conventional forces are clearly underperforming them, then we would be installing a governance more friendly towards the West, not least because we helped them getting there. All they want is power, so give them russia instead of a random piece of wasteland in Ukraine.

They could also be refereing to the coming mud season which will make it difficult for the aggressor.

There's no way Russia can build up enough for the rumored april offensives, Russia spent a substantial amount of blood and steel during the winter.

The question remains - how would Russia achieve any meaningful breakthroughs? The answer is from combined arms offensives - these are the critical difference between warfare of WW1 and WW2.

However, Russia's ability to conduct such warfare appears to be limited at best.

They haven't been good at coordination, precision fires (including air-based) and rapid advance since the beginning of the current hostilities. The only reason they achieved anything much at all appears to have been surprise. And they haven't demonstrated any ability to replicate much surprise since then.

And the longer Russia grinds itself wastefully as it has been, the further it degrades its ability to achieve any breakthrough or rapid advance.

Russia is at the point now where they are drawing on very old stocks of equipment and limited training all the while suffering among the highest casualty rates of the war.

You don't get better at combined arms by throwing away your core capability - your people.

So it's not impossible for Russia to raise some functionally trained force elements and conduct some sort of functional offensive, but it's very unlikely.

The real question is what can Ukraine achieve, there is some really good kit in the training pipelines but not a whole lot of it. Leveraging this qualitative advantage will be crucial if Ukraine hopes to resume the momentum it enjoyed in the second half of 2022.",1677999705.0,1677996172.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jazacfn,,1,35,0,35,0,0,

That at least as an element of plausibility. I do not think it is likely on account of bleeding Russian white and reducing their ability to wage war clearly aligns with Western interests and the European nations are directly threatened by Russia's behavior. They have little incentive to sell out Ukraine. Contrast that with the Kurds who are treated terribly by many countries but it is in Western interest to keep those countries happy. We have to keep turkey on our side so fuck the Kurds. 

So the next question is whether the ukrainians can push the Russians back. Which I think seems pretty likely because even with the defender advantage the quality of Russian troops is terrible. So it seems very plausible that Ukraine can punch holes in the lines and cut off Russian troops from resupply and thus create a huge opportunities to take prisoners. the Russians have little incentive to fight to the death. And if they chose to, if they are surrounded then they could be pounded to death with artillery, no need for Ukraine to take casualties with direct fighting. 

In summary I don't see how the Russians have any realistic way of advancing and taking more territory. I don't see that they can run out the clock and get the current lines accepted. And it seems very likely the ukrainians could simply push them out.

IIRC the Australian Army spent a lot of effort in the early 2000s or maybe earlier, getting rid of the stigma around it and spending a lot of effort in how to do it in an orderly fashion (a 'fighting withdrawal').

Because it turns out, fighting to the death is a great way to lose the core of a military capability - your people. And if you codify and destigmatise it, your soldiers are actually less likely to retreat as they'll trust their commanders to time it properly and better for everyone.

There's been a lot of evolution in force preservation in allied forces over the last 50 or so years. In the long run, this leads to a more effective force for a longer period of time and thus more consistent and better performance.

I see this claim SO MANY times. What do you and others base this on to claim that ""it will probably"" happen. It's just pure speculation, no source, nothing.

Historically, more often the opposite is true. Support increases in wartimes. The only revolts we see are after years of conflict. In WW1 there was a revolt of German soldiers, but bevore that millions died and the war was clearly lost. Stalin could send 30 million to their death and no-one rebelled. And of course, the German population was absolutely shredded at the end and millions of soldiers were dead (rightfully so), but they still did not rebell

Public support for wars is primarily a problem for DEMOCRACIES, and even then only after years of conflict. The US didn't withdraw from Vietnam after the losses increased, and they had 370.000 casualties (60k dead). 

Meanwhile, the Russians have had propaganda against the Ukrainians for decades, they were told this is a second war for the motherland, and it appears (although no-one can really know) that a great majority supports the invasion. Putin is by and large popular according to the few polls done by people who are independent of the government. And lastly, beeing a dictatorship, they can just supress dissent.

From outside Russia and reading a reliably accurate account, yeah his legacy will look bad.  

But if from inside Russia, particularly from a demographic which believes the Kremlin propaganda, that person would get a whole different perspective.  

It really depends upon what happens when Putin is dead. Does the next tyrant use Putin as a scapegoat to absolve themselves of all blame or not and will they continue with the war or not? 

There are various theories about what *may* happen once Putin is dead, but really we'll just have to wait and see. There's no guarantee what the next tyrant will do. I think it is safe to say that whoever it is will still be a Putin-like person. Julia Ioffe has been saying for some time that the next leader will be a Putin v.2.0 as has someone who helped Putin seize power.  

If however you are asking what does Putin himself think of his legacy right now, well I'm very sure that he thinks he's the best and doing a great job. If anything goes wrong it is because of America and the CIA plotting to topple him and destroy Russia. Putin has been thinking this way for many decades.

General Yoshitsugu Saitō gathered almost 4,300 Japanese soldiers, walking wounded and some civilians, many unarmed, and ordered the charge. On July 7, 1944, it slammed directly into the Army's 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry Regiment, which lost almost 2,000 men\[17\] in the 15-hour pitched battle. The attack was ultimately repulsed, and almost all the Japanese soldiers taking part in the charge were killed.

It is next to impossible for a poorly equipped, untrained army of mobilized invaders and meecenaries to overcome well defended, well equipped defending force that is defending their homeland.

Very near the end of an interview for PBS Frontline with Julia Ioffe, she said something rather chilling. Regarding potential leaders, she said that there are people worse than Putin in Russia.  

Be careful what you wish for.  

In an article Julia wrote that her Eastern European intel contacts said that Wagner doesn't stand a chance of seizing power. For one thing there are a lot of people very loyal to Putin that they would have to get through to reach Putin himself.  

Getting enough of the Wagner mercenaries back to Moscow and the Kremlin, and have them armed, would also be difficult not to mention suspicious.  

The last time Julia wrote about this she said that currently Putin has told the FSB to leave Wagner alone. She said they *hated* that as they are ultra paranoid control freaks. The FSB also have another reason to hate Wagner. Wagner are linked to the GRU who gave Wagner their orders. The FSB see the GRU as rivals and really would not want a pro-GRU person running Russia.  

I think that if Wagner tried anything on Putin's life the FSB and the loyal bodyguards, police, etc. would continue to side with Putin.

That’s probably why Podolyak said that the other 4 hotspots besides Bakhmut were seeing just as much activity (gains, losses) and was baffled by the hyper-focus on Bakhmut.  But also, I don’t think this was disclosed by the General Staff.

Regarding capitals—Balinsky ‘decreed’ that Melitopol is the regional head of Zaporozhye, ‘problem solved’, ha.  So from their view, they have 3 of the 4 regional capital cities.  (Side note, even the Russians laugh at how preposterous this is.  I see it in their comment sections of their newssites.  They think that the annexation wasn’t legit bc only a portion voted, and altogether, it’s more trouble than worth.)

Regarding Russia’s judicial pretenses, Melitopol now has some Russian judges and prosecutors.  Not many.  And there’s some collaborators.  There’s still issues of petty crimes (thefts) and a lot of types of fraud.  Their justice is a sham, of course.  And local newssite points out that there’s basically no restraint on soldiers or ‘guests’ [what they call the mass influx of Russian civilians—like the civil contractors—many thousands have come].  That being said, I was surprised [to read this story](https://ria-m.tv/news/313367/osetin_i_zubastik_rashistyi_nashli_ubiyts_byivshego_glavyi_politsii_melitopolya_%28foto%29.html).  A high-profile disappearance, and two civilians have been arrested.  This man had been a police chief in Melitopol, pre-invasion.  Presumably he was pro-Ukraine, bc he and his family fled rather than work for the occupiers.  Then, perplexingly, he went back, solo, in the late fall—to care for older relatives—resigned from position [so no longer receives civil service pay], but disappeared.  His family feared he was kidnapped and taken to the basements—which would align w expectations.  The Ukrainian press covered it—but wrote somewhat bewilderingly that he started a private business down in Melitopol, and was driving for it.  “Delivering goids.” What? Why would he do that? Ok so I’ve come to understand that when things don’t add up, it’s often bc they’re secretly working for the GUR, gathering intel.  Ok, so more likely that he was taken to basements.  (Several hundred locals remain in captivity, the Mayor said last month.  Or at least unaccounted for, they could be dead—I think they’ve gotten confirmation that 70 for sure are being held... which likely means they’re in actual detainment facilities in Crimea with charges.)
But apparently, he was *actually* running a pseudo funeral business?  And was stepping on someone else’s turf?  And Russia will actually prosecute them for murder?  Seems unusual.  I’m not sure what I think of this case. The article I linked says that at the end, why prosecute murders who killed a pro-Ukraine former officer, and answered that it might be like soviet days of mob bosses prosecuted, urged on by other mob boss who controls prosecutor/police.",1678043408.0,1678042750.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jazo1iz,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

There was an ar Le recently where Russia was apparently looking at putting their planes in attack formations over Ukraine. That was some weeks ago and I haven’t heard from it sense.

A bit like throwing mobliks at the problem, this is likely to give Russia some wins but, like using meat waves, the cost for Russia will be huge. In this scenario it won’t be cheap mobliks thrown in to the fire, it will be Russia’s airforce.

Time will tell whether Putin will be that reckless. Unfortunately, I think this scenario is quite possible. 

Putin’s calculations seem to be purely around what might be good for him. Stopping offensives will be disastrous for Putin at this stage. It is likely he will commit the Russian airforce in mass offensives over Ukraine to push his agenda of continued “wins”, and yes, Russia will likely lose many aircraft. 

I do, however, think you are being overly kind to Russia in calling this scenario “combined arms”. They’ve shown many times now they are not able to do western-style combined arms. I doubt Russia will suddenly learn to do combined arms - as you say - while Russia continues to destroy its men at a high pace they are likely to “learn” anything.

What I see is them using their planes as a next-level artillery where they flatten an area before the infantry attacks.

It will be effective. It will also be expensive and ultimately unsustainable for Russia. They cannot rebuild their airforce, and so it’s an all-or-nothing gamble for Putin.

Putin will be conflicted as he is usually risk adverse, but if he doesn’t make this gamble he will never know.

I personally believe he will try it as Putin doesn’t care if the airforce survives, and he cares very much if he survives.

Time will tell if Russia can gain significant amounts of land with this tactic.",1678012414.0,1678003104.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jazcx4v,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

Firstly, 

Russias demographics are appalling. Of its 140 million people on 20 million are able-bodied enough to fight in a war.

Ukraine, remarkably, has almost 10 million able-bodied men.

So the ratio of combat-able men that both countries can potentially mobilise is only 2:1.

If casualties really are in advantage to Ukraine 3:1, then Russia will run out of troops sooner than Ukraine will.

In fact, with 200k gone, Russia has already lost 1% of it fighting age males.

Secondly, 

Conversely, Russia has 120 million people who aren’t able-bodied.

In a country where there are only 14 able-bodied men in every 100 people, losing 1 is painful, and losing 2 is a disaster.

There is a rule that in any society, if you lose 10% of your work force society breaks down.

Russia has already lost 200k in Ukraine. They probably lost another million by people skipping the country.

At least another 400k soldiers are already in Ukraine 

So in the last 2 month, Russia has already lost 1.6M of its 20M able-bodied men - or 8%.

1. The russian FSB planned to fake an attack on Bryansk by a Ukrainian raiding party to create a ""russian bucha""

2. The FSB had Ukrainian army bodies ready in a freezer van and were going to stage a grisly murder scene

3. They were going to pretend the Ukrainian army had raided Bryansk and killed children or done horrible things

4. Part of the FSB plot involved emptying the area of russian officials, so that they can't later claim there were in the area and didn't see anything.

5. Ukraine discovered this whole thing and sent the russian volunteers to arrive just before this was supposed to take place

6. The Ukrainian aligned russians (""rex"" and others) made their way to the area where they took the video. In their own interviews (see wartranslated) they've said they had a small engagement. In the video some gunshots can be heard

6. Anyway this is all extremely confusing to the FSB who aren't sure whether someone screwed up the timing or what

I think we all need to be careful of judging cultures for this because, in reality, all of our great-grandparents grew up in that type of society and with that type of belief system.

In reality, all cultures were like this 200 years ago. It was the colonial world. That was because the world was infinitely large, the forests and animals were endless, and there was always a neighbour who was ready and willing to do the same thing to you.

The 20th century, WWI, WWII, and nuclear weapons changed all of that. The world is a small place. If we continue with colonial thinking, we will fuck it up for all of us.

Some countries in areas where the world still seems infinite didn’t get that memo. Russia and China head the list. For them, they see the 21st century as their chance to finally take over the whole world.

The world cannot move forward with that kind of thinking. One race is not superior to another. The zero sum game kills all of us. We only have one world and if we fuck it up there will be drastic consequences for all of our children.

I often wonder if Russians actually think clearly about their children, and the world they’ve created for them.

Colonial thinking doesn’t work in the technological age. I just hope the whole world will come to understand that, and stop wasting resources on racist wars.",1678045873.0,1678045529.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jb1l0rh,,2,10,0,10,0,0,
17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,11imxyy,jb1shpe,"I broadly agree with everything you've said here, though if like to add some things. I think it's important to keep in mind that right now in Russia, this sick fascist voice that seems so omnipresent and ubiquitous also happens to be the only safe voice to air publicly, and the apathetic don't have any voice at all, so it's easy to mistake what could well be 10-20% of the population and mistake it for 70-80%. But having spent a lot of time in Russia, my own personal experience leads me to agree with experts like Yudin and Vexler who ballpark rhe numbers of fascists and liberals at around 20-30% each. Of course there will be exceptions - Petersburg and Moscow probably tending more towards apathy/liberal, while provincial regions in the east can be very strongly pro-Z. 

In any case, I like to maintain an optimistic hope that if apathy was no longer an option, that majority would err on the side of personal freedoms and being open to the world. There's no doubt in my mind that Petersburg and Moscow would strongly end up that way. On the bright side, many urban Russians have now experienced the west and what western values look, smell, and taste like - an experience that basically no one had during the 90s after the collapse. On the downside, unlike the end of the 90s, they don't really have any chance to change the system now. Yeah they fucked up by voting Putin in that first time, but hindsight is 20/20 and the population back then was emaciated and blind. It would take half of the big cities to rise up together now to overcome the police state. 

In my view, the only hope we have left is that Patrushev (I think the only man who is able to remove Putin) will wait until public sentiment is clearly souring on Putin, and when a critical mass is reached, something will happen to Putin, Mishustin will take over the face of government while Patrushev plays kingmaker from the shadows. He could have Mishustin make overtures of penitence and blame it all on Putin and his enablers. Of course he wouldn't do that because its the right thing - Patrushev has exactly the same ideology as Putin. The difference is that Putin has handcuffed himself to this war, and he will go down with the ship. Patrushev hasn't however, and probably still has a good 10-15 years left that I'm sure he'd prefer to enjoy in an Italian villa like he used to. That alone wouldn't be enough though - the power structure remains the same, and the FSB still control everything. The west would have to make massive reform a condition of any removal of sanctions and getting back to normal. This is the only way we could realistically prevent Putin 2.0 happening again. I really hope the west will not go back to usual business if this primary issue is not solved. I say that as someone who lives in Russia still. We don't deserve any of the belong to the global family until liberal voices are allowed to be heard again, and the apathetic start taking responsibility for their inaction and get involved.",False,1678046076.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jb1l0rh,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

>""Pilots say they could master it in about half a year,"" he said.

Now, he does mention:

* Using all type of weapons
* Pilots could ""master"" it in this timeframe

Air-to-air weapons systems and Basic Fighter Maneuvers are taught first, followed by Basic Surface Attack (BSA), which would probably not be a mission taken on by Ukrainian F-16 squadrons at the outset.

But if the Ukrainians say six months, I'll take their estimate.

Ground crews require less training than that, but let's say a few months to be conservative.

It's still criminal that this program wasn't initiated the moment it became clear, early in the invasion, that Russia has been unsuccessful at destroying Ukraine's air force, meaning that there remains a core of experienced pilots and crews to train on new airframes, and that there remain operational airfields for use by 4th generation fighters.

The rest of the program for arming Ukraine switched fairly quickly from supplying weapons for something resembling an insurgent campaign against advancing Russian forces, to recognizing the need to supply what has proven to be a very advanced, competently-led, well-organized military force against Russian weight of numbers.

But for some reason, we dicked around for over a year pretending that air power reinforcement can wait until the war is over. Training a dozen pilots on the F-16 is a good start. If we hear, soon, that training for ground crews has begun, then we'll know that common sense has finally won out.

Airframes would be a matter of negotiating with NATO partners who are waiting for Lockheed Martin's assembly line to catch up with the backlog of orders.

Anyone arguing that we need Ukraine to join NATO first, to supply them with F-16s, is unfamiliar with how widely this aircraft is in service. With non-NATO countries often fielding the most advanced iterations of the type.

Exaggerating how difficult it is, logistically, or how sensitive it is, politically, to supply Ukraine with one of the key items they've been asking for since mid-2022, can only excuse, if not outright cause, excessive hand-wringing by key decision-makers in the West that directly serves Putin's interests.",1678053481.0,1678053014.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jb1c103,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Those Russians who call themselves liberal but still deny they sided with Nazi Germany are part of the fascist group - just ones who are aware of it and try to hide it. 

And yes, obviously apathy helps the regime. That's why I myself said and say repeatedly that they bear responsibility for this war. But it is implicit support, not explicit. Many of these people are not inherently morally horrible people, and if they were forced to come to terms with the situation and choose a side, would say that what is happening to Ukraine is disgusting and Putin is a maniac.

I imagine Western Europe had a different view of the cold war than the UK. Western Europe was freed by the UK and US armies in WWII((as well as many others, but less relevant for the conversation here), and then spend their years rebuilding. Of course they aligned with the US/UK on the cold war, but i can imagine that Mainland western europe felt more like a pawn than a player for much of the cold war. For example, There have been protests against placing nukes in certain countries, and of course germany even being split in two during the cold war. 

The UK, on the other hand, was the launch point of D-Day, was a victorious army against the nazi's, and was an equal partner in peace talks and during the start of the cold war against Russia. 

So even though both western europe and the UK had Russia as the enemy during the cold war, I suppose this was much more explicit from the UK than from western Europe. And especially after the fall of the wall, Germany of course wanted to look eastward as much as westward. Almost *had to*, if they wanted to take reunification seriously.

Finally, Eastern Europe has of course experienced the horrors of the USSR directly, and has since had to deal with Russia as a direct neighbor. very black and white.

So i guess that the odd ones out are mainland western Europe, who i guess had the perception of being sometimes 'dragged along' rather than an active party in the cold war. And i guess for us it's been the biggest 'shock', and the hardest to view this as black and white.

However, in terms of decisiveness, the (german) wiki has this to say (translated with Deepl)

For a long time, the Battle of Stalingrad was seen as the turning point of the Second World War. This is not least due to its symbolic quality, which in Nazi propaganda was associated with Wagner's Twilight of the Gods and was also staged by Stalin as a world-historical moment. (...) Historical scholarship largely endorsed the interpretation of a 1943 turnaround in the war until Andreas Hillgruber's 1965 book Hitler's Strategy argued for a turnaround as early as 1941.[40] Other military historians also doubt that a 1943 turnaround was possible.
Thus, other military historians now also doubt that the Wehrmacht could have won the war by early 1943. A German victory is now considered unrealistic after the US entry into the war and the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy before Moscow in December 1941. The Stalingrad defeat had not yet meant a turnaround in the world war as a whole, but it had meant the definitive loss of the strategic initiative on the eastern theatre of war. ""In this respect,"" Wegner said, ""the Stalingrad events really represented a 'point of no return'.

So apparently people agree that it wasn't decisive in the sense that Germany could not have won even if it was a success. The defeat certainly did not help though of course, and thankfully so.",False,1678011793.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jazvbly,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

>The Turkish Foreign Minister announced that the Straits have been closed to ‘all warships’. However, such a situation can only arise under Article 20 or 21 of the Convention. Since Turkey is not a party to the conflict, the question of Article 20 does not arise at all. For Article 21 to apply, Turkey must consider itself to be under a ‘threat of imminent danger of war’. In this case, there is no apparent threat of use of force to Turkey. However, since the Convention allows Turkey to make the call on the presence of such a threat, it could theoretically consider itself under a threat of imminent danger of war. Under this theory, Turkey can essentially deny passage to Russian vessels, even if they are returning to their base in the Black Sea, since the Russian attitude is responsible for the application of Article 21. In such a scenario, Russia can only approach the UN Security Council and put Turkey’s decision to a vote and see if it obtains votes of at least a two-thirds majority in its favour.

>This legal position, however, is not possible as, first, Turkey does not consider itself under any threat of war presently. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may put some strategic interests of Turkey at stake, but that alone cannot amount to a threat of imminent danger of war. Secondly, even if Turkey considers there is a presence of such a threat, and makes an untrue determination to that effect, it would negate the principles of good faith and violate the provisions of the Convention, risking its denunciation. Thirdly, Turkey is required to notify High Contracting Parties and the Secretary General of the UN about its decision to impose Article 21. The Turkish Foreign Minister claimed that all countries were ‘warned’ not to send their vessels in the Black Sea, but there exists legitimate doubts about a formal notification being made. In this light, restricting access to the Turkish Straits to all warships is not valid and does not set a correct precedent in the application of the Convention.


---

>Turkey’s decision to block the straits totally to foreign vessels sets a dangerous precedent. On the other hand, if Turkey attempts to defend its position by using Article 21 without justifying an impending threat of imminent danger of war and an evident notification, it may lead to future exploitations of Article 21. In any case, governments depending on passing through the Straits, including Russia and NATO Member States, might begin viewing the Montreux Convention as deliberately undermining their strategic defence interests.

>Ideally, the Turkish Government should implement its obligation under the Convention and limit access only for Russian and Ukrainian warships to transit the Straits under Article 19. That may be at the cost of some key diplomatic interests, but that is how Turkey can hold Russia accountable for its actions, uphold the principles of good faith and be on the right side of history.",False,1678052901.0,t3_11imxyy,t1_jb1ywfi,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

No.  I meant what I said.  Stop wasting my time with nonsense. 

>So you want Turkey to allow a non-Blacksea nation’s warships (which are limited in tonnage and caliber even in peacetime) but block Russian warships, while neither Nato nor any Nato allies nor Turkey itself being officially at war with Russia?

That is what the treaty mandates.  Yeah, I'm out of my mind.  From article 19:

>In time of war, Turkey not being belligerent, warships shall enjoy complete freedom of transit and navigation through the Straits under the same conditions as those laid down in Articles 10 to 18


>Vessels of war belonging to belligerent Powers shall not, however, pass through the Straits except in cases arising out of the application of Article 25 of the present Convention, and in cases of assistance rendered to a State victim of aggression in virtue of a treaty of mutual assistance binding Turkey

>That is a very fast way to drag all of us into a global war and thankfully, that is not happening. 

Absolutely ludicrous.

>Turkey can block all warships as long as it sees a threat of war under the convention.

edit:  Oh yes, and article 21 of the convention requires Turkey to bring it's invocation of that its' under an imminent threat of war to an international body, and the signatories of the convention to vote on whether Turkey's actions should be discontinued - that never happened...because its obviously bullshit.

US military studies, wargames, press releases and Western analysis thinktanks.

>If there ever was a war with China, it would be because China invaded another country, like Taiwan.

Correct, which is why American leaders are so worried, because this actually represents a confluence of problems for the US.

>So it would be China that would be fighting at a disadvantage against US troops in Taiwan

You have not done much research about this situation if you think it can summarized anywhere as simply as ""China has the disadvantage."" Both sides have lots of disadvantages to overcome in such a war, and the US at present does not believe it can reliably win this conflict. In the majority of wargames the US has run since the early 2000s, the United States loses against China in this exact scenario.

The US does not actually station that many troops on the island of Taiwan, and nor would it try to put that many more on Taiwan if it knew that China was about to attack. The risk that those troops would become isolated and cut off from American reinforcement or evacuation is too great. Chinese ballistic missiles have ranges of about 1,500 kilometers, which is well beyond the sea gap between China and Taiwan of 160 kilometers.

American military planners seem confident they can attrit China's navy, but the question is what happens to Taiwan's population and military during the mean time. If China uses missiles and aircraft on a sustained bombing campaign over Taiwan, there is little the US can do to respond, because China's aircraft will enjoy a range advantage. Taiwan is so close to the Chinese coast that it is effectively on home territory for Chinese aircraft and missiles, where American aircraft and naval forces would have to stretch the very limits of their upper ranges in order to stay out of the Chinese anti-ship missile umbrella.

>and that's not even counting the aircraft carriers. 

Yeah, it's not that simple, at all. Losing even one aircraft carrier would be considered a catastrophic loss for the United States, and the odds are a lot higher of that happening than American planners want it to be. The upper range of American aircraft carrier-launched F-18s is about 2,000 kilometers, and the upper range of the carrier-launched F-35B is just 1,600 kilometers.

This is serious problem for American naval forces. In order to stay out of range of Chinese anti-ship missiles, the aircraft carriers have to sit 1,500+ kilometers away from Taiwan. This gives the F-18s only a few hundred kilometers of range to play around with -- functionally, only a few minutes to spend at a time in the combat zone before they have to go back to the carrier or refuel from a circling airborne tanker. The F-35B would have to launch from carriers that are *within* the Chinese anti-ship umbrella just to shoot at anything.

>Not to mention all the bases in Japan, South Korea, etc. Even Philippines recently allowed US troops to be stationed there again.

Those airbases are crucial, yes, but they are also vulnerable. A few key bombings by Chinese bomber fleets, and one of those airbases can be knocked out of commission for a critical number of days or weeks. Taking one of these few airbases offline even for a few hours could pay dividends to the Chinese. 

See, for example, this article:

>Anonymous US defense sources told The Times that China’s ballistic missiles could inflict considerable damage to American aircraft carrier groups as well as to every US base in the Indo-Pacific Command region. The Pacific island of Guam, a base for American strategic bombers such as the B-1, B-2 and B-52, is now considered to be wholly at risk.

>...

>“Every simulation that has been conducted looking at the threat from China by 2030, and there have been various ones carried out, for example in the event of China invading Taiwan, have all ended up with the defeat of the US,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China power project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a consultant for the US government on East Asia.
