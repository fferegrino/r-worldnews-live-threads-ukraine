“Zygar told several sources in the Kremlin and members of Russia's business elite that Putin listens to almost no one for long time and does not personally communicate with anyone except Yuri Kovalchuk.

Allegedly, in the spring and summer of 2020, in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic in the world, Putin sat on self-isolation at his residence in Valdai. Zigar says his friend Kovalchuk was at the residence with Putin the entire time.

Kovalchuk was among Putin's close friends and advisers in the 1990s. He owns the largest stake in the commercial bank Bank Rossiya and controls several state-owned media outlets.
The Russian journalist describes Kovalchuk's worldview as a mixture of hedonism, Orthodox mysticism, and belief in conspiracy theories about the ubiquitous influence of the United States, New World Order. And, according to Zygar, along with Kovalchuk, Putin has also plunged into a paranoid fascination with Russia's former greatness and plans to restore it.

Putin's advisors told Zygar that Putin is annoyed by the discussion of modern economic problems and pandemics, and has gone completely into the study of the past. In support of this thesis, Zygart cites a French diplomat who was briefed on Putin's talks with his French vis-a-vis Emmanuel Macron. During the talks, Putin gave Macron a long lecture on Russian history, and Macron was puzzled as to how to respond.”

Not this shit again, please… We already had one Rasputin…

P.S. I am not trying to justify Putin's dictatorship, but as a historian, I consider an important nuance: 
PUTIN DOES NOT USE THE INTERNET. 
DOES NOT READ FOREIGN NEWS. 
HE JUDGES THE SITUATION BASED ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT HIS SUBORDINATES BRING HIM.

At fact, he build himself a strong propaganda bubble by his own hands.

P.S.2 

There is a type of situation in Russian history in which the Ukrainian War fits perfectly. 

""Little victorious war”

 A perfect example: Russo-Japanese, Russo-Finnish, Russo-Turkish (1853). This is the kind of war in which the Tsar/Gensec/President is persuaded to get involved by his advisors, grey cardinals who is interested in it for some reasons, forming before him the false idea that the war will be easy and quick and victorious and definitely will help solve some problems in our own society (for example, will raise patriotism). 

Joseph Brodsky described it perfectly in his 1968 ""Letter to the General Z"":  
""And here, I think, it was not even strategy that brought us here, but thirst for brotherhood. It is better to meddle in others' affairs if we can't manage our own.”

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechens! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY!

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are.

And here come the kick. We did not have internet. We had no access to free media. We were not able to read or listen to anything that was not allowed as easily as Russians today.

""Putin is preparing a terrorist attack on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
March 11, 2022
According to available information, Vladimir Putin has ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The Russian-controlled Chernobyl nuclear power plant plans to create a man-made catastrophe, for which the occupiers will try to shift responsibility to Ukraine.

Currently, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The station is de-energized. The resource of available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.

The occupiers refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen. Instead, ""Belarusian specialists"" went there on the instructions of Alexander Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.

At the same time, in recent days, Putin's troops have struck at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (where the experimental nuclear reactor is located).

In order to imitate the involvement of the Ukrainian military in the Chernobyl accident, the occupiers are trying to create fake ""evidence"" to confirm their version. In particular, Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Gostomel. There is a possibility that they will be presented as killed saboteurs in the Chernobyl zone.

That is, without getting the desired result from the ground military operation and direct talks, Putin is ready to resort to nuclear blackmail of the world community for the sake of concessions in support of Ukraine.

At present, Ukraine, the world, and Russia itself understand that the statements about Ukraine's involvement in the creation of a nuclear threat are only a staging of a mediocre scenario. Nevertheless, such actions by Putin will have catastrophic consequences for the whole world. It seems that this is what the Russian dictator is counting on, demanding unacceptable concessions.""

>The occupiers refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen. Instead, ""Belarusian specialists"" went there on the instructions of Alexander Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.

>At the same time, in recent days, Putin's troops have struck at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (where the experimental nuclear reactor is located).

So the latest Ukrainian military stats on Russian losses are out and I decided to do a little compare-and-contrast exercise between what Kyiv says and what @oryxspioenkop has verified so far with respect to destroyed, damaged, captured or abandoned units.

N.B.: @oryxspioenkop acknowledges that what is verified relies on ""photo or videographic evidence. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here.""

So let's begin, shall we?

As ever, Ukraine defines its terms a bit differently from how we might do in the West. For instance -- and here I mean no offense to those lovable scamps at Tankist Twitter™! -- Kyiv almost certainly uses ""tanks"" promiscuously to include also APCs, AFVs and IFVs.

So I've included @oryxspioenkop's stats for those. 

Oryx:  353  
Ukraine: 389 

(Not bad!)

Artillery:

Oryx: 51  
Ukraine: 125

Multiple Launch Rocket Systems: 

Oryx: 19  
Ukraine: 58

“Air Defense Systems” (again, Kyiv's definition here may be a bit too loosey-goosey for AD purists, but note the near match-up):

Oryx: 35  
Ukraine: 31

Aircraft (Fixed-wing):

Oryx: 12  
Ukraine: 83

“Automotive Equipment” (Kyiv's term: your guess is as good as mine here, but I've started with trucks and jeeps and added in @oryxspioenkop's categories for infantry mobility and engineering vehicles):

Oryx: 382  
Ukraine: 558

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles:

Oryx: 3  
Ukraine: 7

No doubt I may have made a few mistakes here in my own category assumptions, but I think it's still a pretty useful comparative analysis.

- Does it sound impressive?  They picked a number in the vicinity of the amount Ukraine just advertised getting, but mostly it makes them look incompetent and desperate.  
- Do they think it will be effective?  These people have less experience, less discipline, and no knowledge of the language or the landscape, *or* the weather, and it-is-what-it-is but none of them exactly pass for Slavic.  There are two million Russians they could have pressured into going in their place, so that's not it.  
- Or is it perhaps because they want soldiers who have as little invested in the lives of Slavs as possible, who will kill indiscriminately and for whom the 'will to fight' isn't in question?  And will they perhaps not be used on the line at all, but told to roam between villages committing unconscionable acts of violence?  

It's got to be (3), right?  Otherwise if they march in there as their own cohort and try to take up an offensive position, they'll just be mowed down in five minutes like the first Chechen group.

**Fears grow over bond payment due next week as IMF warns country faces 'deep recession'**

Russia is facing effective bankruptcy as soon as Wednesday after the World Bank warned that crippling sanctions have left the Kremlin “mighty close” to a default on its foreign debts.  
Carmen Reinhart, chief economist at the World Bank, said that Russia and Belarus are now in “square default territory”, with payments on about $40bn of Moscow’s external bonds at risk.  
Analysts fear the country will fail to make a $117m (£89m) coupon payment on a sovereign eurobond next week. It will have a 30-day grace period to pay up, but may be deemed to have defaulted if it attempts to pay in roubles.  
Foreign investors hold about half of Russia’s currency-linked bonds, leaving banks that bought debt from Moscow potentially exposed to multi-billion-dollar losses as a result. France is most at risk, with $4.5bn of Russian government bonds held by the country's lenders.  
It came as Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that Russia is facing a ""deep recession"" from sanctions which have cut access to its central bank reserves, reduced living standards and sparked an exodus of Western businesses.  
A large-scale default would be Russia’s first since the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.  
The ratings agency Fitch has cut Russia’s sovereign debt rating to “C”, deep in junk territory, warning a default is “imminent” as Moscow is increasingly frozen out of the global financial system.  
Ms Reinhart said: “They're not rated by the agencies as a selective default yet, but mighty close."" Althea Spinozzi, a fixed rates strategist at Saxo Bank, said Russia might default “as soon as next week”.  
Defaulting would mean Moscow is ostracised on global debt markets, leaving it unable to tap Western investors for money. But president Vladimir Putin’s ""Fortress Russia"" strategy may leave the nation resilient to this, and sanctions rule out such borrowing in the near term in any case.  
The fate of tens of billions more in corporate debt is also at stake.  
Alastair George, chief investment strategist at investment research firm Edison Group, said it was difficult to gauge the Kremlin’s “end game”.  
He added: “The typical stick that bondholders would use is to say: ‘Okay, if you default on this debt, you'll trash your reputation, and you won't be able to raise capital on international financial markets'.  
“But Russia could turn around and say: ‘Well, we're not gonna be able to do that, anyway’.”  
Sanctions are expected to send the Russian economy into a steep contraction. The rouble has collapsed in value since the invasion and its stock market remains shut.  
Speaking to journalists on Thursday evening, Ms Georgieva, of the IMF, said: ""Unprecedented sanctions have led to abrupt contraction of the Russian economy, moving into a deep recession.  
""We are mindful that massive currency depreciation is driving inflation up. It is denting severely the purchasing power and standard of living for a vast majority of the Russian population.  
She added that global growth forecasts are likely to be cut next month as a result of the crisis.

First, it questions the fundamental premiss of the invasion of Ukraine: namely that it will otherwise join NATO and that then the United States will then install its offensive missiles pointed at Russia. Second, it argues that it would make no sense for the Americans to do any such thing, particularly in a country whose loyalty cannot be counted on. Third, the Americans are never going to let Ukraine have nuclear weapons and the Ukrainians are in no position to create their own. Fourth, the Donbas and Crimea are already burden enough for the Russian economy and given the weight of Western sanctions they will be too much for it.

>  Focusing on the conduct of the war under the subtitle, “A Serious Enemy”, the critique goes on to point out that, not counting Russia and Turkey, Ukraine has the strongest army in Europe, especially in “psychological preparedness for military action.” Moreover, even counting Turkey, it has the strongest air defence in Europe. And “if at least half of their pilots could take off”, they have the strongest air force in Europe. Only the navy can be discounted as insignificant. And on the Russian side, “we should not pray for our Iskanders and Calibres [short range ballistic missiles]: there are only a few of them and they are expensive. We can’t afford to fight NATO-style, bombarding the enemy with ammunition that is more expensive than the targets they hit. In fact, as experience shows, NATO members themselves cannot any longer fight this way, and it is now basically impossible for them to fight in any other way.”

One hilarious thing is that despite many Russians hate the US and western world, they were happy to have an access to western technologies, facilities, culture and more. After leaving of many companies Russian people start to realize that their nation hasn't invented or created anything useful since 80s. They can't even grow potatoes as seeds are from abroad.

How can you become a great power if your economy is selling resources for someone else's goods and technologies? They don't want to be a secondary nation, but basically they are a colony. After breaking apart with the West they won't create their own industry like the USSR did, they will become a vassal of China. Oil, gas and palladium in exchange not for Mercedes or iphone, but for food.

Still Russian propanda narrative is like we turn off the gas supply and people in Europe are gonna freeze. Like 10 years ago Russians were laughing at North Korea dictatorship and its silliness and now they are exactly like it.

I hope one day my Russian friends will realize that Putin's rule was a national disaster which have thrown Russia into degratation and complete possesion of China.

Yes, it's sucks that people will Starve and their life savings will be wiped out. However it's the only weapon the free world has against Russian fascists. Do not give in to the propaganda coming about the ""poor Russians suffering"". Ignore them. This is an economic war against Russia, and that means it has to also hurt as many people as possible. That's what it's designed to do.

Here's why.

Russian fascism (this is what the Putin regime refers to it as, not hyperbole) has the stated goal of ethnically cleansing Ukraine and the complete erasure of the Ukrainian identity. It's genocide.

There are a few ways to stop the spread of Russian fascism.

1. Ukraine continues to fight and Putin turns Kyiv into another Grozny. Essentially turns it into a parking lot and rebuilds.

2. Russia balkanizes Ukraine into 5 or 6 separate countries

3. Ukrainians retake Ukraine (unlikely)

4. The economic sanctions absolutely destroy and Cripple the Russian economy to the point where large scale food shortages and unemployment force a regime change.

Obviously 4 is the most moral choice and minimizes death while also ensuring Russians are free of a brutal dictator and his mafia regime.

So don't engage with trolls who wish to frame the issue about sanctions hurting ordinary Russians. That's what they're supposed to do, and it's far more beneficial a grandma can't buy bread, than Kyiv or Moscow is turned to dust. Again, it's sad that this is where we're at. We shouldnt celebrate starving Russians, but there's simply no better option.",1647008438.0,1647008345.0,t3_tbkzpd,t3_tbkzpd,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

I believe there's a chance we will see a Russian psy-op targeting western conservative and pandemic-skeptical groups. I would not be surprised to see the Russians attempt to put forward a narrative that COVID-19, either overtly or through their sub rosa information warfare channels, was created by the US in a Ukrainian lab, and that they've found evidence of it during this invasion. If they do this, it will be a deliberate effort to sow chaos in western cities. I imagine some sort of weaponized ""convoy"" protest is their ideal outcome--although any form of right-wing terror/insurrection would be satisfactory from their view. There's a reason the Tucker Carlson/Glenn Greenwald/Alex Jones/Tulsi Gabbard types have latched onto this ""bio-warfare labs"" narrative lately.

Russian has been trying to pull off a number of psy-ops targeted at western audiences over the past several weeks within the context of this war. Nothing has really stuck so far, and their entire operation almost collapsed entirely during the early days when their western stooges suddenly had to transition with zero prep from ""you liberals are just crying wolf."" They basically suddenly lost their central narrative and didn't know what to do.

Since then, they've tried a couple of things--the Nazi bit, for instance. Fortunately, these narratives have not stuck because Russian leadership has been trapped by their own cultural blinders. In part, it's because the western understanding of Nazis is fundamentally different from the Russian understanding of Nazis. In short, in the west calling someone a Nazi comes with a diverse amount of baggage--the antisemitism, the global conquest, the repression both domestic and in occupied countries, etc. The official Russian state narrative, though, is quite different: To Russians, they've been told for quite some time that the defining feature of Nazis is that they are anti-Russian. Which is why the ""Nazi Ukraine"" narrative may play somewhat effectively inside Russia, but lands as a dud in the West. We simply understand Nazis differently from Russians, and the idea that a country that elected a Jewish president could be ""Nazi"" is so patently absurd as to be easily dismissed.

So, be on the lookout for this, it's something that may be coming, and while I hope it's also a miss, if it lands it could have serious consequences.",False,1647013815.0,t3_tbkzpd,t3_tbkzpd,,0,26,0,26,1,0,

She's a Russian-born American who studied Soviet history and Russian literature at Princeton University, one of the top schools in the world, and has been covering Russian politics for a long time.

A quote from the end of her interview, [here](https://youtu.be/kSNo2FPQDQw?t=2706) that I think more people need to understand:

>""When Putin threatens the use of **nuclear weapons**...If people think that he won't use them, I think they're mistaken. Everything Putin has showed us, every step of the last 22 years, is that every time we think he won't go that far, he does...because he is losing, and because the sanctions and the Ukrainians are humiliating him, because he is backed into a corner, he is the most dangerous he has ever been.

There are interviews of numerous current and former NATO/military personnel that are saying essentially the same thing: **Putin will continue to threaten the use of nuclear weapons to get his way, and he** ***will*** **use them if he wants to.**

For example, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Wes Clark, echoed something similar in his interview the other day [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFXArMvzRjg). In that interview, he explains how Ukraine is simply the first battle, and Putin will not stop there. If the West and its allies bow down to fears of Putin's nuclear threats, the fight will eventually be brought directly to NATO's territory. There, Putin will try to accomplish his goal of rolling back NATO territory and will try to reclaim what he delusionally thinks is his.

Most of us here are not military experts at all, but I am curious about what everyone thinks:

1. How does NATO respond to the above? Do you potentially let Putin steamroll Ukraine and the whatever else he wants with this threat (and possible usage) of nuclear weapons?
2. What kind of pre-emptive, preventive, or reactionary actions could NATO take? Are sanctions enough? What's the response if he decides to nuke Ukraine, a country that is not part of NATO?",1646989389.0,1646989317.0,t3_tbkzpd,t3_tbkzpd,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

They then shared that info with Ukraine and then helped them plan for counter ops. For example, the big fight that occured in Kyiv near the zoo very early in the campaign was likely a very well organized attempt to topple the heads of the Ukrainian govt. via late night covert assault or abduction that got surprise counter attacked.

As to why, I can only assume that it was deemed worth blowing those assets cover (or the risk of) in order to keep Russia from easily toppling and reintegrating Ukraine back into the their fold. Perhaps the logic was economically motivated.  Crippling the Russian economy clearly has its benefits for the west.  It could also be that the west is *really* playing chess here and there is a greater long term play at work.

There's a few factors why Russia has to get it done now and will do so sooner rather than later  
\- Fatigue, every day where Russia is stalled means more resource drain, more repurcussions, lower morale an more attriton. Attrition being a major factor.  They're already low on food, fuel, suffering from hypothermia and resorting to looting to get by. This isn't a kind of military that can afford to stall. Russia planned a 14 day war, we're well surpassed that with no conclusion anywhere near in sight.  
\- We've seen countless videos of vehicles stuck in the mud, only able to stick to the roads. The recent cold spell freezes the ground and creates more terain for vehicles to maneuvre a little better. Russia will likely try to use this to their advantage  
\- Putin is getting desperate in the Kremlin, firing general, going after FSB, losing commanders left and right. If pulling out and admitting defeat isnt a choice, a frontal assault before Ukraine becomes more fortified and more well equipped poses as a major threat.  
\- Russia is continuing to advance. (people are arguing that UA is counter attacking with success and some Russian lines are stalling, which is correct but what if I were to tell you that there's more than just 2 fronts and other lines are still progressing forward) As many analysts stated; they will begin as soon as the North West/North East flanks somewhat meet up and encircle. UA is preventing that from happening. With other factors are work where full encirclment might be too difficult in a short amount of time with Russia, they might just resort to what they planned to do without full encirclement  
\- From a logistical perspective, we've heard the 40mile convoy has dispersed (widely known fact now) and repositioning/reploying elsewhere. This can mean that they've received central command and know what their next course of actions are. Something is brewing up.  


Of course there are other reasons why they might not:  


\- RUssia insists on full encirclement which means it wont happen any time soon  
\- Russia diverts their focus from Kyev to reinforce Eastern flank where all hell is breaking loose or move South towards Khinnyh Rhiv (sp?) or Dnipro  
\- Russia admits defeat (very unlikely), change in command (more unlikely)  
\- Russia decides its too costly to take over Kyiv and thus just resorts to resource starving them out.

This is an opinion, and feel free to call me a fear mongering idiot.

**What if Putin wants to create like an actual inhabitable buffer between the West and Russia.**

So far, he has gone after (and attacked) all of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine. A major disaster would create a potential ""exclusion' zone that could take up most of Belarus and Ukraine in a disaster. The main reason for having Ukraine is to add a buffer zone to protect from a land based attack via the European Plains - so what if that pathway was impossible to traverse?

If you cant take Ukraine (which he wont) then what other ways or means could you get the desired effect and protection you seek while also having plausible deniability?

If Putin does stage a false flag nuclear disaster at any or all of the power plants in Ukraine and blames it on Ukrainians, I can pretty much say that's the red line, and shit will go down.

Europe would have to act in order to try to contain and deal with these disasters that Russia would have no problem extending. This gives Russia another major bargaining chip - and is basically a nuclear attack without having the responsibility of using one of their weapons to do it.

**NATO would be left with only two real world options.**

1. Confront Russia and face potential large scale conventional or regional nuclear war in order to stop an existing Nuclear disaster from proliferating.
2. Capitulate to Russian demands, Ukraine falls and Europe is now forced with containing fallout from the disaster that Russia created

Ultimately I really hope that this doesn't happen. I PRAY this doesn't happen - but in the face of crippling sanctions and an increasingly unpopular and extremely expensive war, Putin is going to try to achieve his goals as fast as possible, with plausible deniability.

> After reports from British intelligence about the Kremlin's plans to put Yevgeniy Murayev, leader of the marginal political party “Nashi”, at the head of Ukraine, Moscow now has decided to replace him with Viktor Yanukovych, who is currently in the Belarus capital of Minsk, with Russian occupation forces ready to assign him as a president in Kyiv. This would fully comply with the narratives of Russian propaganda, which over the past eight years have been stating that Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 due to an illegal “coup” supported by the West.

>Yanukovych's return to power would let Putin erase the humiliation he suffered during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, when Yanukovych was ousted after the Maiden protests in Kyiv, and the Orange Revolution, which saw Ukrainians protest the 2004 election results that were reported to be rigged in Yanukovych’s favor.

During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) it was under Ming rule as part of the Nurgan Regional Military Commission. It was visited by Chinese expeditions under Haixi Jurchen eunuch Yishiha, and a relic of that time, the Ming Yongning Temple Stele is displayed in the local museum. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk defined the area as part of China under the Manchu Qing Dynasty.

 >Operation INFEKTION was an active measure disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the 1980s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename ""INFEKTION"" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack, who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either ""INFEKTION"" or perhaps also ""VORWÄRTS II"" (""FORWARD II"").

I think China's initial response was because Putin told Xi of the operation but assured him it would be over quick and they could just ignore it... and it upset Chinese authorities that this was not quick or easily ignorable at all.

But I think after the dust settled from the sanctions and the trajectory of this war and situation started to set in, China has modified their approach.


Right now, China seems to be playing a two-faced game.  They're publically engaging in just enough support for Russia to justify further cooperation with them (more importantly, just enough rhetorical support that Russia still wants to deal with them), while at the same time *buying Russia's entire economy out from under it at a discount.*   



They're using Western sanctions as a vehicle to expand their influence at a cut rate and Russia, unable to deny financial assistance from any non-belligerent party offering it, had little choice but to give it to them.

Consider that SARS1 definitely came from a wet market in China. This really made the world, in general, more aware of how dangerous coronaviruses can be, and inspired China to set up laboratories specifically to collect and research them. Coronaviruses are pretty common, with hosts in a variety of animal species. 

Russia has had all of those years since SARS1 to look for coronaviruses in *their* animal population that may be transmissible to humans.

There was what looks like a perfect set-up to plant one in China and no one ever doubt that was the source. Previous deadly coronavirus outbreak from there; source determined to be wet market; high security virology lab studying coronaviruses; conveniently nearby wet market.

Note that while we apparently were able to identify the animal source of SARS1, we've been unable to locate a definitive source for SARS2 in China. Maybe because the source is actually in Russia?

>After the initial invasion went more poorly for Russia than most people expected, most of the posters here insisted that Russia sent it's worst troops on purpose

The thing is, even the West was surprised by the spectacular failures of the Russian invasion in the beginning of the war. We had assumed the 2nd army of the world would be much better than this. I'd say this argument was a way to rationalize what we were seeing, the russian army couldn't be this incompetent ... but it turns out more and more that the russian army was grossly over-estimated.

>Way too many posts warning people not to trust Ukrainian sources, while posting tons of Russian sources. If you go story for story, Ukraine's releases have been more accurate. It took Russia at least a week to admit casualties when we were getting Russian bodies here every day. They are not the same- Ukraine hasn't nearly an equivalent disinformation apparatus; disinformation is Russia's second biggest export. They are known for it above most else. At least divvy up your grains of salt proportionately.

True but never forget information and how it is spun is crucial during war time. I'm definitely siding with the Ukrainians but I'm willing to concede not everything we hear from them may be the objective truth. You do have a point when you say Russia is a bigger propaganda machine and therefore nothing coming from their side should even be considered as truth.

>Constant warnings that sanctions will only make Russians support Russia more. When there is not a viable alternative and the best experts we have are calling for specific sanctions that haven't even been enacted.

There is historical data on sanctions and their effects on enemy regimes, and most of the time, they are spun internally in a way that present the outsiders are out to destroy the people of the sanctioned countries - look at Iran, Cuba, etc. And thus end up increasing support for the regimes. So I understand the warnings in that light. I support the sanctions even with their potential backlashes to the West because they're definitely hurting Putin and his close circle, but I also understand they're not perfect and may very well backfire if the objective is to topple Putin.

>Countless what about racism posts, intended to make people stop caring bout Ukraine.

>Countless, a fucking million posts like ""Sadly, because of X happening this is the end for Ukraine."" two weeks later...

As for point 2, its an information war so both sides have propaganda. I don't trust Russian sources for obvious reasons but also skeptical of Ukranian sources unless they're a primary source of material. I have no doubt Ukraine is inflicting more damage than Russia ever imagined but at the same time, Russia is advancing whether you want to admit it or not gradually on different fronts with some fronts stalled.  


As for point 3, it is a valid point. Success propaganda, fear mongering and confirmation bias amongst other tools can rally some population who's been isolated by the world who have to suffer the consequences because of a maniac's actions.

But certainly there has been lots of anecdotal evidence over the years that the Russian military was faltering - particularly how badly Russian equipped armies have done in recent wars. But obviously it would be incorrect to assume the US military is a joke because the US-equipped Afghan army turned out to be one of the most pathetic armies in history. So you couldn't just assume bad Russia-equipped armies = poor Russian army.

Original comment:

Absolutely ludicrous that people actually believe this will happen. We won’t reach a point where Russia can’t afford to pay their soldiers.

Edit: 

1) Russia is still raking in cash from the West:

>	Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is being bolstered by $285m (£217m) in oil payments made every day by European countries, new analysis by the Transport & Environment (T&E) thinktank has found.

Source: https://theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/european-oil-receipts-boosting-putins-war-chest-study-finds

2) Russia can literally just print its own money. Seeing as it’s been cut off from outside monetary institutions, nothing is stopping it from having a primarily internal economy with no oversight. What’s to stop Russia from printing more roubles? What’s to stop Russia from setting their own market prices for the things they don’t need to import? What’s to stop Russia from seizing and repurposing foreign assets towards these goals?

https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/russia-ukraine-and-the-risk-of-nuclear-war/

One of the guest's main thrusts is that Putin is probably not crazy, and the real threat of him using nuclear weapons comes when he decides that the risks of using them no longer outweigh the risks not using them. In that sense, Ukraine winning the war on their own and sanctions destroying Russia's economy may put us in the riskiest position of all.

But there is a lot more to it. The sort of ""game-theory"" involving nuclear weapons is very complicated, and rife with unpredictable human elements.

It's not good news even if they ""win"" this war, a complete pariah state. 

For someone so consumed by his ego, having failed so miserably and at the age he is at, I do genuinely think he would order nukes be launched, what has he got to lose?  He certainly doesn't care about human life.  Maybe his children?  I assume they would be moved to safety.

I think the things that you list are probably things that, in theory, could be supported internally with a regulated economy beholden only to Russia. However, whenever you trade goods with other countries, you need to sell them the goods according to the exchange rate price. This keeps the prices high in grocery stores, etc. This is because our economies are so interconnected that raw materials from other places are imported in, and this was the major policy of the US and western powers. The thinking was that by tying trade to other countries that if the supply of goods was removed then inflation and prices go up, and we are seeing that now.

You might ask why Russia can not simply change prices arbitrarily. The very simple example goes something like if Russia was trying to make its currency look more valuable when paying for goods from another country, then the other country would eventually (or immediately) get wise and ask for a higher price. Russia, at some point, can not sustain paying the higher price and simply goes without those products from other places.  If Russia could sustain itself with all the goods that are everywhere else, then you have to also think about how much more expensive it is to make those goods in Russia and how there was a cost benefit to buying those items more cheaply in other countries before the sanctions. In all cases, the cost goes up. 

In practical terms that means whoever is making the good in Russia looks at how much it cost to make, how much time it took, how much other substitute goods are on the market, and how much it costs them to live and save and all of that. Then, they ask for a price.  The thing that is happening here is that everyone is doing this, everyone's costs are going up, and therefore everyone asks for a higher price.  If they all do this, then raising wages would mean that costs go up even higher. Hence, there is a spiral of inflation. The fact that this happens so rapidly is because the major financial hubs in Russia (i.e., banks) did this all at once. Also in practical terms, you simply won't have materials coming into Russia and so people will do without goods.

Historically, when inflation happens, unemployment goes way up. Workers absolutely become agitated. You might not see a strike against companies, but you might see unrest against the government itself.",False,1647013937.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i091tal,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The US has reported that 100 % of all staged pre-war forces have now entered Ukraine. So i agree with you that this is the all or nothing moment. Either this hail Mary will reach kyiv or the entire invasion force will break. 

Give that they've so far failed to reach the east bank of the dnieper, failed to isolate kharkiv, that means that kyiv still has wide open supply lines from which Western support is being funnelled. 

I agree with the latest assessment that Ukraine is now much more likely to fight the Russians to a draw (and thus Russian strategic defeat) but this raises the questions of wmds.

It would be an order of magnitude bigger global economic hit of course, but the US would defend Taiwan: their entire system of alliances depends on the perception that they will step in, and they see China as the rising power, the threat that will define the 21st century the way the USSR did the 20th.

Some specific counterpoints:

China's naval buildup isn't completed and they lack the amphibious capability they probably need (though it's coming on fast).

Their most capable aircraft carriers aren't built yet and carrier aviation is still fairly embryonic in the PLAN. They need huge power projection abilities to shut down the Indian Navy and prevent energy blockades in particular.

They haven't finished the onshore facilities they will build to support the invasion, and they haven't obviously massed any troops.

A2/AD bubble isn't tested against stealth, and I honestly think US SEAD efforts, particularly with B2s and JASSM-ERs, would be markedly more effective than Russia's vs Ukraine.

With the way Russia is performing, there's probably sufficient capability in Europe alone to defeat them conventionally, meaning the US could move much of its focus to China without worrying that much about Russia rolling over Eastern Europe.


Honestly, the only small advantage China might have in attacking now is that there's probably a bit of a global shortage of MANPADs and anti-tank weapons right now that would make it harder to ship them to Taiwan.

Edit - Did some more research and tactical nukes are stronger than I thought. They can be stronger than the Fat Man, but some are weaker and others can be “tuned” to do more or less damage. The Davy Crockett “mini nuke” explodes with the force of 200 tons of TNT, and has a “window-breaking” radius of about a quarter-mile according to [Nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/). A 10-kiloton nuke breaks windows for about 1.5 miles (hard to count). There ARE larger nukes that like the 350kt W-78 that breaks. windows ~15 miles away.

Tactical nukes definitely aren’t small bombs, but they can definitely be “aimed” at specific targets in ways that bigger bombs can’t.",1647015451.0,1646992213.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i07ukb2,,2,113,0,113,0,0,

But the fact is that Putin is now a prisoner of his historical fantasies, in completely incomprehensible isolation (no one really knows where he is and whether he is healthy except for 3-4 closest to him advisors), he almost never goes out in public since the pandemic.

In our news, there was a rumor that he was supposedly shocked by the news that enlisted soldiers were sent to the front along with people who were under contract. As weird as that is, I believe it. 

Unlike our defense minister (that weird Shoigu shaman-fireman), Putin actually served in the Army, was a military man in his own right. 
He must understand that conscripts are simply bad for the army. They're ineffective, they're not emotionally stable, and this drags out the process. The Kadyrovites are also bad, because they are badly controlled, aggressive, strong, but disobedient - obidience was necessary to take the cities quickly with a minimum of civilian casualties.

Please stop. This is performative as hell. We're here to discuss an incredibly serious and devastating topic, this is not the place for this kind of thing.

They are Russians. People from the country of Russia. The Russian leader declared this war and invaded a peaceful country. A lot of Russians unfortunately believe that Ukraine is under the occupation of Nazis. Russian soldiers are brutalising a nation. A large amount of younger Russians have taken to the streets to protest, and many of those Russians are now in prison. A Russian woman with a baby was attacked by Russian police in one such protest. An older Russian lady who survived through Stalingrad protested against what is being done in Ukraine, and was arrested by Russian police.

Russians are people. They are not a word you can censor. To take away from their humanity is to downplay the true horror of what is being done to the Ukrainians. They are not being attacked by robots, or fictional bad guys. They are being attacked by Russian people, people as capable of happiness and sadness, joy and pain as you. And those Russian people are now choosing to inflict a hurt upon the Ukrainian people that they would not wish on their own people. Their actions do not take away from their humanity, rather they reflect the kind of people some are choosing to be. Some Russians are going to jail for fighting for the good of their neighbours and the future of own their country. Other Russians are spilling innocent blood. The only difference between the two is the choices they make, what kind of person each individual Russian decides to be.",1646988370.0,1646987806.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i07vgz7,,2,49,0,49,0,0,

 >Operation INFEKTION was an active measure disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the 1980s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename ""INFEKTION"" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack, who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either ""INFEKTION"" or perhaps also ""VORWÄRTS II"" (""FORWARD II"").

Apparently the Germans had discovered the organophosphate nerve agents Sarin, Tabun, & Soman in the course of pesticide development. They refined them into far deadlier poisons than any of the previous war gasses (cyanide, arsine and mustards) and would surely have used them to great effect, especially in fighting poorly equipped ""human waves"" like at Stalingrad. But they never did.

The theory I heard is that the US was also doing work into organophosphates for pesticide use, and then when the war started the scientists involved dropped the research to do other things. The germans saw the sudden lack of papers published on organophosphates and assumed that we had nerve agents too and had classified the whole project (much like the Manhattan Project would later be). 

Since we had far more strategic bombing capability than they did, they calculated that if they used war gasses the Allies would reciprocate with Superfortress-loads of our own potent nerve gasses and make Dresden look like a polite sunday BBQ. 

This was, in fact, incorrect, but they certainly had every reason to fear it might be and the possible advantage was judged not worth the apocalyptic risk. Perhaps it might be considered a precursor to MAD.",False,1646996311.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i084fdp,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

I thought it was only American children who didn't understand this, but apparently many politicians have simply never been briefed on the outcomes, either, given the inanity floating around on socials.  Modern weapons have yields *thousands* of times greater than Hiroshima.  They detonate above cities, not in them, and they devastate entire regions.  There's a reason we haven't allowed testing above ground in half a century.  Even one of them detonating in Ukraine would irradiate western Russia with acid rain for a year.  5-10 anywhere in the world would runaway effect global warming.  15-20 would destroy the biosphere.  This isn't Sid fucking Meier's Civilization.  Building thousands of these weapons was a calculated cold war money sink intended to fool constituents and out-spend the enemy on things less useful than beer coasters.  

But Putin knows that much, rest assured.  His judgment is in question, and maybe insulation from truth, recently, but you don't run a nuclear power for 20 years without understanding your arsenal is just for show.  

Just please, people, educate yourselves.  It's not a video game.  There is no such thing as a nuclear bomb shelter, and if you ever see someone running for office who believes otherwise, run them the fuck out of town.

Democracies aren't lead by leaders, but the leaders led by polls. So it can happen that a dictator is allowed to open up his tents in the Champs-Elyssee-palace on day X and just a couple of years later he needs to hide and becomes a persona non grata (and there didn't change much in between). 

In dictatorships the irrationality is limited to the guy on top. He is more or less rational and changes over time (to the more irrational I'd say). 

With us, the top is the public and that's driven by sentiments to a large degree. 

Yes, there are checks and balances in democracies usually (winner takes all systems a bit less I'd think) that are missing in dictatorships (usually, although in most dictatorships there kind of are as they still need to keep their base happy unless it's a Mao or Stalin case).

Should China voice too much support for the bioweapons-story that could be used as pretext to claim that lines are being crossed and we would consider appropriate reactions. 

China needs to be ambiguous enough. They do not want to be put in the same basket as Russia, they want to remain as neutral as possible. We won't do sanctions anyway as we like our cheap gadgets, but the more we put them in doubt about it, the more they'll put pressure on Russia.

 >Electronic voting was first introduced to Brazil in 1996; with the first tests carried out in the state of Santa Catarina. The primary design goal of the Brazilian voting machine is extreme simplicity, the model being a public phone booth. The Brazilian voting machine accomplishes three steps (voter identification, secure voting and tallying) in a single process, eliminating fraud based on forged or falsified public documents. Political parties have access to the voting machine's programs before the election for auditing.

India agrees to cut ties. It no longer has access to say.... Fighter planes. Now America's ally in Pakistan attacks with F16s. It's happened before.

 The only explanation that I think is remotely adequate for the casualty numbers in 2 weeks is the heavy usage of conscripts on the Russian side, which makes not a lot of sense from the perspective of wanting to keep war support up, and the west would obivously love to capitalize on that fact by over inflating the casualties but I guess Russia could also just be using a lot of conscripts.",1647010833.0,1647010607.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i08vaf9,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Two things to consider:

1. During the Lybian intervention the European countries ran out of stockpiles of bombs within (iirc) ten days and had to be restocked by the USA. Taking on Russia would mean a massive supply and logistics commitment from the USA and other countries not directly fighting the Russians.
2. Putin might still go the nuclear route. In fact if he could convince himself that the nuclear NATO members won't retaliate if he drops a big one on, say, Poland, he may even be more likely to press the big red doombutton.

If there is enough logistical support from the west though I don't see Russia being able to fight a sustained campaign against multiple near peer countries who have better trained forces and more modern, better maintained, and better equipped/supplied forces.

For instance, Russia had ~100 KA52 attack helicopters and ~30 KA50 variants before their romp into Zelenskyy's neighborhood. They also had about 126 of the MI28.

Those three are their most modern battelfield helicopters and about half of them have no all weather capability or night fighting ability.

From some sources they lost about 10% of their total attack helicopters. A high estimate, sure, but still. Pitch them against countries that have modern western SAM systems, and who have a true day/night/adverse weather fighting capability across all their platforms and Russia would have a hard time fighting even a protracted defensive war.

It is as simple as that. Mutually Assured Destruction. MAD.

For the last 75 years we have all lived with this being one of the possible ends of current human civilization.

If one actual nuke goes off anywhere in the world we are all dead.  That is the zero sum game that exists so that humanity has had the chance to continue for these last 75 years.

Since the creation of atomic weapons the entire world has been living on begged, borrowed, and stolen time.

The only way to circumvent this end is the unification of the human race against something even greater than our own evil.  Not going to happen, sadly.

Humanity as a whole is now playing against the clock, against the changes in the environment that we have directly created in the last 200 years.

This war, when seen in the larger picture of the state of the planet, makes complete sense.  It is just so mind shatteringly insane what we are facing in the next 20 years, that we as sentient but wholly self centered beings, refuse to believe it is happening.

While true it takes a lot of time to ""cool down"" your numbers are wrong.

>This heat could melt the core of a light water reactor unless it is reliably dissipated, as shown in the March 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi, where about 1.5% of the heat was being generated when the tsunami disabled the cooling.

So as you can see, while loss of coolant is not good it is already at a point orders of magnitude better then when the Fukushima accident occurred.

WASHINGTON — The tense talks this week among the United States, Russia and European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have made one thing clear: While the Biden administration insists it will not allow Moscow to quash Ukraine’s ambitions to join NATO, it has no immediate plans to help bring the former Soviet republic into the alliance.

If Ukraine were a NATO member, the alliance would be obligated to defend it against Russia and other adversaries. U.S. officials say they will not appease President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by undermining a policy enshrined in NATO’s original 1949 treaty that grants any European nation the right to ask to join.

“Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO’s open door policy — a policy that has always been central to the NATO alliance,” Wendy R. Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, said on Wednesday.

But France and Germany have in the past opposed Ukraine’s inclusion, and other European members are wary — a deal breaker for an alliance that grants membership only by unanimous consent. American and Russian leaders know this. With Russian troops amassed on Ukraine’s eastern border, some current and former American and European officials say Mr. Putin might just be raising the NATO issue as a pretext for an invasion.

Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, has suggested that Mr. Putin is trying to distract from more urgent matters. “Everybody’s talking about NATO expansion,” Mr. McFaul said on a podcast by the Center for a New American Security that was released on Tuesday. “Suddenly, we’re debating this issue that wasn’t even an issue. That’s a great advantage to him.”

Like European leaders, President Biden remains uninterested in Ukrainian membership in NATO. Here are four reasons.
Biden has grown skeptical of expanding U.S. military commitments.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Biden successfully urged NATO to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as member states in the late 1990s. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, Mr. Biden said that turning the former Cold War adversaries into allies would mark the “beginning of another 50 years of peace” for Europe. He added that the move would right a “historical injustice” perpetrated by Stalin.

But over the course of two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, experts said, Mr. Biden’s fervor for expanding NATO cooled considerably. In 2004, seven Eastern European countries joined the alliance, and in 2008, President George W. Bush pushed NATO to issue a declaration that Ukraine and Georgia would become members in the future despite reservations from U.S. intelligence agencies. However, the alliance has never offered either country a formal action plan to join, a necessary step for them to do so.

As recently as June, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told senators that “we support Ukraine membership in NATO.” Mr. Biden, however, has been far more circumspect in his public comments and “has soft-pedaled talk of extending NATO membership to Ukraine,” two foreign policy scholars, Joshua Shifrinson and Stephen Wertheim, wrote in September in Foreign Affairs.

In 2014, as vice president, Mr. Biden told officials in Ukraine during a visit there that any U.S. military support would be small, if given at all, according to a biography of Mr. Biden by Evan Osnos, a New Yorker writer who was on the trip. Russia had just invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and Ukrainian officials were unhappy with Mr. Biden’s message.

“We no longer think in Cold War terms,” Mr. Biden told Mr. Osnos, adding that “there is nothing that Putin can do militarily to fundamentally alter American interests.”

Last June, Mr. Biden told journalists at NATO headquarters in Brussels that “school is out on that question” when asked whether Ukraine could join the alliance.
Biden wants Ukraine to improve its political and legal systems.

To meet one of the three main criteria for entry into NATO, a European nation must demonstrate a commitment to democracy, individual liberty and support for the rule of law. While Ukrainian leaders say they have met that threshold, some American and European officials argue otherwise.

In a 2020 analysis, Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, ranked Ukraine 117th out of 180 countries on its corruption index, lower than any NATO nation.

Officials in European nations with stronger liberal governance — notably in Sweden and Finland — have also floated the possibility of joining NATO, despite years of determined nonalignment. That is a discussion “we are ready to do,” Victoria J. Nuland, the State Department’s under secretary for political affairs, told journalists on Tuesday. “Obviously, they are longtime, established, stable democracies.”

She signaled that might not be the case with Ukraine. “That conversation would be slightly different than it is with countries that are making the transition to democratic systems and dealing with intensive problems of corruption and economic reform and democratic stability, etc.,” Ms. Nuland said.

Her comments echoed those of Mr. Biden on his 2014 visit to Ukraine. “To be very blunt about it, and this is a delicate thing to say to a group of leaders in their house of parliament, but you have to fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now,” Mr. Biden told Ukrainian officials then.

Some Western officials also question whether Ukraine could meet a second set of criteria: contributing to the collective defense of NATO nations. But Ukraine sent troops to the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“There are steps that Ukraine needs to take,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in September after President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office. “They’re very familiar with these: efforts to advance rule of law reforms, modernize its defense sector and expand economic growth.”
NATO wants to avoid greater Russian hostility.

After annexing Crimea, Mr. Putin invaded eastern Ukraine and gave military aid to a separatist insurgency there. He did something similar in Georgia in 2008. The message has been clear: If these two nations join NATO, the United States and European countries will have to grapple directly with ongoing Russian-fueled conflicts.

Russia could also impose other costs on Europe, such as withholding gas exports. And Germany and many other NATO nations prefer to choose their battles with Russia, given its proximity and Mr. Putin’s aggressive nature. They know he and other Russian officials are obsessed with Ukraine.",False,1646996410.0,t3_tbkzpd,t1_i085gle,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

1: Germany could do a lot of damage, but they weren't capable of killing every person on earth in under 24 hours if Berlin was about to fall. Attacking Germany was dangerous for soldiers, but would not result in global extinction.

2: Germany had a full industrial capacity that could be used to stimulate its own economy without foreign support. Germany could properly equip, train, mobilize and support its troops in the field. Russian troops are having to raid Ukrainian grocery stores to keep from starving.

3: Germany had military parity with its regional rivals up until the start of WW2 and veteran leadership that had been thoroughly tested during WW1 in matters of logistics and modern combat operations. This is why they could successfully mount invasions of multiple peer countries in rapid succession. Russia can't even properly refuel its vehicles less than a hundred miles outside its own border.

4: Germany benefitted from a Europe that was disjointed and unprepared for military engagement. Putin has lost any such element of surprise he may have possessed at the start of the conflict in Ukraine.

5: Germany had allies capable of participating in military maneuvers, including Russia itself. Russia has Belarus and that's pretty much it.

*In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with 
intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as 
such: 

(a) Killing members of the group; 

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; 

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its 
physical destruction in whole or in part; 

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; 

(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.*

What Russians do in Mariupol is a genocide according to this definition.

As for aircraft only 1k of their forces are combat craft. They don’t have the pilots trained to fly all of them nor the parts machined to keep them up and running. Same for their tanks.

The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States.

A big card that they haven't played yet, and I wonder if they will threaten is the outright seizure of foreign assets, rather than the current freezing we see now. Just take Chelsea as an example, that is a $1.5-2 billion USD loss if the UK government just takes it, rather than freezes it. That is a pretty crazy escalation though, and would basically be the end of Russian investment in those countries moving forward you would think, but honestly, considering the Russian economy is likely going to topple down DRAMATICALLY once this is all over. Using the current Ruble Russia has gone from 11th largest economy in the world to 22nd in a matter of weeks ([https://theconversation.com/the-russian-economy-is-headed-for-collapse-178605](https://theconversation.com/the-russian-economy-is-headed-for-collapse-178605)). That would currently put them around Sweden's GDP, but with Russia having 14 times the population as Sweden does. Russia's economy is likely to keep falling as well, and it wouldn't shock me to see their GDP end up in the 30s, or potentially even the 40s, or so in another month or 2. If they fall that far you are basically saying ""I am willing to accept no more foreign investment from a country like Columbia or Egypt."" Truth be told, seizing those assets still wouldn't prevent all investment from Russia into the ""unfriendly"" countries, because local Russian investors aren't stupid, and they will want to invest in a country with a good economy (if they are allowed after by their gov't that is). This is also a big card to play because it would be so targeted at the oligarchs, and not the average Russian, so wouldn't be condemned for being ""anti-capitalistic"" in many corners. Who is going to complain if Abramovich (worth roughly $12 billion USD before this all started) loses $2 billion USD by the UK gov't taking Chelsea from him permanently? Nobody, that's who.

“The principal objection would be: Does such a move actually contribute to the stability in Europe, or would it contribute to destabilization?” said Douglas E. Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. “I think it’s indisputable there wouldn’t be consensus among the 30 members, even though all allies agree that Ukraine has the right to aspire to become a NATO member.”

Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said that even in the 1990s, when NATO enlargement was first proposed, many prominent American strategists opposed it for this reason. “That was the concern all along — it wouldn’t be easy to do this in a way that wouldn’t threaten Russia,” he said.
Ukrainian leaders have waffled on NATO membership.

Ukrainian leaders have not always pushed hard to join NATO, and that has shaped the American approach.

Former President Viktor Yushchenko wanted entry into the alliance, but Ukrainians became more reluctant after Russia invaded Georgia. His successor, Viktor Yanukovych, dropped any drive for membership and promoted closer ties with Russia, even agreeing to allow Moscow to continue leasing a Black Sea naval port in Crimea.

During the Obama administration, American officials encouraged Ukraine to sign a formal association agreement with the European Union rather than try to join NATO. Mr. Putin pressured Mr. Yanukovych to reject the agreement, which led to the Euromaidan protests in 2013 that eventually ousted Mr. Yanukovych.

“A lot of the U.S. policy has been quite reactive due to circumstances,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution who was a senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council under President Donald J. Trump. “It has also changed due to changes in Ukraine itself toward this.”

“By now, you’ve got much more sentiment in Ukraine for joining NATO,” she added.

Mr. Zelensky has pressed Mr. Biden repeatedly on membership, including during his visit to the White House in September. “I would like to discuss with President Biden here his vision, his government’s vision of Ukraine’s chances to join NATO and the time frame for this accession, if it is possible,” he said as he sat next to Mr. Biden.

You're vastly underestimating the destructive force of nuclear warheads. There's a reason why nobody's tried to force North Korea to change their regime, even if the people themselves are famished and their military weaker than combined forced of other militaries. 

Putin is not a weak, pathetic old man. He's a narcissist and a sociopath who is slowly dying of illness, surrounded by a LOT of people that genuinely support his insane worldview. If Putin dies, he'll just be replaced by one of his crooks - who EQUALLY hate NATO and the UN and would absolutely not allow them to just storm in and rearrange their government and hand over their nukes. They would threaten to USE their nukes, just like they're doing now. 

Highly recommend looking at the Youtube channel ""Overly Simplified"" and watching their videos about these wars. You might also come out of it understanding how different these wars would've been if they had an arsenal of nukes at their disposal.

Let’s keep this talk about peace going.  I try to be a pacifist every day.  I believe in it, but it takes work.  You can’t passively be a pacifist - it doesn’t work that way.  A person has to put effort into it every day because violence is built into us.

Russian leadership has chosen violence and the Russian soldiers clearly don’t feel like they have the ability to stand up to their leadership and choose peace right now so let’s ignore that side of things.

Let’s focus on the Ukrainian people.  Here are their peaceful options as I see them, and what I believe their outcomes would be:

1.	Ukrainian government capitulates to Russian demands, and Ukrainian soldiers immediately lay down their arms.  Russia absorbs Ukraine.  Russia is emboldened and continues their imperialistic march be invading other countries.  More loss of life.  At some point, we’re all Russian.
2.	Russia can have Ukraine, but not the Ukrainian people.  Mass exodus of all Ukrainians to the western part of the country and then into neighboring countries.  40+ million people is an unimaginable humanitarian crisis.  More loss of life.  At some point, maybe we’re all Russian.

Those are the only peaceful ends I see without conflict and they are both unreasonable and without significant loss of life.  If I’ve missed an option, please enlighten me.

The only real way I see peace for Ukrainians and the rest of the world is to fight back against Russian aggression and oppression and force a change in Russian leadership or their ability to take these actions.  It’s a bloody business.

One day, maybe, humankind will get its head out of its own ass and realize that one government and societal system benefitting all humans equally and giving all humans an equal voice in crafting our future without violence and lack of opportunity is the way forward.  Until that day, we live in this messy system where, at times, we must choose violent action in the name of future peace.  I hate it, but I don’t think I’m wrong.

The battle was marked by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the Second World War and is one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare, with an estimated 2 million total casualties.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

It doesn't affect me. It just looks like hypocrisy. Expecting a poor country that's suffered due to America to make sacrifices for America when America wouldn't even stop arming murderers and rapists.

Around a million Bangladeshis died to the last ""American friendly regime"". Upto 3. It's amazing how no one cares. Upto 400,000 women came forward as victims of rape. 

It's just brown people isn't it. No.

I repeat. What guarantees are people promising India to fuck over people by having no petrol, no gas and no electricity to deal with a conflict that you only care about because the people being harmed look like you. 

Oh I know war my friend. I was the victim of it. I think Ukraine should be free.

However I think without providing economic equality India won't fuck itself over to placate people who can't even pay the damages they owe to India or return looted property. 

I repeat. All of India's tech is Russian. If India cuts itself off will Americans die for India.

You can't say. Because you know the truth. Americans couldn't even stand against genocide when it benefitted them. You probably didn't even know that American armed soldiers killed a million people. All for wanting freedom and equality.

Like I said. If Jews can't let the Holocaust go then why do you expect Indians to forget empire or Bangladesh? People remember the threats of American bombardment and the lies being told about Bangladesh. 

Or lets take stuff like Union carbide. Would the USA dump DOWS board of directors to face mass deaths charges? No.

Why would they deal with you when you don't offer them anything? They are stuck backing Russia for good reasons (Russia's involvement in the Bangladesh freedom war reduced American involvement). There's too many things India relies on the Russians for. You aren't offering anything but nebulous and poorly thought out friendship and now threatening 1/7 th of the planet.

Do you get why the USA is seen as a bully?

I repeat. You can't even lie and say that yes... Some Puerto Rican soldier will die for India's sovereignty... That's how hollow the words are. 

To get India to stop supporting Russia it would have to be profitable. The USA's not a reliable ally in this area. It would need removals of sanctions, technology transfer and straight up guarantees of defence until it can remove Russian equipment. Guess what. That's not free.

Yes, I'm sure there are smart guys that support your side of the argument. There are as well smart guys that support my side.

But the truth is that, with the exception of Serbia and Libya (this one with UN mandate), NATO has never been the aggressor. It's a defensive organization.

And Serbia and Libya are not Russia.

USSR was not defeated using conventional or nuclear weapons. It was defeated economically.

If NATO and EU countries continue and increase the sanctions and bans, Russia will be crushed economically. It’s being crushed now. 

Also, Russia can’t control Ukraine if Ukrainians keep resisting, as much as USSR couldn’t control Afghanistan.

USSR collapsed because it was overstretched by ill-advised war in Afghanistan and that was the final straw. Every time Russia has lost a war it should have won on paper the regime changes (e.g, Japan). Ukraine poses a similar inflexion point and we should expedite rather than sit on our hands.

>If NATO and EU countries continue and increase the sanctions and bans, Russia will be crushed economically. It’s being crushed now.

I know Russia is being crushed economically but it won't happen quick enough to save 400,000 people in Mariupol.

>Also, Russia can’t control Ukraine if Ukrainians keep resisting, as much as USSR couldn’t control Afghanistan.

Putin isn't interested in governing. He wants to extract wealth and kill the people that dared to stand up to him.

>So, if Ukrainians keep resisting and NATO/EU countries maintain the sanctions, Russia will be defeated.

At the cost of how many Ukrainian lives? Are you OK with that, for countless Ukrainians to die while we hang on to weapons that would dramatically shorten the war.

Also you are talking about the USSR, this is more like facing Hitler. Do you really want another Czechoslovakia on your conscience.
