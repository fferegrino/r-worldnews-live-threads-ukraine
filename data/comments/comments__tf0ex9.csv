Day 20 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today intense fighting continued around our city, and good news is that our governor reported that our army repelled one of the attacks from Russians and reclaimed some of the contested territory around Kharkiv. 

But even now we still hear sounds of shelling. We still get air raid alerts constantly and we also heard the planes themselves a couple of times today, terrifying as ever, though most of the time we don’t hear them during the air raid alerts.

Shelling was almost constant today but it was especially bad around 1 pm and 8 pm, people all throughout our city were reporting hearing explosions, so we don’t actually know where the shelling landed, and even as I’m writing this now I can hear explosions somewhere pretty far away.

Putin has pushed Germany towards rearmament and the 35 F35's they're buying could on their own will impact the balance of the power in Europe.

NATO once produced tensions among member states, in part due to some countries not spending in line with agreements. Now, NATO is closer than it has been in years and many countries once hesitant of military spending will open their check books.

Russia's RT network is getting obliterated globally.

Currency is fucked, wiping out vast amounts of wealth for Russians poor and rich. Living costs will likely skyrocket and hyper inflation seems like a serious risk.

Tons of small issues could drum up discontent, including things as simple as not being able to purchase video games. Create annoyances in the common person's life, and they might return the favor.

Conscription will lose support as families lose loved ones.

Russia's commercial aircraft may end up grounded due to a lack of parts and other inputs.

Putin, a once feared geopolitical player now looks like a clown.

Western companies, crucial for their expertise and resources, won't be (re)entering Russia any time soon.

The live streaming of the war and the damage caused is absolutely nuking Russia's reputation. Not sure that I've ever witnessed something like this before.

Russia has pretty limited resources and can't simply shrug off lost weapons. Each time they loose a missile or equipment is destroyed, it'll weaken their army. Russia's military may well suffer a death by paper cuts not just in Ukraine but in general.

Once feared, Russia looks incompetent.

Europe now looks set to speed away from Russian energy, which will hurt revenues and destroys their leverage.

The war increases the likelihood of an EU wide army. This could cause an immense shift in regional power.

After years of the USA slowly reducing its military foot print on the ground, we can expect a rebound, and just as important, a larger America presence in eastern Europe, right on Russia's doorstep. Instead of pushing the USA away from its borders, you can expect more American troops on or near the borders.

Russia's economy is fucked and national economies are the lifeblood for most countries. Want to build advanced weaponry? You need a thriving tech industry and healthy government revenues to do so. That's probably out of the picture now. Also, the gutted economy is going to hurt a lot of Russians, potentially stirring up discontent.

Brain drain will likely hamper Russia for generations and lost talent will weaken the country as a whole. Rivals that accept Russian migrants, meanwhile, will enjoy a boon.

Russia fretted over a Ukraine not friendly to Russia. This war guarantees Ukraine won't be friendly for a long time coming.

Russia's military leaders may now worry about Putin punishing them, perhaps increased the chances of staging a coup. Ditto for the oligarchs. The chance of pre-war Putin getting pushed out of office was probably like .01 percent. And now it's probably some meaningful number, like 15 percent or whatever. He may still be relatively safe, dunno, but he's less safe now.

All of this is happening as Russia's population shrinks and ages, creating myriad problems. Further, oil and natural gas may become less valuable in the years ahead as humanity shifts away from fossil fuels. Time lost now could impact Russia's long-term historical trajectory. Take that oil money and invest it wisely now and it could pay off for generations. Losing that income hurts not just in the short-term but also in regards to long term opportunity costs.

Ivan Gren Class Landing Ship: 13 Tanks, 40 IFV and 300 troops. Depending on the model this could have up to double lift capacity, so ~30 tanks, ~60-80 IFVs (troop count stays the same I believe)

Alligator Class Landing Ship: 300-425 troops, 20 tanks/40 ivfs/1000 tons 

I've seen claims for three Ropucha, two Alligator, and one Ivan Gren. I'd bet the alligators will be used mostly for supply because they're very old and probably cannot hold 20 modern main battle tanks. 

The Ropucha would be landing 30 tanks/40-50 IFVs and ~1000 troops between them. The Ivan Gren, assuming it's a newer model with more capacity for equipment, would add an additional 30 tanks snd 70 IFVs, with 300 extra troops, and the Alligator would most likely carry munitions and cargo. That's 1300 troops, 60 tanks, and about 100 IFVs.

2/8 If this term is the price for my human right to say what I consider necessary, and the civil right to fight for a better future for Russia, then they can ask for even 113 years. I will not retract my words or my actions.

These are back of the hand calculations, based upon reports on US Intel estimations of Russian losses.  Assumptions come from my, amatuer, reading of military history.  Originaly posted as a reply to an earlier comment:

So, combat effectivness of a unit is assumed to have dropped to zero if the given unit has lost 30 - 50% of personnel. The Russians have lost 6-8k killed, which means they've likely lost 18-24k wounded in action, for total casualties before POWs and dissertions of 24-32k. This is of an attack force of 190k.  
  
So, by total force calculations that's 13% to 17% losses.  
  
But, of those 190k, probably 100k-120k are resupply soldiers with front line fighting units only being 70k-90k. So if we reallocate those losses to the fighting units:  
  
70k - between 34% and 46%  
  
90k - between 27% and 36%  
  
If they deployed 90k armor and infantry line units then a signifigant portion of line units could be combat innefective.  
  
If they deployed 70k armor and infantry line units; then the Russian fighting force as a whole could be nearing combat innefective.

Saudi's in Yemen is just a major insult on an already fucked up situation. Remove Saudi Arabi from Yemen and Yemen is still in a civil war with two very fucked up sides.

> ""Russian warplanes are flying about 20 times more missions than their Ukrainian counterparts, **though many never enter Ukrainian territory and simply lob long-range missiles from inside Russian airspace**, a U.S. official said Friday. Russia's roughly 200 daily Ukraine-connected sorties..."" ([Source](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/03/russian-jets-flying-200-sorties-day-firing-its-own-airspace-pentagon-says/363088/)) 

First of all, we 'can't' enforce a Ukrainian NFZ over Russian airspace; Shooting down Russian aggressors over Russian airspace is a war between Name-a-NATO-member & Ukraine vs Russia.

The article also discusses Ukrainian MANPADs and SAMs which are contributing to Russian air losses; These two systems are both mobile and in large quantities, making their presence difficult for Russia to engage in Ukrainian airspace. Due to the high presence of SAMs in both armies, both sides are actually reducing their air forces' sorties in Ukraine. Can't blame anyone for that. I understand the call for more planes for the Ukrainian AF - the Russians outnumber the Ukraine AF, so more Migs reduces that advantage. I also get the call for Patriots - they're sexy and powerful; But, they're not trained on our Patriots, so we'd have to operate it. And, we don't want to risk supplying Migs directly (see Poland & US/Germany playing hot potato with them), but we don't want to deny Ukraine either. So what're we sending instead of Patriots and Migs? MANPATs, MANPADs, TB-2 Bayraktars, and I've heard talks about more S-300s and BUKs. Back to the Russian AF.

One way to avoid SAM coverage is to fly nap-of-earth (NOE), so very low, and very fast to reduce time in area (more time in area, more time to get shot down). Combat footage we've seen shows Russian aircraft that do venture into Ukrainian airspace are flying [exactly like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t0cclo/russian_plane_hostomel_ukraine/) [and this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tentpx/su25_sighted_over_donetsk/) to drop their ordinance and gtfo before retaliatory strikes are launched. Hips and Hinds, on the flip side, aren't as fast and we've seen a plethora of those being shot down by MANPADs ([Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t75awm/russian_mi35_was_shot_down_by_ukrainian_air/)). So what're we seeing? Russians that venture into Ukrainian airspace are wasting lots of gas flying hard & fast, and [they're still getting shot down (allegedly in this link, but probably legit given the Pentagon's estimates)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/terfpy/full_size_resolution_repost_ukrainian_9k37m1/). Makes sense that most Migs and Sukhois are staying in Russia for their launches.

And again, based on the initial article, it appears the Ukrainians are barely, if at all, using their own jets for air-to-ground (~10 sorties a day is minimal over that whole warzone). They've got Grads and Bayraktars for the ground war. And, there's lots of discussion about Ukrainian forces using those to attack Russian command & control and convoys.

So stop saying the NFZ is a good idea. -.-;,",1647379718.0,1647378831.0,t3_tf0ex9,t3_tf0ex9,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

[Apparently this is Tushaeyev](https://twitter.com/grimcultzero/status/1503836942785462286?s=21). He was reportedly [killed the second or third day of the war](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/03/1/7327224/index.amp). 

On Twitter, pro-Russian sources have been posting extremely vague videos of Chechens going over war plans, purportedly in an undisclosed location in Ukraine over a period of several days, with Tushayev briefly featured in some of them. I won’t link them here because these are pro-Russian trolls who are desperate for some copium. 

The funny thing is that none of the videos are really clear; really vague details and locations. There’s no indication of where they are or when the video was taken. 

But it is interesting that Tushayev is suddenly appearing in Chechnya after multiple reports or Kadryov being in Ukraine, or on a phone talking to some random person with the disclaimer that he was talking to Tushayev. And the picture of Tushayev doesn’t even look like him. 

Generally, I’d say the absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence, but with how dodgy the Kadryovites have been, I’m turning heel here. The absence of authenticity from Kadryovites is a fantastic indication that the Ukrainians actually liquidated his ass in Gostomel.",False,1647383887.0,t3_tf0ex9,t3_tf0ex9,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Putin's war on Ukraine will either be the catalyst that revives the spirit & credibility of NATO or the end of the global order. As the Korean War shaped NATO after its birth under Harry Truman's vision of containing Communism, this is democracy vs authoritarianism. 1/13  
   
Retreating from Putin to hide behind a piece of paper is too familiar to Ukrainians . The 1994 Budapest Memorandum promised Ukraine's territorial integrity in exchange for its nuclear arsenal. USA & UK rushed to deny it was a guarantee when Putin invaded in 2014. 2/13  
   
As with NATO today, lack of contractual obligation does not equal prohibition nor a lack of moral and strategic necessity. It's about political will and the choices of leaders. The refusal to defend Ukraine in 2014 led directly to Putin's escalation now. 3/13  
   
Yet they are eager to repeat the mistake, ignoring that every act of appeasement makes Putin's inevitable escalation more dangerous. This overconfidence affects not only Putin, but the generals who give orders and press even the biggest button. 4/13  
   
Instead of knowing that escalation will seal their own fate, they begin to believe there will be no retaliation because there hasn't been in the past. This is what I have warned against for so long. Impunity breeds carelessness, overconfidence, and catastrophe. 5/13  
   
As Truman and the other architects of the Cold War understood, credibility in deterrence means not having to use force. If your enemy believes you will not use force, you will be pressed until you do or until you are destroyed. There is no middle ground. 6/13  
   
Russia is not the only nation with a nuclear deterrent. If Putin & his generals are certain they will be annihilated if they use nuclear weapons, they will not. If they doubt the West will retaliate, the odds of Russian use in UKR & E Europe is higher. 7/13  
   
How will their calculations be influenced by allowing Ukraine to be destroyed or by defending it? Putin may be a madman, but his generals are not delusional. They know NATO could obliterate the Russian military. Its refusal to do so in Ukraine sends a message. 8/13  
   
Why are US/NATO ships not moving to the Baltic Sea? Why are significant forces not being sent to the UKR border? If you hadn't noticed, Putin doesn't need to be ""provoked"" to escalate or attack innocents. Weakness provokes. Strength prevents. 9/13  
   
Cities are being destroyed. Thousands killed, millions displaced. Waiting in the hope of making an agreement with the mass murderer in the Kremlin is repulsive. There is no real victory if Russia stays in Ukraine or if Putin stays in power, only next time. 10/13  
   
Ukraine is a sovereign nation, or is it only Putin who doesn't believe that? Any forces coming to Ukraine's aid will be there at the invitation of its legitimate leader. Conceding all of Ukraine to an invader without a fight is absurd. 11/13  
   
Declare safe zones and corridors for refugees and supplies. Invent whatever legal framework you want, knowing that Putin doesn't care about such things at all. If Putin is given free reign to obliterate Ukraine, what world are we fighting for? 12/13  
   
NATO nations, led by the United States, are being challenged to stand up for the values of human life & liberty while Ukraine bleeds. Those are Putin's real targets and destroying Ukraine is a means to that end. He must not succeed. Glory to Ukraine. 13/13",False,1647397821.0,t3_tf0ex9,t3_tf0ex9,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

**CNN Story**: Three US vets (combination of Iraq and Afghanistan) who went to Ukraine on their own to provide training to volunteers/regular Ukrainians. They're out of Ukraine now (pre-recorded to ensure their safety), but they weren't getting paid, they did it entirely on their own because they said they wanted to help and compared their efforts to what the French did for us during the Revolution.

Some of the weapons the Ukrainians are using are from a local gun collector; they're using whatever they can get.

From: The Pirates of Putin 

I am the very model of a Russian major General,
I’ve no information logistical or geographical,
I lost at least a thousand men in sunflower botanical
From Chernihiv to Mariupol, in order categorical;


I lead sloven wankers both conscripted and some voluntary,
Until recently we were living a life quite sedentary,
While oligarchs built super yachts with military corruption,   
Now Putin becomes swollen with indignant infuriation.

Chorus:

Now Putin becomes swollen with indignant infuriation.
Now Putin becomes swollen with indignant infuriation. Now Putin becomes swollen with indignant infuriate-furiation.


I’m very good at boasts about the virtues of a losing hand;  
I know the scientific name of an army overexpand;  
In short in matters logistical or geographical,   
I am the very model of a Russian major General.   

Chorus:

In short in matters logistical or geographical,
He is the very model of a Russian major General.

——

I appreciate the generosity of Bolshevism;
From leaky rusted warhead seals our weapons glow of tritium;
I bring peace through incompetent invasion pauper stratagem; 
Propellant in our missiles is distinctly not at maximum

I now address economists on concerns agricultural, 
There may not be a harvest the spring that is obtainable, 
Within our sewn on pockets we carry seeds horticultural, 
But first we must spread our rotten fertilizer ironical 

Chorus:

But first we must spread our rotten fertilizer ironical    
But first we must spread our rotten fertilizer ironical    
But first we must spread our rotten fertilizer iron-ironical 

Then I can call home prepaid on a cell phone SIM unencrypted;
And tell their wives how they met their untimely end unprotected;
In short in matters logistical or geographical,
I am the very model of a Russian major General.

Tucker is a ethno nationalist and wants America to remain white above all else. He would rather live in a authoritarian klepto state if it meant the population was and would remain European/white.

Putin is a threat to the post WW2 American global order and is of course a Christian conservative ruler himself. Putin wants a weaker and more divided America and Europe because he wants a stronger Russia.

Tucker wants an America that’s white before anything else and in order for America to stay white it must have a government and institutions that promote policies that help with that.

1. Russia is recruiting military forces from its allies to speed up the takeover; Ukraine doesn't have any allies to do this with.
2. European Union is buying Russian Oil and Gas in massive quantities even after 2014 first phase of Ukranian takeover; Russia can raise prices, use these funds to offset military and sanctions, etc.
3. Any supplies, weaponry, humanitarian aid, or volunteers can be bombed right at the border by Russia.
4. Russia, China and any other nuclear power can annex and reunify any nation that does not have nuclear weapon capability.

This sort of  gives some insight into that, though more about the US than Putin, from wikipedia:

At a November 2014 event marking 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gorbachev warned that the ongoing war in Donbas had brought the world to the brink of a new cold war, and he accused Western powers, particularly the U.S., of adopting an attitude of ""triumphalism"" towards Russia.\[502\]\[503\] In July 2016, Gorbachev criticized NATO for deploying more troops to Eastern Europe amid escalating tensions between the military alliance and Russia.\[504\] In June 2018, he welcomed the 2018 Russia–United States summit between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump,\[505\] although in October criticized Trump's threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, saying the move ""is not the work of a great mind."" He added: ""all agreements aimed at nuclear disarmament and the limitation of nuclear weapons must be preserved, for the sake of life on Earth.""\[506\]  
  
After the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Gorbachev declared: ""The storming of the capitol was clearly planned in advance, and it's obvious by whom."" He did not clarify to whom he was referring. Gorbachev also said that the attack ""called into question the future fate of the United States as a nation"".\[507\]  
  
In an interview with Russian news agency TASS on 20 January 2021, Gorbachev said that relations between the United States and Russia are of ""great concern"", and called on U.S. President Joe Biden to begin talks with the Kremlin in order to make the two countries' ""intentions and actions clearer"" and ""in order to normalize relations.""\[508\]  
  
On 24 December 2021, Gorbachev said that the United States ""grew arrogant and self-confident"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, resulting in ""a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion"". He also endorsed the upcoming security talks between the United States and Russia, saying ""I hope there will be a result""",False,1647382384.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0t27f7,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

The voyage of the Russian Baltic Fleet (Second Pacific Squadron) in the Russo-Japanese war is a tale of ridiculous blunder after blunder, a disaster from start to finish. The last ditch effort for Russian naval superiority in the Russo-Japanese war required a voyage never before taken by a coal-powered fleet. To help matters, the fleet was crewed by conscripted peasants who had little to no experience or education when it came to naval operation. Over the 18,000 mile journey, the fleet attacked civilian vessels from multiple global powers, shot at their own ships, killed fellow sailors with negligence of safety standards, destroyed city's communication grids, and so much more. This event will go down in history as one of Russia's most embarrassing military performances, but on the bright side, at least it gives you one fantastic hard-to-believe story to tell at your next dinner party!

But most in the interior are not the regular army level, but more the ""occupying army"" types you send in to hold already captured ground. The regular army that has received most of the resources lately are organized around mobile units which may or may not be fully manned and equipped at all times.

I listened to a us army research institute podcast and I believe it might have been one from Caspian report about the Russian army modernization, but I might have mistaken it for another YTube documentary. Anyway, I believe what it in essence boiled down to was that they have way fewer elite/veteran regular army units that are well equipped and that the bulk of what they had on the border when it all started was forces intending to occupy after the stormtroopers had blasted through.

Very similar to the small unit tactics the germans developed during ww2, and especially in the last years they had alot of these battles where highly motivated, crack units came in first, and the not so well equipped and motivated guys came behind.

On one hand Putin seems himself in a tier with Katherine the Great and Peter the Great, the great conquerors for the old Russian empire; he thinks it is his destiny to restore the former glory of the Russian empire and Ukraine kinda would be the crown jewel in that quest, given the historical meaning of it.

On the other hand i think Putin also has personal issues with Zelenskyy because he simply cant figure him out. Usually its easy for Putin to intimidate others - just look at western leaders, they all are terribly afraid of ww3 and nukes, so he just has to vaguely hint at those and he has them all afraid. But not Zelenskyy. Since Zelenskyy became president Putin has tried all sorts of threats but Zelenskyy wouldnt budge. On this note id like to propose the theory, that Putin originally didnt mean to invade Ukraine, he simply wanted to amass all those troops to threaten and intimidate Zelenskyy - when this didnt work he snapped and, surprsingly to his staff, gave the order to invade.

Zelenskyy is also a jew who lost family in the holocaust, so rhe nazi thing doesnt work with him. And Zelenskyy speaks russian and has been a star on russian TV anf many russians know him from TV, so the russian hating ukrainian nationalist angle also doesnt work on him.

Ukraine isn't a basket case, even despite the war... they apparently have a lot of natural gas reserves, in addition to agricultural exports (they provide a lot of grains to the Middle East and Europe, also cooking oils, etc.).

However, I would imagine that the Americans and probably the Germans are very much not on board with that, and would use all their diplomatic pressure to avoid this scenario.

Lastly, there would need to be a form of NATO agreement *upfront* that Poland could not invoke article 5 after they joined the war. This would take time and there would also be a high risk of information leakage about this.

So yeah, let's give Russia something to think about. It's not just Putin there. It's a nation of 140 million people, none of the happy to die. Clearly NATO, between the US, France and the UK is incredibly US and western European heavy, so Poland and the Baltics clamoring for war isn't going to significantly change anything. But it at least tells Russia that they are on thin ice, one or two major events removed from other NATO countries changing their opinion, perhaps fueled by popular opinion. 

I think especially in the light of Russia's, apparently increasingly less favourable situation in Ukraine, it acts as a deterrent to further escalation.

A lot of it comes down to the people. The people in Afghanistan did not particularly like the Taliban - so there was much less resistance from the everyday citizens (though still a significant amount by any measure). The installed regeme collapsed for the same reason. If you cannot convince the people to support your government they wont care if who is in charge changes, and won't resist all that much to prevent regime change.

There is also a big dose of Russia being far less prepared for a conflict of this size and nature than the Us+allies were. They expected Ukraine to fold, and when it did not their plans fell apart. Now they are trying to reorient their strategy, but their military organization and general tactics don't work well for the kind of fighting they would have to do to win - namely withdraw to the east, and take small steps, focusing on building strong supply lines that can sustain a force needed to overwhelm resistance.

In reality, there is no way they have 1500 launch ready warheads that would actually land, so lets say \`1000\~ tops with the same math (but the reality is probably far less when you factor in the ability for the USA to knock out launch sites and Russia's inability to do that at all).

The USA has the same or more warheads, plus France/UK, all aimed at 1 county. The math is pretty straight forward here.

The estimates for full nuclear war between Nato/Russia (done by Princeton, google it) have 9% of the NATO population dying in the immediate exchange and 65% of Russia, and that was before we saw the state of Russia's military.

Putin is not insane, he wants to be the man who creates an empire, not the man who causes Russia to not exist.

It is not. There is a natural dynamic of escalation and risk-taking.

I’m not saying it’s guaranteed but the folks who know putin believe otherwise.

> GESSEN: So this analyst is Grigory Yudin, who I think is very insightful. And I think that he is attentive, right? Good analysts are - they largely earned their stripes by just really paying close attention to what is being said and done. And Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons for a long, long time. This is another strain of thought and action that we have observed over the years. Russia has changed its military doctrine to make it easier to use nuclear weapons. And this happened many years ago. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world, and in particular the United States, that Russia is a nuclear power.

>And, you know, I don't know that I agree with Yudin that the first target would be the United States and, in particular, New York City. I think that Putin is much more likely and has given indications on this and also seeing indications of this in the way that the Russian state television narrative is working - I think it's much more likely that they would use a tactical nuclear weapon to target, say, a military airport in Poland.


>GROSS: In Poland?


>GESSEN: In Poland - well, yeah. So the reason - Poland is a country that borders both Russia and Ukraine. It's just to the west of Ukraine. And military aid to Ukraine that is coming from Western countries is coming through military airports in Poland. Poland also used to be a part of the Soviet military bloc. In fact, the Soviet equivalent of NATO - the Soviet-dominated equivalent of NATO used to be called the Warsaw bloc. So the use of Polish military airports to supply arms to Ukraine is almost a personal affront to Putin, who views himself as an agent of restoration, who wants to bring back the former glory that Russia had in a bipolar world. And so the fact that they're using not just a former Warsaw Pact country's airports, but Poland's - right? - the country where the capital is Warsaw, is like adding insult to injury. And so there has been a lot of nuclear saber-rattling in that general direction - or actually in that specific direction.

>	Over half of the world’s Neo-Nazi members are in Russia.  This movement is behind the abuse of gays and violation of gay rights.  The group also opposes foreigners, Jews, Muslims, Roma, and Asians. The group has recently become a paramilitary organization, although they claim to be a sports club.  The Neo-Nazis are training members in weapons as well as hand-to-hand combat.  Many of the weapons used are outlawed, and therefore bought from the black market.  They are strictly anti-drug or alcohol, focusing on fitness and bodybuilding to train for their “revolution.” There are an estimated 50,000-70,000 Neo-Nazis in Russia according to an ABC News report.”

This would require a massive team of analysts trying to analyse every possible geopolitical event and the ways to spin it in a way that would benefit Russia, as heavily hinted to by the previous letters.

Just look for example at the 2016 presidential election, when the Democrats tried to use Bernie Sanders as a stalking horse candidate[1] to generate youth interest for the upcoming election, only to underestimate his popularity and be forced to rig the primaries so that the establishment candidate could win[2]. Russia then went on to exploit the resulting division in the Democratic Party to ensure that their candidate would win - not withstanding the fact that their candidate was better funded, Hillary had her share of scandals and gaffes that Russia could latch on and amplify. But as much as Russia played a role in amplifying these issues, they were not Russia's doing per se, but rather a reflection of the multiple failings within the DNC that they still don't seem to fully appreciate even to this day.

That's significantly different than getting the spin from the news channels where they all say the same thing on every channel. That's still happening, you can see it in this thread when CNN will send a breaking alert to their app and all the people will come in here and ask about it. It happened with the 20 mile convoy and the NFZ and the convoy again (40 miles then) and the NFZ again and the convoy again (all split up and hiding in the woods) and the NFZ again and it will continue to happen as the media drives the discussion.

* cctv, a scene (posted earlier today) near a building in which a missile impacts in the distance in front of a building. on the ground, to the right, the bright reflection of a window can be seen to pulse twice showing multiple shockwaves propagating. people and cars scramble.
* cctv, a scene inside that building, where people are packed into a foyer like sardines outside of a service window (like for a bank, or a train station ticket office). the explosion washes over the foyer
* cctv, a scene in front of the building where no apparent destruction occurs, and yet the people standing out in front of the foyer suddenly fall to the ground with blood emanating/squirting somewhere out of them (overpressure waves?)

* handheld camera, walking up the fragmented remains of a human, exploded like a grapefruit. legs intact but otherwise shredded. no head apparent. a woman wails in the background.
* handheld camera, the same woman in shot crying over a deceased person while someone attempts to console her. cameraman pans to an older man (beret) who is beginning to have a breakdown next to two apparently dead bodies.
* handheld camera, a different scene inside of a bus. english speaker. walking onto the city buss, he sees 4 or 5 dead bodies, mostly intact, some blood, but not fragmented like the 1st body. he says ""oh shit oh my god""
* in-car camera, police approach the scene
* handheld camera, in front of the building entrance, two people (say, albert and betty) are on the ground, one of them has a tourniquet on what is left of each leg, mostly missing from the thigh down. blood pours seeps into the street.
* handheld camera, a walk-around of a vehicle with a couple, both deceased, bodies slumped over one another. No obvious wounds or carnage, maybe overpressure again windshield and back windows intact, but front windows are not
* handheld camera, people discussing the scene in front of the building which, given the ATM out front, is probably a bank. several dead bodies lay around. someone walks out of the bank. the older man (beret) is walking around wailing in shock and grief. a soldier walks out of the bank and tries to comfort the other person of the couple (albert and betty)
* new handheld camera, walking to same scene. this person filming also films himself. someone with a medical bag can be seen tending to the more intact leg of the first of (albert and betty) couple. the person films themselves. he asks the people standing around questions. **it can be seen** that albert and betty are holding hands, sitting there dying in the street.
* handheld camera, a fire on a truck, another fire on a car. firefighters work.
* handheld camera, the car with the two elderly deceased in the car. blood can be seen seeping down from their head

* handheld camera, interior of a building perhaps adjacent to the bank. a man covered in blood and debris, mostly intact but with debris and shrapnel sticking out of him, is on the ground
* handheld camera, firefighters in a cramped space pick up that man with a medical transport cloth thing, he is in severe pain. they lift him outside the building, and put him on a stretcher. the cameraman looks in closely at his legs and can see all kinds of debris sticking in and out of him. he is loaded into an ambulance.
* handheld camera, albert and betty are in close up. it's apparent that both albert and betty are missing all or part of both of their legs. they are holding one hand. they are lying down dying, unable to see each other because of gutter/flashing debris which has landed on the ground between them. the woman says something (reportedly, below, **please let us die in peace**)
* handheld camera, to the right, the man with the beret wails over a deceased person on the ground next to another older injured person who is struggling to move. **the man with the beret pushes on the person clinging to live who is rolling around on top of and obscuring the deceased person**. the old beret man lifts the head of the deceased person so that the injured person is not sitting on their head. the injured person is too disoriented to realize what is happening.
* handheld camera, walking inside the foyer. an uninjured woman leaves the bank. two deceased persons inside the very small foyer.
* handheld camera, another view of the exploded/gibbed 1st corpse up close. the man's right foot is laying disconnected next to his left hand. all flesh is white and ashen.
* handheld camera, a man is seen distressed at the corpse, looking into the camera.

* handheld camera, a nearby bridal shop. a body is on the ground, unclear.
* handheld camera, a woman who does not appear to have horrible injuries being treated in the back of an ambulance

 >Minesweeping is the practice of the removal of explosive naval mines, usually by a specially designed ship called a minesweeper using various measures to either capture or detonate the mines, but sometimes also with an aircraft made for that purpose. Minesweeping has been practiced since the advent of naval mining in 1855 in the Crimean War. The first minesweepers date to that war and consisted of British rowboats trailing grapnels to snag the mines.

The system of Odessa Catacombs consists of a network of basements, bunkers, drainage tunnels and storm drains as well as natural caves. The Catacombs are on three levels and reach a depth of 60 metres (200 ft) below sea level. It is one of the world's largest urban labyrinths, running up to 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi).

Faced with the ever looming prospect of death, they bond over shared experiences, like fighting the Ender Dragon, or the first time they saw the Flood. Finally, one fateful morning the sirens sound, they rush to their position only to find it destroyed from an enemy rocket. Ordered to split up, they each join a team of forgettable and poorly introduced sidekicks for the events that follow. 

Ultimately the film will culminate in one of two ways, either Finn and his merry band of thieves come riding in to save Caleb and his gang by pushing the last of the Russian forces back into the bay, or it’ll be when Caleb, stunned and disoriented by the massive Russian bombing campaign (that is somehow coincidentally occurring while infantry is on site - lmao what IS IFF, right?), stumbles down a stairway and lands on Finn’s lifeless body. Cursing the Russians in anger, he vows to survive this day, and live on to fight in Finn’s memory.

>A leaked 12-page war memo, titled ""For Media and Commentators,"" told Russian media that it is ""essential"" to use more Carlson segments in their coverage because of his positions on the war in Ukraine, Mother Jones reported.  
  
Carlson ""sharply criticizes"" the actions of the United States and NATO and their ""negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine,"" the memo said, per the media outlet.  
  
He is also critical of the ""defiantly provocative behavior from the leadership of the Western countries and NATO towards the Russian Federation and towards President Putin, personally,"" the memo continued.

And IF these, plural, were used in Ukraine, it would be because of direct NATO involvement/BOTG. This would be BAD, not just because of the damage caused, but because NATO now HAS to respond, this CAN’T and wouldn’t be ignored. And by respond I mean a stronger response than just forcibly removing Russia from Ukraine, if they had entered Ukraine that would have already been the goal prior to any Russian escalations.

Also tactical nukes used in Ukraine does not automatically mean strategic nukes around the globe are now headed towards Russia, and vice versa. You just end up in this scenario, I.E. likely global conflict where Russia reacted to NATO’s “escalation” (BOTG in Ukraine), NATO must respond to Russia’s escalation (tactical nukes in Ukraine), and so on and so forth, until what’s left? At the very least no one here knows or for sure can say what the end result would be, but it almost certainly ends up deadly. 

This isn’t really that hard go understand, it’s just that I guess people aren’t interested in rational thought. NATO involvement almost certainly at the very least means MORE death. In that regard these people on Reddit are asking for more death to stop…. death’s from occurring, and NVM the worse case scenarios.",False,1647403886.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0udaoh,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Particularly when OP notes a belief that might be widely held, that if things continue as they are, Russian power is sure to suffer, and the end of Russia is not out of the question.

A question I have is that if he launches a nuke aimed at Ukraine, is there a clause that mandates a nuclear counterstrike? He's invaded Ukraine without direct confrontation because Ukraine isn't in NATO. He may feel he can get away with nuking a city or two in Ukraine.

 >Salami slicing tactics, also known as salami slicing, salami tactics, the salami-slice strategy, or salami attacks, is a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition. With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated ""slice by slice"" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the ""sliced"" sides to protest.

68c76ed831d51fbec9e697492e13c7d4,tf0ex9,i0t6z6m,"For anyone wondering why people think this person is being disingenuous: 

From a pro-NATO POV: NATO is a defensive alliance. Article 5 says that if any NATO member is attacked, all NATO members will come to their defense. If all countries bordering Russia are NATO countries, then if Russian leadership wanted to expand into one of those countries, then they would be required to start WWIII by getting NATO involved. Ukraine got targeted because it does not have an alliance behind it. If all countries around Russia had an alliance protecting it, the threat of a world war would deter Russia from attempting to invade its neighbors, and would prevent other countries from being attacked like Ukraine is right now.  

OP’s comment implies that one or more of these steps of logic is inaccurate. Recently, the most common disagreement is a flat out “NATO is bad” which comes from Russia’s inaccurate accusation that NATO is being aggressive and trying to take over Europe.

Another part of this that is recently commonly refuted is the last part - their claim is that NATO backing wouldn’t stop Russia from invading, and would actually bring the entire world into a prolonged world war. This is, again, derived from Russian propaganda, this time that NATO is weak and Russia is strong and militarily powerful. 

If OP can give an argument that isn’t one of these two, I’ll gladly listen. But for these two arguments, we have refutation. 

For the first one: NATO has been very conservative with accepting countries into the alliance, and even with direct pleas for help from Ukraine, NATO is being aggressively uninvolved - individual NATO-associated countries are providing equipment and training, but NATO is not participating in this war. 

For the second, we have already seen that Russia *is not* attacking NATO countries. If NATO was not a deterrent, then Ukraine wouldn’t be their only target. On top of that, despite Putin’s posturing about countries “escalating” and their assistance to Ukraine being “acts of war”, he still isn’t attacking outside of Ukraine, despite claiming that he’s being provoked. 

Basically - the implication of OPs comment is that NATO shouldn’t expand. When an alliance accepts enthusiastic, capable allies with common goals, everyone in the alliance becomes safer. Preventing NATO from accepting willing, trustworthy allies only benefits Russia, the aggressor relying on NATO’s lack of involvement to be able to invade.",False,1647383705.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0syhkg,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The FGM-148 Javelin (AAWS-M) is an American-made portable anti-tank missile fielded since 1996 to replace the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile in US service. Its fire-and-forget design uses automatic infrared guidance that allows the user to seek cover immediately after launch, as opposed to wire-guided systems, like the Dragon, which require the user to guide the weapon throughout the engagement. The Javelin's HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks by hitting them from above, where their armor is thinnest (see top attack), and is also useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight.

The comments on the first review are not kind to the reviewer. They pretty much point out how pointless the review is.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment\_Switchblade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment_Switchblade)

In October 2020, AeroVironment unveiled the Switchblade 600 loitering munition. The larger system weighs 50 lb (23 kg) but is still man-portable and can be set up in 10 minutes. It is designed to fly out to 40 km (25 mi) in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes (giving it an 80 km (50 mi) total range) and attack at a 115 mph (185 km/h) dash speed, carrying an anti-armor warhead designed to neutralize armored vehicles. A touchscreen tablet-based fire control system can manually or autonomously control the munition, and it is secured through onboard encrypted data links and Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module GPS with a patented wave-off capability. The Switchblade 600 was developed to meet requirements in an Army development program called Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile. By the time of its unveiling it had undergone 60 test flights from ground launches against fixed and moving targets. Other methods could include a six-pack vehicle-mounted version and by air-launch.\[19\]\[22\]\[23\]  
  
On 31 March 2021, AeroVironment was awarded a USD26.1 million contract by SOCOM for the Switchblade 600. The system addresses the United States Naval Special Warfare Command's Maritime Precision Engagement (MPE) requirement to engage asymmetric threats with Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) and Heavy (CCH) boats acting as host platforms.\[24\]\[25\]",False,1647396401.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0tzxm0,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

 >""Show Me the Way to Go Home"" is a popular song written in 1925 by the English songwriting team Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly, using the pseudonym ""Irving King"". The song is said to have been written on a train journey from London by Campbell and Connelly. They were tired from the traveling and had a few alcoholic drinks during the journey, hence the lyrics. The song is in common use in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and North America.

If Russia fired missiles into a NATO country intentionally, there would a kinetic response.  This is especially true if anyone was hurt or any military equipment was damaged.  The minimum response would be an attack on the source of the missiles.  If that was a mobile launcher in Ukraine, then I would expect attacks on every such launcher close enough to hit a NATO country or at least enough to equal or surpass the lives lost.

If the missiles came from a base in Russia, I think NATO would absolutely hit that base.  They would likely tell Russia shortly before launch that the missiles were inbound and were non-nuclear.  But I think Russia would intuit that anyway given the circumstances.  If the missiles came from a city or other target that might make Russia question whether the response was conventional, then I would imagine that NATO would choose some unrelated target to prove the point.

The Tl;Dr is that it's far less likly for your card to be stolen because of something on your computer, and far more likely for it to be stolen either 'in transit' or from data the company you have it too keep. Using good internet safety will help keep risk to a minimum, but not eliminate it - so make sure you know your banks fraud policies and keep a close eye on accounts you use online.

Well known business and using a major imprint credit card? Yea - the business is not likely to misuse your info (outside of what can be corrected by customer service anyway) is likely not to keep enough PII around for the info they keep to be useful to a hacker, and your credit card very likely has a 'you are not responsible for fraudulent charges' clause.

Shady business with your bank card? Don't do it even with antivirus.

If you want to maximize safety, set up one of the popular intermediate services (Google pay is one, and the one I use, but there are tons out there that are reputable. Do your research first and don't take my word for what is best) and shop with that. That makes the actual card information invisible to the end business and limits your exposure to just whoever you use for holding the card info, who probably has pretty good security, so you might have a few breaches a decade instead of a few a year.

There will be some things that you can't do that with (my local utility company for example accepts only eft direct from my bank account if I want to pay online) and for those you just have to be careful, keep a close eye on the account, and ensure that the company you are working with treat your data with the security it is due",False,1647383326.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0t4doj,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

In brief, the Tsar wanted to send more ships to the pacific to help where he was getting his ass kicked. The only ships available were in the Baltic, and they sucked.

So a shitty short range inexperienced artic fleet was ordered to sail 18,000 miles through the tropics.

In the first few minutes of setting steam the flagship ran aground, a destroyer lost its anchor, and another ship was rammed by a 4th ship, which had to return to port for repairs. In the first few minutes.

They shot at their own messenger boat. 

Almost started a war with Brittain when they attacked a fishing fleet on accident.

Attacked their own cruisers and killed a priest.

Attack the empty ocean for 20 minutes in a panic (this ship I swear to god)

Had a ship get lost and shoot at a German, French, and Danish fishing boat and announce its victory over Japanese ships when it came back. (This fucking ship..same fucking one...)

Cut an undersea telegraph line

Give their crew coaldust poisoning.

Have the officers decide moral was so bad that they needed pets! Like lemurs, cobras, pythons, and crocodiles. Yes. Onboard a ship.

Got malaria, typhoid fever, and the majority of STDs known to humanity.

During a funeral at sea accidentally used a live round for the gun salute, which hit the same cruiser that had been accidentally shot up before (this SAME FUCKING SHIP. At this point the Admiral renamed it ""the slut"" and wouldn't call it anything else)

Have their refrigerator ship break, and dump the meat overboard. So know they have a poisonous zoo on board, and are being followed by sharks.

During roll call check in, one ship (take a guess....) instead of saying ""present"" instead says ""torpedo boats"" and puts the fleet into a panic. 

During at sea gun drills zero ships in the fleet manage to hit their target. One ship does manage to hit the cruiser towing the target though. Oops.

Then they get to Japan and are promptly blown the fuck up in one of the most one sided battles of all time.

Edit. Yes this https://youtu.be/9Mdi_Fh9_Ag 45 mins long and doesn't even get to the destruction of the fleet, which is in part two.

This is the same principle with Taiwan. If China attacked Taiwan and the US responded with military force, it would probably result in nuclear conflict. But we accept this risk, even though we have no formal commitments with Taiwan. 

In my view, there are some weapons so horrible that they cannot be tolerated in modern war. This includes nuclear weapons and chemical weapons. If these weapons are used, there has to be a response. That’s why I was a big proponent of the strikes against Assad when he used chemical weapons in Ghouta. Because when one country uses these types of weapons, it normalizes their use. If Russia were to use these weapons in Ukraine, I would consider that a red line that was crossed. And I would be in favor of a military response, knowing full well what the consequences may be.

&#x200B;

Thus – despite journalists who apparently do not know their   
deterrence theory very well continue to insist on talking about it – the  
 chances of something like a ‘no fly zone’ are effectively zero.  Enforcing  
 a no fly zone would require engaging Russian air targets and also   
suppressing Russian air defenses (by bombing them), including targets in  
 Russia; the escalation risk is wildly too high.  
Related concerns make using US air bases to transfer aircraft to the   
Ukraine difficult as well, as that draws dangerously close to NATO   
engaging in direct belligerent action (basing Ukrainian planes on their   
sovereign territory).  There is a lot of frustration in some quarters   
that NATO and the United States won’t take more direct action, but again  
 when you are gambling with the lives of hundreds of millions if not   
billions of people, you do not take risky bets.6  
  Of course part of the limitation here is that because the conflict is   
happening on NATO’s doorstep, any escalation risks triggering Article   
5’s mutual defense provisions; consequently the non-nuclear NATO powers   
cannot really act independently of the effects to nuclear deterrence of   
the nuclear NATO powers (USA, France, Britain).  
As a result, the nature of deterrence puts both hard limits (no   
direct intervention) and soft limits (avoid escalatory scenarios) on the  
 ability of NATO to intervene to stop Putin’s War in Ukraine.  NATO’s   
response has been to utilize indirect intervention methods that has been  
 well established by previous usage (usage which might now be seen as   
decades of exterior maneuvers preparing for this moment) do not cross   
nuclear red lines: supplying arms (mostly small arms and light weapons)   
and economic sanctions, but doing so on a frankly extreme scale.    
There’s a clear logic to that strategy: safer to do a very low risk   
thing a lot than to do a very high risk thing a little.  This is especially true in the midst of a ‘hot’ war where fear and confusion are high, increasing the odds of a miscalculation or error.  
It is worth noting here though how Ukrainian interests here diverge from NATO interests.  Ukraine is already in an effectively total war (from their perspective; Russia is not totally mobilized) with Russia.  Russian forces are already  
 targeting Ukrainian civilian centers with the apparent aim of   
inflicting civilian casualties and making the refugee situation worse.    
The Ukrainian state already faces the potential threat of   
extinction.  As a result, Ukraine has very little to lose if the war   
escalates further (especially since from the Ukrainian perspective,   
nearly all of the escalatory potential is on NATO’s side; note this is not true  
 from NATO’s perspective) and so it may be in Ukrainian interests to   
push for high-risk NATO strategies that it is in turn not in NATO’s   
interest – or the world’s interest – for NATO to adopt.  
At the same time all of this means that observers, especially in NATO  
 countries, need to calibrate their expectations for what the United   
States, NATO and the global community can do here, because the limits   
deterrence sets are real, if ambiguous (that is, we cannot know exactly   
where Putin’s nuclear red line is, but it does exist and   
crossing it would have disastrous consequences).  Those limits are not   
arbitrary: they exist for very real reasons and while I do not always   
agree with the assessments of those limits made by the folks in charge,   
in the end, I’d rather they err on the side of caution",False,1647388282.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0thij0,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

>Russia, China and right-wing American media have been spreading false stories about U.S.-backed bioweapon labs in Ukraine. 

>""We confirm facts, unearthed as part of the special military operations, which testify to an emergency attempt to erase evidence of military biological programs,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said March 9.

>China’s Foreign Ministry tweeted March 8, ""The US has 336 labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone. It should give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification.""

>Fox News’ Tucker Carlson joined in March 9, saying, ""We never imagined Ukraine would have biological weapons.""

>But as Carlson described it, his eyes were opened when Victoria Nuland, U.S. undersecretary of state, had this exchange with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

>""Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?"" Rubio asked.

>""Ukraine has biological research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of,"" Nuland said. ""So, we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach."" 

>For Carlson, this was proof positive that Ukraine has ""secret labs,"" and that what Russia has said is, ""in fact, totally and completely true.""

>Let us be clear: There is no evidence of Ukrainian bioweapon labs. The Russian talking point is not, as Carlson said, ""totally and completely true.""",1647402483.0,1647402124.0,t3_tf0ex9,t1_i0uay70,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
