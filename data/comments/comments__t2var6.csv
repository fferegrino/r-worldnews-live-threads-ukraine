To set the comparison.  The Ruble was 85ish for every dollar on Friday.  Over 200% inflation over a weekend... I think it will be more like 300 or 400% based on the sanctions and liquidity issues that it created.  Just seeing a 4% increase in lending was incredible.

If it's true that they got 50000 calls, then there is a very significant portion of the population actively asking questions right now - these sorts of rumors and underground stories can spread like wildfire in a worried population. People that were not originally interested in token opposition news (i.e. kept around for a pretense at a free press) may come to actively seek these out, especially when hearing they're getting clamped down on. They can spot a few images here and there, see a Russian tank in a Kyiv street, and at this point they would ask why this is the case if ""only Ukrainians are fighting each other"" or ""Kyiv is peaceful"" or ""this is just peacekeeping"" (per the Russian propaganda).

And at that point, a real snowball effect may occur. Even brainwashed citizens do not want their children dying in a meaningless war, especially if they see that the images presented by the Russian propagandists (e.g. peaceful Kyiv) have nothing to do with what's going on, and they've been lied to all along.

Around 1,000 gathered for a spontaneous anti-war rally near Great Gostiny Dvor in Saint Petersburg. According to OVD-Info, by early Sunday evening police had detained at least 900 Russians in 44 cities, bringing the total number of arrests to over 4,000 since the war began. By a little later in the evening, that number had grown to around 1,800 arrests, including over 900 arrests in Moscow and 500 in Saint Petersburg.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the two straits that connect the Black Sea, which sits on Ukraine’s southern coast, to the Mediterranean.

The convention guarantees the free passage of vessels belonging to Black Sea countries - like Russia - in peacetime, but allows Turkey to close the straits to all foreign warships in a time of war or if Turkey itself is threatened.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said earlier: “We have decided that the situation in Ukraine has turned into a war. We will be transparently applying the provisions of Montreaux.”

\- Corruption from top to bottom and nobody dares tell Putin how bad it is because Putin would then look for scapegoats. 

\- The various units are not coordinating properly, either because their leaders want to be the ones to score a win to earn Putin's favour, or because simply their central command is not good enough

\- Not understanding how the modern information/propaganda war works - they only know how to do it to gullible Russians who don't speak any other language and are not much online, thus relying on state media. Old dog, new tricks, no for Russia.

\- Their soldiers do not see Ukraine as an enemy. The public was supporting the DNR/LNR thinking they protect ethnic Russians from militias. Shelling Kyiv and killing Ukrainian citizens isn't populat in Russia. Only the Chechen gangsters are enthusiastic about this war.

\- They have deployed conscripts (illegal by Russian law to do abroad) and have not informed anyone within Russia (their parents included) that they have. Ukraine caught prisoners, allowed them to call their parents and they were shocked to hear their kids are in Ukraine. Russia also geo-blocked the website Ukraine set up with the names of the captured and dead Russian soldiers - the aim was to find a way for the families to get the bodies of the dead.

\- Logistics and supply chain are a mess because even if elements within Russia suspected that Ukraine wouldn't be a piece of cake, nobody dares to tell Putin something  that he didn't want to hear.",False,1645993499.0,t3_t2var6,t3_t2var6,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

Which probably could have happened eventually, but he fails to acknowledge that when Crimea happened, the world was watching and it made us all very aware of who Putin was, so we never stopped watching. And instead of laying low and playing the sneaky game all these years, he kept attacking the world’s elections constantly, even going so far as to try and fill America with Russian assets. VERY publicly mind you, he wasn’t hiding it. So now he is trying his hand again, but the world was already ready for him to jump, we’ve been expecting it for years now, and the world is sick of his shit.

Russia will suffer shocking casualties if they decide to put boots inside of Kyiv city limits. Urban warfare against a motivated enemy is nearly suicide. 

Imagine this, you are a Russian soldier. Your squad is moving at a snails pace, maybe about a mile every few hours. You have to stop and clear roadblocks so your vehicles can continue down the road every 10-15 minutes. Every time you go to clear a roadblock you are ambushed from both sides of the road. So many vehicles become unusable that the ones behind you must leave and find another direction to come from. Now you are walking through the streets of Kyiv with no vehicular support. Your friends are holes blown through their chest every once in a while from sniper fire. You don't know where any enemies are, you only see hiding places around you. The sounds of Crying babies and Ukrainian propaganda telling you to lay down your arms and reject Putin are being played over loudspeakers with no pause, repeating.

This seems like the ""Major"" push.  All vectors and cities are being advanced on and Putin can't afford another day with the Russian economy about to collapse in 11ish hours.

([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/how-russian-sanctions-work/622940/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/how-russian-sanctions-work/622940/))

In my very unqualified opinion this is the stand for Ukraine.  If they can hold their positions through the night, they have a really good chance overall.  The Russian economy will be the proverbial 2nd front that Russia/Putin can't handle and a forced peace will be made.  If Putin can take the cities, but mostly importantly the capital (Kiev) AND kill/capture Z and the other officials he will plunge Ukraine into the darkness with Russia.  There will be a power struggle/vacuum in that situation.  I suspect a Civil war would ensue.

To be clear, I think Russia in it's current state is finished regardless.  The Russian's dying right now are truly dying for nothing if they were ever dying for something before.  Now they die to only satisfy the vanity of Putin to take someone with him.

Glory to Ukraine.  I've never loved another country so much as I love you guys.  I'm sorry we, the world, didn't do more before, but if you glorious people hold strong, you will come out of this stronger and more powerful than ever.

Informative thread explaining what Russia means by “special mode” of the nuclear deterrence:

> What is this ""special mode of combat duty of the deterrence forces""? Hard to tell with certainty, but most likely it means that the nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command

 > As I understand the way the system works, in peacetime it cannot physically transmit a launch order, as if the circuits were ""disconnected"". However, if the early-warning system detects an attack or if Russia believes it entered a ""threatening period"" ...

> ... the national command authority can bring the system into a working condition, connecting the wires, so if a launch order can go through if issued. There is also a protocol that protects the system from decapitation

> Once the preliminary command is issued, the system can act even if the president is taken out or cannot be reached. In this case the system, however, can only act if it detects actual nuclear detonations on the Russian territory

> It is possible that in some cases the preliminary command could also trigger visible actions, such as submarines leaving ports or weapons loaded on bombers (and bomber dispersals). But it doesn't have to - everything could stay on the level of circuits

> In brief, once the forces are brought to this point, they are less vulnerable to a first strike, whether a decapitating or disarming one. It is not something that suggests that Russia is preparing itself to strike first, though

> In my view, a first strike has never been an option https://russianforces.org/blog/2019/04/does_russia_have_a_launch-on-w.shtml and it's not an option today. But technically it makes a first strike or launch on warning possible on a rather short notice

> An interesting question is whether this has ever been done before. Not to my knowledge, although I cannot rule out the early days, 70s and the early 80s.

Previously, you had to do an international account-to-account bank transfer that was less familiar to most people. Now it's basically the same as any other online donation.

Not every element of the page gets auto-translated, so:

* **Сума** = total amount (to donate)
* **Збір коштів на потреби армії України** = Fundraising for the needs of the Army of Ukraine (basically the transaction memo)
* **Номер картки** = card number
* **Термін дії** = expiration date
* **Натискаючи на кнопку «Сплатити», Ви приймаєте Угоду користувача** = By clicking on the ""Pay"" button, you accept the User Agreement

Be sure to **select the right currency** from the dropdown box. By default it's set to the Ukrainian currency. Most people will probably want USD (US Dollars) or EUR (Euros).

You also have the option to donate in Rubles, but I don't think that's worth much nowadays.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

addition: men 18-60 are no longer allowed to leave

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

Dear Senator/Representative NAME,  
  
Hello, I’m YOUR\_NAME, one of your new constituents in YOUR\_TOWN.  
  
As I am sure you are aware, the Ukrainians are currently making a historic and valiant stand against an insane and despotic leader. I am shocked and appalled at how Russia is blatantly attacking an innocent and harmless neighbor. Make no mistake, history has shown that stopping dictators will only get harder, not easier. If they fail, Russia will be emboldened and they will surely move on to attack and threaten other allies in Europe.  
  
The Ukraine issue is extremely important to me. The Ukrainians are a good people, and they deserve a better leader than Putin. I urge you, in the name of human rights and democracy, to help them as much and in every way humanly possible. In particular, a bill is coming up to provide more aid to the fighters, I strong encourage you to vote in favor. This is not their fight, it is our fight.  
  
Please, I hope I can trust you to do what is right.

I'm sorry, but this talking point is bullshit. These people seem to believe that you can always take the highroad. While Russia and China increase their defense budgets, that Europe needs to continue to invest in social welfare. What these people need to understand is: 

1. Your belief in a kumbaya world isn't reality. There are real bad actors out there. Just because you give them an olive branch, doesn't mean they'll reciprocate. In fact, they usually don't. They'll take the olive branch and undermine you anyways. There are real bad actors in the world. Respect them for what they are. 

2. Frankly, the reason that Europe has been able to develop a robust social welfare state has been because it's defense has been largely provided by an American security umbrella. The real people who have suffered in all this has been the American public who have had to bankroll this through their own defense spending. I fucking hate Trump, but one thing he was right about was Europe needs to pick up it's share. Thankfully, after this, it seems the Europeans finally understand this. Sure, there will be some sacrifice, but if you're not willing to do it for your own security, no one else will or in the case of the United States, should have to.

> Russian Studies Director at CNA(D.C. area think tank): That's right, the Russian goal appears to have been to race to Kyiv - elsewhere seizing key junctions and going around major cities. Much of the fighting had been on the outskirts. They dramatically overextended the small numbers of units that were sent in to achieve this.

-Dwight D. Eisenhower

I know Reddit is right now on a pro war path and I’ll get downvoted like hell, but everybody should remember this quote. Everybody should know that every dollar you spend on weapons is a dollar that could have gone to feeding your hungry, housing your homeless, or educating your children. Arms spending is necessary, but one should never forget the opportunity costs it takes. For every piece of armament your country buys is another one of your fellow country members that you continue to condemn to poverty.

So when Olaf Scholz (a social democrat for Christs sake) announces his massive increase for defense spending don’t just look at it as more weapons made and bought, it’s also euros that could have gone to social welfare, to helping the most vulnerable. When Biden or Boris promises massive amounts of military aid to Ukraine remember that it’s not just weapons we’re sending to Ukraine it’s also spending money that could have gone to the NHS or Medicaid.

We need to be doing air-drops.
We know that there are multiple planes who have transponders off as they don't want to be seen.

Surely we can get somebody to airdrop supplies. Yes there's a risk of being shot down, but it's worth the risk to deliver so many weapons at once. Otherwise it will take days and days for the same land supply, and now they report Kyiv is encircled anyway. The land drivers will be targeted anyway.

I'm sure some special Ops (Not under official orders but simply a Civilian Mission to Help) could do this with implausible deniability. Like Russia says no deaths. As long as you can deny it, who cares that nobody believes you. And you aren't shooting their troops directly.

I think the fighting spirit in Syria was very strong and the revolution that occurred there was a profound inertia from all of the factions which in part made the combat so bloody. I think the major difference in this conflict is that there are not so many factions fighting against the enemy, so the city of Kyiv is more easily and readily able to fight as a singular coalition, whereas in Aleppo (and in Syria) many different factions controlled various parts of the city at different times.

He got staff by lying and peddling disinformation. Now no one trusts him, his troops have been decimated by covid his commanders lied to him about his military's preparedness, and his allies were unprepared to support him. 

He got ahead by looking out for #1 and backstabbing whenever it was convenient.  Now he'd isolated on the world stage. 

He held on to power by enabling oligarchs. Now his economy is in shambles.

Here's a short thread on the nuclear posture change that can give some perspective. Remember, we've been here before for half a century. This isn't new. The world knows how to prevent it from escalating.


https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1497937591710195717?s=21

> First, this is a deterrence action against the west, both conventionally and western sanctions. It's a big 'keep out' sign, not a real intent to escalate to nuclear force or aimed at ukr.

> From the operations so far, it looks like R intended a morale victory with fast surrender of UA forces. That didn't pan out, and this conflict is likely to escalate savagely with new commitments of conventional force. This is a 'keep out of it' to the west

> The two big sanctions that rise to the level of a strategic threat are the sanctions against the central bank, and airspace closures making RU mainland-Kaliningrad connections look precarious

> The inevitable response to the R nuclear posture change is that nuclear forces elsewhere will now also go to high readiness

> Unfortunately, there is a good chance those postures will remain on high alert on both sides now until the conflict ends. Which could be a while. The huge risk is not so much immediate, but mistakes and missignalling that leads to horrific consequences until that happens

> Key thing now is for the leaders of nuclear powers to make clear that *they* will not be the source of that escalation, and to recognize the real red lines that can lead to it

> So EU, US, and leaders of those powers need to signal quickly and loudly the circumstances under which escalation can occur. Namely, no use without a strike by R, and to loudly commit that they understand and will not step over the red line triggers

> For example, while airspace closures in EU will occur, under no circumstances will transit or logistics between R and Kaliningrad be disrupted. Under no circumstances will their conventional forces engage directly with R forces.

> That sanctions will be severe and life-changing to R, it's govt, and it's people, but will, under no circumstances, rise to the level of preventing R undertaking its core sovereign activities

> And that responses in cyberspace will not be taken that that have the functional or kinetic effect of disabling the core infrastructure necessary in a modern sovereign nation that would, under LOAC, rise to the level of an armed attack

> During this period, defense ministers, foreign ministers, and heads of state should be particularly careful to ensure that they do not announce new policies or sanctions without consulting with experts and lawyers to ensure they don't unexpectedly step over those lines

> This doesn't escalate to nuclear conflict by itself, it needs serious miscommunication to get there, but given how uncareful EU was in reading R MFA prior to conflict, and how uncareful talk has been since, it is important now for them to be much more careful in signalling

> That all said, this is bad news for everyone, but also a really really ominous sign for ukr that this war is going to get a lot, lot more ugly in conventional force very soon.",False,1645990332.0,t3_t2var6,t1_hyoj4lk,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I am Political scientist-public admin MPA student who has studied geopolitics in the US.

I wholeheartedly agree. Russia cyberattacked our election and energy infrastructure. They had a russian operative join the NRA to stoke russian support among that group. We know this. They were actively trying to weaken our response before this invasion. They have also been garnering support among conservatives.
Anyone saying US politics don't matter doesn't understand geopolitics. I'm convinced the effort to suppress this information are additional psyops in a coordinated effort to undermine US national sovereignty:

> Trump refused to release the funds to Ukraine at the same time he was pressuring that country's new president to announce investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and of Biden's son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukraine gas company. Joe Biden is the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. The funds were only released after the block on the aid became publicly known, sparking the congressional probe which led to the Republican president's impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House.

> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia authorized extensive efforts to hurt the candidacy of Joseph R. Biden Jr. during the election last year, including by mounting covert operations to influence people close to President Donald J. Trump, according to a declassified intelligence report released on Tuesday.

> He is “pretty smart,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday at a Florida fund-raiser, assessing the impending invasion like a real estate deal. “He’s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions,” he said, “taking over a country — really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people — and just walking right in.” Historians called the remarks unprecedented. “The idea that a former president would praise the man or leadership who American troops are even now traveling to confront and contain,” said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, “is astounding.”",1645990792.0,1645990554.0,t3_t2var6,t1_hyogn5s,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".""

Khersor is likely overrun giving the southern flank of the Russian army a chance to cross the Dnieper River. The cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv are reportedly encircled, but resistance is strong and so far none of the good landing sites around Kyiv have fallen to special forces - most bridges and airports into Kyiv are now destroyed so Russia has to rely on long columns for their logistics. The East and Northern fronts are holding at the cities, but the South is falling back - likely the next front lines will be Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv.

>India’s strategic ambivalence at this big turning point in world geopolitics is born out of its friendships and strategic partnerships on both sides. Russia is India’s biggest and time tested supplier of defence weapons. Despite its growing friendship with China, Moscow has boosted India’s defence capabilities with the S-400 air defence system. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited Moscow at the height of India’s crisis with the Chinese Army at the Line of Actual Control in June 2020. And Russia has stood behind India at the UNSC on all issues.  
>  
>At the same time, India has a deep partnership with the United States, which includes defence pacts, trade and investment, technology, and not least, a huge connect through the Indian diaspora and people to people contacts, with thousands of students leaving Indian shores every year to study in American universities.

Additionally, because the invaders bypassed cities that were putting up stiff resistance on their way to encircle their targets, they've been left with vulnerable supply lines and a risk of Ukrainian forces from their rear coming to encircle *them*. Russia could send the remaining 1/3rd of the forces they prepared for the invasion to break a double encirclement, but the thousands of additional anti-tank missiles and MANPADs that are now being shipping to Ukraine could make even that kind of a maneuver very difficult.

This has been a complete shitshow for Russia. If they're willing to bring even more of their troops and vehicles into the conflict, they will probably win, eventually, but at enormous cost. If they stick with the forces they had originally planned to invade with, it seems increasingly likely that Ukraine could break their resolve in the coming weeks or months.

“No, this concept has been developed by Putin at least from year 2003 when he was on record talking about how it would be very good to have Kiev, the capital of independent Ukraine, to be within Russia because Kiev is a sacrosanct place for Russian Orthodox people that has many monuments, many churches, many cathedrals that are very close to Orthodox Christian minds, and that is why this part of territory with some little belongings should be given to Russia.”

He can’t destroy Kiev because of it’s importance in the religion he believes will unite all displaced Russians. This is help us understand he won’t go nuclear because it’s not a part of his vision.

There's a lot of reasons why the Russians think this way, but whether it's true or not doesn't matter, he believes it to be and therefore we must consider his options in light of this.

He has three main ways he could win the war (holding Ukraine is a different story, for the record) - first, he can cut off the flow of weapons into Ukraine and slowly whittle down Kyiv, capturing the government and forcing it to surrender.  Given the leadership of Zelensky and the defiant spirit that's overtaken Ukraine, I find this highly unlikely.  Note that if they want to cut off supplies, Belarus may join in the fight and push towards Lviv - that's something I'm watching like a hawk.  I don't see this happening overall, though.

Second, he continues to push on Kyiv, fails to take it, and launches a tactical nuclear weapon somewhere on uninhabited Ukrainian soil as a warning shot.  Kyiv can't respond in-kind, and the West will be in a dilemma as to whether or not to pop one off in response to the escalation.  He will try and intimidate Ukraine into surrender through this method, only to fail to understand that such a move will only make their resistance more fanatical.

Three, he withdraws Russian troops from Kyiv (however much on the outskirts they may be, surrounds the city, and hits it with a nuclear weapon in an attempt to decapitate the government and break resistance.  This will very likely result in the West launching a preemptive strike to cripple the Russian nuclear arsenal, as letting Putin get away without retaliation for the atrocity he would have committed would be to invite him to do the same to Berlin, Paris, London, DC, etc.  I also find this highly unlikely.

Overall, I don't think the chances are high, as it would be in many ways suicide for Putin.  Maybe 5%, 10% chance at the very most.",False,1645992817.0,t3_t2var6,t1_hyonsw5,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the two straits that connect the Black Sea, which sits on Ukraine’s southern coast, to the Mediterranean.

The convention guarantees the free passage of vessels belonging to Black Sea countries - like Russia - in peacetime, but allows Turkey to close the straits to all foreign warships in a time of war or if Turkey itself is threatened.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said earlier: “We have decided that the situation in Ukraine has turned into a war. We will be transparently applying the provisions of Montreaux.”

It may take many weeks, but this is only a few days into a campaign led by the world's second most powerful military.

My counter was:

And then Russia faces an insurgency.

This is a difficult situation at this point:

Russia is taking mounting financial, personnel & equipment, economic, diplomatic losses that are increasing over time.  They need *some kind of win*: they cannot purely back down.  But whatever they had hoped to gain from invasion *simply is not there for them anymore*.

I'm almost 40 and still remember having air raid drills at grade school during the 80s before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Maybe being older and having a better understanding of the ramifications if there is nuclear war, has me concerned. I never felt this as a kid doing those drills.

I guess this is part of getting older and entering into phases of life that most people experience. There's hope things will work out, but as more information comes out as to the basis for the invasion and war, it's really demonstrating that the dictator in Russia is unhinged, and must be stopped.

If he doesn't, then what next? The rest of the old Soviet bloc members being invaded and conquered? What then?One of those that were members but now are in the EU and NATO?

At the very least, it's a sign that militarily, Russia has no spine.  Within their CoC it's full of rot/corruption from the bottom to the top, and THAT is their undoing.  We're seeing this real time.  I hope as each day of this war goes on, more and more regular Russian folks wake up and smell the coffee.

But it doesn’t feel like either of those options will ever lead to anything but a greater divide, deeper mistrust, and ever increasing animosity. I’m as guilty of choosing both of those options as anyone, so no judgement. 

I don’t know. It’s frustrating how wary we have to be about trusting everything we read or hear. And the idea that our thoughts, opinions, and feelings are being deliberately manipulated really sucks and makes it much harder to form an independent and well thought out opinion.

Standard military logic would be for the Ukranians to continue defending strong central points and inflict large losses, harass (or destroy) the Russian logistical tail, and build up a strong reserve of well armed soldiers. Most of this appears to be what the Ukranians are already doing.

Then when the Russians are as tired as they can be from continuous combat operations, starving, out of ammo and fuel, then you counterattack and completely cut their supply chain and their retreat and possibly the Russians surrender en masse.
