Honestly, it really makes me wonder why Putin who purports himself to be such a strong leader is too cowardly to be upfront with his actions. In truth, being short in stature, Putin appears to suffer from classic Napolean Complex—his psyche still firmly locked into an '80s Cold-War mindset that so thoroughly gripped his reality. Putin may show himself shirtless and being a macho bear, but in reality, his geopolitical projection is closer to that of a snake, both dishonorable and dishonest. 

Appealing to fear and *using* fear as intimidation and leverage is commonplace and well-documented. It's an oligarchy with a mafioso crime boss at its head. This is not a conspiracy, this is evidence that continues to mound.

Poland and Baltic countries trigger consultations under NATO article 4
From CNN’s Brad Lendon in Hong Kong and Vasco Cotovio in Moscow
NATO member states Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have triggered NATO Article Four to launch consultations within the alliance over their security concerns. 

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine represented a “threat to the whole of Europe,” the Estonian government said in a statement on Thursday. 

""Russia's widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all NATO countries, and NATO consultations on strengthening the security of the Allies must be initiated to implement additional measures for ensuring the defense of NATO Allies,” Kallas said. “The most effective response to Russia's aggression is unity.”
Some context: Under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Agreement, the Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the allies is threatened.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO. However, Russia has demanded that NATO commits to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance, something NATO members have rejected, citing the alliance's ""open door"" policy.",False,1645689313.0,t3_t01jrq,t3_t01jrq,,0,70,0,70,0,0,

Japan's Prime Minister says Russia's invasion ""shakes foundations of international order""
From CNN's Emiko Jozuka in Tokyo 
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday condemned Russia's invasion of eastern Ukraine, saying it ""shakes the foundations of the international order.""

""We strongly criticize Russia's actions and will cooperate with the United States and the international community to respond swiftly,"" Kishida told reporters at a news conference.
Kishida added that Tokyo would continue to work with relevant ministries to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in Ukraine.

When asked about further sanctions against Moscow, Kishida told reporters he would consider future measures after communicating with other G7 nations and the international community.

Some context: Kishida on Wednesday said Japan will impose sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

Kishida said Japan will suspend the issuance of visas and freeze the assets of people involved in recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two separatist-held pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine. He did not specify names or how the sanctions would be carried out.

He also said Japan will ban imports and exports to and from Donetsk and Luhansk, and prohibit the issuance and circulation of Russian bonds in Japan.",False,1645688868.0,t3_t01jrq,t3_t01jrq,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

Pentagon is tracking reported incursion of troops from Belarus into Ukraine, source says
From CNN's Katie Bo Lillis
The US Department of Defense is tracking the reported incursion of troops from Belarus into Ukraine, a US defense official said Thursday.  

It was not clear if the troops were only Russian or also Belarusian, the source said.

Some context: Through a livestream video, CNN witnessed troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus at about 6:48 a.m. local time Thursday.

The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Ukraine, crossing with Veselovka, Belarus.

In recent weeks, Russia has amassed a significant number of troops, vehicles and tanks in Belarus near the border with Ukraine. During that time, the two countries have held joint military exercises across the countries, and near the Belarus-Ukrainian border.

Early Thursday, the Ukrainian state border service said the country was attacked through multiple borders, including Belarus.",False,1645682627.0,t3_t01jrq,t3_t01jrq,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

EU foreign policy chief: Russia attack is one of ""darkest hours for Europe since World War II""
From CNN’s Joseph Ataman in Paris and Amy Cassidy
Russia's attack on Ukraine Thursday ranked among the ""darkest hours for Europe"" in nearly 80 years, according to the European Union's foreign policy chief.

“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,” EU High Representative Josep Borrell told reporters.
Borrell promised “urgent assistance to Ukraine,” as well as supporting evacuation efforts, including of EU staff.

EU sanctions: Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Borrell said punitive measures from the 27-member bloc against Russia would be “the harshest packet of sanctions that has ever been implemented.”

Von der Leyen said she will present “massive and strategic” sanctions against Russia for approval later today",False,1645693577.0,t3_t01jrq,t3_t01jrq,,0,52,0,52,0,0,

Here's where explosions have been heard across Ukraine early Thursday
CNN reporters and witnesses in cities across Ukraine have reported hearing explosions in the early hours of Thursday.

Here's where:

Kyiv: CNN reporters in Ukraine's capital heard explosions from the east in the direction of the city's international airport. Social media users reported hearing several explosions in the Boryspil area to the east of the capital, where the international airport is located about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the city. CNN has not confirmed that the airport has been targeted.  
Kharkiv: A CNN team in Ukraine's second biggest city, in the northeast of the country, heard a ""steady stream of loud explosions.""
Kramatorsk: Two people in the eastern city, located about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of separatist-held Donetsk, told CNN they heard at least two massive explosions.
Dnipro: A resident of the central city told CNN they had heard ""a few explosions.""
Mariupol: Two residents told CNN they heard explosions east of the city, which is located in the southeast of the country.
Odessa: A CNN team in the Black Sea port city heard two groups of explosions about 20 minutes apart. 
Zaporizhzhia: A CNN team in the southeastern city said they heard at at least one very distant explosion.
Additionally, a CNN team in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Kharkiv, said they heard a regular stream of thuds that sounded like outgoing artillery fire.",False,1645677546.0,t3_t01jrq,t3_t01jrq,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

St. Petersburg (ND). Vladimir Putin, 2nd Mayor of St. Petersburg and Chairman of the Committee for External Relations of the city of six million, has made it clear to German business representatives that a military dictatorship along the lines of the Chilean model would be the desirable solution to Russia's current political problems. This was reported by WDR in the TV feature ""Aufbruch nach Osten"" (Monday, January 3, 1994, WEST 3 from 9:15 to 9:45 p.m.).

Putin answered questions from representatives of BASF, Dresdner Bank, Alcatel and others who met in the former GDR Consulate General in St. Petersburg. **Putin distinguished between ""necessary"" and ""criminal"" violence. He said that political violence is criminal if it is aimed at eliminating market-economy conditions, and ""necessary"" if it promotes or protects private capital investments.** He, Putin, expressly approved of possible preparations by Yeltsin and the military to bring about a Pinochet-style dictatorship in view of the difficult private economic path. Putin's remarks were received with friendly applause both by the German company representatives and by the deputy German consul general who was present.

* Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad Oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term ""Moscow–Berlin axis"".
* France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a ""firm anti-Atlanticist tradition"".
* The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.
* Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".
* Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.
* Latvia and Lithuania should be given a ""special status"" in the Eurasian–Russian sphere.Poland should be granted a ""special status"" in the Eurasian sphere.
* Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia, ""Serbian Bosnia"" and Greece – ""Orthodox collectivist East"" – will unite with ""Moscow the Third Rome"" and reject the ""rational-individualistic West"".
* Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.

2. Serious occupation.  Permanent.
3. You will probably have some very hard weeks and months ahead.  It depends on how violent a war is on if all stores are destroyed.  But the trucks that refill stores... they will no probably stop running soon.  It is not safe for trucks to drive around during a major war.
4. If there is a lot of ground warfare... yes, things can get very bad for large buildings.  If you hear a lot of small arms (rifles, pistols, handheld rocket launchers, etc), then things may get dangerous.

No one knows for sure.  I am just studying a map.

I hope you already have enough food and water saved up for the coming weeks.

Eisenhower believed that anytime war is on the table, it should be full on all out nuclear war, so that states are more inclined towards cooperation than conflict. McNamara termed it mutually assured destruction. 

This makes sense, so long as the states involved are unitary, rational actors. With Putin in the mix, there's a lot of question marks because he's doing things that don't line up with Russia's national interest. He talks about nuclear power being used, and the scariest part is that he's acting pretty unhinged and so who knows if he ever would take that step.

The rest of the world recognizes what nuclear war would do. They're in a position where if they act, Putin could go nuts. They also have to consider their own national interests, which is ultimately the priority for all states.

Remember - commonwealth nations operate differently, think differently and maintain different social contracts compared to the US. It is a bit less individualistic. Look at how people here in my home of Wellington are fuming at the softcock Police approach to convoy protestors (who I might add, turned our fucking national war memorial (much bigger deal than usual, because of its national historical significance related to Gallipoli) into a public shitter - and then literally threw human shit at cops and a couple of passers-by) - many local businesses and residents are calling for a similar response to Canada. Public support for these convoys is virtually nonexistent in the main body-politic and people are angry at them and want them gone because they objectively impinge on the rest of the freedoms we do have.

Emergency powers might be seen as a power grab in the US (which they could very well be structured as so there, but I'm no expert on theirs) but most of the rest of the western world uses it appropriately - y'know, when a shared public health service is overrun with respiratory disease cases that they can't deal within their existing health system capacity (which all citizens pay into via tax and benefit from the services) and so we need to make slight sacrifices to maintain the common good for a brief period to ensure the right to appropriate medical care FOR ALL, or when your key trade borders are blockaded by people who benefit from that social contract with the rest of their country then having a bitch fit about making minor sacrifices for the whole. Some places are just not as individualistic as the US. And that's okay, but I'm tired of seeing people call literally any move to keep a country actually functioning in support of public consensus, a dictatorial power grab without understanding the actual legislative, operational (as in - most public servants' (including police) desire to act in accordance with national laws) and the human (emotional) context.",False,1645680831.0,t3_t01jrq,t1_hy7716d,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I'm pulling these numbers from memory so they're pretty rough but Ukraine has about 200,000 active troops and over 200,000 as either reserves, veterans, or citizenry with some kind of military training vs Russia's 150,000. Russia has greater air power though (perhaps the greatest force multiplier in modern-day warfare). Ukraine has about 300 fighters vs Russia's 2000. Furthermore, fresh troops will be continually cycled in by Russia which has a far Far larger military in general. But the Ukrainians have a ""home-turf"" advantage and the Russians have a large number of conscripts (lower trained people who probably don't care all that much about Putin's imperialism but who need to put food on the table).

All things considered, the official Ukrainian military and government will probably cease functioning relatively soon. But Ukraine is going to be one hell of a territory to occupy. We saw what happened with the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan but Ukraine is far better equipped. The Ukrainians will probably form an effective resistance movement which, while being incapable of ""defeating"" Russia conventionally, will drain vast amounts of resources from them, making the situation more politically difficult for Putin.

Unfortunately, NATO can't get involved directly. If a NATO coalition were to counter-attack in Ukraine, that would put nuclear powers in direct conflict which didn't even happen in the Cold War (where it gets its name). It's conceivable in such a scenario that Putin may actually give up his prospects in the region (because he probably knows NATO would keep its word and not advance further than occupied Ukrainian territory).

How much capital is Putin willing to spend on this? Will the west be able to continue sending aid to the Ukrainians? How tactically sound are Ukraines battle plans? How involved will non-military Ukrainians be? How many non-military Ukrainians will get involved?

Here's where explosions have been heard across Ukraine early Thursday
CNN reporters and witnesses in cities across Ukraine have reported hearing explosions in the early hours of Thursday.

Here's where:

Kyiv: CNN reporters in Ukraine's capital heard explosions from the east in the direction of the city's international airport.

Here’s a little history lesson you’ve blatantly ignored to bring you up to speed. The the United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit and integrate it into the West. At the same time, the EU’s expansion eastward and the West’s backing of the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine -- beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004 -- were critical elements, too. Since the mid-1990s, Russian leaders have adamantly opposed NATO enlargement, and in recent years, they have made it clear that they would not stand by while their strategically important neighbor turned into a Western bastion. For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine’s democratically elected and pro-Russian president -- which he rightly labeled a “coup” - - was the final straw. He responded by taking Crimea, a peninsula he feared would host a NATO naval base, and working to destabilize Ukraine until it abandoned its efforts to join the West.",False,1645677957.0,t3_t01jrq,t1_hy76tke,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Realists believe that since the international system is anarchic, its basically dog-eat-dog and a zero sum game. Every man for himself, cant rely on anyone else, conflict is always inevitable. So according to them, you're correct.

Liberalists believe that cooperation via institutions (e.g. Nato, UN, etc) can help states overcome the barbaric anarchic system of world politics, and that diplomacy is the way to go in order to avoid this kinda thing. The more interdependent states are with one another, the more incentive there will be for all parties to avoid conflict since everyone suffers. You could see how Germany was trying to navigate this issue with not wanting to take much of a side initially, no doubt in part because of the Nordstream 2 deal. No one can deny how disruptive to economies the actions being taken will be. 

The liberalist perspective has been prevalent and growing, but again, you need institutions for facilitating cooperation, and that is difficult when the states in question are not involved in said institutions (or not playing nice in the ones they are in, cough cough Russia). 

Both these schools of thought have been able to understand and explain much of what we have seen in history, absolutely. But there's also the individual factor which looks specifically at the leader and their operational code, since they are ultimately the decision maker. Putin's psychology is an unknown in a lot of respects.

There's no real good answer, in my opinion. And I'm not an expert by any means, I'm just in uni studying world politics right now. But ultimately we have to look at the big picture and a lot of that points towards Ukraine suffering while the world only does so much, for fear of another great war erupting, or revolts within populations in protest of foreign intervention (a lot of places do not have the appetite to send troops to another area, especially one that isn't in NATO or the EU).

Ukrainians also have a distinct genetic difference compared to Russians, so the quote is also wrong as well. 

UK is different. Wow huge revelation. Napoleon himself had antipathy towards Great Britain and thought of them as different than Europeans.  The Normans, Germans, Danes, and Norsemen and took their turns for over 600 years trying to carve up England due to its unique hospitable temperature in Europe. UK was one of the few countries who never experienced the Holocaust the first hand. This same concept is replayed in many fictional works. In Orwells 1984 the UK is the only country to not fall to Eurasia. 

People side with their own race? Have you been to an public school or a prison yard? People tend to self-segregate by race, a lot. Even the progressive bay area is more diverse yet more segregated now than it was in the 70s. Do you know what the greatest indicators are for predicting how someone will vote in the US? Again, nothing new. 

But because it’s presented in neat orderly prose you gobble it up even though it’s not actually saying anything. 

There’s nothing unique about Russias geopolitical interests about Ukraine anymore than what other neighboring countries have with each other. 

The UK has historically always been an outlier in Europe, and has been a place of power due to its geographical and environmental advantage. For hundreds of years. 

People identify and establish community and solidarity within the same race.

Haven't claimed otherwise, but there has been enough misinfo around about NATO being the 'aggressor' when Russia started this shit already eight years ago that you'd think, hope, that people would be at least smart enough to think a little harder on, but alas....

>Cite tech & Intel all you want. 

Thanks, I will, because it's patently obvious you don't know what you're talking about, and those factors are a big reason why it is much more possible to have a better idea of what's going on on the ground which doesn't hinge purely on the statements of intelligence agencies. Instead of bitching about a war from 20 years ago that doesn't apply to the situation in a different time, place and with a different aggressor, maybe shut the fuck up and pay a little more attention to that information that is straightforward enough to investigate yourself?

>Same shit was cited 20 years ago. 

No, it literally wasn't. Iraq was initiated by the US over claims of WMD. Ukraine is a continuation of something that happened eight years ago, initiated by a different country.
