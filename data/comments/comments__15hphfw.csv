I'd love to see Ukraine destroying ruzzia's navi in the Black Sea and continuing the grain export all by themselves. But I didn't expect ruzzia to be able to destroy Ukraine's naval drones ...

Do you think we could see more ruzzian ships being destroyed in the coming weeks? Or more successful attacks on their ports?

I am grateful to Saudi Arabia for this platform for negotiations. Recently, a meeting in the same format was held in Copenhagen. We are moving step by step towards the Global Peace Summit. It is very important that the world sees: a fair and honest end to Russian aggression will benefit everyone in the world. Everyone! 

Liberating Ukrainian land from the occupiers means restoring full respect for international law and the UN Charter.

>
>It also signaled that Moscow‚Äôs economy is more squarely in Ukraine‚Äôs crosshairs, bringing the war to one of Russia‚Äôs most critical commercial ports.  
>
>Here is a look at the port and its significance for Moscow:  
>
>What is Novorossiysk?  
>
>The Novorossiysk commercial seaport is one of Russia‚Äôs largest by volume and among the biggest in Europe ‚Äî a key node in exporting Russian grain, oil, and other products to countries worldwide.  
>
>It has been a hub of international commerce for Russia since the 19th century, and the city was also the site of the first Pepsi factory in Russia, which opened in the Soviet Union in the early 1970s during the Cold War d√©tente.
>
>Before his illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia allocated significant resources to constructing the naval base at Novorossiysk, turning the port into one of the country‚Äôs main naval hubs for the Black Sea. On the same day the port was hit, a drone attack also targeted Feodosia, a Russian-controlled port in Crimea.  
>
>How important is Novorossiysk for Russia‚Äôs economy?  
>
>The port is a significant export hub for grain, given its proximity to Russia‚Äôs most extensive grain-producing regions and its location on the Black Sea, allowing for easy exports to Africa, Asia and South America, and Europe.  
>
>At a summit with African leaders last week in St. Petersburg, Russia, Mr Putin promised free grain to several African nations ‚Äî grain that likely would be exported from Russia via Novorossiysk.  
>
>What does the attack mean for Russia?  
>
>The attack, and the subsequent pause in maritime traffic at the port, prompted wheat futures to rise on Friday, indicating Novorossiysk‚Äôs importance to the global grain trade. Russia is the world‚Äôs largest wheat exporter.
>
>The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which operates an oil terminal at Novorossiysk, said the attack caused a temporary halt in the movement of ships in the port. It was unclear whether any oil export infrastructure was damaged in the attack.  
>
>If strikes continue around the port ‚Äî whose commercial operator is under European Union sanctions ‚Äî the result could be significant economic disruption for Russia.  
>
>The attack on Friday could be ‚Äúa powerful shock to the Russian economy,‚Äù the Russian pro-government Telegram channel Readovka Explains posted on Friday, calling for an ‚Äúimmediate response‚Äù by Moscow.

>‚ÄúWho do you work for?‚Äù demanded one blogger, Aleksandr Talipov, denouncing pro-war Telegram channels for posting photos of supposed Ukrainian attacks on Russian-occupied Crimea. The channels, he suggested, cater to Ukrainians.

>Since the start of the war in February 2022, the bloggers‚Äô unstinting support for the invasion has given them license to criticize the Russian government over how the military campaign has been conducted.

Olenegorsky Gornyak was meant to support the ""Crimean Bridge"" project. In a propaganda news segment from July 11, the reporter says that the ship arrived in Kerch to help move trucks and cars by the personal order of Putin himself. The presenter clarifies that the use of a warship as a ferry shuttle is planned only if the situation at the bridge worsens and motorists become stuck in traffic jams. Which became reality when the Kerch Bridge was attacked less than a week later on July 17th.

This had been one of the primary reasons for disagreements between Prigozhin and Shoigu / Gerasimov.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/fighting-two-enemies-ukraine-female-soldiers-decry-harassment

>**‚ÄòFighting two enemies‚Äô: Ukraine‚Äôs female soldiers decry harassment**

>**Women in armed forces express anger at stigma and treatment by male colleagues and say complaints are being ignored**

>...‚ÄúShe was a flame I followed, a bright flame that always did the right thing and we need more women like Elya in our army,‚Äù said a sergeant who had been asked to say a few words at the service. And yet, conceded a second soldier in an interview with the Guardian, while Maltseva was respected and listened to as an operations planner by those around her, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say the same for those at the higher command level‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe have Nato standards but a Soviet system and mentality,‚Äù he added. **If Elya had been listened to, he suggested, the soldiers would not have been there to die...**

>...There is equality on paper today but scant evidence of it in practice, Haran said, with women‚Äôs needs in terms of uniform, body armour, sanitation and career development not treated as priorities **and regarded as almost a form of provocation by many men fighting alongside them.**

>‚ÄúI would say we have to fight two enemies at once,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne being Russia, obviously. And the other one is the stereotypes and the stigma that you face every single day. And the only place that I can say I did not see that stigma was the actual ground zero [on the frontline] because everyone was so freaking busy fighting for their country...‚Äù

(Just a reminder that Ukraine is meant to be fighting a bunch of arse-backwards rapists and oafs.)

>The list of shortcomings goes on: there is no contraception at the frontline nor the provision of female urinary diversion devices that allows women in trenches to stand up when relieving themselves so as to avoid infections.

>Doctors in the field are not trained in gynaecology, and when a female soldier‚Äôs contract comes to an end they must undergo a medical examination to be re-enlisted in what many suspect is an attempt to ensure they are not pregnant and chasing paid leave...

It gets worse. (As another reminder, all women in the Ukrainian armed forces are volunteers.)

>...‚ÄúYesterday I had to talk to a girl, who knows I am a former gender adviser in the army, **and she was put in a psychiatric facility without consent by her commander, just because she applied for transfer to a combat unit**,‚Äù Haran said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that bad. And my former subordinate, a girl, a medic, she filed a sexual harassment report and there were witnesses [but] all [the] men refused to testify on her behalf and her commander threatened to put her in a facility as well, just for reporting that she was being sexually harassed...‚Äù

And this should be grounds for a court martial, at the very least.

>‚ÄúI left [my brigade] because there was this person high up the food chain who would harass women and I know these women,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome of them are my subordinates who I‚Äôm responsible for. They were harassed by the same person **who basically told them if they refuse to have sex with him, he‚Äôs sending their husbands who were also in the brigade to their deaths.** I was told to shut up because he did not harass me personally.‚Äù",1691152555.0,1691152232.0,t3_15hphfw,t3_15hphfw,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

Can't comment much about Latvian situation (it's different because Latvia had a concept of alien passport), but can provide a brief summary for Lithuania.

There are 11k more BY/RF citizens here than 1 year ago. Number of Belarussians increased by 10k, Russians - almost 1k  (although no Russians were allowed in the country, lol) according to the state stats agency.

And yes, the state has introduced a lot of restrictions for purchasing property (especially for RF citizens), obtaining residence permits and crossing the border, also a questionnaire with questions about the attitudes towards the war was created, intelligence service is now involved in background checks etc. These things are used to reduce growth of the number at least by a bit.

But that doesn't eliminate the problem - even with huge restrictions the amount BY/RF citizens in the country is growing very fast, we have never had such an amount of them living here since the collapse of USSR...

>President Vladimir Putin has signed a law introducing a windfall tax on excess profits of Russian companies, which was published on a government website on Friday.  
>  
>The law, passed by parliament last month, is aimed at raising 300 billion roubles and easing strain on the budget as Russia wages its war in Ukraine. Reuters reported exclusively on Friday that Russia had doubled its 2023 defence spending target to more than $100 billion, or a third of all public expenditure.  
>  
>The windfall tax rate will be 10% of the difference between firms' average profit for 2021-22 and their profit for 2018-19. **Firms can get a 50% discount if they pay before Nov. 30.**  
>  
>There are **exemptions** for a series of sectors including **small and medium-sized businesses and oil, gas and coal companies.**

The russian navy can't really do much in the Black sea.  Early on they drove around the whole place for seemingly no reason, but when the moskva was sunk that just stopped and they stayed far away from Ukraine's coast.  They have not and likely cannot make any kind of blockade, short of outright piracy in international waters.

On the other hand they can send ships and submarines out to sea just a bit and launch cruise missiles.  This is hard to stop.  They have something like 5 frigates and 5 submarines that can do this.  It's very hard for Ukraine to strike either of those, but of course with a FPS drone like tonight's video seems to show they can definitely try to be opportunistic.

The third thing that Ukraine actually needs to at least slow down is munitions supplies.  Ships bringing supply into Berdiansk bypass all the roads and railways that Ukraine has been hitting, so anything they can do to slow that down is really good.  The hit tonight is on a ""landing ship"" that probably was doing that, although too bad it looked like it was heading back toward russia and presumably empty.

A bit off topic, but if there's an FPV of this drone driving into the ship, there should also be one of the bridge strike(s).  I wonder if we'll ever get to see that one.",False,1691138314.0,t3_15hphfw,t1_juqhnwx,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

Fact is, no Republican contender has any chance while Trump is running - but there is a fair chance that he will either pull out of the race or become ineligible to hold office as his legal troubles mount. If that happens, the race will be blown wide open and that is what all other contenders are waiting for. Christie I think would actually fair reasonably well in the debates, especially against the likes of Pence and DeSantis, so it's a little bit early to count him out completely. 

I agree though that his chances are pretty slim and that his whole campaign is (in part) meant to raise his profile and perhaps position him for an important position in any potential GOP administration that isn't run by Trump. 

In any case -it's always good for Ukraine when a high profile Republican visits Ukraine or expresses support or visits. Fact is the GOP is somewhat divided on the issue, with the establishment GOP being pro-Ukraine and the reactionary part being anti-Ukraine. 

Christie visiting Ukraine shows that he believes that doing so will be good for his campaign and raise his profile under (a part of) the GOP electorate, and further more raise the profile of the Ukrainian situation with that electorate. 

Fact is, the GOP electorate ultimately doesn't care a lot about Ukraine as they are much concerned with internal matters. It's not a deal breaker to them like other issues, so this is actually a point where they can be influenced a bit more.

Or the recent attack on Moscow where likely ECM caused a missile to miss its target and hit the building next to it.

But remember the lessons we learned at the beginning of this phase of the war about the three words for ""truth"" in Russian society and their different meanings.  Leaders say lies to let others off the hook for their behavior or to cover their countrymen's actions.  Putin saying it wasn't a Russian launched missile that shot down MH17 means it is the official, party line, and lets the population parrot it to outsiders, letting Girkin off the hook for the mistake (at the time).

Over the last decades the profile of possible attacks shifted more and more towards asymmetric threats (small boats with bombs for example) and the russians have dropped the ball on adapting for the most part.

The damaged landing ship probably has some small arms capabilities to defend itself, but hitting a hard to detect and quick surface drone with a low profile is probably a very difficult task for them, especially when it's dark and they're not prepared for it. Being 800km away in 'safe' waters did the rest to drop their guard.

>  
>‚ÄúWe see that when our exchange rate weakens, various conspiracies arise about how \[the ruble\] is deliberated weakened to increase budget revenues‚Ä¶ But we must look, first of all, at the dynamics of foreign trade,‚Äù Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.  
>  
>Nabiullina explained that the ruble ‚Äî which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine ‚Äî managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.  
>  
>‚ÄúIf we compare the positive current account in the first quarter \[of 2023\], then compared to last year's peak, it fell five times, so the floating rate is changing under the influence of foreign trade,‚Äù Nabiullina added.  
>  
>The ruble has traded with extreme volatility in the 16 months since Russia invaded Ukraine as the West has targeted Moscow‚Äôs foreign currency reserves and crucial energy exports through sanctions designed to cripple Russia‚Äôs economy.  
>  
>Nabiullina highlighted the potential inflationary risks stemming from the continued depreciation of the ruble, emphasizing that such factors would be taken into account during the Central Bank‚Äôs upcoming meeting where it will decide whether to adjust its key rate, which has remained steady at 7.5% since September.

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,15hphfw,jur2ys3,"Not the person you responded to, but risk modelling is about likelihood and impact expressed in cost. The likelihood may not be very large, but the impact of an event would be significant. So even a small increase in the chance, could have a large impact on the risk model of the insurer. 

For example, say that normally speaking the chance of a ship sustaining significant damage on a journey would be 0,001% - ie, one in every 100,000 journeys would result in a large pay-out by insurers, then it's really not a stretch to say that this chance would increase significantly, ie - one in every 50,000 or every 20,000 journeys if there are drones exploding in the neighborhood. That alone could double/triple the expected risk and therefore potential cost for the insurer. 

I don't know much about shipping, but my guess is that the cargo and the ship would be insured separately, with the cargo being insured for the specific journey and the ship having a longer running insurance. I also expect that they designate certain area's as higher vs lower risk, ie it will be higher risk to run your ship past Somali pirates than over the Atlantic. Since ships run variable routes, my guess it that the insurance cost remains the same, but that the pay-out will be less if you run into an issue in a high-risk area. For example, normally insurance could pay out any damages starting at $1 million, but if you receive damage in a high risk area *due to the high risk factors* it may start at $10 million. 

All in all, what that means I guess is that insuring the cargo would be more costly, but the ship itself not. 

As a whole however, the effect will be that costs will increase. Either the insurer, the shipping company or the cargo-owner has to deal with the increased risk. If you're not paying more for your insurance, you might still pay more for shipping the cargo as the shipping companies themselves will need to factor in *their* risk. 

The more these types of attacks happen, the more insurers and shipping companies will start to worry and that will surely be reflected in the prices. That doesn't mean it will become unsustainable or uninsurable, but prices would probably increase across the board.",False,1691151801.0,t3_15hphfw,t1_juqwnoy,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

d6ddfbe0ed379ebc88a16607cb2991de,15hphfw,juqskrl,"The old soviet ships are actually the ones that are very well protected against modern small drones and as long as crew is paying attention it's impossible to touch them. Those old 30mm gatling AA guns that were on most soviet ships in the 70s have very good coverage, including ability to point down and shoot at water right next to the ship. With their high rate of fire they will tear apart any small boat that comes within couple of kilometers of them. 

Many modern russian ships have removed those defenses for some idiotic reason(cost saving? corruption?) and have hard time dealing with such threats.

In this particular case and in case of Sevastopol attacks the overconfident idiots clearly didn't expect anything(year and a half into full scale war, very smart!) and simply didn't spot the attack, so it doesn't matter what weapons they had.

In case of that recon ship that was attacked some time ago they did notice and fight back. That junk was armed with single WW2 era machine gun turret that had a huge blind spot in the back of the ship, and even then they managed to destroy all but 1 attacking drone with what seems to be just small arms fire. 

Based on that it seems that these drones are only useful in surprise attacks on unsuspecting(and really dumb) targets or against unarmed ships. I am very skeptical on all the claims of them ""revolutionizing"" ship warfare.

What i'm hoping to see is drone torpedo boats. Even cold war era guided torpedoes are almost impossible to defend against(there are some countermeasures, but i doubt russian ships have any) and they are much more damaging than these drones. Can't use them easily by airplanes or surface ships, because they will be detected by radar and intercepted by long range anti air/anti ship missiles, but if you can deliver them by a sneaky drone boat they should be incredibly effective.",False,1691145774.0,t3_15hphfw,t1_juqo32l,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

Biden barely won in the swing states that allowed his electoral vote total to be 306-232. Same with Trump in 2016. So yes, he did barely win.

>And since then the Republican part has seen some fractures, an identity crisis, Trump is facing three indictments, two of which will begin early next year, and Biden's had a great presidency with few problems or scandals.

You seriously think the GOP isn't gonna fall in line behind Trump as soon as he wins the nomination? JFC, I can't tell if this is an overdose of hopium or copium. Maybe both.

It is important that we turn the tide and equally create a more responsible electorate who votes more often in midterms and primaries too in order to counter the far right movements.

I believe it is still possible, and I think 2024 absolutely puts us on a better path to get there.

? You seem to be the one downvoting every reply, talking about neocons, terrorists, interventionists, and complaining about the west. Like, you almost sound angry, but I‚Äôm not sure at what.

Your assumption that Ukraine hit a high-rise because it was a high-rise, and not because that building contained government agencies, such as the Ministry of Digital Communications.

I also would like that coups be reverted or don't happen in the first place, telling me that I prefer the junta is hostile and reductionist especially because I'm from a country that suffered under one.
