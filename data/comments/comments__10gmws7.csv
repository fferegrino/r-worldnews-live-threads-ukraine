Previously, ""Bild"" and ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" had reported that Chancellor Scholz only wanted to deliver the Leopard tanks if the United States agreed to their Abrams tanks.

Focus of aid packages is to provide Ukraine with equipment it can use now.

Milley is confident that the Bradley, Strykers and other armored/mechanized equipment will provide Ukraine the ability to mount an effective offensive, like they have before.


There was a lot of covering for Germany. Just highlighting what they are doing and how everyone can do more. But they were definitely highlighting Germany's support of training for Ukrainian forces, plus previous assistance packages.

Secretary Austin: ""It's about the kind of world we want to live in. And tt's about the world we want our children and grandchildren to inherent. The members of this contact group are standing up for a world where rules matter, and where rights matter. And where sovereignty is respected. And where people can choose their own path free of tyranny.""

Secretary Austin again: ""This isn't really about one single platform, our goal is … to provide the capability Ukraine needs to be successful in the near term."" … ""This isn't dependent on a single platform. It's a combined arms effort.""

Gen. Milley: ""From a military standpoint for this year it would be difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from Russian occupied Ukraine."" Focus is on Ukraine using its forces to liberate as much as possible.

It’s called Epiphany^1, and it celebrates Christ’s baptism—and Ukrainians often themselves dip into ponds or lakes or at the seashores in the freezing cold January—especially, tough young men.  (A baptism/feats-of-strength tradition that was highly discouraged this year as subsequent heat sources could not be guaranteed.)

Abstaining from the tradition, Ukrainians turn to the news to see what their Patriarch^2 did for Epiphany’s liturgy service, and were “impressed,” “proud,” and “quite delighted” that he donned an ornate clerical robe, fully embroidered, showing his patriotism in all of its Ukrainian blue & gold splendor.

[See photos](https://glavcom.ua/country/society/patriotichne-vbrannja-mitropolita-epifanij-proviv-sluzhbu-u-lavri-u-zhovto-blaktinij-rizi-902951.html)

They are uplifted by this. 

He did similarly for Christmas—wore ornate robes embroidered in the traditional Ukrainian embroidery colors—red and black.

*Why significant to them:* 
There’s a ***1000–yr old monastery/Lavra in the heart of Kyiv***. It’s always been a big deal to both the Russians and Ukrainians.  Back the Orthodox Church split in Ukraine a decade ago, the Russians were able to stay at this important site (there’s 2 orthodox churches in Ukraine, and one is led by Moscow).  ***Just this month, the Moscow Patriate priests were evicted***.  This is the second liturgical service by the fully-Ukrainian church—which is why it’s fully of this symbolism and meaningful to Ukrainians.

6. Just a list of other donations we've heard before. Highlights how it signifies resolve to support Ukrainian, European and Global security. ""It's about the kind of world we want to live in. And tt's about the world we want our children and grandchildren to inherent. The members of this contact group are standing up for a world where rules matter, and where rights matter. And where sovereignty is respected. And where people can choose their own path free of tyranny.""

7. Gen. Milley is speaking now.

8. War has evolved over last 11 months, but contact group's mission is the same. Committed to support Ukraine.

9. Latest package signifies movement for Ukraine to go on the offensive to liberate its occupied territory. This includes the training going on, too. Basically Ukrainian military is being set up for a successful offensive in the NATO style.

10. ""Until Putin ends this war, his war of choice, the nations of this contact group will continue to support the defense of Ukraine in order to uphold the rules based international order.""

11. Austin asked about tanks: Germany hasn't made a decision on provision of Leopard tanks. Focus is on Ukraine's ability to be successful now. Window right now between now and the spring when Ukraine goes on the counter offensive, it's short. Poland is offering/providing tanks plus other countries. No announcements on M1s.

12. Austin/Milley asked if he's disappointed and how Germany can be seen as a reliable ally since they're 'dragging their feet' and are there any prohibitions of Ukrainian use of American weapons in Crimea: ""This isn't really about one single platform, our goal is … to provide the capability Ukraine needs to be successful in the near term."" Goes through battalions/brigades of mechanized, non-tank, capability. Says it can help Ukraine be successful. And that right now there's an opportunity to ensure Ukrainians are trained properly on the equipment and it will enable Ukrainians to be successful going forward. ""This isn't dependent on a single platform. It's a combined arms effort.""

13. Milley adds to last answer: Everyone says this'll end in negotiated settlement. Milley says it's a difficult fight, with a static frontline for now, outside of Soledar region. ""From a military standpoint for this year it would be difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from Russian occupied Ukraine."" Focus is on Ukraine using its forces to liberate as much as possible.

14. Austin asked if Germany is doing enough to show 'real leadership in Europe:' ""Yes, but we could all do more. … Germany has contributed a lot to this campaign."" Highlighted the training going on in Germany, including German forces training Ukrainians.

15. For Austin: Is it possible to send a small amount of Abrams to push German Leopards? For Milley: Can Ukraine use this equipment together. Austin's answer: There's no linkage between Abrams and Leopards. DOD's goal is to provide credible combat capabilities. Milley's answer: To operate effectively Ukraine needs the personnel and the training and the equipment. There's a short period of time to get that all together, it can be done, but it will be a challenge.

6e4ab49df504ef55a73832b957cc6604,10gmws7,j5602nq,"I'm confused about the Hungarian military purge news. The article from Telex says:

> 170 generals and officers have already been dismissed from the national defense, says the former state secretary of national defense

And in the body it says:

> another source said that 157 generals and colonels were dismissed with immediate effect

I'm confused how there could be that many generals / colonels to dismiss. Googling around, the US may have 1 general / flag officer per 1,450 other personnel or so. Wikipedia says hungary has 37,650 active duty personnel and 20,000 reserve. If we assume that they have a similar ratio and we're generous with the numbers, there would be 27 active duty generals and 14 reserve generals. Assuming a 4 : 1 ratio Colonels : Generals, there would be 125ish active duty colonels and 56 reserve colonels.

So the total number of active generals + active colonels should be about 150, and reserve generals + colonels about 70.

If they're dismissing 170 active duty colonels and generals that would be Hungary's *ENTIRE MILITARY COMMAND*. If they're also dismissing reserve colonels and generals, that's still *77% of Hungary's ENTIRE MILITARY COMMAND*

That doesn't make sense. I tried to reconstruct these numbers by using Wikipedia's information on the Hungarian military. The Wikipedia pages for Hungary's military imply that Colonels command Regiments and Generals command Brigades and above, with some members also being part of the general staff. Hungarian military brigades or military formations which might be commanded by a general include:

* Medical center
* Budapest garrison Brigade
* Military Law Enforcement
* Logistic Center
* HDF Academy
* HDF Form, Prep, Train Cmd.
* Combat Ops
* Psy Ops
* Papa Air Base
* 86th Helicopter Base
* 59th Air Base
* HDF Combat Command
* 25th Inf Brig
* 5th Inf Brig
* 2nd Special Forces Brig

So 15 generals in charge of active duty units, with let's say 10 in military high command and staff roles. This implies 25 active duty generals. Using troop ratios, I had estimated there were 27 active duty generals. I think this implies that my numbers for Hungarian generals were correct. But more info:

With colonels in charge of:

* 64th Logistic Regiment
* 54th Radar Regiment
* 43rd Signal and Cmd. Support Rgmt.
* 37th Engineer Rgmt
* 24th Recon Rgmt
* 12th Air Defense Missile Rgmt
* 1st EOD and River Flotilla Rgmt

Aka 7 colonels who have commands which aren't part of brigades. If I assume the 15 commands with generals all have 4 colonels each, that's 60 colonels. If I add in 7 colonels who have commands reporting to the general staff or combat command, and round up, that's 70 colonels. That's very far below my previous estimate of 125 active duty colonels. If I use this actual counting of Hungarian command units, then I arrive at 70 colonels and 27 generals in active duty. With reserves about 50% of active duty forces, there might be 35 reserve colonels and 14 reserve generals, for these totals:

active duty colonels + generals: 97

reserve duty colonels + generals: 49

Total Colonels + Generals: 146.

This is why I'm confused. The article from Telex has a headline like:

> 170 generals and officers have already been dismissed from the national defense, says the former state secretary of national defense

Shouldn't that be Hungary's entire officer corps?

[Edit] I called a retired US Army Colonel I know to ask what he thought. He said that the Hungarian military might have named some people as ""generals"" who aren't really generals, ie some militaries will name people in charge of defense industry as generals, and sometimes the position of 'general' will be awarded based on political patronage. If that's the case, then the ratio of enlisted : generals can be different than in the US which could mean Hungary has more generals to cut than the US has. Also, the US Congress has a set limit on the number of generals and that might mess with the US ratio of enlisted : generals, which in turn would mess with the ratios I used in my first calculation. Both of these things would imply that the % of generals and colonels being dismissed is smaller than I think. On the other hand, he also implied that my colonel : general ratio was bad and there should be fewer colonels per general, which means that he thinks there are reasons to believe the % of generals and colonels being dismissed is *larger* than I think. So I'm still confused....",1674235862.0,1674234979.0,t3_10gmws7,t3_10gmws7,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

- Yes, he was secretly contacting Russian military and Russian intelligence assets.

- Ukrainian Security Services (SBU) intercepted the calls, and arrested him, while he actually was being guarded by agents from the GUR [Ukraine’s military intelligence]. (Both he and GUR complied, believing it would soon be remedied.)

- Those calls were not acts of treason.  Zelensky himself *personally* authorized the calls, as an undercover operation. [He was likely given some intelligence to disclose, in order to gain trust—ie, a small be trayal—a painful but necessary part of intelligence work in order to gain trust, which is likely why it required Zelensky’s approval. Basically, double agent type work.]

    - Budanov, head of the GUR, had *personally* recruited him to “infiltrate the GRU” [Russia’s military intelligence] because he plausibly appeared sympathetic to Russia, creating a good cover.  He was so high level, that Budanov *personally* handled him [he reported directly to Budanov], because he obtained such extremely high-level intelligence.  Budanov credits him with providing the critical  intel that enabled Kyiv to be saved [note that it’s similar as Bill Burns had provided, but now was verified by their own asset—down to the exact hour of invasion, landing at Gostomel; but possibly different details were shared].

- No, no one told the SBU, however, who thought they found a traitor.
The SBU arrested, the very day, while he was actually on the way to represent Ukraine at negotiations with Russia—at Budanov’s request—but the SBU didn’t actually arrest. (The fact that later, traitors were discovered in the SBU appears unrelated.)

- Yes, with an hour, the SBU had put a bullet to the back of his head, on the street.

- Still unclear—whether those at the SBU will be charged.  assassination. WSJ notes that there’s a federal investigation and key personnel refused to be interviewed due to investigation.

Zelensky awarded him hero, buried him with honors, next to Ukraine’s first Foreign Minister.

KYIV—Ukraine is braced for a major new offensive that could begin within weeks. One of President Zelensky’s key insiders told The Daily Beast that they expect **a looming Russian move to encircle the country with a simultaneous attack on three fronts.**

Rustem Umerov, a member of the team negotiating with Russia, said the Kremlin was preparing for a fresh advance which could begin as soon as February. **The assault would come from the north**, over the Belarusian border, **from the Russian strongholds in the east of Ukraine, and from the south**, where the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was seized by Vladimir Putin’s forces in 2014 and nearby cities of Melitopol and Zaporizhzhia are now also under Russian control.

“**Russians are encircling us from 240 degrees**, attacking from the Black Sea, from Belarus and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions,” Umerov said.

Russia declared its first victory in the war for months this week, claiming they had taken the salt-mining town of Soledar in Donetsk. There is still some dispute as to whether fighting continues for control of the town but the Russians have clearly made territorial gains—at a huge cost.

Mercenary fighters working for Wagner, Putin’s private army, have led the charge on Soledar and the nearby city of Bakhmut. Fighters recruited from Russian prisons were key to the onslaught; The Daily Beast reported that their fearless advances towards near-certain death helped the Russians identify pockets of Ukrainian resistance.

“They are coming from all directions, with three lines of fighting: criminals, private contractors, and regular forces. Their goals are to get rid of their criminals, to test and train their contractors,” Umerov said.

Ukrainian intelligence and defense experts believe that it is all preparation for a **large-scale ground offensive**, bolstered by more recruits to the regular army.

Colonel Oleh Zhdanov, a former staffer in the operational directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told The Daily Beast that Ukraine’s military and intelligence units are tracking the movement of Russian troops in real time.

“We are watching Russia build lots of forces in the Zaporizhzhia region. It looks like they are planning a pincer attack from Kharkiv [in the east] and Zaporizhzhia [in the south] directions, they will attempt to capture all of Ukraine’s major defense forces,” Zhdanov told The Daily Beast. “We are also watching Russian military constantly moving 10-12,000 men in Belarus [to the north]. They are also reinforcing in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.”

Colonel Zhdanov says there is only one man in the world who knows when the war in Ukraine will end: President Joe Biden. He believes that the war will go on until the White House signs off on all of the additional military firepower Ukraine is requesting.

“President Biden has a detailed scenario of this war in the White House. The sooner we get weapons the sooner we finish the war, but it looks like the U.S. wants Russia to exhaust itself with all of its war efforts,” Zhdanov told The Daily Beast. “In Russia they now have a cult of death: on all levels, from propagandists to the Orthodox Patriarch, Russians are called to go and die in this war, as their grandfathers died in previous wars.”",False,1674211807.0,t3_10gmws7,t3_10gmws7,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Germany is ""ready to move quickly"" if allies reach a consensus on sending tanks to Ukraine, Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Friday.

""As far as the delivery of the Leopard is concerned, there is no unanimous opinion,"" Pistorius told reporters on the sidelines of a high stakes defense meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

He rebuffed claims Germany has been ""standing in the way"" of a ""united coalition"" of countries in favor of sending tanks to Ukraine.

""There are good reasons for the delivery and there are good reasons against it. And given the overall situation of a war that has been going on for almost one year now, all the pros and cons have to be weighed very carefully, and that assessment is explicitly shared by many allies,"" he added.

Pistorius said he had instructed officials to carry out an audit of Germany's stocks of Leopard 2 tanks so the country can ""move quickly"" in the event of a ""positive decision.""

The Defense Minister added that the issue of export authorizations was not discussed during Friday's meetings. 

Poland has been waiting on the go-ahead to send German-made tanks to Ukraine. On Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that if Poland does not get the green light from Germany, it will ""do the right thing ourselves.""

Statement by German defence minister Pistorius, rough translation by me: 

>""Of course we talked today about the possible delivery of Leopard tanks. First of all, I have to state that there is not a clear consensus among our partners here. **The idea of there being a united coalition [for the delivery] and only Germany is standing in their way is false.** 

>There are many allies who share the point of view which I presented today - there are good reasons for the delivery, and good reasons against. Considering the bigger picture of a war which almost lasts for a year we have to consider each point carefully. **And this opinion is shared by many allies, as has been made clear in the talks today.**

>We can not say today what the final decision will be on the delivery of Leopard tanks. **At least I can't, you know how.** 

>However in my career I have made the experience that if you don't know how a decision will eventually look like you should at least prepare for everything. This means that when a decision is made - wether in 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 day - I want to be in the position to act quickly. [If a positive decision is made] it is necessary to train the crews, to check the tanks and more. 

>This is why this morning I ordered my [defence ministry] to conduct an examnination of Leopard 2 tanks in our forces as well as in industry stocks. We will especially take note of compatibility of our systems with those of our partners, the availability and the number [of tanks].""


Opinion: 

1. He does not look happy. He very much sounds and looks like somebody who wanted to give the ok but was stopped at the last second (Scholz I guess). 

2. I would be very much interested which majority of partners he is talking about here. 

3. IMO it is beyond time for nations who actually want to send tanks to Ukraine (and are not ""considering"" it or are merely posturing for domestic audiences) to actually put numbers on the table and in export requests. So far it is not even clear if one nation has done so, thus the pressure on Germany is basically nonexistent at this point. If however six or seven nations were to make export requests I cannot see Germany denying them. 

4. It is beyond a joke that such a study was not done already by Germany, just goes to show how useless the previous defence minister was. 

5. I highly doubt Germany has many Leopards available anyway and I doubt the numbers that can be donated by other nations even reach 100. The Poles are the only ones who named a specific number yet and it is quite low with 14. Which brings me back to a point I raised before - the US seriously has to consider Abrams because it seems as if they will be the only stable supply in numbers. And yes, I know the technical issues but if you want Ukraine to get 300 MBTs then it looks as if US stocks are the only option for now.",False,1674229635.0,t3_10gmws7,t3_10gmws7,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

As police quickly evacuated the building, **the local FSB explosives expert was called in to defuse the detonator; he determined that the sacks contained RDX, a explosive powerful enough to have brought the entire apartment building down**. In the meantime, roadblocks were established on all roads out of Ryazan, and a massive manhunt for the Zhiguli and its occupants got underway.
> 
> By the following afternoon, word of the incident in Ryazan had spread across Russia. Prime Minister Putin congratulated the residents on their vigilance, while the interior minister lauded recent improvements by the security forces, ""such as the foiling of the attempt to blowup the apartment building in Ryazan.""

Also, worth noting that Germany's government never hesitated to approve Rheinmetall's contract to build Russia's most advanced military training center in Mulino, supposedly created to train 30,000 soldiers a year. Presumably, thousands of Russians trained there have killed Ukrainians in this war.  


>The company has repeatedly said that sanctions against Russia would not have a major impact on its business because the combat training centre, its only major contract with the country, has been largely delivered and paid for.

Similarly, the German government enthusiastically approved the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, regardless of the reasonable security concerns of Eastern Europe.

In addition, the German and French governments blocked Ukraine's path to NATO membership in 2008, despite the U.S. support for Ukraine's application. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-idUSL0179714620080403](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-idUSL0179714620080403) Other former Soviet countries joined NATO without difficulties (for example, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, etc.)

Lastly, regarding the argument of history and guilt, here's a reminder of what Nazi Germany did to Ukraine: 

>Ukraine’s human and material losses during World War II were enormous. Some 5 to 7 million people perished. Even with the return of evacuees from the east and the repatriation of forced labourers from Germany, Ukraine’s estimated population of 36 million in 1947 was almost 5 million less than before the war. Because more than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages had been destroyed, 10 million people were left homeless. Only 20 percent of the industrial enterprises and 15 percent of agricultural equipment and machinery remained intact, and the transportation network was severely damaged. The material losses constituted an estimated 40 percent of Ukraine’s national wealth.

If I were to read between the lines I would think that it's not that they're refusing to send them, rather the tanks themselves are not ready to be sent and need to be prepared before it's announced. 

Even the whole Abrams thing seems to be an issue not of competence of the Ukrainians but of trying to keep these things fuelled in the field. They hit hard but they chug on fuel hard too. No point in sending them if they can't perform at their best. That being said I wonder if they might look down the line at sending some not to be sent to the front lines but to be deployed along the Northern Border to free up other hardware...

So, just maybe the meeting was about trying to either take advantage of the time we have to quash the Russian invasion before it escalates to a level we haven't seen in eighty years. 

Arguably at the rate Russia is committing people to the meat grinder, and the amount KIA everyday, it will be a while yet before more need to be mobilized, but if he wanted to use a ""surge"" tactic like the USA used in 06-08 to swing a losing war into his favor then more mobilized would have this very effect.

It's not really what they are doing. They send in troops to check Ukrainian positions and trigger arty and will they call in artillery of their own and do counter arty fire. Then they repeat that a lot. I do think Bakhmut is heavily fortified but this still causes a lot of attrition on Ukraine and might ruin the defensive positions with time. Soledar was less prepared which is why I think it fell faster as Ukraine pulled back to other defensive lines.

We don't know Ukraine's plan but I doubt it's to permanently hold the front at all costs but rather do so as long as it's effective. It does seem like Russia or Wagner was stubborn about Bakhmut expecting it to give way faster and might've wasted a lot of manpower on it but it's hard for us to measure their progress or the damage Russian arty is doing. Russian arty is not that flexible or accurate but they have a ton of it so if anything they like static targets.

So frankly most of Russia's success in the middle to current state of the war has been the situations they can have massed arty and wear down locations.

52121c4c00e78525fb48e852ef2cea22,10gmws7,j56199u,"I would say the two biggest advantages that the Abrams would have are actually not obvious.  First is the sensors and optics on the Abrams are amazing.  Both the gunner and the commander have independent access to excellent thermal imaging sights and can spot targets faster and at longer ranges than the Russians.  That means the Abrams shoots first, just like Han.  Throw in the networking between tanks that allow them to share information, it's almost like if you're spotted by one you've been spotted by the whole company.

The second and probably biggest factor in the Abrams success is crew training which obviously may NOT apply in the hands of Ukrainian forces in the short term.  Driving an Abrams around, practicing, shooting live rounds etc is an expensive proposition, and one that only the US can afford.  A lot of the success of American forces in Iraq was contingent on this.  None of the American tankers had been in combat before, but they had all practiced so goddamn much it didn't matter much.  

I think this is the biggest barrier to the Ukrainians using Western tanks like the Abrams.  It just takes a long time to learn how to fight well with them and that can only be shortened by so much.  Without that training and proficiency, a lot of the advantages of these vehicles go away.  We've already seen that the margin for error as a tanker is slim in Ukraine.

TLDR: bradleys and stykers are awesome, M1 Abrams is too logistic intensive right now in Ukraine's active warzone. 

TLDR Extended from things I've heard:

M1 Abrams require logistic support centers Ukraine can't manage right now. Basically, the amount of supply trucks necessary to support them would have to be pulled from other fronts. The Abrams is designed to be modular, so you need centralized repair centers and a whole logistics train of vehicles that can transfer these replacement parts and rearm these Tanks in situ. Doing this would take logistic trains from other fronts. It's easy to install these places in Iraq when the US has 20 years to do it, or in Egypt when they aren't at war with a near peer foe that can hit these targets. Here is a [reddit thread discussing this](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/10frwn1/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j52qmhe/).

Honestly I have no idea why people are jumping on Germany about those Leopards - for best part of last 50 years German defense was tied closely to NATO. You guys had some well trained people and small, but effective army. I understand that some statistics were just for show (we have such and such number of tanks for example) and in most cases you just had bare minimum to satisfy your NATO membership requirements. Weapons are expensive and in a country that despise war (some people cannot believe this) funds are better utilized supporting the economy. However if that information would be served as ""listen, we just have bare minimum ourselves, we are not comfortable with selling those tanks to Ukraine"" - no one would blame anyone. Gepards actually saved thousands of lives. Leopards are primarily offensive weapons. People just don't get it. Unfortunately some trolls don't care about Germany - they will exploit any single crack in NATO. Psyops will spin a bullshit wave based on even something that small. Don't worry about it. Ukraine needs help in any possible way - German people don't want offensive weapons sent there? No problem - send them some warm clothes. Or generators. 

On the other side what's now going on is a wake up call for NATO. Total number of tanks destroyed long time ago crossed the number of all tanks available in NATO. People started to notice things. Hence the panic.

And regarding PiS - don't worry about those morons. Morawiecki is actually a person that gave unlimited credit line to Russia, so Russia could buy Polish strategic industries and Polish cargo rail.

That obviously didn’t happen and Russia has been able to adapt their logistics to keep going. Certainly it is not perfect, but better than anticipated I would wager. Over the summer, Russia expended massive amounts of artillery munitions to compensate for their lack of manpower. Now that Russia has started conscription, they have manpower - but they lack the munitions. They are not going to run out, but they are going to have to be more selective.

Not necessarily true.  Ukraine very likely has forces deployed to swat anything coming from Belarus or Transniestra.  There is a concept called ""holding a strategic reserve"".  A general does not know where something will go wrong before the wrong happens.  Good generals respond to the crisis with the reserve that they held in reserve.  

It could greatly simplify Ukraine's supply lines if the most active combat units are using the familiar supply lines.  Freeing Ukraine to use all of its reserve T72 and T80 tanks would greatly increase their front line combat strength.

b373c764dac98fb6fc19b0f25219a24d,10gmws7,j54fuj6,"Partly it's Scholz as a character but mostly its just how politics in Germany works. Most of these delays and waiting for others to act first have domestic reasons founded in election cycles, coalition politics and bureocracy.

You really overestimate how much the average German voter (and therefore politician) care for international PR or something.

The basic problem is as follows:

Every year Germany has state level elections in some states which work as a constant version of the US midterms since those elections determine the composition of the upper house (the Bundesrat) . The Bundesrat is similar in function to the US Senate and is needed by the federal government for many legislative issues or they wont be able to govern effectively. Since Germany has a government out of parliament and no ""executive orders"" this is even more important here than in the US.

As a result Scholz is really averse to do anything too unpopular with the voters. And being a ""military leader"" is vastly unpopular hence the hesitation to be seen as the first in anything. Basically, assuming that there is the will to deliver tanks, he has to wait till the pressure is percieved to big that he can basically say to his electorate ""see my hand was forced by events"".

This goes for nearly all parties btw. with the excemption of maybe the Greens who have the most bellicose voters (ironically since they are a derivate from the 80s environment & peace movements).

The effect of this you saw yesterday.

Two things happend:

1. The French announced they might deliver MBTs. France different to the UK is basically the most respected country in defence and foreign policy in Germany, about as important as the US, and has been our closest partner in crime in most foreign policy for the last 20-30 years. Basically Germans trust them (except with our money).
2. New polls came out showing tacit support for the delivery of MBT (up to roughly 50% from about 35% a month ago).

As a result of this, immedeately the new defence secretary issued a statement saying that Leopards are still in the cards and the US delivery of MBTs s not a precondition. I am strongly suspecting that today the export order for Leos which came in yesterday (from Poland?) will be approved (or at  least a statment towards that will be made) and they will also state that deliberations on German tank deliveries will start too (i.e. how many we can spare at all).

Edit: Another fact which partially explains the perception of delay abroad is the political culture in which ""hasty"" and ""agressive"" polticians are not rewarded by the voters. To be seen deliberate and considering as well as not too outspoken is a trait highly valued by German voters. For an example of this, watch a German poltician from a main stream party give a speech. They are basically snooze fests compared to other countries. That is not because they are incapable of good speeches or that German is unsuited to such speeches, it is a very deliberate act so not to be percieved as too agressive or even worse be compared to the ""old way"" of German rethorics (i.e. Goebbels, Hitler, Willy II etc.).",1674206268.0,1674205863.0,t3_10gmws7,t1_j54co1q,,3,15,0,15,1,0,
6571fe800eef0977f723a268afc37697,10gmws7,j54i8eb,"I'm convinced the Germans are afraid of themselves. If they ever take the lead on this, if they seize the initiative and sign off on a massive armament of Ukraine with German tanks - that's the action of a great power. That's declaring that in the dispute between Ukraine and Russia, Germany takes the side of Ukraine and is making substantial moves to ensure Ukraine wins the war, because a Europe in which Russia is defeated and Ukraine victorious suits German national policy.

And that's scary. German national policy hasn't shaped the fates of nations in the wars of Europe since 1945. Ever since that time Germany has shied away from taking up the role of a great power, in shame for what they once were and fear that they might some day become such a horror again.

It's much easier for them if America goes first. If it is _American_ policy for Ukraine to win the war, and Germany just goes along with that and contributes in a smaller way to what America is already doing, then there's much less anxiety about their returning to the great power role. They're being a good little ally instead to an even greater power, and that's not remotely as frightening.

And that's why Britain isn't enough, and neither is Poland. Neither of these two have any qualms about stepping into the role of a great power; in Britain there's an urgent need to prove our continuing relevance after recklessly abdicating from the top tables of European power, and in Poland they aspire to a leadership role among the free nations on Europe's eastern borders, and both nations have it in for Russia. But neither of these are great enough for Germany to feel comfortable falling in behind them. Germany needs a _greater_ power to follow, if they're not to feel worried about returning to a position of leadership and even domination over others - and that greater power can only really be America.",False,1674207865.0,t3_10gmws7,t1_j54co1q,,3,10,0,10,0,0,

That applies to pretty much every NATO country as well (Canada for example). We do not have the support capability to keep Abrams running properly for a sustained period of time nor do we have all the necessary satellite, transport capability, and comms infrastructure that make it so effective.

The reason why NATO members use the leopard is that in the event of a full scale war, our combined leopard tank combat power (and all the support crap that goes along with it) would rival the tank combat power of the US alone. It reflects our doctrine and how NATO is structured. Canada would be accessing Polish, German, and Danish etc. maintenance and logistical networks while the US would be doing its own thing with the Abrams.

But the big advantage of the Leopard is that in non-NATO conflict situations, it can be operated and sustained at an individual country operational tempo that doesn't require international bases and the world's largest Airforce and navy to keep it running. It's the perfect solution for every NATO member that isn't the US. The trade off for that is it doesn't have all the capabilities something like the Abrams has but what a tank can do isn't as important as what a military can do and sustain during peace time and war time. 

The 2% GDP defence spending requirement is supposed to be the minimum level of spending we require in order to collectively be as strong as the US if we ever have to go to war as NATO.

**TL;DR**: the Leopard is designed to be operated by smaller nations that plug into a coalition of countries' support networks. Exactly Ukraine's situation.

The Abrams is based on the design philosophy of "" 'MURICA! FUCK YEAH"".

When a Leo2s diesel engine needs repair or maintenance, well, it's a diesel engine. More or less any diesel mechanic can work on it.

My understanding is that a good crew can replace a Leo2 engine in under an hour, the same cannot be said about an Abrams.

The US knows the differences between these two platforms, and they know that they can easily train a tank crew to drive and fight in an Abrams, and that there are a limited number of countries that can *properly* train a logistics team.

They also know that there are a [large number of Leo2 operators on the same continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2#Operators) as Ukraine that can train tank crews and also the logistics teams.

My suspicion is that this is the main issue, the countries that would donate Leo2s to 3CY are legion, and each operating country can train multiple crews and support teams simultaneously, meaning more teams getting trained at the same time, which results in *more tanks in Ukraine and quicker*.

In contrast, exports to the United States, the most important destination of German exports, increased by 30.9% to 14.4 billion euros. '

Exports to russia **currently make up a total of less than one percent** of Germanys exports and **before the war were at roughly 2%**.

Given, this is just a snapshot from November, but it's nowhere near your claimed 25%.

“What's the difference between an APC and an IFV?
The fundamental difference between an APC and IFV, is the role they are designed to serve. The CFE treaty stipulates an infantry fighting vehicle is an APC with a cannon in excess of 20 mm, and with this additional firepower the vehicle is more involved in combat, providing fire support to dismounted infantry.”

Strykers don’t just carry infantry like APCs. It’s a veeeeery simple difference.

IFVs are designed to sustain infantry and support them in direct engagements in high intensity conflict. Stryker is not designed to do that, its armor is too thin, it is not tracked and it lacks the staying power.
