Day 363-364 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a mostly quiet day, there was one missile strike that was aimed at Kupiansk, it hit some residential buildings and injured a civilian, but not much more happened. Today there was yet another missile strike, but this one was aimed at Kharkiv. It wasn’t exactly unexpected as the air raid alert was active at the time, but it was active because we were expecting Shaheds, which could have been decoys as we never heard about any of them entering our airspace after they were apparently launched. 

They fired 4 S-300 missiles from Belgorod at 10:30am, all of them did make it to their targets whatever they might be, the explosions were very loud and our windows were shacking yet again. From the reports we know that they were targeting our industrial infrastructure, and that 2 people were injured, but nothing else was specified. They didn’t target our energy infrastructure this time, as there were no power outages after the strikes.

The new Putin’s speech was so underwhelming, especially after Peskov said that this speech “will be studied by everyone”. What is there to study? He talked for so long, but said so little, literally nothing new was said, just more complaining about “The West” and how they are attacking the “poor little Russia” with Satan himself. And of course, how can we forget about how “the decadent west is trying to make god gender neutral”. What the fuck is he even talking about? The only new thing that he said was that they are withdrawing from the START treaty, but that didn’t exactly surprise anyone, it was just another nuclear threat that everyone is already sick of.",False,1677110970.0,t3_118of6g,t3_118of6g,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

First of all, I want to thank mods and commentors for these live threads. Over the last year, these have become the main source of information for me (and many others). These active threads have helped me in understanding the tragedy of this war and identifying the misinformation.

Even with the help of automated tools, it is not easy to remain consistent. Many people here have worked hard to priorities reality and facts. So, thank you all for providing stories of sacrifice, courage and resilience.

Having said that, I have another agenda for this comment. I am a beginner in data analysis and I am analysing one year of these live threads. But, I am unable to find URL /ID of 14 of these posts.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 February 2023  


* On 21 February 2023, President Putin made his first State of the Nation speech since 2021. He made it clear that he intends to continue with the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine.  

* He characterised Western elites as having “become a symbol of total unprincipled lies” and suspended Russia from the New START treaty.  

* Putin continued the bellicose tone he has adopted in speeches over the last six months but did not reveal any practical measures which might relieve Russia’s current deadlock on the battlefield.  

* Putin continues to present a contradictory narrative of existential struggle, while insisting everything in Russia is fine and going to plan. This renders both messages ineffective.

A year into the war, thousands of them are dead.

We do not know the precise number of dead, though it is more than a quarter of a million. Unmoved by the losses on his own side, much less on Ukraine's, Putin has sent his minions to the provinces to scoop up more human material for the meat grinder of his war. And what of his strategic mastery? For years, the Kremlin leadership advertised the modernization of its post-Soviet military and the sophistication of its ""asymmetric"" fighting doctrine. But every credible analyst of the invasion has been stunned by the scale of Putin's folly — the miserable planning and poor intelligence, the lack of training and logistics, and the lawlessness of his officer corps. His strategy, it turned out, was of the most primitive and criminal variety: deliberately targeting civilian structures — schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, power plants, bridges. In Bucha, Kherson, Izyum, and elsewhere, Russian forces and mercenaries have carried out acts of torture, which journalists and human rights organizations have documented.
>
> Putin's failure extends well beyond the battlefield. He has isolated Russia from much of the world, undermining its reputation, economy, and prospects. Hundreds of thousands of Russians — often the best and the brightest in tech, academia, and the arts — have left the country. With Putin's most compelling political opponent, Alexey Navalny, languishing in a prison camp and independent media outlets shuttered, it may seem that Putin has secured the bovine indifference of all his subjects. And yet there are signs of disaffection: protests and individual acts of defiance reported on Telegram and other social media. One of the top-selling books of the past year in Russia is George Orwell's dystopian novel ""1984."" Not long after the invasion, police in Ivanovo arrested two people handing out free copies on the street. Sales are so high, and the implications so obvious, that Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry, felt compelled to reject the notion that the novel resembles Putin's rule in any way. ""In school, we were drilled that Orwell was describing the horrors of totalitarianism,"" she said. ""This is one of those global fakes."" Instead, the novel ""depicted how liberalism would lead humanity to a dead end.""  
>  
>Although the anniversary of Putin's invasion is a moment to pay solemn tribute to the dead and celebrate Ukraine's astonishing resilience, it cannot be one of heedless overconfidence. This is a war that could go on for a very long time. As Dara Massicot, an expert on the Russian military, writes in the latest Foreign Affairs issue, ""The Russian armed forces are not wholly incompetent or incapable of learning."" Her article deftly anatomizes Russia's failures but also goes into alarming depth about how the military leadership can call on hundreds of thousands of recruits and better exploit the resources of a vast country to inflict incredible pain on Ukraine. Crucially, Putin seems not to care about casualties in his ranks. Just recently, hundreds of his soldiers were, according to a leading Russian officer, killed ""like turkeys at a shooting range"" in the town of Vuhledar, in eastern Ukraine. Putin responded laconically to the debacle. He said his 155th Marine Brigade was ""performing as it should.""  
>  
>One of the many gifts that Zelensky and the Ukrainian people have provided in the past year is the example of their courage and sanity. In the most heroic terms, they have drawn the line against delusion. Putin told Ukraine that it is not a nation. Ukraine has given its response. As Orwell wrote in his novel, ""There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.""

[Also it will allow Russian commander in Mariupol to demand more resources there.] She warns to stay away from such places.

2. A lot of telegram channels have reported that “liquidation of Wagner PMC by russian mod hs started” - I believe this conflict will get violent, it will not be limited to not supplying ammo. Wagner will try to take what they can. (They have no choice)

3. Solovyov and other russian propagandists say that on 23rd, as a “gift” for putin by Biden, Zelensky and Sandu, UAF will occupy Transnistria (TRANSNISTRIA, NOT MOLDOVA!!, or only the ammo depot, not sure, anyway, with thr approval of Moldova, or on our request). 
Solovyov says there is an unusual concentration of Ukrainian forces near Transnistria.

I’m from Moldova - mixed feelings about it. But it aligns with a lot of what has been going on (russian threats to overthrow our government, to occupy the airport and so on)

Upd: TRANSNISTRIA, NOT MOLDOVA, I get that most of the people have limited knowledge, but asking “why would Ukraine attack moldova” when I clearly said Transnistria is like asking why would Ukraine attack Crimea or DNR.

They were jealous, but they understood that not everyone would be given such a supply and he would give such a result as they did. The result doesn't just come from quantity...

Now the supply guys have become like everyone else, and the most depressing is not that they have been relegated to general norms, but that these general norms do not allow to give the desired result. At the same Vuhledar, before the offensive, the army reduced the daily consumption to a minimum in order to accumulate a supply at least for the first day of the offensive.

China-Russia relations have reached ""new milestones"", according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said after speaking with China's top diplomat Wang Yi that ties are ""progressing and developing"". Putin also says that they have arranged a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Wang has told Putin in the conversation that relations between Moscow and Beijing are equal and will not ""sink under pressure from third parties"". The United States and NATO expressed concern last week about possible Chinese arms transfers to Russia, which has been isolated on the world stage since the invasion of Ukraine.

About a year ago, just before Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi and Putin signed a ""borderless"" partnership. Since then, China has largely kept aloof from the war, much to the frustration of the West, which hopes Xi will use his clout to convince Putin to end the invasion. Russia is increasingly dependent on China due to all Western sanctions.

Last week, Wang said Beijing plans to come up with a peace proposal soon. This has been met with skepticism, because giving up land for Kiev is currently out of the question. Wang says China wants to play a ""constructive role"" in resolving the crisis. The Kremlin credits Beijing for its efforts and ""balanced approach"". Russia welcomes China's ""positive role"" and is eager to continue cooperating on security issues.

A possible visit by Xi to Moscow could be related to a peace proposal. Putin also announced in December that he expects to receive Xi, but such a trip has not yet been confirmed from Beijing. An Italian minister said last week that Xi will deliver a speech on peace on Friday, a year after the Russian invasion.",False,1677083037.0,t3_118of6g,t3_118of6g,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3306506/deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-sabrina-singh-holds-a-press-briefing/

There's not much specifically about Ukraine; a lot about China, China and Russia, and, of course, about the balloons.

Confirmed that Russia gave the US a heads-up before their missile test, so that level of communication is still good. Putin does NOT want a nuclear war over a misunderstanding, which I think is a good sign.

I do want to point out one particular exchange here - questioner is Liam Cosgrove of Epoch Times, which seems to be a far-right newspaper (according to Wikipedia). He was really pushing this idea that the US and Russia should be negotiating behind Ukraine's back, 'for the benefit of Ukraine's citizens'.

>MS. SINGH: We currently maintain the lines of communication. As you just saw, the White House reached out to Russia to alert them about the president's visit to Kyiv. We maintain open lines of communications. The ICBM test that was just launched over the weekend by Russia, we were notified through the New START Treaty process that they were going to test the ICBM.  
 
>So it's not that we've closed off communication. We welcome communication with Russia.  
 
>Q: Well (but ?) they have asked to speak with Biden without Ukraine's presence, and I know we want to involve Ukraine, but couldn't we go to that meeting and speak on Ukraine's behalf, maybe without them being there? Just to ease the tensions in some way.  

>MS. SINGH: No. There's nothing -- as the president has said, nothing -- there's nothing that's going to happen with Ukraine without Ukraine. We're not going to have singular conversations with Russia about the war in Ukraine. It is Ukraine who is the most impacted, it is Ukraine's civilians who are being killed on the battlefield and in cities. Ukraine has every right to be part of any conversation, whether it's with us and (Russia ?), but we would not have a conversation about the war without Ukraine.  

>Q: (inaudible) help their citizens, us doing this, wouldn't that be something to entertain?  
 
>MS. SINGH: Well how -- we don't know that it'd help their citizens. Again, I'm not going to engage in a hypothetical question.

China shares similar ideology as Russia about western power ""controlling"" the world, however the power balance between China and Russia drastically changed after the invasion. And this happened because Russia proved to be a terrible military ally compared to what everyone had in mind. 

Whatever they thought about having Russian on their side, now China knows the gap between Russian army and NATO is just huge. So they probably figured out that being involved in a bigger war would be terrible for their business, even more since Russia is not as strong as anyone imagined prior the invasion. 

Putin with few moves showed that his army is not strong, and despite his huge resources it's a mess. Then with this invasion helped european countries to be all on the same page and made it possible to Finland to be soon a NATO member. So he failed his plan, showed how bad his army is and his decisions lead NATO to get bigger and stronger. Putin leverage on gas and oil failed too. 

So that's what China is looking at the moment. Their begger ally fooled them. China wants to protect its economy and there are zero reasons to get involved in a war. They will probably give some type of help by I guess they won't put too much effort in a war Russia is doomed to lose. And after the war Russia will be weaker and that's ok for China.

Thread ""XXVI"" (26) is actually ""XXIV"" (24) but the title has a typo that rolled on towards the others. This means two Roman numbers were inadvertently skipped in process due to human error and likely sleep deprivation.
This means thread ""XXIV"" and ""XXV"" do not exist because of the typo but they're actually the links on Part 10 and Part 11.

The Roman numerals were abandoned because most users can't read them as easily and they eventually become a pita after a certain point.

I think a lot of the confusion and misnumbering from around that time (the 26th) is because we were discussing changing over to regular boring numbers while in an extremely sleep deprived state (I spent like, half my income on Monster that month). Also, we were switching over to the bot, and some of us deleted stuff we'd manually posted because we missed that the bot was active, and we were trying to change to regular numbers in a way where it wouldn't become a meme or a joke because thousands of people were dying.

Anybody been able to get a somewhat accurate count on the number of bodies in that picture? It seems to be like 50 something bodies? This would add up to at least an additional 150 wounded daily when using the 1:3 ratio, just for Wagner alone.

[5 days ago, the US came out with the estimate that over 9000 Wagner troops have been killed since the beginning of the war with half of those since December.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/white-house-wagner-group-has-suffered-over-30000-casualties-ukraine-2023-02-17/)

If the amount of dead in that picture, give or take 50, would be an average day for Wagner since the first of december, then that would come down to around 4000 deaths in total.

He has fallen out of grace, as can be seen from several actions by the Kremlin

First they banned him from recruiting prisoners, which is the deathblow for the Wagner group, because they uses them as cannon fodder to serve as a shield for his troops and to reveal Ukrainian positions and now the Kremlin doesn't seem to be providing them with ammunition either.

He has made many enemies.  The Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the FSB and the Justice Department, big business and governors, not to mention the Presidential Administration and the State Department.

The intelligence services in particular aren't thrilled that he's recruiting prisoners and even see it as a threat, which is understandable.  The prisoners will most likely not have a good opinion of the Russian state and possibly some of them will also be political opponents who have been imprisoned.  Now you give them weapons and some military training.  It's even worse when they really are mass murderers who have been in prison for a good reason.  

Who can guarantee that they won't secretly run away with assault rifles and grenades and wreak havoc in Russia?  

Every intelligence  service would be against it, no matter whether in a dictatorship or a democratic state (example: the German intelligence service would also not be enthusiastic, if right-wing extremists, „Reichsbürger“ and murderers were suddenly equipped with military grade weapons and received military training.).

In short: Many want to see him and the Wagner Group dead.

He also just wanted too much.  

Prigoschin aspired more than Putin gave him credit for.  

For Putin, a mercenary force is a kind of equipment inherent in any government with geopolitical ambitions.  But it must act without initiative, solely within the framework of state interests.  No unnecessary publicity, total subordination, no own political agenda - in this form mercenary troops are needed.

The Wagner boss did the opposite.  Not only has he become a public figure, he is developing into a full-fledged politician with his own very revolutionary views.

Their early-war goal of entering Kyiv seemed achievable, and it didn't seem clear how well the Ukrainians were going to do fighting in the field. The Ukrainians didn't seem ready--almost like they were trying to hope their way into not getting invaded. 

But the weaknesses of the Russians started to show immediately. They were roadbound, much like the French in Vietnam. Their equipment was frequently rendered combat ineffective because they had failed to do even the most basic maintenance. The moment the most senior officer on scene died, the entire formation fell apart. The Aerospace Forces turned out to be totally incapable of doing anything other than murdering civilians. 

The Ukrainians were the opposite. TDF troops fought bravely and tenaciously. Ukrainian artillery was professional, effective, and exceptionally well allocated. They contested the skies and husbanded their air units, whose pilots fought valiantly. They corroded Russian forces on the ground and deep behind the lines. Their command was innovative, rational, and opportunistic. And Zelensky turned himself into a Churchillian; the man who told the world they would not only survive, but win.

However, once they're gone, I think normalizing relations is in the best interest of encouraging regime change and fostering the faint hope of liberal democracy slowly taking hold. 

If Russia is forced out without normalization, then Putin (or whichever hardcore nationalist blames, defenestrats, and replaces him) will be able to keep using ""the West"" as an enemy to blame all Russian problems on, and to keep the population in line out of fear of the outside enemy. 

Defanging that argument maximizes the chances of Russians getting tired of irredentist strong men failing to fix internal problems. That increases the chance that somebody a bit more moderate comes in and says ""let's fix corruption in our own back yard and focus on making people's lives better"". That moderate (by Russian standards) leader may do a little less to squash civic society, NGOs, and actual opposition parties. A slight opening up might encourage liberal democracy to slowly grow and become a real force in Russia.

Is the above all that likely? Still no. Russia has a deeply engrained and deeply toxic political culture. But our chances are best if we don't hand the Russian people somebody to blame (us) on a silver platter.

Would it be better if we could get Russia to agree to reparations? Of course. But unless Putin is overthrown by a legit anti-war leader (nearly impossible, his greatest threats are other strongmen who don't think he's strong enough), or Russia is invaded itself and the government is forced or overthrown (which means nuclear war), thatll never happen.

Edit: minor update - so far I was able to find this:

The few thousand pro-Russian troops would have to do all of this knowing there would be zero reinforcements behind them whilst Moldova could, theoretically, call upon tens or hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers (not that it would require that many) as well as Ukrainian tanks, aircraft, etc.

Even a couple of Ukrainian Su-25s for a single afternoon would seriously put paid to most efforts that the Transnistrian rebels / Russian forces could muster.

That's however not how it works. Running out, means that the rate of acquisition and production is lower than the rate of consumption. Which means they'll run out of their stockpiles eventually if they don't reduce their consumption. And when they do run out of stockpiles it simply means that they can now only use as much as they can acquire and produce.

For example there are certain missiles they produce only about 40-50 of on a yearly basis. If they shoot about a hundred every week or so, they'll run out of their stockpiles rather quickly. But it doesn't mean they can't fire them anymore, but that they can only fire about 40-50 every year instead.

And that's if they don't simply reduce consumption rate as their stockpiles decrease, thus stretching them out further. Now it takes longer for them to run out.

Once Putin has stated his desire, you don't get the chance to ask for clarifications, or try to compromise. All the while, officials at every step are looking to extract what they can for personal benefit.

So, Putin says to his Ministry of Defence ""I need a hundred thousand more troops"" without specifying from where or whom, and instructs the government to designate a hundred million roubles for making it happen. 

The Ministry of Defence guy pockets 20 million, goes to the komissars and tells them to go out and find a hundred thousand more troops with 80 million roubles. The komissars all pocket 20 million between them, and pass on the menial tasks of meeting quotas with 60 million roubles to their assistants, who are not uncommonly untrained, understaffed, and incompetent paper-pushers. 

Everyone from Putin down to the komissars would know implicitly that police are off limits for conscription. But these unskilled grunts that get given a task without details, just told to ""find people"", don't necessarily know that. Add in the aforementioned corruption, and you've got a system that is perpetually broken. Ever since the first mobilization, there has been constant reports of the wrong people getting summoned, including people who are deaf, blind, ninety years old, nine years old, or outright dead.

The original sin here is their inability to escape the ideology of the Mao era, even after Deng and Hu actually did make strides to decouple modern china from those ideological chains.  
  
Xi's faction fundamentally believes that China is an ascendent power which will inevitably replace the western alliance, but they seem to fundamentally misunderstand the tools of western hegemony.  It is the same misreading of Marxist theory which has plagued China (and the USSR) for decades - they see the inherent historical determinism as a dogmatic inevitability; it is a straight and obvious path for them to follow, rather than a chaotic connection between two points in history.  
  
This informs a kind of diplomatic maximalism which has recently been ruled by a single overarching premise - that Chinese ascendence *must* be orthogonal to western decline.  Chinese scholars have spent decades filling libraries describing how the tools of western power are designed to keep China subjugated.  This obviously ignores the very clear facts that China's economic miracle has been built largely on foreign investment, but the real miscalculation here is projecting their own deterministic view of history onto western actions and motivations.  It's an academic gravity well from which they cannot escape, because doing so would require them to admit that their models for global power are flawed, and have been for nearly a century.  
  
The reality is that anyone with eyes, ears and a handful of functioning brain cells can see plainly that China could easily supplant the US within the current frameworks of global power if it chose to.  Anyone with a mild appreciation for East Asian history could see that the path Xi is on is same stubborn ruinous path Mao pursued for decades.  Anyone who has been to China should understand that Chinese people are happy and healthy and modern - they are largely unconcerned with Xi's dogma.

Its the problem with what fundamentaly Russian, and Russian are. They an empire. And Russians are people of the empire. They want their empire to expand. They want to win wars. They want all post soviet countries to be returned to them. They deny that Russia and Soviet Union did any wrong, and if they are pointed towards the atrocities - they will allways say ""west did it also"", or just say ""it was a right thing"". 

There is no understanding or retrospective on mistakes of Russian past. They do not think that Russian Empire or Soviet Union was wrong, they only sad that they have collapsed. 

So naturally majority of Russians (the 100+ millions you mentioned) see no wrong with what Russia have done in Moldova, Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, or Ukraine. To them it was all justified. 

Just like occupation of Baltic states was justified. Just like how winter war was justified, just like how they nearly 100 years AFTER the WW2 still ignore that Soviet Union HELPED Nazies and attacked Poland. 

If you had the chance and speak with these 100 millions of Russians and learn their views on this matter - they would shock you. I mean what sane individual can think that USSR was right in attacking Finland? Or attacking Poland? What sane individual can support genocide in Chechnya, or annexing land from Ukraine? 

But Russian DO support it. They justify it, they celebrate it. They are proud of it. Just as they are proud of their invasion in Hungary, Czechia, to ""secure order"". They are using the same old shitty lies to fit in to their justification of all of these unjust and criminal wars, and they still support them. Why? Because Russia can do no wrong. Someone else is always to blame. Because if they do not support the official view - they need to accept and take responsibility and see what the actual monster Russia is, and always was. 

I am not asking you to ""loathe them"", i am asking people in the west to finally OPEN their eyes and see what Russians are. They are  a people of an empire. People who are glad that Russia is expanding, that Russias borders are ""enlarging"". 

Entire world moved away from ""redrawing borders"" and ""enlarging"" their empires. Entire world did, but not Russia, or Russians. 

If you watched the video, western journalist in question speaks with many Russian figures, and ignores that these Russian “Dissidents” as he called them actually supported annexation of Crimea. They did not voiced a lot of stuff about what Russia was doing pre this big war (and there was a lot to talk about). They were absolutely FINE with what Russia was doing, BEFORE they felt consequences that impacted them in person. And even still, a lot of them lie and harbors old views, and only hides them because they have to stay in the west to keep their quality of life. 

Because Russia remains an empire, and many Russians are embracing it, dreaming of an “ideal, good Russia”. Problem is – that according to many of them, Russia was fine with what they did in Georgia, Crimea or even Donbass. It had “legitimate reasons” to do so. They still view past Russian action as “justified”, instead rethinking and realizing what monster Russia was all this time. 

There is NO way for Russia, or Russians move forward and get rid of this genocidal Empire mentality, if they do not understand or accept that their actions are wrong. And if they cannot see and admit and learn from wrongs Russia committed 100 years ago, they are sure as fuck will not learn and see anything now after this war ends.

And this is the part that i do not see how it can be changed or helped. It required TWO generations after defeat and total occupation of Germany after WW2. Only then they realized that what they have done is wrong, and managed to get rid of their NAZI mentality and combat it effectively. They spit on Marlene Dietrich in 1960 ffs. And it will be even harder to make Russians see how wrong they are. Because I do not think we can occupy Russia, and I do not think Russians are interested in seeing and admitting, and repenting to their mistakes.",1677089361.0,1677089122.0,t3_118of6g,t1_j9kjqs3,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

Part of it was Putin saw his own fate when he watched those videos. We know his paranoid KGB mind sees democracy and freedom as tools used by America and the CIA to topple dictators.  

So when Putin saw the [Euromaidan protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) in Ukraine back in 2014 he freaked out. His paranoid mind saw democracy coming too close to the Kremlin, for if the Russian people saw freedom and democracy was actually working for the Ukrainians then they may want it too. To make matters worse, Hillary Clinton publicly voiced support for the protesters and for democracy. To Putin that confirmed his worst fears.  

Russia ordered a very harsh crack down on the protesters. I believe they even had snipers killing the protesters.  

It doesn't excuse him in any way shape or form but this fear of democracy Putin has is believed to be part of the reason for the current war.  

He wants to kind of put the Soviet Union back together. He sees the fall of the Soviet Union as a major weakness, a humiliation of Russia. He wants his puppets installed in those lands. He *desperately* wants the power, respect and prestige of being a mighty world leader on par or greater than the American presidents.  

He also wants to be rich and powerful. We know that Putin is heavily linked to the Russian mafia. It is believed he's also a very big player in the organised crime narcotics trade. Might makes right. Powerful people take, they do not ask. That's his macho view.  

But most of all, in his paranoid KGB mind he wants to live yet another day as a tyrant, as a dictator. So to do that he cannot allow any weaknesses such as freedom or democracy to be used as weapons by America and the CIA to topple him.

But generally speaking you make a good point It's not that russia is going to wake up one day and have zero shells and give up, it's that they will (and maybe have got to a point) where they realise they are headed for a crunch, their stockpiles are running out and their defence industry isn't replacing them, and need to slow down usage to of their stockpile- maybe to give them  exhausted and they need to rely on new manufacturing to cover their use. That same scenario is potentially being repeated in a bunch of different logistical areas and in a society as sclerotic and brain drained as russia I doubt very much they are going to be able to solve the supply crunch.

For me the most interesting question is their capacity to ramp up production of things like artillery shells let alone more complicated items.

The US is trying to do the same thing at the moment at places like the Scranton plant but it has an enormous technological edge when it comes to  high end precision manufacturing. It will take time, but there is no doubt at all they will be able to increase production by huge margins, they have the equipment and  know how and they have no sanctions to contend with- its simply a matter of scale.

The problem for Russia is when it comes to machine tools, whilst China produces lot by volume most of the world's very high end manufacturing equipment, and the technical ability to service that equipment when it breaks is in Germany and Japan, and they sure as shit aren't helping. In any sort of heavy manufacturing process things are constantly breaking because of the high temperatures and tolerances involved, so machines need servicing and replacing at an extraordinary rate.

 It is why the current political dance between Moscow/Beijing/Washington is so interesting, by the second half of 2023 I think russia is  going to need Chinese manufacturing to keep this war going.",1677115274.0,1677050000.0,t3_118of6g,t1_j9incd2,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

In the future, we will see some units (the lucky ones) using BMP-3 (late 80s design), that are still in production, but not enough to replace the losses of other BMP types.

(The modern, designated replacement T-15, based on the Armata tank, is a paper tiger, that only shows up in parades.)

Even reporters were saying that they didn't expect the plan to have any meaningful details as they didn't think that was its true purpose.  

Western leaders quickly, and rather vocally, publicly responded their commitment. Some spelt out what they would need to see in a real peace plan, such as Russian forces being removed from Ukraine.  

As for the west and south though, that's a bit more problematic as many southern nations are dependent on China's investments through their Belt and Road scheme.  

As one diplomat put it, they don't want to sell themselves to China but as western investors have recently been pulling out and raising interest rates in the current economic climate it leaves southern countries with no alternative but to work with the only country who is willing to help, which is China.  

Southern countries depend on those investments to make ends meet. The cost of grain and fertiliser production (which is dependent on cheap fossil fuels) has got so high that a diplomat said one country is having to subsidise the cost for farmers. That in turn puts a massive burden on their already tight budgets. As if that were not bad enough, climate change is also causing them problems.  

Just recently some western leaders were quite candid in saying that they didn't do enough to keep their southern counterparts informed of what's going on and explain why the grain and fossil fuels are so hard to come by and so very expensive. Having world leaders admit to diplomatic failures so candidly isn't that common.  

This where China comes in to it.  

If western nations need votes in the UN from their southern counterparts it puts the southern nations in a difficult position. They really cannot afford to have anything happen to the Chinese investments.

Ever since Russia's conflict with Ukraine, there has been growing distress in Moldova for the Cobasna ammunition depot, with some believing that the weapons there could be used in a potential future military conflict. **Additionally, the Academy of Sciences of Moldova determined that an explosion of the weapons located in the ammunition depot, which passed their expiry date long ago, would be equivalent to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[2] Concern for such an event increased following the 2020 Beirut explosion**.[1]

Certainly it was a dumb idea in retrospect (and even at the time) to put so much energy dependence on Russia. That gave them all the leverage with not much to be done on Europe's side. 

I think the problem is that they were dealing with Putin just like he was another popularly elected European leader when he is clearly a dictator who doesn't agree with the European consensus. 

I think China had been doing a great job with soft power up until Pooh got into power. He's now using the hard power cudgel so violently that nobody is viewing China favorably at this point.

The ammunition is a mixture of small arms rounds and artillery shells, most of it is of WW2 vintage or 1950s vintage, all of it is expired. It has been stored questionably for at least 30 years and probably longer. Given the age of the depot, a lot of the artillery shells will be the obsolete 122mm for the retired M1938/M-30 howitzer used by the Red Army in WW2, not the 1960s-onwards 152mm Soviet howitzers Ukraine uses today. Ukraine supposedly has a very small stock, around 100, of the early 1960s D-30 howitzer that is in 122mm but this is only a small part of their artillery makeup. In comparison, Russia claims to have 4500 of them. Essentially, Ukraine has little need for a stockpile of 122mm artillery shells, especially in poor condition.

The stored small arms are probably obsolete rifles (MN M44, SKS, original unmodernised AK-47s) and equally obsolete against body armour wearing Ukrainian forces SMGs (PPSh-41s, PPS-42/43s). The latter might be useful for Russia in fighting TDF or for controlling a civilian population. To Ukraine who have access to way more modern weapons, they're basically a curiosity. Maybe a few PPS could be issued to rearguard/TDF drivers and vehicle crews and free up AK pattern carbines, but that's about all they'd get from that side of things.

In a nutshell, the contents are likely to be more valuable to Russia because they still actually have the artillery calibre in mainstream service and because they have fewer external sources from which to resupply. For Ukraine the main value is in denying those resources to the Russians, even if they actually turn out to be unserviceable that's still energy Russia will have expended trying to recover them.",False,1677112019.0,t3_118of6g,t1_j9m9fx5,,7,4,0,4,0,0,

He was also pretty obsessed with making missiles. Those infamous SCUDs that were pushing closer and closer to hitting any location in Middle East. And this increased range wasn't a result of ingenious engineering, but making warhead smaller and fuel tank bigger. So it was genuine concern that Iraqis would switch to unconventional warheads to keep them effective. They were getting to a point where their SCUD derivatives could cover 500+ miles, yet didn't have accuracy to hit anything smaller than Manhattan and had explosive charge equivalent of two M39 GLMRS rocket fired from HIMARS. He turned a rubbish short range ballistic missile that USSR intended to use for nuclear attacks into a pure terror weapon that could land anywhere except what the crew was aiming at.
