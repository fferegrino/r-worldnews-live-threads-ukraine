It is a significant blow to Russia.

Day 4 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today was the most intense day in my district yet, in the morning after I woke up my grandma said she has seen light armored vehicle on the road right beside our apartment building, it had an “X” on it, apparently it means that they were from Chechen battalion, just one kilometer away from me there was a whole column of russian forces, there’s still one of their destroyed vehicles left close to the subway.

The fighting inside city was really intense, sound of russian Grads was almost deafening, it was really scary, when the sound continues for almost 2 minutes straight you just end up hoping the stray missile doesn’t get to you home, as there’s not much else you can do, it’s an absolute state of helplessness.

We didn’t go outside today as it was way too dangerous. Luckily my district is mostly unharmed outside of destroyed russian vehicles left in the streets and for the last 4-5 hours everything was mostly quiet.

Tomorrow though we have to go the store as we don’t have any drinking water left, tap water ended up being worse than expected it’s really muddy, yellowish color and it doesn’t even quench your thirst, it’s almost like sea water but instead of being salty it’s full of chemicals.

We are not sure if there’s anything left in the stores but today we still saw people going back to their homes with full bags and water bottles, hopefully there’s at least something, water, beer, cola, wine, anything will work, really. Russian forces are also looting our stores, which is just horrible as there’s not enough food for civilians as is.

And the more we talk with our friends and family from Russia the more distant we become and this is an EXTREMELY common sentiment among people living in Ukraine, it’s like russians suddenly all joined a hive mind  became the same exact person saying the same exact phrases – “just wait a bit, everything will be alright, we will liberate you”. 

They are also blaming US for making THEM invade US, what the fuck, when we tell them that we are constantly sitting under shelling with a very real risk of death they are telling us how it’s also bad for them, they are “depressed” and they can’t go for a vacation. Fucking depressed, people here are dying here and you people are depressed and want to go for a vacation? They are looking at our situation as if it was just a show for them to watch.

It’s becoming more and more absurd, yesterday on their official news they said that we are using, and I shit you not – “Bandera Automobiles” HUH?!?!??!?!? What the fuck are they smoking, and what fuck is a “Bandera Automobile” and why haven’t I got mine yet? After all we Ukrainians are using them all the time apparently. Well, how else could they say we are nazis without saying we are nazis, right?

Seriously look for yourselves, you can’t make this shit up there’s the link to an excerpt from their official speech that someone uploaded https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgxql4WcfZ8

I don’t even know what to think at this point but their news is just a goldmine for memes, their writer was definitely high when he thought of the name “Bandera Automobile”. That gave us the much needed laugh, but left us wondering how someone can believe this shit.

And also sorry for not responding to personal chats, I just prefer to do my updates in bulk, but I do appreciate everyone for worrying about us nonetheless.

Here are Sunday’s top headlines on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine:

Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. The US condemned the order and said Putin was “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”.

Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but “let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance.”

Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands as Russia has faced a series of military setbacks. Satellite images are showing a 3.25 mile-long convoy of Russian troops headed toward Kyiv.

The EU will purchase weapons for Ukraine. Multiple European countries are offering military aid to Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion, including Sweden, which hasn’t sent weapons to a country in armed conflict since the Soviet Union’s 1939 invasion of Finland.

The EU also plans to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, including the private jets of Russian oligarchs, and ban Russian-state backed television channels RT and Sputnik

The UN security council has called for an emergency special session of the general assembly in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the council has made such a request.

The UN refugee agency has said more than 368,000 people have fled Ukraine into neighboring countries. Up to 4 million people could become refugees if the situation continues to worsen, the UN said.
Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system.

The World Health Organization warned thousands of lives are at risk by falling Ukrainian oxygen supplies.

Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken” by the war and appeared to take direct aim at Putin by condemning people who “trust in the diabolic and perverse logic of weapons”.

The UK will send an additional £40m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while the US said it is sending nearly $54m (£40m) in new humanitarian aid

Ukraine’s deputy defense minister Hanna Malyar claimed Russian forces have lost about 4,300 servicemen, a figure it was not possible to independently verify.

Russian police detained more than 1,400 people at anti-war protests on Sunday, an independent monitoring organization said, lifting the tally for crackdown arrests to over 4,000.

[Russian advance slowed by Ukrainian resistance and logistical setbacks, U.S. defense official says](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-invasion-russian-advance-resistance/)

> The Russian forces invading Ukraine have faced more resistance than the U.S. believes Russia anticipated, a senior defense official said Sunday morning. The Russian forces have advanced toward three cities, including Kyiv, **but have not yet captured a city since invading**. 

> ""The Ukrainians are putting up a very stiff and brave and heroic resistance, but we are only in Day Four, and I would be reluctant to provide an estimate of how many more days there are and what those days are going to look like,"" the senior defense official said. 

> The U.S. Defense Department estimates **about two-thirds of the combat power Russia had arrayed around Ukraine's borders have now been committed inside Ukraine**. That leaves **about one-third that have yet to enter the country, which is a significant amount of power still at the ready**. 

> The Russian advances on both Kharkiv and Kyiv have been slowed by fuel and logistical shortages and by the stiff and ""creative"" resistance by the Ukrainians, according to the official. 

> **The Russian advance forces are still about 30 kilometers outside of Kyiv**. There are indications that **some reconnaissance elements are inside Kyiv's city center putting up a fight** but the main forces are still 30 kilometers away, which is about where the forces were on Saturday too. 

> **One change that concerns U.S. officials is the first indications the Russians are adopting siege tactics in Chernihiv**, on the way to Kyiv, for a full out effort to capture it. **The Russians have started firing rockets, which are imprecise weapons, inside the city** that risk hitting civilian infrastructure. 

> On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir **Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert** in response to statements by Western countries and NATO. The senior defense official said the move was ""unnecessary and escalatory"" since Russia is not under threat by NATO or Ukraine. 

> Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of Putin's decision from his announcement, the defense official said. Putin's announcement  came just before Austin hosted an operations and policy synchronization meeting attended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, combatant commanders, as well as senior policy leaders. The leaders discussed Putin's announcement during the meeting. 

> **The Russian invasion into Ukraine advances along three lines of assault**. One, north to south, from Belarus towards Kyiv. Another, northeast to south, towards Kharkiv. And a third from the South towards central Ukraine. **The southern advance has forked**, with some Russian forces headed northwest towards Kherson and others splitting off northeast towards Mariupol. 

> On Saturday, the Russians used an estimated four landing ships to conduct an amphibious assault about 70 kilometers from Mariupol with several thousand naval infantry troops. **They have advanced about 20 kilometers since then, and are about 50 kilometers out from Mariupol**. 

> The U.S. government on Sunday advised Americans in Russia to ""leave immediately,"" according to an advisory posted by the State Department. **The State Department is urging citizens to leave Russia now** because an increasing number of airlines are canceling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines.",1646003501.0,1646003226.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

America didn't share a border with Iraq; you can literally drive from Moscow to Kiev on **a single tank of gas**.

In Iraq, a huge amount of time was necessary for the US to establish staging areas to push out from, beachheads, camps, supply areas, etc. within a few hundred miles of Baghdad. Russia started the war ready within *200 miles of the enemy capital, with multiple major freeways wide open for them to make the drive.

Russia's failures are like the US failing to take Ottawa in 5 days after spending several months building up a giant invasion force consisting of 3/4 of our fighting strength and miles and miles of resupply. It's a fucking embarrassment for them.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646000104.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,69,0,69,0,0,

Since they quickly deleted it, the version on WayBackMachine:

https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html
 
Some main points: 

- Glorious Russia is back, all thanks to Putin! The successful de-nazification of Ukraine (lol), combined with the referendum in Belarus (100% democratic) led to the three fraternal peoples reunited and the reformed Great Russia.

- It had to be done now, as long as Washington had not brainwashed the Ukrainians too much and they could still be re-Russified

- Europe exists only because the USSR allowed the reunification of Germany (lol)

- And is 100% controlled by the Anglo-Saxons

- And would do well not to go after the Great Russia

- While Great Russia is re-establishing its historical borders (Poland according to Molotov-Ribentropp, Baltic States, maybe Finland and certainly Moldova)


A Full translation of the article: 



    A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

    Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia.

    Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

    Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said

    Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

    The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

    Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

    And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

    Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

    More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.

    Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

    Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

    But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.

    Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

    China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646001925.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

And thanks to the sanctions, that 60% is no longer usable.

There's $60 billion in Chinese Yuan but that won't be acceptable as payment to the countries that supply Russia with consumer goods. It does have $130 billion in gold, but again a hard sell unless they tried Switzerland(who hasn't fully joined on the sanction train) , but Eastern Europe has basically shut Russia out of that airspace sector.

Positive for Ukraine:

* Russian strategy and assumptions in the opening days are borderline nonsensical. Analysts surprised at the tepid military action from Russia. This was no shock and awe, at least until now.
* Russia did not take away Ukraine's ability to defend its airspace and actually perform offensive operations against Russian military units. This is surprising since large scale SEAD and DEAD operations are the first things to happen. Troops should only be sent in if the skies are clear. Tells us that either Russian intel is bad, they dont have enough precision guided bombs (they should, if they dont then they shouldnt have even attempted invading), or they're assumptions going in were completely off. Probably a mix of everything.
* With all that being said, Russian tactics in general are baffling. Very predictable and unimaginative. The US has been telegraphing Russia's plans for months now. They followed those to pretty much a T. Random airdrops, sitting duck armored columns, lack of close air support, and not fighting as an integrated battle group.
* Ukraine is performing very clever defensive tactics, with excellent weapons and training. With the help of NATO intel and targeting data, they are making it extremely hard for Russia.
* As far as we can tell and confirmed by the US, no problem for flow of weapons into Ukraine. Not even sure if Russia is even trying to stop these.
* The entire world is galvanized against Putin. Even if he annexes half of Ukraine, he doesn't come out winning.

Negative for Ukraine:

* You aren't seeing Russian successes for a reason; Russia is largely keeping videos of these underwraps. Ukraine is paying a huge price, which is no surprise.
* Russia not capturing major cities is not an indication of failure. Their strategy seems to be to surround most major cities, other than the ones in the south and Kiev.
* Putin will be force feeding troops into Ukraine. Poor performance so far is largely due to an unorganized and tepid invasion. They most certainly have the capabilities to achieve their goals if they get their act together.
* Ukraine's ability to defend and use airspace has been greatly degraded.

Other things:

* Fog of war is real.
* As much as I want Putin to get absolutely fucked, I hope the Azov Brigade gets wiped off the map. Fuck those pieces of shit.",1646001672.0,1646001453.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,69,0,69,0,0,

*From CNN's Paul P. Murphy.*

As Ukrainians continue to repel Russian advances around Kyiv, new satellite images show a more than 3-mile-long Russian military convoy is on a roadway that heads toward the capital city.

According to Maxar, the convoy was seen on satellite images on Sunday around 10:56 a.m. local time on the P-02-02 road near Ivankiv, which is about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of the Ukrainian capital. The P-02-02 road goes toward Kyiv.

Maxar identified fuel and logistical trucks, in addition to tanks, infantry vehicles and self-propelled artillery moving in the convoy.

**Ukraine's Ministry of Interior says 352 civilians killed**

*From CNN’s Katharina Krebs in Lviv*

The number of known people killed in Ukraine following the Russian invasion is 352 civilians, Ukraine's Ministry of Interior said Sunday. 

At least 14 of those killed are children, according to the ministry. 

Another 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been injured.

**Nearly 6,000 detained across Russia as anti-war protests enter fourth day, monitoring site says**

*From CNN’s Vasco Cotovio in Moscow*

Russian authorities have detained a total of 5,794 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country, since the Kremlin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday. 

As of 3 p.m. ET, 2,650 people had been detained for protesting in 51 cities throughout the country, OVD-Info also reported, and 1,225 were detained in Moscow alone. 

Under Russian law, large demonstrations require protesters apply for a permit, which has to be submitted no more than 15 but no less than 10 days before the event. Heavy fines — and in some cases even prison time — can be imposed on those who protest without a permit. Individuals are allowed to stage “single pickets,” which are solo protests but it is not unheard of for people to be detained for those as well.  

On Thursday, Russia’s Investigative Committee warned that participation in any anti-war protest was illegal. It also said that offenses could be entered on participants’ criminal records which would “leave a mark on the person’s future”",1646000809.0,1646000585.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

“The world order, as it appeared as the result of WW2 after 1945, seems to not represent the real political and economical balance of powers and the challenges which we face. A new world order has still not been found. Finding it can impossibly be up to Germany or it’s parliament alone. However, we will have to do our part. A world in which there are wars, in which nations threaten each other with weapons of mass destruction, in which millions of people live hunger and misery, in which human rights are violated on a daily basis, and in which the natural basis of life of future generations is destroyed, is no just world.“

And he was fucking right. That was 24 years ago, and yet we are still here. It‘s fucking depressing.

Edit: “Alterspräsident” is literally “President of the house due to old age”. In the UK that role is called father/mother of the house.

First of all let’s be very clear: Russia is undeniably the aggressor and agitator in this conflict - which is increasingly less about Ukraine and more about sticking the finger to the West. They cannot be excused, or forgiven and blame is not being proportioned to the Ukraine. (Only 15% of Russians themselves think the Ukraine has anything to do with this invasion - the rest citing western nations’ policies as the catalyst - so says a news report) 

It is important that we stand with Ukraine, we help with aid and humanitarian efforts and sanctions; and of course with the inevitable rebuild. But the toughness and strength of character displayed by the impressive Ukrainians does not merit their automatic entry into geopolitical member groups. We cannot award Ukraine with a ‘participation’ and ‘best effort’ badge. The standard protocols must be followed: the very fabric of these organisations is that they follow stringent rules of entry and membership. 

Would you want South Sudan, Somalia, Honduras, Venezuela or Libya to join nato or the eu (assuming they met geographical requirements)? I assume not. Then why Ukraine? 

Move aside their inspiring fight against a larger oppressor,   The passion they have for flag and country - the massive balls they have to face down guns and tanks. The fact is that over the past 10 years Ukraine has consistently earned a top spot on the list of  most corrupt countries in the world. Earnest & Young had them as high as third  most corrupt as recently as 2012 (prior to Crimean annexation), and the *most corrupt in Europe* in 2015!! 

I don’t say any of this to knock Ukraine. Let’s support them, let’s champion their cause - but we can’t let the high of celebration cloud us. Once we have hopefully helped Ukraine avoid this criminal attempt by Putin - they need to go back to addressing these internal issues and focussing in corruption, employment, infrastructure, etc. 

Each  time someone says Ukraine should get EU entry now - along with NATO membership - remember that a nation shows it’s guts and glory during war - but it takes more than guts and glory to work alongside other nations in the international political landscape. It is a privilege earned by competent government and securing rights and safety for citizens - not by knocking out an opponent or showing real slunk as
a David against a Goliath. 

When we watch the Olympics for two weeks we become experts of sports we’ve never seen. We question judges who award an 8.4 instead of a 9.7. We tutt tutt when a diver over rotates, or gymnast loses their balance on a ‘simple’ beam manoeuvre. So it is now. It is easy to be reddit armchair generals - but we need to remember this has only been going on for 4 days. To me it feels like months - I look like it has been years due to lack of sleep and probably 20 hours of screen time a day - but this invasion is only four days old. It may potentially go on for a very long time. It may be over soon enough. I just hope casualties are minimised on both sides, there is respect for POWs, civilians remain untouched and Geneva conventions are adhered to. Let’s hope pressure will result in a ceasefire and resolution. And no matter how it ends - reasoned, considered, unemotional and logical thought will prevail in the clean up after.",False,1646002559.0,t3_t2z5rd,t3_t2z5rd,,0,-15,0,-15,1,0,{'gid_3': 1}

So now they only have to worry about highway that runs from South Belarus to Chernihiv from the north of Chernihiv.

Their solution to this logistics problem is taking shitty roads in South Belarus to use 2 small roads in Northern Ukraine to Kyiv. The problem is there 2 roads are too small to move much heavy armor like MBTs and MBTs cant travel long distances so they use trailers to carry them and this road cant sustain much of that sort of weight. Also, they don't have enough men to secure the entire length of the road so Ukrainian tanks and ATGM hunter killer teams have ambushed their rear supply elements coming down to Kyiv.

So their left with VDV+OMON+Spetsnaz armed with mostly AFVs and MRAPs with some artillery backed up by some Ka-52s smashing themselves against the other suburbs Kyiv.

You don't take a city of 3 million without employing armor division with tanks backed up by mechanized infantry and masses of regular infantry and tons of artillery. They tried this morning to use mostly paratroopers led by Spetsnaz special forces and paramilitary police OMON to push an armored column through.

Guess what? They got completely massacred.

So now their trying to do it the right now by slowly pushing some MBTs and a lot more AFVs through while bringing enough men to guard the roads in their rear from Ukrainian raiders. Maxar satellite said this morning there was a 3 mile long column near Ivankov.

Also, we know their bringing out the Western military distract units because T-90a's have been seen for the first time near Chernihiv. So their gonna make another push weather tonight or tomorrow and this time it's gonna be a lot more heavy armor rather than just BMP, BTR, BRDM + Tigr-M & Typhoon MRAPs + KAMAZ armored trucks. And troubling for Ukrainian airpower, they been bringing more and more AD. Including Pantsir-M and Buk.",False,1646001443.0,t3_t2z5rd,t1_hyp9btc,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Then you need the riot police in Russia to turn too so the protesters don't keep getting arrested.

> A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.
> 
> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia.
> 
> Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.
> 
> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
> 
> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.
> 
> The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.
> 
> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
> 
> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.
> 
> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.
> 
> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.
> 
> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.
> 
> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.
> 
> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.
> 
> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.
> 
> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646003697.0,t3_t2z5rd,t1_hypgql1,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

And of course, in the fourth, intra-Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to gain a foothold for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said

> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

> The first would always be a complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

> Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations

> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

> Russia has formed a delegation to negotiate with Ukraine

> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? In the fact that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. After that, swinging at Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe alone, did not have the strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is coming back.

> Russia brought to Ukraine an agreement to organize negotiations, Peskov said

> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation brings huge costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

> Russia's rights in the Council of Europe have been suspended

> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.

> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

> No one in Europe wants to fight Russia, said the French Defense Minister

> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.
The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.

1. Least important - Ukraine itself. Great farmland and a competitor on the industrial scale grains market, and has a 44 million population he wants as a captive market for Russian goods, keeping them out of the EU and dependent on Russia, so Russian companies can turn heavy profits without western competition or any sort of government oversight. 
 
2. Middle important - Geopolitics, which he is playing badly. He was afraid of Ukraine joining the EU or NATO, concerned the Westward expansion makes him look weak.

3. Most important - Domestic politics. Russia's economy has been awful for a long while. He's a bad economic manager and people's lives have not improved at the same rate as their neighbours. It sucks to be Russian and watch Latvians and Estonians look down on your quaint little economy and its little trinkets. He wants to fire up violent nationalism he can harvest as political capital to keep his domestic political position strong. Starting a war has that effect. 

Ultimately, it was a very stupid idea.

Ukraine is proving an expensive acquisition and will likely resist, with an expensive occupation both hemorrhaging badly needed Russian cash and blood and tanking the economy they want to harvest in the process.

The invasion, if successful, will require Russia to keep a large garrison in Ukraine, depleting its overall strength, and has done wonders to persuade other formerly neutral powers to join NATO and existing members to bulk up their defences. 

Finally, these sanctions might really sting, meaning that he's going to be playing a lot more defence at home politically, and his ego will need to deal with the fact that he's turning Moscow into a Chinese vassal as Pyongyang 2.0.",False,1646004230.0,t3_t2z5rd,t1_hypgqc2,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

The articles were pulled very shortly thereafter, due to Russia *not* having captured Ukraine as the articles suggested.

This put things a little more into perspective for me.

Now, for the physics part. This rod is made from a relatively unstable, radioactive material. What radioactive actually means is that the atoms are so packed with particles, that they tend to be unstable and send those particles flying. If they reach a certain 'mass', they tend to explode violently and release immense amounts of energy.

A nuclear bomb exploits this fact by taking these two pieces I described above, and jamming them into each other abruptly. This makes the atoms go over their critical mass, resulting in the devastating effects we're all familiar with.",False,1646000399.0,t3_t2z5rd,t1_hyp7rkg,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

 Russia' remaining forces are probably best served as replacements for destroyed and damaged units and to replace materiel. Hell, just MOVING the units to the area might be counter productive, much less letting them fight They might try to peel away logistics units from other areas to support existing offensives and rotate divisions, but not much else. 

The issue is logistics. Something analysts have been pointing to as an Achilles heel for a while now with Russia. They just don't have the equipment to sustain a longterm offensive away from their rail line. The deeper they go, the worse it will be.  They need roads, trucks, trains, etc.. to replace, repair, and maintain. You can't create that from thin air and Russia lacks the productive capacity, logistics, etc.. to fix the situation easily.

Imagine you're in Russia and you want to turn a billion ruble into USD purchases through bitcoin. Where do you start? 

1) Find a Russian exchange and offer them your ruble  
2) The exchange needs to be able to obtain a billion ruble worth of bitcoins to give you for your fiat currency    
3) The exchange tries to buy the bitcoin from foreign exchanges with.. ruble!  
4) Foreign exchanges deny the transaction because they can't accept ruble

It was just 2 old soviet neighbours fighting over disputed land to the west. We saw videos of executions of pensioners and pows, beheadings etc on video here in reddit.

All nations were told to evacuate citizens weeks ago. This was fairly simple for rich nations like the US or European nations like the UK who’s citizens could just walk across the border to Poland and catch a flight home. 

Many African governments (and India who are the largest group affected by this) did not do this due to both negligence and understandable economic realities. 

War broke out and the EU said they would only accept Ukrainians who had no where else to go and are legitimate refugees. For those who are in Ukraine on a visa, they do not qualify and normal travel requirements would apply. Many Africans then attempted to flee and Poland (not necessarily Ukraine) refused their entry. This totally logical move was branded racist because the woke people couldn’t give it a rest for any longer. 

This has been massively misrepresented. Also many African students are (for economic and cultural reasons) young men, so not the priority. Since, many have been placed on trains or have found their way to the border at which time theIr respective nations (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya) have alongside Poland organised coaches direct from the border to transport their citizens to the airport and back to their respective home countries.

Greece’s actions in WWII may well be modern history’s most consequential example of David vs. Goliath courage. As Winston Churchill also said, “Hence, we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks.” Adolf Hitler said: “The Greek soldier, above all, fought with the most courage.”
Greece’s victory over Mussolini forced Hitler to have to invade Greece. This delayed Hitler’s invasion of Russia by two to three months moving Hitler’s Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel to say, “The unbelievable strong resistance of the Greeks delayed by two or more vital months the German attack against Russia; if we did not have this long delay, the outcome of the war would have been different.” As well, Soviet Union Premiere Joseph Stalin said, “We thank the Greek People, whose resistance decided WWII…you fought unarmed and won, small against big…You gave us time to defend ourselves.”
Winston Churchill said, “If there had not been the virtue and courage of the Greeks, we do not know which the outcome of World War II would have been.”

The ""joke"" is that Donald Trump is so grossly pathetic and incompetent, being banned over a year ago from Twitter for being a treasonous cunt and trying to start a MAGA coup. So long story short, anytime you hear going forward,

""Donald Trumps Twitter says ....""

The joke is that who cares. He got his Twitter banned like a fucking toddler, so there is no tweet, and everybody is better off.

Putin, who undoubtedly is a narcissistic psychopath - I say that not as an offhanded disparaging remark but to highlight the type of psychopathy that's at play here - has long wanted a reunification of the old U.S.S.R. He's getting older now and with age comes thoughts of legacy.

Under his leadership, Russia has gone from an infant, and no doubt struggling due to massive corruption, democracy to full blown police state. Exactly as he believes Russia should be. For more insight into this:

Listen to this 01/28/22 episode of The New Yorker Radio Hour:

[Russia’s Intentions in Ukraine—and America](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/episodes/russias-intentions-ukraine-and-america)

Read this [pre-written press release](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t2x5s9/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/hyp457e/?context=3) that was accidentally left on their server in which Russia announces their victory over Ukraine; screen shots in English:

If you understand anything about narcissistic psychopaths you know - ironically they are very insecure while simultaneously believing they are always right, they are absolutely incapable of caring about anyone but themselves, when their own behavior pushes them into a corner they 100% will not admit any culpability and would literally rather die believing their death will ""show you"" and if in doing so others are hurt or destroyed see lack of empathy above, that's not in their calculation.

TL;DR Yes, I do believe Putin would use nuclear weapons and the response of NATO member countries and the world is proof they do as well

His actions in the last years were always to do something elegant without direct Russian army interference in most cases. Then he can take this small achievement and pump the hell out of it in the propaganda TV. That's what they've done with Crimea, Syria, even the donbass war was more ""elegant"". But this full blown assault on a sovereign European nation of 44 millions? That's just insane, that's why almost nobody in Russia/ukraine believed this scenario could happen. 

So if it was business as usual and he's just looking for some military achievement for a nice propaganda picture he would just put his troops in donbass, maybe even start a local conflict there to push for the region's borders. But that's a completely different scale from what we see now. 
In my opinion he wants to leave his name in history forever, he wants to be a great conquerer no matter the cost, and no matter if he's the villain. Like we still remember Hitler's name to this day, everyone heard of him. But what's different about Putin that unlike hitler he has no real ideology, no real fanatic followers, just yes-men who are too scared to say no to him. He's basically a mafia boss/cult leader who controls a superpower with nukes. 

As far as the exit plans he has, nobody knows. In theory he could leave ukraine right now and announce on TV that all the objectives of the operation were completed. But that would leave him looking incredibly weak. He probably believed he'll take over ukraine in 48 hours without bloodshed, a clean transition of power without a humanitarian crisis. But he failed to do that. Maybe the leadership suffers from the classical soviet problem of his staff beautifying the truth for him cause they're scared. Maybe the US intel leaks pushed him to attack earlier than expected. To me this seems so badly planned. 

In any case I'm afraid we're dealing with a completely different beast this time, the stakes are sky high. I'm afraid he won't back down until ukraine surrenders. Lukashenko hinted today that what's happening right now isn't a war, but in a few days it might start to look like one.. my guess that he's referring to starting massive attacks against cities including targeting civilians. I recall a quote of a British general in WW2 that the best way to win a war is to basically massacre/scare the civilians so badly they'll demand a surrender. (In relation to the dresden bombings, don't remember who it was but you can probably look it up)
