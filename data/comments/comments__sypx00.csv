> The result was hundreds of thousands of victims, injuries to entire nations, the consequences of which both we and Afghanistan still cannot overcome, and the emergence of one of the key reasons for the collapse of the USSR.

> Those morons from the Politburo covered themselves with a two-faced ideology.  These Putin's dotards do not even have an ideology - only  constant and undisguised lies.  They don't even bother to give their casus belli the slightest credibility

> Both of them need one thing: to divert the attention of the people of Russia from real problems - the development of the economy, rising prices, reigning lawlessness - and switching it to the format of ""imperial hysteria.""

> How long has it been since you last watched the news on federal channels?  It's the only thing I watch now, and I can assure you, there is NO news about Russia there AT ALL.  Literally.  From the first to the last piece, it's Ukraine - USA - Europe.

> Bare propaganda is no longer enough for the senile thieves.  They want blood. They want to move around tank figurines on a map of hostilities.

> Replace ""Ukraine"" in his speech with ""Kazakhstan"", ""Belarus"", ""Baltic countries"", ""Azerbaijan"", ""Uzbekistan"" and so on, even including ""Finland"".  And think about where the train of geopolitical thought of this senile grandfather may take him next.

> All this ended very badly for everyone in 1979.  And it will end just as badly now.  Afghanistan was destroyed, but the USSR also received a mortal wound.

> Thanks to Putin, hundreds of Ukrainians and Russian citizens may die now, and in the future, this number may reach tens of thousands.  Yes, he will not allow Ukraine to develop, he will drag it into the swamp, but Russia will pay the same price.

> We have everything for powerful development in the 21st century, from oil to educated citizens, but we will lose money again and squander the historical chance for a normal rich life for the sake of war, dirt, lies and the palace with golden eagles in Gelendzhik.

> Putin and his senile thieves from the Security Council and United Russia are the enemies of Russia and its main threat, not Ukraine and not the West.  Putin kills and wants to kill more.

> The Kremlin is making you poorer, not Washington.  It is not in London that economic policy is being conducted in such a way that a pensioner's ""borscht set"" has doubled in price, but in Moscow.

> Washington has so far received support from Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan for plans to implement restrictive export controls on Russia, three U.S. sources tell Foreign Policy, part of a broader sanctions package aimed at crushing Russia’s economy and technology sectors should the Kremlin move forward with plans to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. The three Asian countries are major producers of semiconductors, computer chips, and other high-end technological exports that Russia is reliant on.

>Ukraine must be allowed to retain the option of Nato membership, Finland’s foreign minister has said, warning that Moscow’s open aggression seemed to be based on a “concept of the past and rebuilding the Soviet Union”.  
>  
>“There were clues in Putin’s speech and in recent propaganda \[about\] Ukraine developing nuclear weapons and with the mentions of Odesa,” he told the Financial Times. “So you can start to see locations on a map that give a hint of what may be \[the Kremlin’s\] next steps.”  
>  
>Putin has demanded that Nato withdraw from eastern Europe and the Baltics and bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance. Haavisto said this seemed to have grown out of Putin’s apparent “frustration with the past 30 years, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia’s self image” and that the Russian president’s actions were “based on some sort of concept of the past and rebuilding the Soviet Union”.  
>  
>Although Nato has firmly rebuffed Putin’s demands, some have suggested a compromise whereby Ukraine effectively remains outside of the alliance while retaining the theoretical possibility of joining.  Haavisto rejected that idea.  
>  
>“It is very important that Nato keeps its open-door policy, that Finland keeps the right to apply . . . and that is our position for Ukraine and Georgia as well. Every country should have that right,” he said.  
>  
>Haavisto said “you have to be a believer in diplomacy” and that the so-called Minsk process may have been one way of bringing peace to eastern Ukraine. “But that was then,” he added, given that Putin’s decision to send troops into the separatist areas had buried the Minsk agreements, which aimed to end the conflict that has left more than 14,000 people dead since 2014.

When Russia announced the withdrawal of troops last week, I wrote they would likely shift some Crimean units near the Donbas four days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/warinukraine/comments/suyhvq/buildup_near_donbas/):

“All this talk of genocide in Ukraine, mass graves, recognising DPR/LPR and yet, hardly anything is deployed in the vicinity during this buildup. What gives?

My guess: Crimean units may swing over that way and reinforce that buildup while Russia says they’re de-escalating/pulling troops out.“

This has been confirmed.

This won’t be the main front but those BM-30s are monsters. 

I also wrote that the LSTs may go home and it was possibly just a feint so russia could score a PR win on “duping” the west again. I no longer believe that to be the case. They’re going to use them, and the naval assets in the Black Sea are prepped for a massive naval fires operation.

We’ll likely see the LSTs move on Odessa and Mariupol concurrently in tandem with the overland push from Crimea following the massive naval fires, after air superiority has been achieved.

I could be wrong, but that’s the posture Russia is currently projecting. 

The Donbas buildup though is still the smallest by far, which should give everyone cause for concern who thought we were seeing *the* Russian invasion. The others in Belarus, Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk and Crimea are all 3-4x larger.

Russia has been wanting a landline to Crimea ever since they took it. This was very much to be expected. Not to mention that Russia has been sniffing along the Ukranian border for ages. 

Moldova has always been a target for the Russians, just like Ukraine. So that they keep poking and prodding there should come as no surprise. 

Belarus has and always will, be a Russian proxy state. Their allegiance to Putin is the most expected thing in human history. 

Transnistria wanting to join Russia, as they said today, has been known for ages. That's basically the entire point of filling Transnistria with Russians. They, much like Belarus, are as much Russia as you can be without actually being Russia. 

And let's not forget that the Russian invasion of Georgia never stopped. It's still active, it's progressing slowly but surely against Tbilisi. 

My point if that none of this just happened all of a sudden. And it's never been just about Ukraine. Never. And it's not about ""starting with Ukraine and then taking other former soviet non-NATO countries either. Because this isn't thr start. Crimea wasn't the start either.

China’s position in this round of Russia v the west is under particularly heavy scrutiny following Xi Jinping’s pledge with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on 4 February that there would be “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” in their bilateral relationship.  
  
In the last few days, as the crisis in Ukraine dominated international headlines, Chinese analysts have debated the country’s policy choice. While hardliners advocate a pro-Russia foreign policy, others think Beijing should seize on this crisis to protect ties with Washington.  
  
“China ultimately wants good relations with the US,” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a Beijing-based thinktank, who also advises the government.  
  
It is true that Beijing and Moscow have pledged closer cooperation, because both countries have similar concerns over external involvement in their own security issues,  
  
Wang said, adding that China sees some parallels in Nato’s eastward expansion with its own concerns relating to the South China Sea, which, he said “should all be resolved by the countries in the region without foreign interference”.

Many of the representatives at the UN were talking about how Russia ""broke"" the Minsk deal, but an actual agreement was never going to happen. It was never accepted by the Ukrainians, and Zelensky had to contend with [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_to_capitulation!) when he tried to implement it. Many on the Ukrainian side saw it as capitulation. There's no way in hell Ukraine were going to accept the decentralisation of power and self-governance for Luhansk and Donetsk, both of which were required by Minsk. Giving Ukraine weaponry by the truckload wasn't exactly going to encourage them towards Minsk, either.

Of course, the Seperatists/Russians aren't exactly clean in all of this. Breaking the ceasefire was a daily occurrence and they weren't for one second going to actually disarm and withdraw fighters. Russia wasn't going to accept any real form of peace until Ukraine pursued geopolitical neutrality, but who in in their right mind would expect Ukraine to so willingly give up their attempts at sovereignty? The only reason things are heating up now are because the Russians have decided to give up on cold conflict, and that is undeniable, but a feasible diplomatic goal to this conflict wasn't ever really on the table to begin with.

As diplomacy falls, if the invasion gets worse, both Taiwan and China will watch with great interest in the US & Europe's reaction.

The US doesn't have to save Ukraine, but if Russia doesn't crack its jaws swallowing its prize China will learn and repeat. If this attack shatters the Russian economy, jeopardizes Putin's hitherto iron control, or fails to win a serious prize (While the Luhansk and Donetsk regions are the flashpoint of this crisis, the real prize is Kiev) it will deter China from their own gambit. If US allies band together, stay strong, and smack Putin in the cock with some serious embargos and sanctions it will also give the Chinese pause. This is a real test of the anti-Russia, anti-China axis the US has been building the past ten years, if it hangs together through this crisis thats important.

Hitler started off as a charismatic nazi that spoke what was on a lot of German peoples minds at the time. It wasn't all ""And we need to take out every Jew while we have a chance!"" (though anti-semitism was a huge part of nazism) It was a lot of ""The German people have been at the will of the rest of Europe for too long, this has been decades of humiliation and forced poverty to the Germans while every other major European power is prospering, we can not""

In other words Hitler was really pushing for nationalism and a renewed desire to be German (a long with other terrible things of course) but historically, even before then, and now you are seeing it again, words like that from major leaders have always inspired people to be nationalistic and supportive. Primarily because your average individual is pretty ignorant to the realities of whats going on around them, even if everyone else is telling them one thing, that isn't what they are hearing or seeing from what they have always listened to or what has never steered them in the wrong direction traditionally.

Now the whole range of necessary actions is being carried out,"" Domashenko told reporters.

Earlier on Tuesday morning, Kharkiv telegram channels published a recording of a conversation in which two men, identified as ""Person 1 Citizen of the Russian Federation ""Aleksey"" and ""Person 2 Citizen of Ukraine (performer)"", discuss the possibility of carrying out and paying for several arsons in churches on the territory cities.

“Of course, I won’t do 4, but I can do a couple. I looked, there on Cold Mountain you can get up there from behind, you can throw it at Nauchnaya,” says the “performer”.

He reports that he agreed to help with his brother.

His interlocutor insists on carrying out four arsons and promises a ""mower of greens"" for this. He also warns that before breaking windows and setting fire to churches, the ""performer"" must leave a ""sign"" - the letters NI.",False,1645548025.0,t3_sypx00,t1_hxzbdrn,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I think you’re talking about an actual act of war with seemingly no guarantee of reversibility. In my eyes, diplomacy always needs to have some “way back.” If you seize all Russian assets permanently, you have created an insurmountable barrier to that way back. The only option is war. This is exactly how most wars start, with the gradual escalation of sanctions until they are too much to bear. This plan basically jumps a few steps beyond into “we HAVE TO fight this out.” 

I basically simplify it down to three major variables. Human/military impact, economic impact, geopolitical objectives. We can pull the economic levers a bit to make the calculation harder to justify the human/military impact, we can give the Ukrainians weapons to pull the human/military lever. At some point, whether it’s by nato giving the Ukrainians nukes or whether it’s permanently crippling the Russian ruling class financially, the calculation for military/human loss becomes astronomically high and justifies total war. 

Appreciate the thoughtful nature of the post though, hard to find that nowadays.

Edit: I’m just now realizing that you probably are German based on your post. Not trying to go back to a rough part of history, but do you think that the measures you outlined above created support for the war among Germans, or do you think it had the opposite effect? It seems like a way to cause the people who’s ears are closest to the leadership to start beating war drums.

The alternative is to put up some military resistance and then rely on non-cooperation with the occupying Russians. See how well they do governing a country that resents being governed by them.

What if the Soviet Union backed a street putsch against the elected, pro‐​American president of Mexico. Sent officials to Mexico City to press for the appointment of a pro‐​Soviet president and cabinet. Loaded up the new government with weapons to deter American action. Sought to redirect trade away from America. And invited the new Mexican government to join the Warsaw Pact.

US officials would not, shall we say, be happy. Planning for subversion and invasion would begin immediately.”

&#x200B;

Russia will demand retreat from the contact lines, which Ukraine will not comply with. Then Russia and it's proxies start a massive bombardment of the contact line, which puts the Ukrainian defenders in a position where they either just take the beating, or they fire back counter-battery fire... Any one of their shells can be used by Russia as a pretext to press further, and then the match is lit. 

I doubt Russia just wants to take those territories. They deployed enough force to conduct a punitive campaign that destroys Ukraine's military and severely damages any and all infrastructure in the conflict zone, which I think would be all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper as well as territory north and west of Crimea, extending all the way to Transnistria.

Technically, if unauthorized soldiers step foot on embassy grounds, it could be considered invading that country.      
As for diplomats, they have diplomatic immunity and if another country does not treat them as such (by harming, killing, or illegally seizing diplomatic pouches) that would be a violation of international law and could be grounds for further involvement of that country. Now, a host country can expel all diplomats. I am not sure if an occupying country has that power as well.",False,1645555704.0,t3_sypx00,t1_hxzun08,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Several European leaders said earlier in the day that Russian troops had moved into rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine after Putin recognised their independence — but some indicated it was not yet the long-feared, full-fledged invasion.
The White House, which had been reluctant to use the word “invasion”, signalled a shift in its own position on Tuesday.
“We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine,” said Jon Finer, principal deputy national security adviser. He said “latest” was important. “An invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way.”
The White House decided to begin referring to Russia’s actions as an “invasion” because of the situation on the ground, according to a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
The administration resisted initially calling the deployment of troops because the White House wanted to see what Russia was actually going to do. After assessing Russian troop movements, it became clear it was a new invasion, the official added.

it's actually literally protocol for people with government protection like the secret service to show up late (and by an arbitrary amount of time).

it's for security reasons incase someone malicious was trying to harm the person. (i say ""person"" instead of president because i found this out at the victory party for a senate candidate back in 2008 and that's when i learned about this).

I would say yes. They all suffer from poor capacity factors (how much of the time they are producing energy) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor, so if you put up a windturbine it might only produce energy 20% of the time durings entire operational time.  And they also produce inconcistent electricity which will have to be balanced to the power grid.

Renewables also requires energy storage if they are to be relied on, as you need to have energy when there is no sun or wind.


The last thing I dislike about them is that they are very area and resource inefficient, compared to ""regular powerplants"" where you produce all the energy in one concentrated area, renewables often requires massive space in order to withdraw energy from nature. For instance windmills are absolutely massive, and have to be separated like 200m +++ apart, in order to maintain good airflow. And you obviously have to use much more resources to craft these energy systems, as you need A LOT of them, in order to cover an entire country's electricity grid.",False,1645556806.0,t3_sypx00,t1_hxzywds,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Hope that makes sense. Here is a simple example:

Two bakers: one Russian, one American 

The American can sell a cake for $60. The cost of his labor, supplies, kitchen costs, and supply/demand deemed this a good price. 

The Russian can sell his cake for the equivalent of 1 dollar. The cost of his labor, supplies, kitchen costs, etc are just less because he exists in the Russian market. 

Both are selling the same cake. But the scale of the American economy makes the American cake more expensive than the Russian cake.

Also i havent seen any sanctions lists or already in place sanctions that would support your argument either. They say it will be big sanctions but so far its only this promise. Also unity on economical sanctions often break quickly apart and Putin is betting on the short memory of free markets. Everyone knows that Russia only reacts to strong reactions. Sanctions are not a strong reaction and never been. You will not be able to make Russia to something like north korea and even them are still doing fine as a dictatorship. Also russia took control of a lot of countries in Africa to have access to important resources in the string of only several years because Africa was sick of china and the west. They get weapons and training from them without to be asked for what. So i still think that they positioned themselves in a way that makes them strong enough to withstand any sanctions longer then the political stability is in the countries that put them in place.

 >Robot Jox is a 1990 American post-apocalyptic Mecha science-fiction film directed by Stuart Gordon and starring Gary Graham, Anne-Marie Johnson and Paul Koslo. Co-written by science-fiction author Joe Haldeman, the film's plot follows Achilles, one of the ""robot jox"" who pilot giant machines that fight international battles to settle territorial disputes in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world. After producer Charles Band approved Gordon's initial concept, the director approached Haldeman to write the script. Gordon and Haldeman clashed frequently over the film's tone and intended audience.

You can argue that Crimea was a surprise and that Germany was caught off guard. But after that point, if they had invested into nuclear power plants or alternatives (including a pipeline thru Greece / Turkey into the oil fields of middle east), then there would have been little to no issue to completely halting any gas imports from Russia with far smaller losses to Germany.

What happened was Crimea happened, the EU did some sanctions that cost itself relatively lightly, and now the crow is coming to roost because Russia knows that in order to hurt Russia, they need to actually cause issues at home and they know the calculation for that is far more heavy and one where maybe larger parts of Ukraine needs to be under attack to be on the table.

As it stands, EU as a whole cannot simply say we are going to cut you completely off, because it means they are at a far higher risk of energy insecurity. Which given how long it has been since Crimea too little efforts had been made on alternative energy sources.

America felt like Afghanistan was getting too pally with communist Russia and began to fund rebel forces in Afghanistan which in turn led to russian invasion, which lead to America increasing their funding to rebel forces (including funding foreign forces who backed the Afghan rebels, such as Al Qaeda), which lead to Russia withdrawing, the communist Afghan government falling, both superpowers forgetting about Afghanistan for a hot second, & then the most organised rebels (aka the Taliban) taking over. 

While all this was going on, America was busy doing bits all over the middle East (#PersianGulfWar) , which Al Qaeda was pissed of about - as Al Qaeda was an international terrorist group (not exclusive to afgans. The reason they're so closely linked to Afghanistan is because the Taliban backed Al Qaeda, and let them train, grow, launder money etc etc in Afghanistan). Which in turn lead to 9/11. I don't think Afganistan threw the first punch here....

(Btw, this is not relevant for this discussion - I don't think it's cool that Russia is invading Ukraine or in any way justified just because America has invaded some places.

It's not like Putin wasn't trying. The idea behind Minsk treaties was that Donbass stays in Ukraine. Olland and Macron have tried to negotiate following it (Steinmeier formula), Merkel and Sholtz, even Biden advised Zelenskiy to at least start doing something about the treaties, not to say that Zelenskiy's election campaign had promises of bringing peace to Donbass. Nothing worked and Zelenskiy did 180 degree turn and waged even more war in last 2 years.

There was some talk about UN peacekeepers at some point of time, iirc Ukraine denied that possibility. So here we are, Putin got enough and is solving the crisis in his way. I hope that'll end the war there.

I don't think it'll end there, honestly. Thing is, in 2014 after the coup and Crimean annexation there were massive pro-Russian movements in various regions (Kharkov, Odessa and others), but they were suppressed and died out when it became obvious that Russia won't make any further moves and support anyone outside Crimea. The prevalent opinion, also used in Ukrainian propaganda was, that Putin basically betrayed Russians in all regions except Crimea, and has left Donbass for war and slow bleeding out. Now though, those movements may start again, we'll see.

Problem is, Ukraine can't pay interest of their debt, not to say the debt itself, they have lost most of their markets and industry, tariffs are rising sharply and the country itself is very unstable politically and economically, that may accelerate unrests in all the regions.",1645550202.0,1645549788.0,t3_sypx00,t1_hxzcagb,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

I was 8 years old and on the day of 9/11 I was off school sick. I went from playing with my action man to suddenly watching live images of planes hitting huge buildings and then people throwing themselves to their death live on TV. This wasn't the really traumatising thing though.

The thing that was most damaging was that all of the adults *lost their fucking minds.* Before that, to a kid's mind, the adults were in control of everything and kept everything safe and running smoothly. That day brought the illusion crashing down as you instantly found out that the people supposed to protect you could be dumb, panicky animals.

Crimea is nothing compared to taking a larger land grab like Ukraine. This requires years of political maneuvering. Weakening European energy independence. Weakening European dependence on the USA. Softening the GOP's platform on Ukraine. Creating political distractions at home for the Americans.

Combining the lasting impact of the American invasion of Iraq with the foreign relations disaster of Donald Trump w/ Europe, I'd say the GOP is most responsible for allowing Putin to maneuver behind a weakened, distracted American-European alliance.

I (my opinion) would not say Putin believes that NATO is a threat (specifically talking about threat in form of taking/invading Russian territory), but it would be almost safe to say that of course he knows NATO is a ""threat"" in that form, that NATO hinders him in annexing and bullying the neighboring countries. He is an a\*\*hole but he is a smart a\*\*hole.

He tries to spin this logic and is telling that NATO is a security threat for Russia, while it only would be that way, when Russia has plans to invade other countries. So NATO is more of an annoyance to him because he can't do what he wants as freely as he likes.

And that's actually what NATO should be doing. NATO helps independent countries to stay that way because bigger countries can't just use force to invade or flip those countries with a puppet president when NATO protects them.

I am mostly a proponent of nuclear power, as its very energy dense, and thus can maintain pretty much all the advantages of regular powerplants, in a concentrated areas.


Renewables are fine too, to a point. But the entire power grid should not be based on it, due to the concistency issues. Imo.

Kind of like how the US hasn't declared war since WWII but they've clearly been the belligerents in a lot of conflicts (though the US was far more brazen in some of their ""conflicts"").

I (my opinion) would not say Putin believes that NATO is a threat (specifically talking about threat in form of taking/invading Russian territory), but it would be almost safe to say that of course he knows NATO is a ""threat"" in that form, that NATO hinders him in annexing and bullying the neighboring countries. He is an a\*\*hole but he is a smart a\*\*hole.

I don't think he's afraid of an actual invasion. But I think he fully believes they will install missles aimed at Russia in the Ukraine.

>He tries to spin this logic and is telling that NATO is a security threat for Russia, while it only would be that way, when Russia has plans to invade other countries. So NATO is more of an annoyance to him because he can't do what he wants as freely as he likes

I believe there are certainly people within NATO that will try to push it to be more aggressive towards Russia. Since you never know who will win internal political struggles, I don't blaming for assuming the worst. All of the other points you are making are also correct.

>And that's actually what NATO should be doing.

In an ideal world, yes

> NATO helps independent countries to stay that way because bigger countries can't just use force to invade or flip those countries with a puppet president when NATO protects them.

That's true and a bit idealistic at the same time. NATO has also been used as an instrument of US geopolitical interests, such as the Iraq invasion. So one can't fully trust their ""pure"" intentions.

>After earning his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Mr. Chang joined Texas Instruments and ended up running its semiconductor division. He left in 1983 after a falling-out with his bosses and joined General Instruments, where he served a brief, disillusioning spell as president.  
>  
>''I had enough money not to work for the rest of my life, and I had gotten a little weary of the corporate rat race,'' said Mr. Chang, who is an American citizen. ''At that time, Taiwan beckoned.''  
>  
>The Taiwan government, eager to turn this island into a technology redoubt, initially recruited Mr. Chang to head an industrial research institute. But given his pedigree and experience, it was a matter of time before the government persuaded Mr. Chang to join Taiwan's drive into the semiconductor industry.  
>  
>In 1987, the government staked him $100 million and took a 49 percent share in what would become Taiwan Semiconductor. That, along with $58 million from Philips, the Dutch electronics company, allowed Mr. Chang to set up shop. The government still owns 15 percent of the company, while Philips owns 26.7 percent.

* US R&D is still by **far** the leader: *""Semiconductors were invented in the United States, and the domestic industry remains the leader in the global market. While America’s position has been challenged many times over the decades, it has always prevailed due to its amazing resilience and ability to run faster. This does not mean the United States will go unchallenged in the future. The importance of semiconductors is so great that most Information-Age nations strive to be competitive in at least some aspect of this critical industry, and the world’s most ambitious nations seek to chase the U.S.""*

We had to have a surge of personnel in the US military (well I can only speak to the army) when we were engaged in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We even pulled personnel from our Inactive Ready Reserve (soldiers that completed their base service but could be pulled back if needed. Basically it’s 2-4 years of time where you are selected before a draft is called).

I do not quite see the advantage of risking global war to protect Ukraine. And I am confident that no NATO nation sees the advantage of such a move. 

As commendable as your perspective may be, I simply don’t foresee it happening.

Placing NATO forces in Ukraine validates Putins stance on NATO expansionism. NATO forces in a neutral nation, postured in direct opposition to Russia, would be a majorly costly move, I believe.",False,1645564423.0,t3_sypx00,t1_hy0hi5i,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Also, I’m certain you’ve never been to Russia, and life there, particularly for the super rich, is far from a shithole.

Yeah, none of the sanctions have any teeth, because that’s what is beneficial for the US/EU. If you don’t think UK banks want Russian accounts, you’re naive.
