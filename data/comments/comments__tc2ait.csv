Day 16 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Sound of explosions and shooting was almost constant today, it continues even now and it’s 3 am here, but as usual we don’t know where the sound is coming from. There’s constant intense fighting in the outskirts of Kharkiv and some small towns were basically levelled in the process.

About food situation, there’s still food in stores but if you want to have a choice of what to buy you have to go in right as they are opening at 8 am, if you go at noon or later most shelves in stores will be completely empty, and for some specific stuff like meat you might even see queues.

Also there are volunteers giving out humanitarian aid like food for free in residential districts every day, so most likely there won’t be food shortage for now, but the price of most food in stores has doubled since the start of war.

In the past few days, more and more people on reddit seemed to have become increasingly critical of President Zelensky's persistent demand for a NATO no-fly zone. What they failed to understand is that this is exactly what he should do to maximize NATO support while providing NATO with a political cover to avoid escalation with Russia.

  
In negotiations/politics, if you want 10, you'll have to ask for 15. If you ask for 10, you only get 5, or less. By demanding something that the NATO mostly likely can't provide (like a no-fly zone), Zelensky makes all other Ukraine demands seem even more reasonable and cheap (politically). Forcing NATO to repeatedly deny the request for a no-fly zone compels them to keep providing Ukraine with other forms of assistance to compensate: weapons, equipments, intel, sanctions, food, humanitarian assistance, etc. It's just a common and necessary tactic.

  
Asking for and being denied a no-fly zone also gives NATO a much needed political cover to avoid escalation with Russia so they can keep assisting Ukraine while denying direct involvement. I saw people complaining that Zelensky doesn't thank NATO enough for all they've done for Ukraine. That's just stupid. Do you want him to come out and say ""Oh wow NATO you're providing us with everything! We can't survive without you, you're practically fighting our war for us""? That's like the worst thing you can say if you want to avoid further escalation since it basically forces Russia/Putin into a corner. It's the same reason why Ukraine almost never acknowledge intelligence tips from NATO. Do you really think Ukraine's own intelligence system is capable of providing such broad and accurate and high level intelligence that we're seeing? It's definitely NATO behind it, but they have to claim that the source is Ukrainian (or Russian). So it's absolutely necessary for Zelensky to criticize NATO for not providing the aid Ukraine need so the assistance can keep happening behind the curtains. Sometimes to avoid escalation, you have to (pretend to) demand escalation. It's counter-intuitive but it's the art of politics.

  
Now, I'm not saying that no-fly zone is in itself an unreasonable demand; in fact, it's absolutely needed given Russia's attacks on civilians. However, it is unlikely that the NATO would risk direct confrontation against a nuclear power with an unstable madman at the top. I believe that by repeatedly demanding a no-fly zone, Zelensky finds an optimal balance in this to extract as much assistance as possible from this tricky situation.

  
So it's perfectly fine for headlines like ""Zelensky criticizes NATO"" to dominate the news as long as the actual aid keeps happening in the background. Let's talk more about what Ukraine needs and less about what other countries are providing. It's good for everyone.",False,1647039017.0,t3_tc2ait,t3_tc2ait,,0,923,0,923,7,1,"{'gid_1': 3, 'gid_2': 1}"

Nato sends troops for exercises in Norway

As Ukraine enters its 17th day under Russian invasion, Nato has said that it will be sending troops to Norway on Monday 14 March.

Some 30,000 troops, 200 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 nations are expected to take part in the Cold Response 2022 exercise, the largest exercise involving Nato troops this year.

Starting on 14 March, the manoeuvres will enable western nations to hone their combat skills in Norway's cold climate, including in the Arctic, on the ground, at sea and in the skies.

The exercise will be held a few hundred kilometres from the Russian border. While it was planned long before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it now has added significance because of the war.

Norway's Defence Minister Odd Roger Enoksen said: ""This exercise is extremely important for the security of Norway and its allies. We will practice an allied reinforcement of Norway"".",False,1647060672.0,t3_tc2ait,t3_tc2ait,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

* Non-stop shelling, but not sure who's doing it right now. She said the Ukrainians have been pushing the Russians back pretty successfully.
* Mayor's brother said Kyiv could be surrounded any day now. They have about 2 weeks of food.
* City is heavily fortified, the extra time has allowed them to really dig in and prepare.
* Some debate if Russia can surround the city, it looks like they can encircle it, but whether they can take Kyiv is the big question.
* A lot of residents of Kyiv have left, but equally a lot of people in the suburbs are now in Kyiv.

**Kaitlan Collins in DC**

* Big concern for the West is that equipment had been flown directly to Kyiv, but now they're struggling to get the weapons and humanitarian aid to the Ukrainians. White House is getting concerned that Congress is taking too long, relative to the speed with which the Russians are moving.

**Retired Gen Hertlings**

* 30 mile circumference around Kyiv, but they're still 10 miles away. He said they could be preparing but given that the Ukrainians are still attacking them, he said the Russians look extremely disorganized and unable to encircle the city.
* He doesn't think they'll be successful in encircling the city. Said bombs, but still surprised by the lack of the Russian air force.
* High praise for the Ukrainians, he didn't expect them to be this successful.
* Thought the Russians would suck, they suck more"" than he expected! Also noticed the desertion and capture rates for the Russians are extremely high.
* Key: can the Ukrainians hold out and how bad the war crimes will be.

SUBBED White House hosts private briefing for TikTok influencers:

White House officials hosted a private Zoom briefing for about 30 influential TikTok creators to keep them informed of the latest US messaging regarding Ukraine, according to the Washington Post.

The briefing was conducted by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Council adviser Matt Miller. Several of the social media stars have since gone on to post about Ukraine.

The topic included the US ""strategic goals in the region"", according to the Post, such as how the US would respond to a Russian nuclear escalation and how US aid dollars are being spent to help Ukraine.

Highlights and Quotes:

Russian commanders now scared of being killed, hiding, can’t communicate with their own units: 
> Reports from prisoners of war also suggest that Russian officers fearful of being on the front line **have withdrawn beyond 18 kilometres radio range of secure sets**, forcing soldiers to use mobile phones. . . . The intensity of fighting, with western estimates putting Russians killed at 6,000, along with **commanders being deliberately targeted by Ukrainian snipers**, has apparently **led to officers being absent on the front line.**

POWs now say this **led to inability contact command, so then open comms, thus giving away/commanders position—the exact thing trying to avoid**: 
>...shortages in long-range radios had prevented contact with generals commanding the entire invasion. This had resulted in troops using mobile phones to contact officers and “gain some situational awareness,” said the report.

Further, russians are reported to have stolen civilian hand radios. But now, such a reliance is just another ludicrous weak point. 
> Russian-speaking Ukrainians might now be feeding “false or misleading traffic” [on the hand-radios] that is allowing them to “sow disorganisation, doubt and demoralisation” among Russian units.

My mom's childhood friend is a plastic surgeon. Her son was a protest organizer against Lukashenko two years ago. He had to flee the country because there was a warrant out for his arrest. He fled to Kyiv. Now, he had to flee again but has nowhere to go because he can't return to Minsk. The mom can't find any work - because of sanctions and low savings, few people in the country can afford elective cosmetic procedures. So, she's broke. My parents used to send friends money back to Belarus, because their conditions are so bad. But, with the disconnect of the banks/Paypal/etc, they can no longer send money back to help those that need it.

So, while I don't have a lot of sympathy for Russians - most of whom support Putin - I have a ton of sympathy for Belarussians, millions of whom went out to protest against their dictator at great risk two years ago.

Belarus would attack in the west, and there would be fervent pushback from their own people (villagers).
*“Belarusian troops’ motivation is even lower than that of the Russians,” Karl said. “And the western Ukrainian — the probable approach line of Belarusian units — nationalist and anti-Russian sentiment would make the terrain very hostile toward them.”*

Putin should absolutely have known the reports and assessments were false.  (I myself have seen both Jack Barsky and Andrei Kozyrev say the same thing in the last week—Putin knows russian intelligence and military assessments are fabricated to please superiors—bc Putin himself did this as an agent in East Germany.)
*Still another problem bedeviling Moscow is its arsenal, which also seems to have been largely the product of Potemkin imagination, according to Karl. “Putin was told he had [something like] 10,000 missiles. In fact, he had 1,000. It’s peculiar that he didn’t remember how he was lying to his own bosses as a young KGB officer.

**THE GAMBIT**


*Kenya* introduces a bill which proposes we take seriously the accusations of the gentleman sitting in the Soviet Union seat. We propose an investigation of these serious claims along with the related questions the Chinese delegation raised during the previous meeting.




**THE PROPOSAL** (with cooperation from two countries in question)

* the United States invites an international delegation to visit a sample of the aforementioned 300 or so sites so that we may learn about what goes in in such facilities. The delegation will consist of international observers and subject matter experts including experts from the Russian Federation and China and any other Security Council who wish to visit.
* Ukraine **likewise** invites an international delegation to visit a sample of the 30 or sites so that we may learn about what goes in in such facilities. The delegation will consist of international observers and subject matter experts including experts from the Russian Federation and China and any other Security Council who wishes to visit. **Of course**, this will first require cessation of hostilities in Ukraine along with a reasonable protective force to escort the delegation to the sites in question.

**THE OUTCOME**

This will **force** vote which will go exactly one of two ways:

* **15-0** in which case we actually do the tour and sacrifice some secrecy but with neither Russia nor China learning anything fundamentally new.

* **14-1** in which case Russia is shown to be diplomatically isolated and furthermore insincere with the UNSC.

I get why people personally impacted by this are very frustrated and angry and feel helpless but it’s not true at all that the US isn’t helping Ukraine and obviously Biden needs to speak to and for the *American* people. Besides, it would be stupid for him to make a big announcement about going to war directly with Russia *now* (I don’t think we will but I still believe there might be ways for the US to somehow act which will not be broadcast in advance). I get not everyone is going to like POTUS’s decisions on everything no matter the topic, but blaming the US for Russia is getting old although I’m trying to be mindful of the great stress people are under.

Can US farmers be asked to go ahead and plan to plant instead of waiting to see what happens to the export market? (As mentioned in the article) 

In the past we have paid farmers NOT to grow. Perhaps it’s time to subsidize farmers to GROW? Subsidize the increased fuel costs? Increased cost of fertilizer? Perhaps incentives to grow more of crops that Ukraine was a crucial supplier of, like sunflowers(for oil) and wheat, (in appropriate amounts and correct environments).

Trumps trade war with China led to China developing new trade partners. Russia and Brazil increased production and market share. Russia will sell to China, but perhaps Brazil can be brought into the planning of how to avoid these famines? 

Last thought: a vegetarian meal has roughly half the carbon footprint of an omnivore meal. (This is a rough average, it varies a lot depending on the cuisine, types and sources of meats and grains eaten,etc. ) This is because it takes multiple pounds of grain fed to animal to harvest a pound of meat. But not all kinds of meat have big carbon footprints. Just cutting out beef from one day a week will cut your carbon footprint by 7%. This frees up grains and fuel to help ease global shortages. 

While individual choices can’t solve everything, perhaps some changes and planning can ease this looming disaster. Perhaps consider choosing the non-beef option, or a vegetarian meal a few times a week?",False,1647050095.0,t3_tc2ait,t3_tc2ait,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Been learning more about the Maidan Revolution and the historical leaders who inspired the people that overthrew the corrupt government.

Stepan Bandera was a Ukranian hero who fought during WW2 against some of Ukraine's worst enemies. He helped form the Nachtigall Batallion which fought in Lviv. 

He was posthumously granted the title of ""Hero of Ukraine"" and became an inspiration for the same brave Ukrainians that fight today against the same nationalists.

""In the current, digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness. Never fading, always accessible. Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander...

All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate.  The digital society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards the development of convenient half-truths. 

Just look at the strange juxtapositions of morality:  Billions spent on new weapons in order to humanely murder other humans. Rights of criminals are given more respect than the privacy of their victims. Although there are people suffering in poverty, huge donations are made to protect endangered species.

You exercise your right to ""freedom"" and this is the result. All rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt. The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value systems.

Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid of a larger forum. They stay inside their little ponds, leaking whatever ""truth"" suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large.

The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is invalidated, but nobody is right.  Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being engulfed in ""truth.""

Taiwan, SK, Japan, etc. US and other countries better not say a fucking word when Taiwan or Japan or SK say they want nukes. what, is US going to war against China if China invades Taiwan? i dont think so",False,1647047715.0,t3_tc2ait,t3_tc2ait,,0,-28,0,-28,0,0,

Putin as he has been planning for years gets ready to do what he said for many years. Escalate into a cold war and have another cuban missile crisis. He said America tried to destroy Russia after the Cold War and gained all this leverage and put missiles on his border and if we don’t move them, he will do that. 

He lays out his grievances and then his philosophy of mutually assured destruction being balancing. 




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo&t=115s  

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  


So he tells China Dash I can guarantee you all of the American business in Russia in one year. What do you have to do for it? Just stay out of this. Just wait. And in the end I will make you more powerful in your position in the world

Then Putin just needs to invade Ukraine and beat the west into firing a shot. Then he can escalate and try out these missiles he’s been bragging about for a while

https://youtu.be/j9kbiXVjeMc

He wants a new security deal and for the west to back off his borders. What language does he have? Clearly he’s not gonna get any leverage by starting a war. We won’t say if you stop it will take all our missiles off the border and back away.


One of the few ways he might consider getting leverage as a crazy person is trying to use a hypersonic missile on American soil or American territory. From his point of view Americans go to war without ever having to fear war or bombs on their own soil. Not from a foreigner. Not since Pearl Harbor

If he could get them to have the insecurity of bombs landing in their backyard and the implication that you could send a nuclear weapon undetected, even if he would never use one, I’d be enough to give him some sort of leverage

Notice how quickly the Chinese banks were ready to give accounts to Russia and step in? Notice the declaration of unlimited partnership?

Putin can escalate and how will China gain influence in the world? Well when Putin escalated to these tensions that, in his mind, re-create a new Cuban missile crisis (Technologicall advancements mean you don’t have to get to Cuba. You just need to fire a missile undetected. A hypersonic missile which we, China, and Russia have. And China tested last year. Can you send a rocket into orbit and then fire it from space at 20 times the speed of sound. Radars cannot detect it


Would be then escalate to World War III? Which is what Putin has been talking about and thinks give him leverage? Possibly. So China steps in a negotiates a deal and saves the world. China gains power and prestige and financially in all of this. Putin gets what he wants this entire time. Missiles off of his border, and most importantly Revenge on America who tried to destroy Russia after the Cold War, which is how he puts it

Is Putin Willing to destroy his economy? Yes. He’s doing it. Is he willing even today? Probably. With another man yes. To get revenge on America and leave a lasting legacy that he took the back part of Ukraine and got Nato to back off  -  possibly. He is a psychopath and a megalomaniac who is been two years pretty much only talking to two or three people. And that makes you even more delusional. And he’s done and got in the way with many many many things. Not just rigging elections and hacking but wars and other things like invading Ukraine the first time.

>1/ Many Russian elites are dissatisfied with the war. But these two could not say it spontaneously. This show is pre-recorded and carefully orchestrated. Which means that these discussions were approved and permitted.

This program was not about elite media figures challenging Putin. This was a carefully managed effort to reconcile the Russian internal propaganda about Ukraine with reality, especially the economic shock that cannot be hidden from ordinary Russians.  

Going forward, the most important thing for us is the conclusion:

>6/ The army destroyed the main Ukrainian forces and demoralised the government achieving its goal. Russia cannot “denazify” Ukraine. It should be done by Ukrainians themselves. Russia should make Ukraine neutral but it cannot risk new Afghanistan. Stop the invasion.

To my knowledge, this is the first time that Russian state media has talked about a possible off-ramp for the Ukraine ""special operation"" other than regime change. Russia trying to move the goal posts so that the Russian military already sounds successful is good news for people who want the violence to stop.

If Ukraine would be willing to be ""neutral"" (no EU membership, no national security agencies, limited army, possibly a pro-russian stooge to ""represent"" the russian minority), accept Russian control over Crimea and accept L/DNR independence than yeah, I see Russia withdrawing its troops.

I don't know how you Americans are seeing this move. But from the perspective of a Venezuelan I couldn't have face palmed harder.

Ok, yeah, I get it, strategically it makes sense for the US to improve relationships with Venezuela because Putin's war is affecting the prices of oil and Venezuela is struggling economically so they can convince them easily, take a Putin ally away from him and gain additional oil in the process.

Why am I face palming? Well, because this move means  the weakened dictatorship that has been plaguing my country for over 20 years is going to get stronger thanks to the US. Also, Venezuela has a huge fucking loan debt with Russia and China. Now, with China, Maduro gave the unexplored oil reserves to them as payment guarantee. With Russia they negotiated a payment plan of a loan taken in 2017 where they had to pay 133 Million dollars anually until 2022 and starting from 2023 they must pay  684 Millions annually, and that's not counting the unpaid loan they got from Rosneft valued at 1,500 Million.

I don't know if the US is trying to tell Venezuela that if they turn on Putin the debt will disappear (no idea if the sanctions on Russia could play a part here). But realistically, the money coming from the US to buy Venezuelan oil could be used to pay the debt to Russia, so your dollars are still making it to Putin's war effort and starting next year that income is going to make a huge leap upwards.",1647043669.0,1647043016.0,t3_tc2ait,t1_i0b0ier,,1,66,0,66,0,0,

I imagine that Zelenskyy would give the order for retreating units not to be harassed. Whether or not every single unit would follow that order exactly to the letter is a different question.

As unlikely as it sounds, remember, Zelenskyy is very aware of the world perceptions going on. If Russia were to pull back, Ukraine's victory will have been almost certainly one of the morally/ethically cleanest military victories in modern history (at least till the dust settles and we inevitably find out the little stories here and there that inevitably crop up). The foreign aid money will flood in for a time to help rebuild and rearm.

But if on the eve of victory, Ukraine suddenly starts committing counter atrocities, all that international goodwill will dry up faster than spit in a desert and they'll be left to pick up the pieces on their own.

So in all likelihood, Zelenskyy would take the opportunity and call off attacks and make a public show of supporting the investigation (if not necessarily eventual prosecution) of any that disobey that order.

 >The siege of Leningrad (Russian: блокада Ленинграда; German: Leningrader Blockade) was a prolonged military blockade undertaken from the south by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany against the Soviet city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on the Eastern Front in World War II. The Finnish army invaded from the north, co-operating with the Germans, and completed the ring around the city. The siege began on 8 September 1941, when the Wehrmacht severed the last road to the city. Although Soviet forces managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, the Red Army did not lift the siege until 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began.

Vietnam wasn't a conventional invasion by a foreign power; it might be best understood as starting as a civil war with each side supported by a great power.

See, the thing is, when the Vietnamese earned their freedom from the French by beating them silly at Dien Bien Phu, they split, with communists in the north and the Diem's government in the south. They were supposed to have an election to reunify the country, but knowing that the communists would win in a landslide, Diem reneged. The US, fearing the international spread of communism and Soviet influence, backed him up (initially, check his wiki page to see how things worked out for Diem). The north, as a result, began a guerilla war in the south.

The US initially provided advisors and materiel and economic support, but after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, began sending increasing numbers of combat troops, who increasingly engaged conventional PAVN (North Vietnamese army) units as the war progressed. It's a staggering oversimplification, but it's the quickest way to clarify that Vietnam was a much slower burn, without any conventional conflicts coming close to the scale of the conventional war we've seen today until... 1968ish, I'd guess, because I don't think anything before Tet was similar in scale, but I could be wrong-- four years after the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

The war in Ukraine today is conventional from the outset but may deteriorate into increasingly guerilla engagements, almost the opposite of Vietnam. The main similarity in these very different conflicts, frankly, is a simple fact:

Neither the US in Vietnam nor Russia in Ukraine have sufficient forces, materiel, or national will to successfully occupy a deeply hostile country.

This could become much more similar to Vietnam if Russia continues pouring resources into a war that cannot be won. That was the fundamental American mistake, more than anything else. When you add to that the US, especially early in the war, was far more effective than the Russians today, it could become catastrophic for Russia at an even greater scale than Vietnam.

But I don't know that that happens. Russia is being devastated at home in a way the US never was, and a dictator's grip on power can become tenuous fast. It's much more likely that Russia intends to fight to a strong bargaining position and then negotiate. Putin can't survive a decade of this conflict, literally, because he will be killed long before that (I'm emphatically not suggesting I believe a coup is in any way likely in the short term but I believe after a few years of this his position becomes untenable). And that's what it would take, along with a much larger commitment of blood and treasure.

So I don't think it's an easy comparison. They each have claims to being greater blunders, but Putin could significantly blunt the magnitude of this one before it becomes Vietnam by finding an offramp, but fighting this to the hilt will end him.",1647055032.0,1647054576.0,t3_tc2ait,t1_i0bd2hz,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

North Vietnam could not take any territory in the south, until 2 years after the US left. 

The real lesson to learn was propping up a country and fighting their battles for them is a good way to never leave that country. See also Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Russia couldn’t figure out logistics to supply troops located 50 miles from their own border. They were supposed to have air supremacy day 1 and they can’t even seem to bomb Ukrainian airfields.

We should not forget how this war started after all and how it evolved into Groznyficiation of cities nowadays.


There is a bit of a scary mental experiment - try putting yourself into Putin&co shoes and mindset (haha):


Russian incursion is nothing short of catastrophe, we are essentially embargoed and forbidden to trade or even try to workaround with sanctions, due to secondary sanctions and pressure in regards to access to US+EU+Japan+SK markets (no nation can resist more or less, even China), the future is incredibly bleak and its a blow from which nation may never recover or straight up fall apart. What are the options? (and all of them are extremely negative for RuFed)


Option#1 aka best case scenario for world - a coup with arrests and a trial of Security council members  and a whole bunch of ""collaborators"" + liberalization of Russian political system at the very least (basically unscrew the screws, the warming of relations as a goal). In regards to Ukraine - buy Crimea/land lease with buying in the future as a goal, Donbass up to negotiations, Ukraine as a whole can join EU, but is prevented in some sort of shape or form or bound by some treaties from joining NATO. 


Its an extremely passive option for Russia, since the treaty won't be worth shit, when Russia weakens and Ukraine will be accepted into NATO right here and there (understandably so, in geopolitics no one gives a shit about agreements, if its suits nations interests). It basically leaves Russia with a knife next to its throat from a purely geopolitical/map viewing perspective after some time passes. 

Russia pays for damages aka its reserve 600 bln $ fund is gone. 


In this best case scenario sanctions are swiftly removed and Russia rolls back in its development at least 10 years or so, all the while NATO rapidly remilitarizes spearheaded by Germany, Finland and Sweden are possibly new members and reducing dependency on Russian oil/gas also continues in overdrive mode, which leaves Russia with very little sources of revenue and that's not even mentioning the whole 2050 climate goals of various nations and desire to reduce emissions and consumption of gas/oil which is bad for Russian economy.

 
Russia looses all money for potential modernization attempts, while the world continues in its modernization and reducing reliance on fossils, while getting a 40 mln neighbor who hates u to the core. (+ since u can't modernize, EU+U.S. prolly pressure u to the max, caz hurr, durr, u can't meet climate goals and all your meager local production goes under knife)


Option#2, since things are not looking too hot and u do not desire to die (remember, u are currently Putin and his friends), your goal shifts from initial regime change in Ukraine and the whole denazification/demilitarization more towards inflicting a colossal amount of pain and suffering for Ukrainians, destroy as much as possible being the goal using conventional means and hope to break the spirit (?). Its expensive and does not fit the narrative of liberation from Nazis and the whole special operation thing, but its not like u have much to loose - everything that could be sanctioned of importance is already sanctioned, so WHY NOT? 


At the very least that will teach them a lesson (don't forget about the nature of Russian statehood and how its essentially a mafia/gang), ""bitch dared to resist!"".


In this scenario Russia becomes a de-facto Vassal of China, rolls back at least 30 years or so in development and becomes an extreme rogue statue, supplying all sorts of dangerous shit all around the world to all sorts of elements, again, nothing to loose more or less. The modus operandi shifts towards extreme hostile behavior. 


Its the Cold War 2.0 scenario, which leaves Ukraine alive, which hates Russia even more than in scenario #1, but at least it exists in some shape of form. 


In this scenario u kind a need a big enough shocking false flag if u want to mobilize Russia to level Ukraine to the ground, otherwise current forces can't really meet the desired outcome and losses would be too high (remember, u are great Ruler who will lead Russia to glory and all that)


Option#3 this one is the worst case scenario and its ugly to the core. ""Carthagen must be destroyed or Rome is doomed"" type of thing. Complete destruction of Ukraine and genocide of Ukrainians, the more u can ""Krush, kill & destroy"" (c) - the better. 


Again, Russia in modern media = Nazi Germany (and its not unbiased, too many ugly parallels for anyone who read history books).


This too requires a false flag shocking enough to trigger disproportionate response or escalation at the level - u use dirty bomb/Chem weapons on the territory of Ukraine (or your own) and see the reactions, if NATO moves - u warn that they will be nuked and if they still want to continue, u launch a ""de-escalatory tactical nuclear strike"" as a warning.


In this scenario Ukraine becomes a wasteland, on which normal life is more or less impossible, a land poisoned either by Chemical weapons or maybe even radiation, depending how it goes. 


This scenario is quite unstable by design, because there are too many variables - NATO response to getting tactically nuked, when they decide to escalate in regards to Ukraine getting WMD'ed, Chinas response due to vaaaastly different world that they hoped for and its a road nowhere so to speak, because even if it won't trigger WW3 outright and NATO de-escalates (or not escalates in the first place and leave Ukraine to die), the endgame is the same - either Russia is exterminated or NATO is. 


Which is turn will trigger Nuclear arms race worse than Cold war one and it will be a short one, as soon as Russia feels it cannot keep up (and it cannot), its ""end of the line"" and ""lights out"", with all the consequences. 



The scariest part of all of this, is that even though Option #1 & #2 are both feasible and likely (with some variations, but basics remain the same), the ""final solution"" one **increasingly** looks more and more likely to happen and that's a very bad thing. 


After 2014 Russia chose worst case scenario in regards to Ukraine (sadly i even got it right 7 years ago :/) and in current climate in regards to sanctions and perspectives, with no real ""outs"" as a nation, i'm afraid that it just might choose the worst path yet again.


 At the very least, I don't see any feasible scenario that does not leave Russia ruined/becoming vassal and while during Soviet times there was a belief about Western help/brighter future, nowadays no one has any illusions (?), which means peaceful dissolution is increasingly unlikely. When there is nothing to loose, who cares if the world burns? At least u will have company on road to hell or heaven (as per Putin fantasies).",False,1647063239.0,t3_tc2ait,t1_i0buzbh,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Ukraine might also allow a constitutional reform to recognize and protect Russian minority groups within the country.

Putin will be able to call it a victory for all of his points at home - the rest of the world will see it for what it is (absolute humiliation of a former superpower by its smaller neighbour, on the scale of the Russo-Japanese war in the early 1900s), but Putin will have just enough to have met his war goals, if you squint hard enough and jump through a few mental hoops.

NATO membership is easily Russia's biggest sticking point, and the thing Ukraine is likely to give up the easiest - after all, do they really need NATO at this point?

1. Russian withdrawal without negotiation, in the face of military and economic collapse. Invasion force has reached loss levels that indicate military collapse is possible (and losses would ramp rapidly if troops did not withdraw). No sufficient reinforcements are staged and ready.

I think it's less that they've underestimated Ukraine's ability and more, as you've said, that they've overestimated the ability of the Russian Armed Forces. There's a historical pattern of Western military analysts overestimating Soviet abilities in certain areas (e.g. the abilities of the MiG-25, the ""missile gap""), but today, I suspect that contemporary Western military analysts looked at a small number of campaigns that Putinist Russia has fought - on a smaller scale than this one - and taking into consideration the genuine and legitimate fear of Soviet capabilities in the past, didn't realise just how bad the rot seems to have set in with Russian military proficiency in certain key areas.

I don't think you're going to find many analysts which predicted this happening; it was received wisdom for a reason until now. But there's still that lingering fear that the Russians could turn this around remaining.

What do you propose for a solution to ending Russia's war then?  Continuing our current strategy of sanctions and the renewed Lend-Lease act. I'm guessing you're also pro-insurgency as well. I'm assuming you've only seen an insurgency from a very long distance.

You're making a couple logical fallacies in that NATO being attacked makes nukes suddenly not matter and that nukes are more deadly than conventional warfare. 

I agree that nukes are deadly, but so are bullets, bombs, missiles, landmines, the biological/chemical weapons that it seems like Russia might use.

You seem to not understand that the ""red line"" you keep saying NATO has drawn is subject to the same reasons why we shouldn't get involved in Ukraine.

Nukes.

You're basically saying that we shouldn't get involved militarily because of nukes. We should let the Ukrainians be the ones who die, who watch their children murdered, who watch their women be raped because Russia has nukes.

Conveniently, biological, chemical and radioactive non-nuclear weapons (like dirty bombs, nuclear power plant ""accidents"", etc) don't make the red line.

So if/when Russia attacks Lithuania, Poland, Romania? Oh, would you look at that... Russia still has nukes. So, per your logic, we should just back down again. Yes, I know you said that Russia attacking NATO was a red line, but the nukes are still there and you and every other anti-interventionist seems to fail to grasp that.

But, I forgot, everyone who wants military intervention in Ukraine must be a bunch of idiots and only the wise and enlightened are against it.

I get why you're afraid of military intervention but Jesus Christ, just say that you're afraid. Stop trying to pull all this holier than thou shit. Tell us that you'd rather see Ukrainians die than see your own country getting attacked (until your country is getting attacked because you didn't take enough action to stop Russian aggression in Ukraine). Tell us that you would rather watch Putin and Russia commit genocide than intervene.

Your arguments don't help Ukrainians. Because *if* nukes get launched they would all die, we should just let them be bombed and shot and raped and let their country be destroyed. Sure, we've enacted sanctions (that Germany is already fighting against and apparently rhe UK is being super slow to enact) and yea, we're sending weapons and intel. NATO has made it perfectly obvious that if those shipments get cut off they'll just throw up their hands and say ""we tried.""

The average Ukrainian already seems to be leaning towards an Anti-NATO stance since NATO seems to be sitting on their hands. Yes, they're providing weapons and intel (and they should continue to do so and provide more), but Ukraine is fighting against an enemy that doesn't value humanity at all. We're not doing enough to help them.

Yes, it is difficult to wrap your head around going to war but sometimes there is a clearly defined right and wrong thing. Standing up to tyrants, stopping genocide, fighting against injustice, these are the right things to do.

Fuck, man, I can see the logic, needs of the many vs needs of the few, but russian shills are using the same arguments so the west just keeps sitting on our hands while they kill as many civilians as they can. Maybe it takes more strength to not fight, but the anti-interventionist arguments smack of cowardice and appeasement.

I respect your position, but I disagree vehemently with it. Instead of trying to understand you just tell people that they're stupid and wrong and they should wait for diplomacy to work while Ukrainians fight for their lives.

Having nukes as well, or having more nukes means fuck all. The 'point' of a nuclear deterrence is the second part - deterrence. Each nuclear armed nation has enough nukes in their missile tubes and submarines to wipe out each and every other nuclear armed nation on their own.

The point is to stop nuclear armed nations attacking you, but in return the risk to attack nuclear armed nations is too high. By pushing past that deterrence and attacking an armed nation you unlock the box and peak inside - what happens then? The unknown at that point is why **no one** will do it in Ukraine (regardless of whoever calls for it on the internet or in Ukraine's government, as much as they have their reasons) - the risk of getting that wrong is potential annihilation for most of the world's population.

cb95236444aed69cdd034daae2a3ecdc,tc2ait,i0axbzt,"This all seems too easy. Make a deal with China. Invade Ukraine thinking you would provoke the west into firing shots. The minute the west fires shots Putin tells his isolated people that America is attacked in Russia just like he said they would all these years. That’s why they put their weapons on NATO’s border 

China here’s the deal. I will give you all of America‘s business in Russia and help increase your power in the world. All I ask from you is to stay out. And eventually to broker a deal once we escalate to nuclear tensions and the “new Cuban missile crisis“ that Putin has been talking about for years. He said it will balance power and take back the leverage america gained after the cold

Then he would have carte blanche, his people would allow him to do anything. And they would believe we are attacking them. And he could easily convince them that we are going to nuke them because America did drop the bomb before. You say see, America dropped a bomb on Japan they will drop it on us now


You can escalate. You can get Poseidon and all of your nuclear submarines going. Evading defenses as you’ve been practicing and maneuvering. You could whip out your hypersonic missile and fire on any American target or territory just to show them that the paradigm will be shifted and has shifted. America goes to war thinking they will never have water on their soil. So they do it as if it is a little concerned to start a war and murder people and do everything we are seeing on TV now. That’s another irony. Everything we’ve ever done Putin is not doing to us almost tongue-in-cheek. Literally the same strategy of declaring something independent, calling yourself a peacekeeper, and putting your missiles up along the border. It’s what we did in the 90s. 

If this was a spy novel, you make a deal with China. You give them all of Russia’s American business and you do it in a month. You don’t even have to kick out the Americans they leave themselves

You invade Ukraine and you escalate. Once America fires, you attack them with a hypersonic missile and really that might be the only leverage that makes America take pause. The idea that not only can they be attacked on their own soil if they start a war, but the mutually assured destruction got weirder. You can nuke somebody before they even know that the missile is coming with a hypersonic missile


Then, being a megalomaniac’s and thinkin you can control everything and nothing goes wrong - there are no accidents - Russia comes in and becomes the new Geo political leader.  They have the unbelievable fortune of brokering a deal with america and russia. Russia may get some security concessions like they have wanted for decades. We move out our nukes. Maybe some deal with Ukraine.  China gets a stronger better financial system and partnership with Russia. The American dollar gets depressed. America gives up security concessions. Putin dies with a legacy that he brought down America and God even, even if he dies or goes to jail he wouldn’t care. He’s sacrificing for the long term. In the long term Russia will do better with the partnership with Russia. Russia is stronger and will more quickly surpass America financially but also in their Geo political mate. Then even as a partner Russia and China together become the new global power. Or don’t


He is a psychopath. A cold calculated killer. And he probably has everything planned out and has been saying it for years. That’s the irony. He told us he would do this. If this ends up with China being stronger and bigger and better than that’s good enough for Russia if it means pushing down America and getting concessions like he wants. It’s his legacy

On the plus side you could use the onboard systems as recon so the trip could serve two purposes. You could even have some armaments and engage targets along the route.￼

But just making a simple drone that only drops supplies could be fairly inexpensive. The air frame need not be expensive but the guidance might be the expressive part along with possibly the engine depending on how big you got. I’m thinking along the lines of a really big r/c airplane, flight systems would be kept simple and just set a target with gps. Heck you could just make a simple large plane, have it fly via gps and once over target kills engine and parachutes. After it’s retrieved maybe pull payload, flip a switch for return gps vector start it back up and let it fly home.

The internet runs on [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol), which is a path vector routing protocol.  Entities on the internet running BGP are referred to as ""Autonomous Systems"", or AS'es in short.  I'd say think of an AS like a person, with people you know or have met being your ""peers"".  To get to someone else, you follow the chain of people you know - ie if you know Alice and Alice knows Bob and you want to talk to Bob, you hand the message to Alice and tell her to give it to Bob.  You and Alice could also have a mutual friend Dave, meaning you could give the message to Dave, who then gives it to Alice, who gives it to Bob, but what BGP does is that it determines that the shortest chain of people to deliver the message is through Alice, so it gives the message to her.

LINX is an internet exchange - think of it as someone who talks to a lot of different people, but doesn't really travel.  They're not always the best route, but they might do things like peer with Apple/Facebook/Google/etc, meaning they might have a better route to those common services.  The other important category here is tier 1 carriers - think of these as long distance messengers who also talk to a lot of people.  These are companies like Level3/CenturyLink, Cogent, Hurricane Electric, etc.  These Tier 1 carriers all talk to each other too, because of their role as the backbone of the internet, and many of them run what is known as looking glass services.  A looking glass service is a lot like playing 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon, only instead of trying to find the shortest path, you try to find all of the paths.

I plugged the ASNs mentioned by LINX into Hurricane Electric's looking glass, and it seems these companies aren't anywhere near from being cut off yet.

[AS12389](https://bgp.he.net/AS12389#_graph4)

 >A battalion tactical group (Russian: Батальонная тактическая группа, batal'onnaya takticheskaya gruppa), abbreviated as BTG, is a combined-arms manoeuvre unit deployed by the Russian Army that is kept at a high level of readiness. A BTG typically comprises a battalion (typically mechanised infantry) of 2–4 companies reinforced with air-defence, artillery, engineering, and logistical support units, formed from a garrisoned army brigade. A tank company and rocket artillery also typically reinforce such groupings. BTGs formed the mainstay of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine from 2013–2015, particularly in the Donbass war.

Not really. That is based upon the assumption that as Russia has the *global ability* to level Ukraine to the ground, that Ukraine has already lost. No doubt that Russia could carpet bomb Kyiv from the air tomorrow, drop heavy bombs, or send in countless cruise missiles.

On the other hand, Russia chose a rather conventional invasion. In addition, the ""100% certainty"" line of thinking assumes that sanctions will prove ineffective.

If Russia were to totally destroy Ukraine, the next step of installing a ""puppet regime"" would prove ridiculous.

Either it ties up troops they desperately need in Ukraine (and NATO will know if the troops sent are actually combat troops or just the 403rd Catering Corps or something), or NATO proves that Russia doesn't see NATO as a real threat which undermines what little justification Russia has for attacking Ukraine.

If Russia chooses the latter path it will drive a wedge between them and their few remaining allies who will see this is just a cheap power grab not an act of defense. It will mean other nations are more hesitant to send troops or to trade with Russia for fear of being caught in the sanction crosshair themselves. Even China is not safe from sanctions.

However, if Russia sends troops, it will impact their ability to wage war in Ukraine. NATO will send more troops and expect Russia to do the same.

The program began in the 1920s and lasted until at least September 1992 but has possibly been continued by Russia after that. During World War II, Joseph Stalin was forced to move his biological warfare (BW) operations out of the way of advancing German forces and may have used tularemia against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. By 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union.

Then days worth of cookies…  

Then just a few…  

And now you’re officially out of cookies, and you can never get them again unless you take serious action. Most people would assume you’d apologize for what you’ve done and work to regain people’s trust…  

… but there are rare cases when the kid would rather not apologize, and resort to stealing or even violence.

Nobody ever wakes up one day and its a world War.  It takes months to years for each nation to get dragged in on either side.  

The reason this could be WW3 is that de-escalation *is really fucking hard*.  The only thing we really have going for us is we live in a world much more aware of history and how these things shake out.  We are well aware that once things start to escalate we can't stop it, even if we think we are trying to.  

Go read through the full time line and history of both world wars and you'll find that this is exactly how it starts.  Both times it was a confrontation that was supposed to be over quickly - ended up being prolonged and neither side backing down.  Sanctions  all around until a merchant vessel of an ally gets targeted - pissing off a populace and changing their minds about wanting to fight.

Your arguments can be applied for why NATO shouldn't help a NATO nation as well. As you, probably, aren't leading NATO, what you or I think about the situation means jackshit. NATO is constantly de-escalating while Russia is escalating to de-escalate. That's their strategy.

I hope I'm wrong about NATO and I hope to God they'd fight back if Russia attacks them, but based on their past actions I think they won't. I think they're run by a fucking coward who'll back off and back off until the USSR is there again. The only time they enacted Article 5 was against Afghanistan and most of the NATO countries seemed to think it'd be a cakewalk.

And yes, it's a rant. As you pointed out I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated by NATO's cowardice, I'm frustrated by Russia's existence at this point. I'm frustrated that we're watching the beginning of a genocide occur and we aren't stopping it.

And I'm frustrated by this constant argument here that if your country isn't in NATO then your life is less valuable than someone in a NATO country.


It is fucking infuriating that NATO and the US Army, where they drill it into you that you have a moral imperative to do the right thing, do fucking next to nothing during Russia's war. The world would rather watch every Ukrainian die than get their hands dirty.

I get it. You don't want to fight. You don't want to worry about nukes. You aren't in any danger and you want to stay that way.

I'd like to stay safe too, but there are times when doing the right thing means being in danger. If I could, I'd go fight, but I have people to care for.

If you're for non-intervention then at least work towards making Russia pay for their barbarity and their war crimes. Don't buy into the propaganda that we can't do anything beyond our current actions because Russia will start WW3.

Idk why I'm debating with you. You aren't going to change your mind and I'm not either. And you're probably right, the world is a cold cruel place filled with terrible people who generally don't give a shit about anything other than themselves. NATO won't lift a finger more than it has, the US won't help more than it has. Russia will eventually recover from the sanctions and get away with its crimes.

If he has powerful opposition and allies who might become opposition for the sake of business it can. I gurantee you Putin is sleeping with one eye open right now because he knows some of his oligarchs are probably gauging if they should ""suicide"" Putin for the sake of their interest or Russias interest.

And even if it doesn't oust Putin militaries still need funding and supplies which get much harder to do with bad sanctions. Wars are expensive and troops need to be paid and fed to make them function well. Just look at how the ANA disintegrated in Afghanistan. Some of them weren't even getting fed. Then surprise surprise they just walked away from their posts. Even if Putin takes every last bit of luxury goods and crumb of food and buries himself in some mountain bunker the sanctions will have broken the Russian army.

As for this ""new super power of China India and Russia"" idea I don't really buy it. China would rather trade with America than Russia generally. China has disputed territory and tensions with both Russia and India to boot. I doubt any of them trust each other or get along like say the US and EU get along. Its also very hard to just become self reliant when everything from the economy to manufacturing is so globally interdependent.

It's worth noting that Biden declaring we aren't getting involved is not a binding statement. There's nothing about those words stopping him from ordering the military to intervene if Russia DOES actually break out the gas.

And at the end of the day, as much as it sucks, there's the simple fact that the sanctions approach IS working. The Russian economy is running out of slack (stored goods in warehouses for grocery stores and such) and once they default on their debts in the next month things will get MUCH worse.

In an ideal world, Putin gassing Ukraine would immediately get him bitchslapped by a proper army. But the world we live in has severe risks with regard to those nukes. By just cranking up the sanctions further and further, if Russia doesn't pull back, it WILL suffer a general collapse of a sort never seen before from a modern nation. At that point the war ends simply because nobody is bothering to ship bullets to the front anymore. It comes with all sorts of OTHER problems, but those are for future-us to deal with.

But if NATO attacks, even if only to clear out Ukraine and nothing further, it becomes MUCH easier for Putin to reach for the nukes. There's a direct threat to deal with. He might have generals that would refuse a deployment order over economic sanctions but would agree to such an order with NATO sweeping the floor with their forces in Ukraine.

The shitty SHITTY consequence is that we can't give Putin that justification. So if he gasses a town, the world leaders have two choices on their hand. Choice 1) Stay the course, it WILL work, it's just a matter of when. Grit our teeth and pray for forgiveness from the next town. Choice 2) Bite the bullet, say that our souls cannot handle the burden of letting these people die this way, and we risk everything.

I advocate for neither choice and would not blame our leaders for whichever choice they pick, but that is fundamentally what the choice comes down to.

""The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the UN Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval.[56] The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.[57]""

 >The ten stages of genocide are an academic model created by Gregory Stanton, the founding president of Genocide Watch, to explain how  genocide develops. The stages are not linear, and several may occur simultaneously. Stanton's stages are a conceptual model for analyzing the events and processes that lead to genocide, and for determining preventive measures. In 1996, Stanton presented a briefing paper called ""The 8 Stages of Genocide"" to the United States Department of State.

>Tesla has been criticized for selling and promoting its so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) add-on, when in fact the software requires drivers' constant supervision and is not actually capable of full self-driving.[42][43] Despite its name and marketing hype, Tesla's Full Self-Driving is generally considered a SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance system, similar to competitors' offerings such as General Motors' Super Cruise and Ford's Co-Pilot360.[44] However, legal scholars William Widen and Philip Koopman argue that Tesla has misrepresented FSD as SAE Level 2 in order to ""avoid regulatory oversight and permitting processes required of more highly automated vehicles"".[45] They argue that FSD should actually be considered a SAE Level 4 technology, and have urged state Departments of Transportation in the U.S. to classify it as such, because publicly available videos show that ""beta test drivers operate their vehicles as if to validate SAE Level 4 (high driving automation) features, often revealing dramatically risky situations created by use of the vehicles in this manner.""[45]


>Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that Tesla vehicles will be capable of full autonomy in the near future, but a Freedom of Information Act request made by PlainSite revealed that Tesla told the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in December 2020 they ""do not expect significant enhancements"" to the Full Self-Driving software that would enable full self-driving.[43][46] In May 2021, the California DMV said it was investigating whether Tesla violated state regulations by misleading customers in its claims about ""full self-driving"".[47] In Germany in July 2020, authorities ruled that Tesla misled consumers regarding the ""abilities of its automated driving systems"" and banned it from using certain marketing language implying autonomous driving capabilities.[48]


>Bryant Walker Smith, an autonomous vehicle law expert at the University of South Carolina, said ""it's so obviously clear that there's a contradiction"" between what Tesla is saying in its marketing of Full Self-Driving versus what its lawyers and engineers have told the DMV.[35] Smith said that using the name Full Self-Driving ""leaves the domain of the misleading and irresponsible to something that could be called fraudulent"".[49]




In 2015, Musk said he did not think making fully autonomous cars was very difficult,[121] and predicted ""complete autonomy"" by 2018.[122] As of March 2020, Tesla was ranked last by Navigant Research for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.[123] Musk has claimed that Tesla vehicles are capable of ""full self-driving"", but Tesla's Autopilot is only a Level 2 advanced driver-assistance system, requiring drivers to maintain full attention and be prepared to take control of the vehicle at a moment's notice.[124] In 2019, Musk said that Tesla would have more than 1 million robotaxis on the road in 2020, and sold a ""Full Self-Driving"" package, despite the technology not yet being available.[125][126] Experts stated the prediction was unrealistic and Tesla had no chance of achieving it.[127] In April 2020, Musk admitted that ""punctuality is not my strong suit"" and robotaxis in some form could be in operation sometime in 2021.[128] In 2021, Musk opened the Las Vegas Convention Center loop which only uses a fully human-operated Tesla Model 3 fleet in a single lane tunnel with a capacity lower than any transit.[129] In 2022, Jalopnik noted that Musk has promised full self-driving ""Next Year"" for nine consecutive years.[130]
Musk claimed in 2016 that the Nevada Gigafactory would be a net zero-emissions facility, running on 100% renewable energy from solar panels covering the factory's roof.[131][132] The Gigafactory has been operational since July 2016,[133] but as of December 2019, only a small portion of the solar panels necessary to power the factory have been installed.[134]
In 2018, Musk eventually conceded that his plan for ""excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake.""[135] Tesla ended up building some of its Model 3 cars in a tent using mostly manual labor who used shortcuts.[136]
Musk said that 2019 would be the ""year of the solar roof,"" and was hoping Tesla would manufacture 1,000 roofs a week by the end of the year.[137] Publications estimated that solar roofs were installed on less than 100 homes and challenged his prediction.[138] Then, in June 2020, Tesla cancelled many customers' orders for solar roof installations, saying they were outside of their service area.[138] Customers complained about being upset with this decision since they had placed $1,000 deposits for pre-orders as early as 2017.[139]
Multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers have reportedly approached Tesla for electric vehicle technology that it was supposedly open to sharing and were instead offered the opportunity to purchase regulatory credits by Musk, thus suggesting that the company and Musk ""may not be not as eager for the electric revolution to occur as [they claim]"".[140]

He’s been trying desperately to make this about the US being the aggressor towards Russia, because that is a narrative he could rally his country and “allies” (like a China) around.

Biden has been masterful at not giving Putin anything to actually grab hold of. He’s lead from the back, allowing the EU and Macron to play the role he should in being the voice / face. He’s ignored the blustering about “No Fly Zones” recognizing that such a thing means the US initiating a hot war with Russia. He’s wouldn’t go along with Poland’s hot potato attempt on the MIG deal that would make it “US flies fighter jets to war against Russia.” Simply put, he’s not falling for any of the bait that would allow anyone to paint a credible narrative of the US attacking Russia. 

What he has done, is be very clear in his communications, telegraph his intentions, draw deliberate lines and note the specific consequences of crossing them, and then… do exactly what he said he would. 

Unlike Putin who has lied and blustered and now can’t be trusted at all, Biden has positioned himself to where both allies and enemies know to take him at his word. Poland and the rest of NATO can have confidence that the US will “defend every inch of NATO territory”, and Putin now knows that, unlike himself and the other autocrats/wannabe autocrats, Biden doesn’t bluff and he doesn’t fold - so when Biden says he’s going “all in,” Putin knows he better be holding the winning hand (which he isn’t), or he’s definitely going to lose.",False,1647064164.0,t3_tc2ait,t1_i0c4bhx,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The writer brings up Moldova and then strikes on the Baltics. As we all already know, these are already potential immediate targets for Putin. And many have suggested their small size means he could gamble that NATO wouldn't react as strongly if he hit Riga or Talinn as if he hit Paris or London.

The writer then goes on to discuss the threat of actual conventional strikes on Europe.

Now bear in mind the Baltics have already come up right before this passage.

It stands to reason that the Baltics, already established as prizes for Putin, could be the first targets for such strikes. 

Could my conclusion be wrong? Absolutely. He could well attack Paris and I pray he does not. We know that's Article 5 and things do not end well from there. That goes without saying. But if Putin's gamble is correct and a country like Germany won't come help Estonia...NATO is done, and it's open season on Eastern Europe. He wants to fracture NATO rather than attack it head on.

In pursuit of its policy of preserving peace, preventing war, and enhancing security and stability and as set out in the fundamental security tasks, NATO will seek, in cooperation with other organisations, to prevent conflict, or, **should a crisis arise, to contribute to its effective management, consistent with international law, including through the possibility of conducting non-Article 5 crisis response operations.** The Alliance's preparedness to carry out such operations supports the broader objective of reinforcing and extending stability and often involves the participation of NATO's Partners. NATO recalls its offer, made in Brussels in 1994, to support on a case-by-case basis in accordance with its own procedures, **peacekeeping and other operations under the authority of the UN Security Council or the responsibility of the OSCE, including by making available Alliance resources and expertise.** In this context NATO recalls its subsequent decisions with respect to crisis response operations in the Balkans. Taking into account the necessity for Alliance solidarity and cohesion, participation in any such operation or mission will remain subject to decisions of member states in accordance with national constitutions.
>
> 32. NATO will make full use of partnership, cooperation and dialogue and its links to other organisations to contribute to preventing crises and, should they arise, defusing them at an early stage. A coherent approach to crisis management, as in any use of force by the Alliance, will **require the Alliance's political authorities to choose and co-ordinate appropriate responses from a range of both political and military measures** and to exercise close political control at all stages.

Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from January 27, 2017, until March 6, 2017, when it was superseded by Executive Order 13780.

The drone targeted and killed Soleimani while he was on his way to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in Baghdad. Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Hey China will not only give you every business dollar America has pumped into my country will even give you their offices and infrastructure at half price. Look if china is an up-and-coming superpower that people are predicting will overcome America in 2050, Putin wants to go online with that. He’d rather destroy his economy for a couple of years and then be completely reliant on China who he believes is going to give him fair and better deals. And he will not sanction him when he tries to do whatever he wants.


He has single-handedly disrupted the world markets, the economy, the food supply, and it’s just the beginning because this will be felt more and more and more


People think he’s out to get Ukraine. He’s out for more. He’s out for revenge and to cripple or disrupt the position of America. He has said so. He has stated that’s basically his single mission in life.  Get the nukes office border and guarantee Ukraine does not join NATO. So instead he’ll take Ukraine or part of it and find out a way to escalate until things are so tense and disruptive he thinks he will get a deal.

Look at how Russia suddenly is giving India 27% gas discounts. Oil. Do you have all of these major players like India, China, Venezuela, Iran, Korea who figure why do we have to keep working with the Americans? And Putin is willing to gamble at all. What do you have to lose? His life. The way he still at those tables very very far apart from everyone and the way they are reporting nobody knew what he was doing Dash it protects his mother land. Because if he eventually gets caught they’re not going to blame his people and his country. They only need to blame putin.

Putins KGB to the car. His whole life is a single mission. Get back at the Americans for trying to step on the neck of Russia and destroy their country and economy after the Cold War. Because in his mind the cold war was supposed to be a standoff that was balancing. And when we declared peace and tore down the wall it should’ve been more fair and more balanced. He said “we could’ve been friends. We didn’t even have to be friends but we could have been willing to work together.“

I’ve been studying russian in Ukrainian history my whole life. My grandparents lived literally in the center of fighting during World War II, the west of Ukraine. Lviv. They were refugees. They lost everything. They had the wherewithal to get to the west before they closed us Germany and split it into two. I have family in Ukraine now. And family members who are Russian and like they say in the news, they called their family and they don’t believe it. It’s preposterous. Russia would never invade your crane. And you see others on YouTube channels who are explaining that we are fighting Nazis and we will suffer like we did before with our economy and food shortages but we have to do this. I have studied Russia and its origins and conflict in college and for many years afterwards. And like I had posted I was keeping track of all of these unsettling things Putin was doing before 2020. I personally think before Covid he was planning to do this sooner. And he was expecting Trump to be an office. But during Covid he isolated himself and probably had even crazier ideas. And then he decided to start the process. This process is not just about Ukraine. Yes he would love to add bringing Ukraine back into Russia as part of his legacy. But he would risk his life and risk it all to get back in America. I personally do not believe he would ever risk firing a nuclear weapon. Only he is insane enough to think he can micromanage a new Cuban missile crisis. And we almost made a mistake in the first missile crisis. Russia was sure that America launched a missile and a Russian soldier refused to push the button and it turns out it was an error. 


I mean American people need to study his speeches even the ones he gave before he invaded. It’s the same message. He’s been warning and threatening this for years. Give me what I want or I will escalate because you leave me no choice

That is the easiest one to find if I don’t go digging. This guy knew the roof of a tank and was ready for it. He had been buying go to stave off insulation for a long time. He has been building new subs and bragging about it. And hypersonic missile‘s. And we don’t know if he really has it but it would be foolish not to consider it. He could steal or buy the technology from China because they do have it. Certainly. They tested it last year for the world to see


This is the long game. Soviet leaders have always been willing to risk the lives of their people and their livelihood for the long game. Stalin bragged to one of our presidents during World War II that he killed 25 million of his own people. The Ukrainians have always felt the Russians were more brutal than the Nazis and were more terrified of them. Because Styling with throw people into the Gulag and get rid of any dissent. And slowly Putin has been doing this on a lesser scale. He doesn’t give a crap of his people suffer for 10 years or five. Because to him it’s justified that he will give them a better global position and a better deal. And the better quality of life by working with China and helping them become the super powers sooner. And allow in China to be the world police for a while. Prop up China and try to push down America. Russia is resigned to understand that they will not be number one.

So while you’re right it may be more simple. It actually may be a lot of KGB tactics and sleight-of-hand. I don’t believe he went in with planes smoking in the sky and tanks falling apart and tattered uniforms. That’s insane. He won the wars in Chechnya, Syria, Georgia, and others. He invited Ukraine successfully the first time. Although he didn’t use soldiers outright they were little green men


This guy is using subterfuge.  And he is waiting. He wants this long and drawn out to disrupt the world. And then you’ll see. He’s going to escalate. Not because Ukraine isn’t going well but because escalating has always been the plan. Because he said so for years! To him that’s the irony. I told you all I told you so. I warned you. And the minute details and shows his people, whether it’s a doctored video or real, that American fired missiles or weapons and shut down Russian plane or tank or anything – he then gets to use the thread that America will drop a nuclear bomb. His people will let him do whatever the hell he wants. Even fire hypersonic missile on America. Why? Because America made that stupid mistake of dropping the nuclear bomb. Now most of the world Who supports Russia says America is evil. America drop the bomb they would do it again. Putin is justified America started all these wars. America is a hypocrite.

Why is China so supportive? Why are they using propaganda against America? Why are they saying America would Russia and would attack China next?

Because Putin doesn’t have to tell this guy anything of his plan, he could just ask the Chinese to stay out of it and say don’t worry I will never ever escalate to nukes, you know me.

Let me get all of American business out of Russia. Let me disrupt all of the supply chain. Don’t worry. I already understand a lot of supply issues because of Covid. Let me escalate into this tension and MAD situation and “new Cuban missile crisis“ – and then I guarantee you when you tell me to stop by will. And China gets to play the hero of the world. And increase their global status exponentially for saving or preventing World War III. Sounds crazy? Yes. Improbable? Probably. But if I could think of something like that then he could do. And if this guy has been in Covid isolation and has all of these ideas that he can control the world and the west stupid - and has gotten away with so much from meddling in elections, hacking, the first one Ukraine, and more and more and more Dash you start to get a megalomania that you can do anything. That you can pull it off


In any case, I’m just saying the west had better be careful. Do I really believe this? No. Do I believe it’s possible? In a worst-case scenario? Yes. It’s probable this guy wants to escalate to unseen tensions the way he said he would. Some new technological version of a Cuban missile crisis.

If Russia wanted to they could move into Ukraine and carpet bomb pretty much the entire country in one day. And they could be using much more missile silos. People are acting like this guy just took a bunch of tanks from the Cold War out and they are a joke. He just finished doing a few things America has not been able to do. When wars. I believe I read the last five words he thought he won. I can think of at least four like I said. Georgia, Chechnya, recently Syria, Ukraine the first time, and some other conflict. When you were fighting war after war, your tanks and equipment have not been sitting in the garage getting rusty and old and falling apart. Perhaps he thought he could send the B team and it would be all right. But even this just seems so calculated to me. But I know I have a totally different perspective. I do understand that most people are looking at this through the lens and eyes of the west. And even if I am not perfect or great at looking through the eyes of a Soviet orand Ukrainian, there are enough family stories and things I have read and written about that make you understand even what Putin is saying in that video. Whether it’s true or not, he believes it. The west has been cruel to Russia. They did try to destroy and isolate them. They didn’t try to play nice after the Cold War. They tried to push down Russia and prop themselves up.  I’m not arguing if he is right or wrong. But it’s about perspective. And unfortunately many countries have a very negative perspective of America in a way which Americans really cannot grasp. And to them we are not the heroes of the world, the leaders of the world, we don’t have exceptionalism, and we have done many bad things including wars and dropping nuclear bombs. When you are teaching people in your country about America and using propaganda on top of that, the paint so much different picture than what Americans think of this country this is why Putin calls us Nazis and say we are worse than Hitler and his people believe it. Especially the older generation. And they revere him for bringing jobs and stability after so many years of standing in line for bread. The younger people are for peace. The younger people want to get rid of Putin. When you watch videos even recently they’re afraid to say it. This channel is pretty interesting

The people who say 'this is bad, but it's not my problem, and I don't want it to become my problem. Let others die so long as they're a different race, nationality, or creed than mine.'

>Go grab a gun.

They don't need guns. They don't even need foreigners with guns. It's not enough. They're still dying. So I fight for them to get whatever it is they need. The MIGs they were promised but then denied because of people like you, because your politicians worry about how people like you would react if they did something that could be construed as being too war like and so cost them votes.",1647066858.0,1647066468.0,t3_tc2ait,t1_i0caear,,5,0,0,0,0,0,

I doubt there's been a president in the last 50 years that hasn't had at least a portion of the population make that accusation. Besides, remember, there's no disqualification from the Presidency for having a low-IQ.

>  Either puppeted or has just an amazing team that works for him

No president in history has done their job without a large team supporting them. Even back in George Washington's day the amount of affairs going on that a President needed to consult with other experts on was large.

Entire books have been written on the various ""unsung heroes of history"" that the public never knew existed, but who were instrumental to Presidents making good decisions, especially in times of crisis.

Choosing a good team is an important part of the job. So if he's got a good team that is ""puppeting"" him, then it's because he chose them to be good at it.

> his age isnt a good look for the US though

This is not a disqualifying factor for presidency.

> like people concerned their president may die of old age in the middle of the biggest global crisis since the cuban missle crisis

Fun fact 1) A president can die at any time for any reason, most of which have nothing to do with old age.

Fun fact 2) We have a vice president specifically for this reason.

Biden's job isn't to make you feel comfortable with him being President. His job is to be the President, and sometimes being President can involve making you UNcomfortable with him being President.

I'd be perfectly happy to vote for a law establishing a maximum age for a President. But we do not have such a law yet.

As such, the time to express your dislike of a candidate that old is at the voting booth. The country decided that a ~77 year old candidate was acceptable for the Presidency. In two years you'll have the ability to express your opinion in this regard again.

That's how the US works. We vote, then we go with what we've got. If there's a REAL problem, like the official breaking laws, then we have mechanisms for removal. TECHNICALLY Congress can impeach a President for literally anything, but ""he looks too old"" is unlikely to be the case.

If Biden actually begins the stages of senility while in office, as the Vice President, Kamala Harris has the ability under the 25th amendment to remove Biden from the Presidency over his mental state.

> To answer your question, i dont think hes done anything wrong per se.

And this is where you're going to find that Reddit takes exception to your objections here, because ultimately you're basing your objections not on bad performance, but that at any moment he might suddenly have reduced performance.

Let's say that Biden was removed and Kamala took the big seat. Your current objections regarding how Biden's age might start to effect his performance in office, thus necessitating an urge for him to step down before that happens, are VERY adjacent to the argument people do make against the idea of a woman President. ""What if a crisis happens while she's on her period? How can we know she'll make the right decision instead of throwing a hormonal hissy fit?!"".

To be very clear, I'm not accusing you of being someone who WOULD make that argument, but I'm putting into perspective that your argument is topically very similar to that one, and so you're GOING to get downvoted and such over it.

At the end of the day, a lot of people will agree that having an upper age for a President would be a good idea. However, as we don't have such a requirement right now, that's not the basis for a call to step down that many are going to support. Or more specifically, one group of people that WOULD support that call don't actually CARE that Biden is old, they just care that he's a Democrat, so they want any excuse they can find to kick him out.

And that's where your REAL problem here on Reddit is going to be.

The reason why insignia (Z, V etc) is added to the vehicles is because they are trying to avoid friendly fire from close arms not because they think it's fashionable.

Secondly, I believe they have resorted to utilizing civilian transport instead of armored transport in an effort blend in when they assault heavily fortified urban areas such as Kiev, which is where they are headed. The insignia of the civilian vehicle will prevent the russian armor from targeting their own whils't the same insignia won't be detected by the Ukranian UAVs since it is too far up in the sky or any long distance Ukranian anti vehicle rockets.

So therefore they have achieved ""two birds with one stone"" so to speak.

Finally, the narrative that they are resorting to civilian vehicles because they ran out of tanks and armored vehicles is stupid, because they literally have tens of thousands in their inventory and anyone who believes this is thick skulled.

The US keeps ignoring the self determination of Puerto Rico by dismissing every referendum on the political status by not granting a binding referendum and finding any excuse to ignore the ones that were done.

 >The Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the University of Chicago, some of whom have constructed and popularized its principles. Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered the leading scholars of the Chicago school. Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations. The freshwater–saltwater distinction is largely antiquated today, as the two traditions have heavily incorporated ideas from each other.

The support we’re giving is enough to hold the Russians back for weeks, months even, but the cost in lives of Ukrainian civilians goes up each day we don’t provide more support. Eventually there’ll be nothing left of eastern cities to support.
