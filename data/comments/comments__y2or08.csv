- After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove.

- Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia's flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River. Most of the Russia troops on this front line remain understrength VDV (airborne) units.

- In recent days, the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson. It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself.",False,1665644626.0,t3_y2or08,t3_y2or08,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

Day 232 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they fired a lot of missiles from Belgorod throughout the day, starting at 1pm, when they fired 3 missiles in Kharkiv direction, but all of them malfunctioned and fell in Belgorod. One of those missiles even directly hit one of their apartment buildings. Of course Russians immediately accused us of shelling Belgorod, but the moment of impact was filmed by Russians, and it happened right when they were firing missiles at Kharkiv.

Then at 7pm suddenly an ammo depot in Belgorod exploded, which was great, it’s always nice to see Russians ammo depots blow up. Surprisingly even Belgorod’s governor confirmed that it was indeed an ammo depot and not civilian infrastructure, like some Russians were saying right after the explosions, while also accusing us of targeting civilians, but they were proven wrong by their own governor.

After 2 hours Russians prepared an answer to destroying their ammo depot, what did they do? Of course they targeted civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, that’s the only thing they are able to hit, because it’s literally marked on every map for everyone to see. They targeted yet another substation, which cut electricity in some districts, ours included. In our district not every building had their power cut, but ours did, and we had no electricity for about 2 hours.

Putin proposes new European gas hub in Turkey

Gas supply through the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany has been disrupted since Russia invaded Ukraine, and completely halted after an explosion on the pipeline under the Baltic Sea, which is believed to have been a deliberate act of sabotage.

For — 99 delegates. This is a historic result! Full support of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe!

The most important points of the resolution:

1. It is noted that the Russian regime is a terrorist. This is a powerful signal on a global scale, and it is another step to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.
2. For the first time in history, the COE(council of Europe)

declared that it is necessary to give weapons! We are talking about air defense systems

3. It is noted that the presence of Russia in the UN Security Council is not legal, there are no legal reasons why they are there.

4. Creation of an international tribunal as soon as possible

Thanks to all colleagues who supported the resolution. And thanks to Zingeris

for the excellent report.

We continue to work for the victory of Ukraine!

Today, I heard from retired General Ben Hodges that there is no reason for Ukraine to retake Kherson at this point. Instead what they should aim to do is trap the forces in Kherson behind the Inhulets river but no further. As the frontline gets smaller and more manageable this should free up Ukrainian forces to push to Melitipol and will ensure Kherson is still draining resources from Russia. If the Crimean bridge is destroyed the only way to supply the soldiers in Crimea and Kherson will be through the Zaporizija oblast. If Ukraine manages to push to Melitopol it will isolate Crimea and Kherson and will make their capture much more cost effective and with a Ukrainian push from the north both the eastern and southern fronts will be caught between Ukrainian forces.

Just because Kherson has not already fallen doesn’t mean it’s not part of the plan. Same can be said for the other side. It’s difficult to judge where the war is headed based solely on who captured what.

The governor of the city of Belgorod in south-west Russia, near the Ukrainian border, says a residential building has been hit by Ukrainian forces.

Vyacheslav Gladkov said a residential apartment building was damaged and that information about victims was being gathered.

He added that shelling by Ukraine's forces had landed near school grounds in a village outside Belgorod, although no students were on the premises.

On Monday, Gladkov announced classes were to be held online for two weeks as an apparent precaution against potential attacks. Earlier this week, Gladkov said Ukraine shelling on electrical facilities had briefly left some 2,000 people without power.

- He either presents against a plain background or uses simple clear maps and diagrams.
- He speaks clearly and at a comfortable pace.

I'm really happy ""Good Times Bad Times"" covered the topic of how the west would respond to a nuclear attack on Ukraine by citing one of the best written expert articles I've read on the topic (and previously thrown at people here).

TL;DR most likely a conventional NATO attack on Russian forces in Ukraine to make Russia lose more than it gained by using nukes to further discourage the usage.

Sending nukes directly on Russia for a minor nuclear attack is a very bad idea as you'd directly escalate into mass death and nuclear WW3 even if a lot of tactical nukes aren't really that much damaging compared to more conventional types of bombings. There's no easy solution to meet a nuclear attack but there is viable options that both strikes back at Russia and doesn't automatically enter a nuclear WW3.

So if you think there needs to be a strong threat towards Russia to keep them from using nukes in Ukraine I think it's better to get behind a conventional NATO intervention rather than all out nuclear war because when it comes down to it I don't think any of us really want to watch the whole world burn so Putin might be more willing to gamble on that not happening if it's the threat presented.",False,1665653251.0,t3_y2or08,t1_is4sg70,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

2) They have a high degree of certainty that he has taken the decision to use nukes of some type or another. (No fearmongering here)

If it's 2, this statement HAS to happen now. Because NATO can't be seen as wobbling back and forth AFTER the weapon has been used.

You now have a clear tit for that. This is important to say no nukes because then people don't think NATO is weak if they don't use nukes of their own.

The reason we're not running an Iran livethread is we're not confident that we can talk authoritively about the events, not that we care less.  I'm one of the guys who started this livethread, and I can assure you I'm just as locked into Iran as I am locked into the Ukraine War, but I don't know anyone who can speak Persian, I don't know anything about the culture on the ground of Iran, I know for sbsolute certain that if I tried to run a similar livethread for Iran I would make an idiot of myself and not be super helpful. 

So, what I can do for yall is this, if you go to old.reddit.com/live, you can make a thread of your own.  If an Iranian group or modteam is able to crosscheck and verify stuff to the standards that we've been doing here (and I'm not saying they're super high, just like, visibly retract stuff when you misreported and hold back from the hype and crosscheck stuff, two sources for every fact, etc), I would totally reccomend to the rest of our modteam that we sticky that too. In the past, we've stickied threads from Hong Kong protest groups to the top of the subreddit, there's precedence. I can't promise anything outright, as I can't solely speak for a team decision, but I'd class it as likely if it was high quality enough.

If a sentence has been given justly, it becomes unjust to abbreviate it for selfish reasons.

Sexual violence for example has much higher rates of recidivism than single counts of second degree murder, but (in for example the US, but also many western countries) the former rarely equates to longer sentences than even voluntary manslaughter, while the latter can be a life sentence.  That's obviously ass-backwards.

In summary:

Russia tried to blitzkrieg into a country without planning for proper logistics because they thought the government would collapse and the Ukrainian army would give up. When the Ukrainian army didn't give up and made a stand, it gave time for ukranian special forces and airborne divisions to harass their supply lines and make the logistical situation worse. Ukraine didn't have to beat their tanks and artillery, they just had to destroy their ability to supply them. 

Simply put Russia didn't have enough trucks and the ones they did have got their asses handed to them because they didn't use enough troops to secure their supply lines. 

On top of this Russia showed a complete inability to adjust strategy, improvise or even respond to their changing situation.

Oh and turns out the Russian airforce is a complete paper tiger if not bombing a third world country. And their missiles have nowhere near the required accuracy needed... And usually weren't even aimed at the right place. Ie, they kept shooting missiles at airfields where the jets and radar installments had already been moved....

There are two types of nuclear weapons(well... no, there are many more than that, but two that are relevant here): tactical and strategic. Tactical nuclear weapons are typically lower yield, meant to accomplish a single military objective, such as sinking a ship/relatively tightly grouped fleet, wiping out a military base, punching a hole in a front line, etc. Strategic nuclear weapons are much higher yield, and are the ones that would level cities.

Using tactical nuclear weapons on population centers accomplishes little; given how slow cruise missiles are, most/all would be intercepted, and the response from allied powers would be swift and immediate. Lviv is close enough to Poland that a slight deviation of the missiles flight path, or Ukrainian air defenses doing their job(assuming missiles launched from the black sea), and those nukes could fall on NATO territory, even if they don't actually detonate.

Strategic nuclear weapons are even less likely; these are higher yield weapons that are seen as a last resort, retaliatory measure. The scale of destruction, especially if launched at a city like Lviv, would absolutely have consequences in Poland and Romania. And that's not even mentioning what such a strike on Odessa would do to the Black Sea, which is bordered by 3 separate NATO members.

And this is all assuming Putin could even 1) find enough enough working warheads and 2) load and launch those warheads without the Western intelligence apparatus seeing it and preemptively responding, and neither of those things seem particularly likely given Russia's failures thus far.",False,1665695177.0,t3_y2or08,t1_is7da1p,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

If by ""lose"" you mean ""politically defeated,"" then yes those examples definitely apply. ""War is politics by other means,"" as the saying goes. When it became clear that just mindlessly bombing the North Vietnamese for years on end wasn't convincing them to give up, the American public eventually stopped supporting the stalemate and the military was withdrawn. (Because that's how democracies are supposed to work.) The Tet Offensive was an operational failure that didn't actually achieve its battlefield objectives; but it was a major political victory. It didn't matter how many direct engagements the US won, none of their operational successes were leading up to a strategic victory. But the US was able to choose the day they left Vietnam, same goes for the other cases. 

I think this is still Wallace's ultimate point though; unless something changes, Russia in Ukraine is heading for an actual defeat on the battlefield itself, not just a political defeat where they do the ""declare victory and go home"" thing.

""Russia became a member of the Council of Europe in 1996. In 2014, after Russia invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, precipitating a bloody conflict, the Council stripped Russia of its voting rights in the PACE. In response, Russia began to boycott the Assembly in 2016, and beginning in 2017 refused to pay its annual membership dues of 32.6 million euros (US$37.1 million) to the Council placing the institution under financial strain.  
Russia claimed that its suspension by the council was unfair, and demanded the restoration of voting rights. Russia had threatened to withdraw from the Council unless its voting rights were restored in time for the election of a new secretary general. European Council secretary-general Thorbjørn Jagland organized a special committee to find a compromise with Russia in early 2018, a move that was criticized as giving in to alleged Russian pressure by Council members and academic observers, especially if voting sanctions were lifted. In June 2019, the Council voted (on a 118–62 vote, with 10 abstentions) to restore Russia's voting rights in the council. Opponents of lifting the suspension included Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries, such as Poland and the Baltic states, who argued that readmission amounted to normalizing Russia's malign activity. Supporters of restoring Russia's council rights included France and Germany, which argued that a Russian withdrawal from the council would be harmful because it would deprive Russian citizens of their ability to initiate cases in the European Court of Human Rights.  
On 3 March 2022, after Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the council suspended Russia for violations of the council's statute and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The suspension blocked Russia from participation in the council's ministerial council, the PACE, and the Council of the Baltic Sea States, but still left Russia obligated to follow the ECHR. On 15 March 2022, hours before the vote to expel the country, Russia initiated a voluntary withdrawal procedure from the council, delivering its formal desire to withdraw on 31 December 2022, and announced its intent to denounce the ECHR. However, on the same day, the council's Committee of Ministers decided Russia's membership in the council would be immediately terminated, and determined that Russia had been excluded from the Council instead under its exclusion mechanism rather than the withdrawal mechanism. After being excluded from the Council of Europe, Russia's former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev endorsed restoring the death penalty in Russia.""  


TL;DR: Russia was in the Council but didn't meet the requirements. Was suspended because of Ukraine invasion in 2014, and France+Germany did a Chamberlain and fought for Russia to get back, ""poor russians"", etc. This year with Ukraine second invasion+war, Russian applied for withdrawal but instead was kicked out. After that, Madveded said he was all for death penalty. That's all folks.",False,1665666057.0,t3_y2or08,t1_is57p5m,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

It's also a number pulled out of the air; SpaceX is claiming that each terminal in the field, already provided, costs ~$4,500 per month to operate. That's probably the bill SpaceX charges its regular customers for top-tier service [EDIT: ....eeeh, I suppose it's _possible_], and no military operator in the field is going to say ""oh no, I'm going to cut back on the level of service to save some money"".

EDIT: For more context:

> The terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.

> That’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.

Not saying the service is _free_ to provide, but those monthly per-terminal figures look an awful lot like wartime price-gouging to me. It's honestly mind-bogging - there's so much good press to be had from Starlink's presence here _and_ future government contracts up the wazoo if he plays his cards right, but no - he wants to sour the deal and make a quick buck instead.

Elon says that there has been about 25k terminals sent to Ukraine and Ukraine has said that about 500 are lost per month. Lets ignore that and just stick with the 25k. Twenty five thousand terminals at 600usd (the cost that Starlink charges) is 15 million. Then 25k connections at 110usd per month (what Starlink charges) is 33 million per year. So in total if a regular citizen was to buy these and run them for an entire year it would cost 48 million.

85% of the terminals was already paid for by Poland, US and other countries. So the terminals actually costed Starlink somewhere around 2.25 million. Those same groups have paid for 30% of the connection. So that is leaving Starlink with 23 million in costs for the year. So as it stands right now, it should be costing Starlink around 25 million for the year.

Elon is saying that each terminal costs about 4,500 usd for ""advanced services."" No idea what that means but somehow these advanced services is the difference between 25 million in regular services to what would equate to 380 million per year from the word of a senior defense official.

I don't think the thread is implying this, though some people are inferring it.

I doubt that this is because of a potential nuclear weapon use for a couple of reasons - the main being that it must now be very clear to Russia that any use of a nuclear weapon is likely to result in NATO forces becoming involved within Ukraine (including Crimea) and utterly destroying the Russian capability for years to come.

Regulatory alignment will come first and that will be pretty quickly and quietly brought in once we have a change of government. This is because we will see tangible economic benefits in the form of imports/exports as soon as that is enacted. 

Perhaps full EU membership is far off but if Labour are polling well going into a second term in office I could definitely see Customs Union being part of their manifesto. 

The economic pain that the UK has uniquely suffered from Brexit is almost unarguable now. There is no 'trade deal' based economic argument for Brexit any more. The trade deals outside of the EU have been pathetic, and greatest of ironies - the trade deal with India will include large numbers of migrant workers.

Soviets were out producing the Nazis in certain key weapons systems, like tanks. However, they did this at the cost of specializing in these systems to the exclusion of much else that was necessary. 

As it has often been said, the Soviet army marched to Berlin in Ford trucks while eating Spam. They could not have sustained offensives without the help of lend-lease. 

The continued Soviet focus on weapons was only possible because the West handled much of the unglamorous logistical elements (such as canned food and motorized transport) for them. Without that help, the Soviets could never have continued to produce so many weapons. They would have suffered from vital supply bottlenecks. 

The Soviet (and now Russian) tendency has always been to focus on massive numbers of weapons, and less so on the boring stuff like logistics. This is a huge strategic weakness, one that is crippling them in the current war.

I think it's great to advocate for a diplomatic solutions like these, but there is zero real indication of any interest from the Russian side so it's pretty much moot.",False,1665687358.0,t3_y2or08,t1_is6n58w,,3,2,0,2,0,0,
af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,y2or08,is6zqxq,"The threat is bullshit, always was. 

The whole point is to keep it ambiguous, to unsettle and distract his enemies. 

I will tell you why I think he will never do it. 

Nukes can be used in one of two basic ways - “strategic” (meaning, blowing up cities); or “tactical” (meaning, used on the battlefield to kill enemy armies). 

Nether works well for Putin. 

A strategic attack - where will he aim it? At Kyiv? That would be pointless. At the West as a whole, Ww3-style? That would be suicide. 

Okay, so maybe he’s losing on the battlefield, so he uses nukes tactically, telling the West to back off or he’ll use them strategically. 

Unfortunately for him, the Americans have war gamed this sort of scenario to the hilt (and no doubt so have the Soviets, back in the day): tactical use of nukes simply isn’t very effective in modern war. Troops are too spread out and too dug in to make the use of nukes a really attractive option, superior to other forms of weaponry, in this context (never mind the unfortunate political effects using them may have). 

Here’s an interesting read on the subject:

First, at the beginning of his invasion, he warned the West that interference would be met with a nuclear response. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-war-warning-us-nato-rcna17497

Then, he puts his arsenal on full alert: 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-orders-nuclear-deterrent-forces-high-alert-tensions-build-ukrain-rcna17853

Now that he’s being beaten without NATO boots on the ground, he’s claiming that any attacks on Russian territorial integrity would be met with “all the means at his disposal”, an obvious reference to his nuclear arsenal (and reinforced with “not bluffing”). 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna48713

This is in the context of further bullshit claims that NATO is threatening *Russia* with nukes, but also in the context of Russia annexing a huge swath of Ukraine. The obvious conclusion: trying to take that part of “former Ukraine” *back* violates his (self-declared) “territorial integrity”, and will be met with nukes. 

All fully deniable of course. That’s why it is “bullshit” and not just “lies”. 

The difference is this: a “lie” is a factual statement that is made knowing it is not true. “Bullshit” is a statement made purely to create a mental state in the intended audience (in this case, to scare them) without any regard for its truth.

Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

Yes you're right. What I've seen is the zealotry diminish and they're now quite reserved about it, from my experience anyway.

The problem was that whilst they always said 'we may have some pain initially but we will see the economic benefits in the long run', that was always based on the lie they got sold that we would get these fantastic trade deals that the EU was holding us back from. You have to shake your head at the fact they believed this, but the likes of Farage are very experienced snake-oil salesmen and grifters.

The arguments of 'project fear' were dismissed out of hand, but they know now how accurate they actually were. It can't be denied.

They will still comfort themselves with the 'sovereignty' angle and arguments about immigration, but those things were always backed up by the idea that the EU was holding us back economically. So yes, the hardcore haven't been turned yet by any means, but those on the fence definitely have and there is only a relatively small group of zealots who are still completely in denial on the issue.

We could be at quite an interesting turning point in terms of their strength over controlling the narrative when the narrative they have pumped out for so long has been exposed as lies.

However, the means taken to pursue those goals, while cruel and so far ineffective, are not irrational. Rather, Putin took a huge gamble (that the Ukrainian government would collapse under the threat of invasion) - and lost.

Money is absolutely helping Russia.

But we can do that right now anyways. Doing masses of work, ostracizing the east and losing support at home just so we can get humilated and the government looks weak just to supply hardware is not reasonable. Sending combat vehicles does not rely on Russian gas. It relies on the wills of our leaders to escalate. The public support is already there and clearly the foreign secretary is in support of the idea. 

>Would the Baltics, Poland, hell, even Ukraine actually be against NS-2 if it meant billions in German hardware for Ukraine?

Yes. Because there's really two ways to go about this. 

Either the first German announcement on this topic is coupled with the announcement of hundreds of tanks, in which case the pipeline never opens anyways, and at best we end up looking like hypocrites by handing Ukrainians arms to kill Russians while we hand tons of money to the Russians and at worst we end up looking like total morons who somehow though that we could have it both ways. The eastern Europeans will see this happening and already strike down any such ""United European gas"" idea in the first place. 

In the second case, we announce nothing and let the Russians crow over NS-2 being opened while slowly sending tanks to Ukraine, upon seeing which Russia closes the pipeline. We look weak at the start and idiots at the end. The eastern Europeans will not agree to this either, and rightly so. 


>Allowing Russian gas without the second part of my suggestion is a terrible idea. 

The problem is your suggestions are mutually exclusive and rely mostly in a dreamworld where we can have our cake and eat it too. No recession, great economy and continued slothful dependence on our enemies while enriching them, and still defeating them to the extent ukraine regains all its land, which is basically a massive humiliation to them. This is wishful thinking even compared to the older ideas of ""putin won't invade because we're economically dependent on each other"". 

The only way for a Ukrainian and hence European victory in this war is the essential internal destruction of Russia as it exists today. That will only achieved by an aggressive and non conciliatory stance. This is not a harsh time of peace for the EU, it is a very easygoing time of war, where we can win by only suffering relatively minor hardship and next to no loss of life. I'd suggest we learn to live with some short term hardship in favour of some limp compromise with ourselves where we do something we can do anyways but only with extra humiliation, lots of extra effort, lots of disunity, and added ammunition to the far right everywhere.",False,1665644358.0,t3_y2or08,t1_is4j4zs,,7,3,0,3,0,0,
