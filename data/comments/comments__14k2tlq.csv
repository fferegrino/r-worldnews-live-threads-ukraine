Russia jailed one of its most eminent hypersonic scientists for allegedly leaking secrets to a NATO country as a western diplomat warned that Putin and his spies 'see treason lurking around every corner.'
Professor Valery Golubkin, 71, has been sent to a strict regime penal colony for 12 years after being convicted of high treason by the Moscow City Court.

According to reports, he was accused of handing the information involving aerodynamics to scientists from the Netherlands.

Treason cases are heard behind closed doors in Russia as they deal with what authorities deem to be classified information. 

At least three other Russian scientists who had worked on hypersonic missile development have been arrested on suspicion of treason over the past year.

Address by the President of Ukraine:

Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!  
  
Today - the front. Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia. Our warriors, our frontline positions, areas of active operations at the front. Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day. I wished the guys more days like this.  
  
I paid a visit to the Khortytsia units that distinguished themselves heroically in the Battle of Bakhmut. Well done, warriors! Then our marines - very powerful, very accurate. Thank you for doing your best to save the lives of our warriors. Then Tavria, the south, the front. It was a busy day, a lot of emotions... I was honored to award our warriors, to thank them personally, to shake their hands. Thank you for all your words of support, guys! Thank you for your hugs, very warm ones, to everyone today. And thank you for your chevrons - it is extremely honorable for me, and I will tell about each chevron separately. All our warriors - from soldiers to sailors to generals - are doing a great job!  
  
I presented two Gold Stars of the Hero of Ukraine – to Captain Oleh Olyva, commander of the airmobile company of the 81st separate airborne assault brigade, and Major Serhiy Dudin, deputy commander of the marine battalion of the 35th separate brigade. Indeed, they are great people, thank you!  
  
Meetings with generals... Zubanych, Tarnavskyi, Sodol, Syrskyi. Several operational decisions were made. Once again, we discussed the creation of the Marine Corps, all the details are clear, absolutely clear - organization, training, supply... We are strengthening the Marines and all elements of our Defense Forces, it is a must.  
  
Yesterday, I had talks with partners, including President Biden, primarily about arms supplies.  
  
Today, I was in the area where these weapons will give more power, more protection to Ukrainians' lives. And bring our victory closer, this is the main thing. All our land will be free - all of it.

Lavr Kornilov was a popular and effective general in the Russian Imperial Army, who won the only Russian victory of 1917; he'd also been instrumental in crushing the July Days protests that had previously threatened the Provisional Government, and ended with the elevation of Kerensky. His officers and men were loyal to him, as he treated them well and didn't spent their lives cheaply. He was made the head of the military of the Provisional Government. At some point, he had determined that he needed to move a force of his soldiers into Petrograd to eliminate the threat to the Provisional Government of the Petrograd Soviet. 

Kerensky's role in this is uncertain--he had some role in the planning, but it's unclear, what exactly that role was. Eventually, Kerensky decided late in the process that he didn't want Kornilov in Petrograd, because once Kornilov's soldiers were in the city Kornilov could easily seize power and install a military dictatorship, as a result, Kerensky turned toward the Petrograd Soviet for support. The effect of this event was to fatally undermine Kerensky, while also elevating the Petrograd Soviet in general--and the Bolsheviks in particular. 

Failed coups are always dangerous to the present powerholders. They undermine their authority, and the closer they get to success, the greater the likelihood that another interested locus of power will then try to make their own play.",1687872945.0,1687872363.0,t3_14k2tlq,t3_14k2tlq,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Putin's supporters don't mean the same thing as westerners when they say neo-nazi. Jews and racism have nothing to do with it to them.

Remember, USSR was allied with Hitler in the first part of WW2. They had absolutely no problem with the atrocities that Hitler committed. In fact Stalin committed many of them himself. It was only after Hitler turned on them and invaded them, that they suddenly had a problem with nazism. And therefore that is what the propaganda leaned into from that point: That the nazis were bad simply because they were the enemy, because they were traitors, because they invaded the USSR. Now, you can see how it would make a lot of sense to call Ukraine nazis, because in Russian's mind, Ukraine is also the enemy, they are also traitors for siding with NATO instead of Russia.

The more nuanced and boring answer is that this is a massive war and both Ukraine and Russia have too few long range precision missiles for the targets that they would like to strike. Sending ATACMS or F-16s won’t win the war by themselves but they will increase Ukraine’s capabilities and present further logistical hurdles for Russia which will make Ukrainian territorial gains more likely. Every weapon given, whether that’s a 40 year old truck or a storm shadow missile, helps Ukraine. If Ukraine doesn’t get F-16s or ATACMS they will still be capable of liberating their land but it will take longer and involve more dead Ukrainians and higher losses of western equipment. If Ukraine does get ATACMS and F-16s they won’t suddenly win the war either although it will be a step in the right direction.

He was already making money on the side by owning the company that manufactured Russian Army rations, and now he can skim even more off the top w/ his own personal army that was pretty much Corp strength at its' height in Ukraine.

Russians have been doing exactly this for months.

I suspect Ukrainians are slowly demolishing the worst points of these fortifications and minefields, establishing strategically sound positions before starting the real offensive, while Zelensky does his job, spending time campaigning for more supplies and support from the allies. All the while the Russians are trying to make this as expensive for Ukraine as they can, which is also why they are attacking and still capturing some ground (~90Km^2 last time I checked) in the northern parts of the front, to force Ukraine to cover that line and distract troops, equipment and munitions from the south.

Given ukraines aircraft are by necessity based in the far west of the country, that means every stormshadow launch has to be weighed up against the risk to Ukraines small stock of working fighters and has to be significantly pre planned. Its a solid 800 km from lviv to the frontline, meaning even if a su24 already had a stormshadow loaded and ready to go, it's going to take a solid 20+ minutes of flying time to get to a launch position for things in Crimea or far eastern donetsk. So say the ukrainians get good intep that, eg, gerasimov is inspecting a particular position, or a munitions train is moving from melitpol to crimea by the time a Su24 is in the air, has protection organised and is close enough to launch, the moment has probably passed.

ATACMs being ground launched means they can fulfil a far different role-yes they are less survivable than a  storm shadow but rhey can be stored closer to the front wherever HIMARs are operating, giving troops  more immediare long range strike option.

Something you don't see much either (in this specific discussion) is that tensions with China are quite high. While it remains a remote probability event, a Chinese American conflict is not an impossibility. The US is not ready for that conflict and is not in a position to give away weapons it deems vital to deter China, which may or may not include the ATACMS until PRSM is in production.

The below is an alarmist article, the US always conducts its war games conservatively, but the message from the military and certain politicians with high clearance has been one of consistently growing alarm. The fear is that the early phase of the conflict would be massively destructive to both sides, but the US has a much smaller industrial base and would be in a poor position to maintain a conflict. With that fear in mind it makes sense the US is hesitant to reduce certain stocks.

Yes, the treaty was definitely too punitive, especially with both an excessive financial burden with the humiliation of French and allied control of German territories. Territories that were pretty much required to make that capital to pay back the allies - the Ruhr and Saarland where German industry and coal was abundant. 

Hitler's rise to power was almost 15 years later after the treaty. Yes, something like the financial crisis (an event from 15 years ago that also had far reaching impacts) will have had an effect on events that are happening today, but it's not the sole cause of everything that has transpired since. 

But Weimar Germany had a fundamentally weak constitution that had difficulty combating extremism and the early 1920s were spent putting down rebellions of both the communists and fascists. 
The Weimar government, with the passing of competent leaders like Friedrich Ebert, had weak leadership by the end of the 1920s. There is no way a senile Paul von Hindenberg could control Hitler if he made him Chancellor, as much as he thought he could.

The problem after 1870 was that Germany was a superpower that arrived at the table late. The world was divided up between Britain, France, Russia, America (the USA is and was an empire), and China. Based on population, industrial output, cultural influence, and so forth Germany was the peer of Britain but despite being stronger than any other European power it had no empire. It could only address that imbalance by taking from the existing ones. Not because it was weak or bitter but because it was an empire that completely destroyed the balance of power in Europe.

After WW1 France advocated for the carving up of Germany and the permanent occupation of industrial zones because nothing had changed. Germany was still a superpower based on demographics and industrial output. It could not be pacified, only dismantled. Europe could not have peace with Germany and her 80 million people in its heart. Wilson argued for keeping her intact and seeing if history repeated itself if you change nothing.

WW2 was caused by leniency, it was caused because Germany again looked at her demographics and industrial output, looked at her place in the world, and recognized that she was denied what she felt she was owed.

After WW2 the powers implemented what France had proposed following WW1.

Or worried about escalation along with several other possible reasons. There has been fear by some that certain weapons being sent to Ukraine will cross a red line for Russia. This was never going to happen, but what Ukraine does with those weapons may.

Imo Crimea will be a red line for Putin, and one he would've had the power to do more about several months ago. Dragging the war out weakens him. I don't necessarily think this is the US strategy, but may have very well been Ukraine's when choosing to fight for Bakhmut.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-holds-back-all-hungarys-cohesion-funds-over-rights-concerns-2022-12-22/

> The 22 billion euros for Hungary are earmarked for programmes including education for disadvantaged children, rail transport upgrades, access to broadband and aid for regions affected by coal plant closures.

https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7801

> In particular, almost €1.8 billion will help ensure better access to quality education across the country by providing crucial financing to make the teaching profession more attractive.

> road safety

> Finally, funds will improve housing, living and health conditions of people living in segregated areas.

Sounds like education will be affected, rail service could get worse or even become unsafe. Isolated groups who clearly need it will get less help. Sounds like things that could very much affect government services, not to mention the potential for future economic growth by failing to upgrade telecommunication infrastructure.

And pulling this funding is not done in a vacuum, if billions of Euros a year are pulled out of certain programs either Hungary has to cut those programs, shift money from other areas which means less funding for other priorities or borrow more money and add to their ever increasing debt load. All that is going to have an affect on the entire governments financial picture and that could mean less funding in areas unrelated to the EU aid.

The exact same fiction Russia hid behind in 2014 when Ukrainian ""rebels"" wearing Russian uniforms invaded Crimea.

That doesn't matter to you.  It *does* matter, however, to the State Department.  And it does matter to Putin, not because he appreciates our restraint, but because he's spent the past 18 months making the case that Russia is defending themselves from the United States, both domestically and abroad.

Yes, that case is nonsense.  Of course it is, so what?  Without being able to point at US-made, US-supplied weapons hitting *actual-factual* Russian cities, that case is harder to make.  And escalation is harder to justify.  And India, Iran, and China are forced to be more circumspect with what they supply Russia, beyond just buying cheap oil, while western countries are more enthusiastic with their aid.

It's *almost* like the US State Department is run by adults, and professionals, some of whom have been doing this for as long as you have been alive.

During the Cold War, the geography of the plain also played a huge role in NATO's defense plans in the case of a Soviet invasion, despite nuclear arsenals being already a thing back then.

It's not about the fear of an immediate invasion, it's more like: if we allow Ukraine to establish control over the plain that close to our border and joining NATO, this will be an irreversible Russian vulnerability for decades if not centuries to come.

It was a time frame that was closing, and it was safe to assume that once Ukraine joins the EU and NATO it won't open again unless there will be a major geopolitical shockwave.  And technically they're not wrong. It obviously doesn't give Russia any right to invade or render the invasion justifiable, but there most definitely was geopolitical reasoning and logic behind the decision, which certainly would be obsolete if Russia would be willing to engage with the West more constructively, but we all know that's not what Putin wants, no matter the costs.

From the Russian perspective, losing control of the plain beyond their borders is like starting any chess game you play from now on without any pawns.

Disregarding the probability that Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons, maybe a very quick humiliating defeat would have been better. But I think the time for that has already passed. The war has already lasted for ~18 months now and Russians have already seen pictures of destroyed Leopards and Bradleys. They know western weapons are not invincible.

>It doesn’t matter how many tanks Russia has in storage if they believe that the moment those tanks cross international borders they will be blown up.

True, but if Russia has 0 tanks in storage, because they all got destroyed in an attritional war in Ukraine, they still can't cross any national borders with them.

>The over arching priority is to stop Russian imperialism and not simply weaken Russia.

Those two objectives are very closely linked though...

>Many western countries would also love for Russia to stop fighting and leave Ukraine so that they can drop sanctions and start buying Russian energy again. 

I am not so sure. Most European contries are trying to shift away from fossil fuels anyway.

Please don't get me wrong! I think Ukraine should get much more support than they are getting today, so that they can end this war as quickly as possible! It is the moral thing to do!!! I am just not sure avoiding an attritional war is the optimal choice for NATO from a point of view of pure self interest and cynicism.

Turkey's candidacy was advocated mostly by Eurosceptics in order to stop it from ever becoming anything more than a trade zone. It was intended to be a Trojan horse. Thankfully, that candidacy is dead now, and Europhiles need to make sure it stays dead.

The UK is also out, because in the end, they had never adopted a European identity. That is why Brexit had the effect of making the EU stronger.

As for Greece, you are talking about the times of the Greek Crisis. Even then, Golden Dawn was never part of the government, only getting a single-digit result in the parliamentary election.
