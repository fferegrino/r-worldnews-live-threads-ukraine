>Today I made two vital calls on the Ukraine Crisis  
>  
>(1) with our congressional leaders  
>  
>(2) with heads of state of our Nato allies to bring them up to date to what the US thinks what's going to happen in Ukraine in the next days. We stand united with the allies.  
>  
>I share what we know about the rapidly developing situation in Ukraine.  
>  
>There's been a shelling of a kindergarten yesterday, misreported as being caused by the rebels. False reporting in Russian media about the Ukrainians ?? ... (didn't catch this), that the Ukrainians are committing a genocide.  
>  
>Do you really think that the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with 190000 soldiers at the border, to escalate the situation?  
>  
>All this behaviour is consistent with the playbook Russians have used before. False-flag operations.  
>  
>The Ukrainians have shown great restraint.  
>  
>**Russian troops have Ukraine surrounded, all around the border & black sea.**  
>  
>**We have reasons to believer that Russia will attack Ukraine in the coming week or even days. We are calling out Russia with the hope to deter their plans.**  
>  
>**USA & Allies prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. We will continue to provide resources to the Ukrainians - e.g. javellins, loan guarantee to strengthen Ukrainian resilience. West is united to impose sanctions on Russia if the Ukraine is invaded.**  
>  
>**Russia can still choose diplomacy. Russia agreed that Labrov and US should meet on 24 February. If Russia takes action before this date, they will have chosen war and they will be sanctioned.**  
>  
>We are united, US& allies, the west, US political parties ...

I think the following is going to happen:

As a trigger point, an unbadged, group of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine will start some terrorist activity. Russia and NATO countries will then exchange blame (who did what first) as civil unrest erupts. Both will be too scared to be the first to enter into the conflict directly, and they’ll play the poker / chicken / you blinked first game. The language and blame game will continue to escalate.

Meanwhile a Ukrainian civil war will start, while Russia and NATO both stand on the sidelines, and send weapons support to the respective civil warring sides.

NATO will remotely launch strikes to a stop a humanitarian crisis, and this will shields the western part of the country. Russia will launch from their country too. 

The conflict will finish when the pro-Russian separatists have gain control of all of the pro-Russian parts of Ukraine which is the northern and eastern sides of the country (as well as a greater area around Crimea).",1645231220.0,1645230143.0,t3_svsa2c,t3_svsa2c,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

I encourage everybody to read the brief summary of The Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin. It essentially maps out a long-term plan for Russia to regain its influence in Eurasia.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations\_of\_Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)

Key highlights include:

""The textbook advocates a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services.""

""Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.""

""The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.""

""Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and ""United Ossetia"" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable""",False,1645227783.0,t3_svsa2c,t3_svsa2c,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

89ac143b08e2c91e32c1ab80b0476aff,svsa2c,hxieahj,"Love this thread, thought I will share my take on the situation as of now:

With the current reports of numbers over 150.000 on the Russian side I don’t understand how the plan about encircling Kyiv to install a new leader could still be in play taking into consideration that Russia can achieve air superiority and easily offer air support for its infantry and armed forces. Yes, the point is always to outnumber your opponent, but Russia is still a superpower and going only for Kyiv could be done with fewer soldiers, so it’s clearly going to be a large scale invasion.

The weather may not be the best for an invasion right now, but with those numbers I find it hard to believe that Russia won’t end up reducing Ukraine’s territory to a third or worse and in that case it’s hard to believe that the population that will have to move to the West won’t hate Russia and won’t want to make Ukraine a part of the EU and NATO.

On the other hand, all of those reports about their planned false flags operations and things like kill lists or chemical weapons are gruesome to say the least, something I never thought I will hear about being planned in our century and will open the door for regimes like China and Iran, even with the harshest sanctions and isolation from the world, if Putin will still be Russia’s president after invading Ukraine and using horrible tactics that would be an unprecedented threat to the current world order as we know it, just one more reason for China to do the same with Taiwan. 

If Ukraine can use the anti tank weapons the right way and really slow the advancement of Russian troops so that even if Russia occupies a significant portion of Ukraine that territory will be hard to maintain with guerrila warfare from the Ukrainian side, leading to a tough job for Putin in maintaining his narrative in front of its Russian public since the reality on the ground will be way different from the propaganda and will have to be faced when troops return from the frontlines.

If the invasion is successful it will make things worse than intended for Putin, the buffer he wants to achieve by controlling Ukraine will be worthless as NATO will have every reason to increase its presence significantly on the Eastern flank and no matter what,  invading Ukraine will not bring back the buffer Russia had before the fall of the USSR, not to mention the modern weapons systems that will be deployed.
The Black Sea will have to be shared with NATO countries and the new territory will be a headache on the political front with an economy that will be hit like never before with harsh sanctions and Europe’s intention to no longer depend on Russia for its energy needs.

In any scenario possible, invading Ukraine is a very dumb idea short term and long term for any person with a brain, Putin is a madman, he’s not 20 or 30, he’s almost 70, he can’t be justifying this for the next 40 years as he doesn’t get to live 40 more years, it’s a political suicide, doing something Stalin or Hitler would’ve done isn’t the the thing you expect from a calculated person, it’s just void of sense.

bb8c003789f4bbe8eaadcb1dab85bc79,svsa2c,hxio742,"I want to address some comments here that fault NATO or the US primarily in this conflict.

Mostly the argument goes that NATO has pushed too far into the Russian sphere of influence and ignored Russian warnings since the nineties that they could not accept this. That is to some extent worthy of debate (and it has been debated by numerous scholars, analysts and journalists), I'll address it at the end.

**MAIN POINT**  
But some people take this **way too far**. Even accepting that western foreign policy might have unwisely walked into this conflict by ignoring prior warnings... this does not excuse Russia for starting a war of aggression against another country. It doesn't make 'the west' the aggressor and absolve Russia of guilt. Taking the argument that far is just crazy.

That's roughly similar to saying The Third Reich wasn't the aggressor in Poland/France in 1939/40, because the Entente Powers set up the politics of post-WWI Europe in a way that would lead to an aggressive and revisionist/expansionist Germany (via the Versailles treaty). The latter point can be argued (I even think it is true), but that doesn't make France (and Great Britain) the aggressors of WW2, just because they had a hand in setting up an uncomfortable geopolitical position that was unstable. This is a good argument that the post WW1 foreign policy was short-sighted (at the time pointed out by the US), but it does not equal moral culpability for WW2. That still very much rests with Germany who could have chosen not to try to reclaim their old territory. Nobody forced them into a war of aggression, just as nobody is forcing Putin to send the tanks rolling now.

**Russian sphere of influence**  
One the issue of whether pushing NATO farther East was risky, probably yes. Complaints about NATO expansion started early in the 1990s and have been reiterated constantly. It certainly raised the stakes of conflicts like the current one in Eastern Europe. I still think it's somewhat misleading as an argument here though, today.    
NATO would never defend Ukraine against Russia with their own soldiers. (Just as the aren't now, nor would they ever.) They know that's just too close to home for Russia and much to dangerous an escalation (and also too big a war with too many casualties).  
Hence, everyone knew that dangling the NATO membership in front of Ukraine was done only for reasons of Ukrainian domestic politics. It never was a 'real' future option. Ukraine wasn't ever given a path to membership. Russia knows this.  
There are enough policy documents from NATO countries that therefore no large troop deployment into Ukraine could happen, only training, other small detachments, etc.  
It's still true that Russia fears Ukraine becoming a very western nation. It's not about NATO membership though (even if that is the public claim), because they know that's not coming; it's about economic help from western countries and generally closer ties (including weapons sold). The issue goes beyond NATO membership (which again, isnt' even on the table)  
I also have no doubt at all that often western policies were not guided by anything other than expediancy, and not by enlightened ideas of self-governance of the Ukrainian people (although it helps when you see yourself as the good guy), other motives always loomed, we've certainly seen plenty of hypocrites in western foreign policy circles.  
Anyway, Putin fears that a Ukraine that is more democratic and economically successful could inspire democratic notions in Russia. He has been very outspoken against all these 'colour revolutions' (orange/... revolution, etc.) in countries around Russia. That threatens his personal power. That is probably more of his personal motivation; though the general Russian establishment absolutely sees the sphere of influence issue as the crucial element. Russia is a fallen great power, and desperately wants to reclaim it's status, not see it slipping away.  
An invasion was probably preventable by changes in western policies, but not in the last months or so; that ship had sailed. Over the last 8 years, yes. But it would have required cutting off economical aid for the orange revolution/post-Maidan Ukrainian government, letting it crumble/fail internally. That way it would have been less threatening for Putin and probably would have enabled him to eventually get a government in Kiev sufficiently pro-Russian or simply corrupt enough (yes, more) that Moscow could have enough influence in Ukraine to be content with the situation.  
Sphere of influence here therefore meant far more than just NATO/EU-membership, it meant not interfering (even with money) with Russia's ability to influence/steer policy in Ukraine (and Belarus, Georgie, others). Anything that threatened this capability, that would enable Ukraine/Georgia/others to cut ties with Moscow and completely decide their own paths, was that step too far.  

Whether it is correct to let certain Eastern European countries' fate be (co-)decided by Moscow to safe-guard a safer, more peaceful co-existance with the nuclear power that Russia is ... is a very difficult question of realpolitik foreign policy. It is very much a hard risk/reward problem as well as a moral one (which countries/people do deserve the right to self-governance and how far should other countries go to help).",1645230671.0,1645230564.0,t3_svsa2c,t3_svsa2c,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

Dear friends, these days I am receiving many warm letters from all over the world with words of support due to the threat of an invasion from Russia in the coming days. 
I sincerely want to thank all of you for your concern, attention and participation in my long-suffering country. ❤
We are very unlucky with a wild and aggressive neighbor, an unnecessary country for the civilized world, which refuses to understand that greatness lies not in strength, but in applying it correctly. 
There are barriers that cannot be overcome by force alone, and the main obstacle for him is the Spiritual Force of Ukrainians.
For 8 years of the war, we have learned how to fight, the morale of Ukrainians is so strong that it is impossible to break us. 
We will be able to adequately defend our country, our home and loved ones, and we will try to stop this monster, which will not stop in Ukraine, but will definitely go further. 
If he doesn't break his teeth about us, of course.
And the participation and help of the whole world warms the heart very much, it helps a lot to keep the morale. 
Thank you so much, I really appreciate your love and care! ❤

Stardust on our boots
Cozy armchair with a checkered blanket

Sunny day in blazing dreams

My number on my sleeve
Wish me good lock in the battle
Wish me not to remain here in this grass

I do not want to put my foot on somebody's chest

What I do know is that Russia and other non NATO superpowers like to have neutral or allied countries on their borders. If Ukraine (I'd imagine this was discussed in talks) comes out and says they will not join NATO, it takes away a lot of the strategic benefit of Russia invading IMO.

My question is why would Russia want to invade Ukraine, besides the above reason? My first answer would be Putin distracting his population, but war will not be good for Russia. War means sanctions (Russias economy is smaller than California's economy) which would not be good for Putin and his allies and of course loss of life for a non threatening neighbor.

Biden and the US has done a really good job of painting the narrative, at least as a US citizen and Western world stage. Russia at this point has three options at this point: back down and lose face in their threats, in ade Ukraine and lose face in the international community and be hit hard with sanctions, or go allllll the way to the edge of invading, scaring the shit out of everyone, only to pull back at the last minute and claim to be the champions of peace.

Majority of the modern wars have been related to oil but now we are transitioning away from that to solar. Partly due to cost of war and climate change.

Afghanistan war was not just to get Osama but to help build the pipeline there.
Syria is a battle between Russia, Iran etc with the US and its allies on where the pipelines go to Europe. 

This battle with Russia vs Ukraine is about tarrifs for transporting natural gas from Russian pipeline to Germany and beyond. 

US has a stake in this too because US can supply natural gas to Western Europe. (It may already do that). 
Ukraine could easily step away from this mess by letting Russia transport its natural gas at whatever rate Putin is comfortable with (which publically we dont know).

I think there’s actually mounting evidence for this theory, as Russia is talking a lot about Donbas. According to other sources like Pod Save the World, if Russia invaded Eastern Ukraine, it would likely be enough to destabilize Zelensky’s government. Considering destabilizing literally everyone is his aim, this would not surprise me. I do think he’s also paranoid about NATO (which I find odd because I’ve always felt like NATO is completely useless at this point), but ultimately the man hates democracy, hates popular uprisings, especially in the countries surrounding Russia (better not give Russian citizens any ideas!), and Russia has been using and abusing Ukraine for decades. 

Anyhoo, I think that’s most likely what he’s doing. But I am by no means an expert, so please take that with a grain of salt.

Russia will be left alone by the international community as long as they refrain from all-out warfare against civilians. Ukraine has no preexisting alliances to speak of. (Obviously had they joined NATO none of this would have happened.)

Russia has neither the capability nor interest in aggressive action against any NATO member states. So in Europe that means they stop at Ukraine and Belarus. However there are many unaligned nations in Central Asia that may or may not have strategic interest to Russia. Possibly another invasion of Georgia is next, or Kazakhstan may either be invaded or accede to hefty Russian demands.

In general, Putin follows the ethnolinguistic playbook that has been the basis of war since World War I…or really since the existence of nationalism starting in the 1880s. The basic idea is that cultural barriers are a continuum, and whenever you draw lines you inevitably end up with some ethnic group on the wrong side of the line. Understanding this, Putin uses this as an excuse because border regions near Russia often have large Russian-speaking minorities. of course, the reverse is true as well so it’s really a question of which country is strong enough. Recall that this was essentially the same excuse Hitler used for annexing parts of Czechoslovakia. 

I expect that as far as Ukraine goes, when the dust settles Russia will retain Crimea, eastern Ukraine where Russian speakers are arguably the majority or at least half, as well as any areas of economic or strategic value. The rest of Ukraine may be able to remain independent as a buffer state between Russia and NATO but Russia may attempt to install a puppet government. 

Another issue is tensions between Russia and China which I’ve always been very complex. I wouldn’t put it past Russia to revisit a century-old interest in a warm water port in the Pacific although they need trade with China to keep the oligarchs happy. 

At the end of the day, how far Russia goes will depend on China. The real issue is that Russia is setting itself up for massive economic sanctions with the west, leaving China their a major trading partner. Russia is effectively a kleptocracy and policy is driven by what keeps the wealthy elites happy. If the west organizes a massive group sanction against Russia then the only money flows from China, and if we tell China “it’s them or us“ China may stop doing business with Russia to protect their economic interests. Of course China is getting strong enough now where they can pretty much write the rules so this all may fall somewhere in between. 

Of course, at the end of the day all of this could turn out to be a big bluff and Putin gets some negotiating concessions because everyone wants to avoid a massive war.",False,1645230453.0,t3_svsa2c,t1_hxiloti,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The fact that we still don’t have free healthcare is appalling. Hell we still have a bunch of red (republican) states here where marijuana is illegal.

Nobody on this side wants conflicts, there were never any intentional policies to hurt Russia, it's often other way around.

However, Russia's oligarchs at every turn try to fuck Russia over, they bring people to wars, they funnel money en masse to their ego projects, they kill everyone who exposes them, they don't give a fuck for well being of their citizens and longevity of their economy as long as they are able to squeeze some oil and gas money out of Russia. Now, however, they have minor panic with recent development of green energy + European countries working towards their energy independence, or dependence on other countries that Russia.

It's so sad to watch. But then again, I don't think it's by accident. If population didn't had war propoganda blasted to them daily, kept poor and being told that West is evil boogeyman that is rotting everything for them, then maybe they would turn to their rich ruling elites and a dictator, not like there aren't movements against Putin already.

Keep in mind, before the revolution the opposition party in Ukraine had loudly proclaimed that Ukraine should yank Russia's lease in Sevastopol.  I think this, along with the concerns about NATO/Western/democratic influence spreading, play equal parts in why Putin has drawn such a heavy red line around Ukraine.

I think the importance of Sevastopol is clear because the first thing Putin did after the revolution was move to secure the Crimea and Sevastopol. Sevastopol is key to Russia's status as a major power, because of where it's situated and because it's Russia's only warm water naval base. Ukraine has continued to make noise about joining NATO, and about retaking Crimea. Putin will NEVER allow either to happen, because see above. After the current US administration's debacle in Afghanistan, Putin decides this is as good a chance as he'll get, and this is the time to solidify Ukraine in the Russian sphere permanently.  I think you're right that this decision was made months ago and there's no diplomatic solution at this time.

Small chance Putin has done all this to scare the shit out of everyone and make it extremely explicit to the West that Ukraine is THE fucking red line re: NATO/Western/democratic expansion and interference, but I just can't see him leaving Crimea up to fate or the test of time.

Russia is still going in, they're going to take some or all of the Ukraine, heavy economic sanctions will be imposed on Russia by the west, Putin is going to blame any and all economic meltdowns on the west and those sanctions, Russia is going to enter a tight relationship with China as their power plant while China mass produces shit for Russia, and all of the countries that were united against Russia and China will continue to do the same thing while trying to deal with the fallout of this mess.

Putin's administration is going to call bullshit on anything said by the west and he's positioned to vilify the west more than ever which will gain him the support of an angry and desperate Russian public that'll be starving for some scapegoat stew.

Russia was likely headed for an economic meltdown before this happened. That would've made Putin look like shit to his own people. He's already pissed off most of the world, ruffled a lot of feathers at OPEC, and he's losing favor with younger Russians. The pandemic brought Russia even closer to an economic meltdown.

He needed some way to fix Russia's impending economic doom, hide that it was caused by his poor leadership, grab a new trade partner that's hungry for energy exports, and score a massive patriotic flex.

This invasion gets him everything he needs to accomplish his goals. Xi gets to tell Australia and OPEC to go fuck themselves thanks to his new energy supplier and can add Russia as a new major market hungry for his mass produced products.

Global energy sector goes bananas, the west is further demonized, Russia gains longterm economic stability and whatever parts of the Ukraine it can grab during this invasion.

I'm a foreigner who doesn't know anything but I'll say it in case you just need to hear someone say it, it may be worth considering leaving the city sooner rather than later. If nothing happens, you can return easily, but if it's bad then you will be safe. There would be no shame in it, and it's much better to be called overdramatic or gullible if it doesn't happen than to be in serious danger if it does.

Hesitation is always easy but rarely useful- either stay because you've decided staying is the best thing to do, or go because you've decided going is the best thing to do. Don't hesitate because you're not sure and have your choice made for you.

If you're going to stay, have plans A, B and C, know where you will meet people if separated and at what times of day, know your possible routes out of the city and then out of the country. Have a bag already packed which includes any medications, warm clothes, a phone charger, high calorie snacks, money and identification documents, a camping stove if you own or can get one, a water-sealed piece of paper with your important phone numbers on.

After you feel like you've made your choices and prepared as well as you can, make sure you're taking deep breaths. The other person was right that some things still matter. In some situations, we can't control what's going to happen but there are *always* some things you can control. Protecting others, helping your community or those around you, sharing, cooperation, whether you spend extra time worrying or with people you love, etc. There's the serenity prayer to refer to here, or Stoicism: ""grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference"". You don't have to suffer to excess no matter what circumstances you find yourself in, because letting go of what you can't change is a release of suffering. It's extremely common that when the list of those things you can change becomes really small, you end up finding out what your values really are and living them, and then you realise that a life lived according to your values is a life which can't be ruined by bad events, and where you can really give yourself fairness and compassion. Your values can be like a safe home which can't be taken away by anything.

Your community is with you even if it gets attacked or Kyiv has to empty, the solidarity formed in 2013-2014 is amazing to the rest of the world, so have faith in your city.",1645228096.0,1645227881.0,t3_svsa2c,t1_hxicot3,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

812ce98f0a12011ca237254a4e9ca8c6,svsa2c,hxim51v,"Lots of reasons.

The first was that Russia's economy was still in the toilet following the Obama era sanctions. They just didn't have the kind of money needed to do it. There was a currency crisis and the ruble plummeted. Even now there are questions about whether or not they have the money to handle occupying another country. And my guess is if they do now, they won't after the new sanctions hit.

The second was probably a lack of experience and other geopolitical aims. They had already taken Ukraine's navy, which effectively took their military from them. But they also didn't have much large-scale experience military-wise, which would later be solved by the war in Syria and ISIS. That took a lot of effort, and probably kept Russia from escalating things further.

The third was that he was having a shit ton of success with a lot of the things he's complaining about now through Trump. During his administration, Trump sowed a lot of discord in NATO by complaining about spending, pulling out troops without telling anyone, and even privately asking about pulling out of NATO entirely. Also, Trump was appeasing the hell out of him on the national stage by doing things like inviting Putin to join the G7. Putin could have invaded, but I think he saw Trump as a way to divide NATO enough to make invading easier.

Lastly, at the end of Crimea's annexation, potential further invasion and occupation of Ukraine was wildly unpopular with Russians. I think only 10% of the population actually thought taking Kyiv was a good idea. It takes a lot of planning to take people from 0-100 on invading a neighbor.

Other reasons might include the Navalny saga, discord with Putin at home, the construction of Nord Stream 2, COVID, and international pressure from continuing sanctions.

Ukraine is mostly a flat, featureless plain, so anyone staying out in the fields will only have the protection of whatever military equipment they have, and man made structures. 

Unfortunately for Ukraine, they have almost nothing to put in the air to contend with Russia, so Russia will have air superiority. What this means is any ukranian armored (which isn't standing up to russian armored regarldess) as well as all infantry will be greatly exposed to enemy air if they're not in a village/town/city. This will pretty much limit a majority of the back and forth to cities, with Russia mostly dominating the country side. Unfortunately, Javleins and Stingers alone will not be enough to stop this if Ukraine doesn't have enough of their own armored and air to contend with Russia, it will only fend Russia off. People want to pretend there's an avenue where this invasion becomes too ""costly"" but it simply does not exist anymore, Putin is dedicated and he has several times over tanks and jets in reserve than ukriane does in javleins and stingers. 

Once Russia has most resistance coraled back to cities they will seige them while cleaning up the country side. It will effectively turn Ukraine into a handful of isolated cities. Getting any resources anywhere will be impossible, if NATO is supplying Ukraine at this point, this would probably be the moment they stopped.

All war is a war of attrition. The too sides beat on each other to eat through the other's supplies, food, fuel, weapons and soldiers.  

The problem is, if both sides have nukes, at some point one side will be worn down enough that nukes are the only thing left. So what do they do, hold back proving their expensive complex nukes useless.  Making them week on the international stage, or use the bomb and likely destroy the enemy, themselves, and most of the wrest of the world.

What about the other side? Do they stop before it gets to the point where the losing side needs to resort to the bombs, leaving them able to come back to fight again in short order.  Or do they really try for decisive victory.  If the loser does launch.  Does the winner just take it to protect the wrest of the world, or do they retaliate in kind.

Two nations with the bomb can not functionally go to war.  No one can win.  The leadership knows this but they are all painted into a corner.  They have manouvered themselves into a place where if anyone backs down they make themselves look to weak to be taken seriously, but they know they can't go to war like they would have before WW2

Tactically I think Putin is currently trying to injure Ukraine by keeping his thumb on them without invading for as long as possible. Every day this waiting goes on causes injury to the Ukrainian economy and morale.  International investment halts, people can't work, and (in his mind) loyal Russians have the chance to overthrow zelinsky as more people just want it done.

But I think he has dramatically underestimated just how firm a position NATO and the world would take.  He's in a corner because he really doesn't want to invade and take thousands of casualties.  He wants another bloodless Crimea.

a7e2ce12f496e54934255bd9e502bfe7,svsa2c,hxib86j,"No, yes, and no. 

No, it's not going to a global conflict because the West isn't going to involve its soldiers in Ukraine and Russia is unlikely to push out past there.

Yes, if the sanctions disconnect Russia from SWIFT it can do real damage. Russia has reserves but not an economy that's strong in the long term or that is viable without high prices on natural resource exports. Possible sanctions can include making it a pariah on the Western markets and significantly impact the long-term economic health of the country.

No it's not enough to stop Russia in its tracks because the only one who can decide that is Putin, and his calculus is not dependent on how tough things become for the Russian people. No sanctions could destroy a country the size of Russia quickly. What they can do is make its geopolitical position weak and force it to basically become a junior partner to China. If the national interest was first, sanctions might stop Russia in its place. But long term national interest is secondary to Putin's personal interests so as long as he's OK with the consequences (and he appears to be) the sanctions can't stop him.

By the way, Russia is already in the process of becoming China's junior partner out of all this. Over the last year or two it's been cracking down on civil society by designating almost any group involved in politics or media which gets foreign money as 'agents of a foreign state'. However, despite multiple Chinese political organizations openly admitting to being funded by China, Russia hasn't been willing to designate even one of them a 'foreign agent', showing that for all its bluster Russia is scared to offend China.",False,1645224848.0,t3_svsa2c,t1_hxia54v,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Putin doesn't need the Ukrainians to love him. Putin likely would be happy enough with just nominally establishing an iron-grip in the region.

I'm hopeful if there is an invasion that the Ukrainian forces can hold off, but Russia has a lot of capabilities to greatly limit the capabilities of Ukrainian troops as well as mess up their communications. I think it really depends on how much force Putin wants to use. I kind of suspect Putin wants this to be a quick invasion, as most leaders would. Expect tons of drone strikes targeting Ukraine tanks, airbases, maybe even individual people key to Ukrainian military.

I suspect it will not though because that war would have far reaching ramifications in the form of ICBMs.  What the us probably will do is funnel weapons and money into Ukraine to make the entire thing as painful for Russia as possible in the hopes they are forced out.

I don’t think anybody really knows right now how the war will go.  The prospects are grim for Ukraine, but war is chaotic and upset victories have happened before, like Finland v. Russia in 1940 and the Serbians absolutely trashing Austria-Hungary in 1914.  

In this conflict the Russians have more money, more and better equipment (at least on paper) and a numerical advantage… but won’t be able to dedicate everything they have to the war because they have a vast territory to defend elsewhere.

On the other side of it, Ukraine would have the advantages of being on the defensive, fighting on home territory, and frankly a pretty determined population.  They also have broad international support and enough manpower to make taking and holding territory hard for the Russians.  While much of their equipment is old Soviet stuff, they have a hodgepodge of internationally sourced equipment, some of it more advanced than what the Russians have and very well suited for a guerrilla war.  The terrain is also slightly on their side at this time of year due to mud, but the open terrain in general tends to favor the Russians because they have much bigger air force.

Ultimately it’s predicted to be a bloody affair for everyone involved.  Even if Russia occupies the country in a week the conflict could drag on for a long, long time.  It’s possible Ukraine could throughly humiliate them, but they are outnumbered 3 to 1 and lack air superiority so it’s a long shot they win conventionally, especially in flat terrain which is less favorable to guerrilla tactics.

ae9aa9f28c862f2e41ff00c0d500ac78,svsa2c,hxi4hff,"Who knows, but, the best I’ve been able to piece together from what I’ve read is that Russia is trying to salvage its Ukraine policy, which has been failing since 2014. Russia views Ukraine as part of its vital interests, and having Ukraine aligned with the west, hosting western weapons, and potentially joining NATO and putting US forces in the country as unacceptable. When Ukraine turned to Europe after the Maidan revolution in 2014 Russia moved aggressively to seize Crimea and establish a foothold in the country using the Luhansk and Donetsk breakaway republics. Russia then negotiated the Minsk Agreements with Ukraine to change the Ukrainian government system and weaken the country, but this process has failed. Russia’s aggression in 2014 and its continued support of the breakaway republics and hostility towards Ukrainian sovereignty have just made Kiev more interested in western cooperation, western armaments, and a possible security guarantee. Thus, Russia’s policy has failed, mostly because of Russia’s own actions. 

At the same time, Ukraine is getting stronger. It is growing closer to the west. Russia has lost influence in the country. If Russia believes that Ukraine is a vital interest that cannot be allowed to “fall” to the west, then its window to prevent this may be closing. The costs may be getting too high if Ukraine can defend itself. So the only option is a show of force of some kind that would keep Ukraine in Russia’s sphere of influence. 

If that sounds like a vague plan that’s because it is. A lot of really smart people who know a lot more about this than I do have noted that there’s really no clear path for Russia to get what it wants through force. Occupation of the country would be very costly, and outright annexation impossible. A Russian invasion would just bring NATO closer and show that it is needed to deter Russian aggression. Ukraine would turn even further from Russia. It’s a self-defeating policy. 

But, as sometimes happens, leaders can convince themselves they have no real options if the one sure outcome, in this case the loss of Russian influence in Ukraine and its stronger ties to the west, is certain.

A few feet of railway track gets blown up by the Kempeitai, and the Kwantung Army just so happens to be on maneuvers and is simply compelled to invade all of Manchuria to uphold Japan's sacred honor. Sound familiar? 

Putin thinks he's in control of the situation on his side but in reality he has to worry about all these semi-autonomous factions inside his government and the motley group of puppet states around him that he set up.

at the time under the same agreement Kazakstan and Belarus had given up theirs, UKR wouldve been a pariah state, rogue in the eyes of Russia and the west.

command and control of the nukes was in moscow, and while this could be switched it wouldve been long and expensive

you know whats more expensive? storing and securing hundreds of nukes, that again, ukraine couldn’t effectively deploy. its like owning guns with trigger locks on them that you dont have access to unlock.

compile the expenses and the international isolation, add the fact that Ukraine economy was in the shitter most of the 90s, with a lower gdp then most post soviet republics is recipe for economic disaster

Eye on the TV  
'Cause tragedy thrills me  
Whatever flavor it happens to be like  
Killed by the husband  
Drowned by the ocean  
Shot by his own son  
She used a poison  
In his tea  
And kissed him goodbye  
That's my kind of story  
It's no fun until someone dies  
Don't look at me like  
I am a monster  
Frown out your one face  
But with the other  
Stare like a junkie  
Into the TV  
Stare like a zombie  
While the mother  
Holds her child  
Watches him die

Kind of like what the night hawk was. While the F-22 is an amazing fighter, arguably the best in the world right now, it's far to expensive to mass produce to a level that it can be used as a primary fighter.

The F-35 is meant to be the vanguard, namely it's job is to locate the enemy and use it's radar to mark them for missiles fired by other platforms and itself. While they can go behind enemy lines, their main job is to be able to get close enough to Sam systems and other fighters without being detected so they can use their radars to quickly mark the enemy, fire, and escape: and if things go tits up, they are extremely good front line fighter.

Finally you have the F-15EX, which is effectively an upgraded F-15 that acts as a missile carrier for the F-35 and AWAC'S systems. They are meant to stay just outside enemy radar, allowing the F-35 to mark targets for them to fire at, then light up said target with said missiles.

Finally you have the AWAC's systems, which are long range, aerial radar systems used for early warning and scouting. Their job is to locate the targets for the F-35 to engage and to provide early warning for possible incoming attacks.

What we should all be afraid of is the economic toll of a war breaking out and who takes sides in it. We already know China has Russia's back economically, but China is also the primary country propping up the USD, and a lot of the world trades in USD to supplement their native currencies. If China decides to pull the rug on the USD it would mean world economic collapse; like Venezuela level collapse, except for in countries that are more independent.
Outside of economically speaking, it's also hard to fight a war abroad when you have people starving in the millions in your homeland. Americans like myself need to be uniquely aware of this, but it seems everyone is putting headphones on and blasting the trumpets of war. If the war kicks off, the first thing that happens is the US power grid buckles because our infrastructure security is 10-15 years out of date and China and Russia know it, likely already having sleeper code in the systems regulating the power network. My fellow Americans seem to have this belief that America is untouchable, when in fact we are more vulnerable now than ever before because of technological dependence and shit security for said dependence. If China wanted to hit the off button on electricity in large swaths of the US, they could.

Russia could make a similar miscalculation. For example -- we freeze a bunch of their assets and shut down their gas sales. (Err, the ones they didn't blow up themselves.) 

They could, calculate, for example, that because we're deeply divided politically, struggling to control Covid, and because we pulled out of Afghanistan recently that we just don't have a stomach for a fight ... and they could hit us with a limited attack thinking we'll back down and retreat.

I’m sure that the US and several EU nations would also back them. I see the Ukrainians making any occupation extremely difficult for Russia.

How is the US/NATO to blame?
Where to begin...

How about the eastward expansion to Russia, violating their agreement almost immediately? 

Or more recently, the 2014 coup. 

The heavy build-up of US and NATO forces and weapons and the threat of establishing a base with missiles that can reach Moscow is less than five minutes.

The banning and jailing of the opposition in Ukraine, including and especially pro-Russian parties (and laughably, Poroshenko, who's under house arrest, since Zelensky views him as a threat)...

The arming and massing of up to half of the Ukraine armed forces up to the Donbass border including the Azov neo-Nazi battalion... with more recently, a marked increase in shelling of the region.

The declaration that Ukraine won't abide by the Minsk Agreement...

And as for the so-called build-up of Russian troops?
They was no build-up near the border.

Hell, up to several days ago, even the Ukraine govt said as much. I mean, before articles in the Western mainstream media began issuing veiled threats of another coup, by claiming that the Ukraine president didn't fully grasp the situation. 

Oh and let's not forget the claim by the US that Nord Stream 2 will not be allowed to proceed... with Biden TELLING this to the German PM during a press conference, in fucking Germany.

They do not wish to draw Putin into further conflict. They intend to do the opposite if possible by using this strategy.

The fallacy is to assume that Putin's objectives match up with the presumably rational assessment about what is to be gained as observered from a western perspective.

Jail?! Oh no, 3 months of free food and lodging 😱

The only reason we play their game in the first place is bc they sell a dream that in 36 years we can stop working without becoming homeless. As old people.

If we ALL were just like “but we don’t care about living that long, we don’t need your promises,” they’d have a hard time. 

And MAYBE fix a few things just long/well enough to bribe you back into place.

The problem is now and always will be that we are programmed to throw others under the bus for individual gain. The competition gives economy power.

We are not united. We will never all agree, or want to share, or agree to sacrifice for the bigger picture. 

Everyone has their own definition of “greater good,” so there will be no collective impact made to force lasting positive change.

Idk what the plan should be, bc I don’t care what happens to me. But the first step is everyone admitting what this is and what it ain’t.

What matters a lot more is the quality of the people pulling the triggers, the quality of their equipment and training, and the quality of how they're supported on the battlefield. 25,000 US Army infantrymen could easily defeat a traditional army of several million.

If you look at NATO, most of the countries simply don't have military capabilities on par with the Russians: the Turks, the Italians, the Germans, the French, and the British. Those are probably the only countries that have the power to really fight off a major Russian invasion or attack on their own. And it's not about numbers of troops.

""settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered""

Before they can fully join NATO, they need to get rid of their current issues. That's exactly why ukraine can't join NATO at the moment and why NATO has that rule. Having a country join with an open dispute makes that dispute a matter of the collective instantly.

Since NATO would then need to retake control of the part that Russia annexed, as NATO itself considered it to be illegal by Russia, it would result in an instant military action against Russia which would result in a war nobody  wants to fight or at least where everyone would lose.

Also you can't compare NATO and the EU. The EU is build on a common foundation and has many different aspects that need to be aligned before a country can join. Same for NATO but they differ a lot in terms of their requirements and goals.

And yes that ""veto"" is there for a reason. If a country invades another and the invaded country would simply be able to join NATO after invasion, they would trigger an immediate response where NATO would be unable to pursue any other way than to directly engage with its military. At least when the invaded country triggers the article for defense. 

You don't want a country in war to join and then tell you to come in guns blazing because that's the idea in case a member gets invaded.

If you want to believe the Ukrainian Army is intentionally raising tensions in general rather than simply responding in-kind to separatist violations, that's fine, but I don't think even the open source information available shows that to be the case for the most part. What's certain is Ukraine isn't committing ''geocide' in the area as Russian state TVs wants people to think.

Regardless of what that witness sees, the LPR and DNR's independence from Russia is highly questionable at the very best. They aren't inherently bad people, obviously as many had some legitimate grievances with the old Ukrainian government, but Putin has defacto control over the situation and calls the shots. I'm not sure if you're aware that a number of separatists were assassinated these last few years at what appears to be Russias' behest because they caused 'trouble'. Furthermore they are completely dependent on Russian sources for necessary supplies and ammunition",1645317463.0,1645317055.0,t3_svsa2c,t1_hxkgfxu,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

The things that book lists is *exactly* what was occurring while Trump was president. I'm not even saying Trump was doing it on purpose because of the book, just that it was happening. Trump being president of the US  makes Putin's goals much easier, because Trump is doing it himself already. Putin would not do anything that could put Trump's position as president in jeopardy.

It includes two pipelines running from Vyborg to Lubmin near Greifswald forming the original Nord Stream (also known as Nord Stream 1; former names: North Transgas and North European Gas Pipeline), and two further pipelines running from Ust-Luga to Lubmin termed Nord Stream 2. In Lubmin Nord Stream 1 is connected to the OPAL pipeline to Olbernhau on the Czech border and to the NEL pipeline to Rehden near Bremen.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan (one of Russia's most important allies) literally just survived a coup less than a month ago. A coup so messy that, when sent to disrupt protesters, 40% of the military arrived, joined forces with the protesters, and turned their weapons on their fellow comrades. The coup was only stopped by Russia dropping an entire battalion of paratroopers into the middle of the battle. But that was not even a month ago. And 40% man! 40% of the entire Kazakhstan army, when given the opportunity, were ready to kill their own fellow soldiers to topple their government! Shit doesn't turn all hunky-dory in 3 fucking weeks after some shit like that goes down!

Russia needs to be able to respond to future incidents in Kazakhstan, and the situation is ripe for the US and/or EU to manifest a civil war.

Meanwhile, less than TWO months ago, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan had mobilized 2/3 of *THEIR* entire militaries on each others borders, ready to go to war. It took a significant presence of Russian military *AND* Russian diplomats to quell this situation.

That was not even two months ago. It ain't like the spirit of fucking Christmas brought them back together. The situation is ripe for the US or EU to exploit with false flag attacks, tricking the two nations into fighting one another. 

This is Russia's backup. These shithole countries are Russia's NATO. And they've got a proper fucking mess on their hands.

He had Trump talking about leaving NATO and getting better ties with Russia, nothing would have been a dumber idea than to invade Ukraine in the middle of manipulating your way into a stronger position. The rest of NATO, many of whom have nukes, were never going to let Putin get away with invading without doing the same military support and sanctions they plan today, so Putin would not have been more successful if he did this while Trump was in office. It would have ruined his plans and caused enormous political pressure on Trump to stop siding with Putin, and wouldn't have made a difference to the outcome. UK would still have sent all the Javelins. There would still be very bad sanctions.

His plans with Trump to get his hands on Ukraine through improving his reputation, weakening NATO and getting Trump to spread his propaganda failed, so now he is invading instead.

Why the hell would you sabre rattle using 70% of your military, and then refuse to come to the negotiating table properly? Why would Putin make a list of extreme demands (removal of NATO from Eastern Europe and barring Ukraine from NATO), and demand the response *in writing*, while refusing to accept any negotiation?. Everybody knew that Ukraine is at least 10 years away from being accepted into NATO, and maybe even then they won't be able to meet the requirements to join. Just keeping up the eastern border dispute would be enough for Ukraine to stay permanently excluded from NATO because NATO will not accept a member in, just to get dragged straight into a war.

Putin *knew this*. He *still* demanded answers to his demands *in writing*. Which *forces* NATO to say ""we refuse to bar Ukraine, they have the right to choose"", giving Putin an excuse to justify invading in the name of security. The security claim is nonsense.

Because it's impossible. That's how revolution in Ukraine happened in 2014. The democratically elected president decided to agree to Russia's requests and was kicked out.

If you are talking about relations with the west, it isn't happening too. That's what Russia tried before 2008. Read Putin's Munich speech. How Russia was treated during the Balkan war also shows how the relations were going.

International law. It is illegal to just invade other countries and so is pretending to do so.

>They are right at our borders. Sometimes violating them. How would the us feel if Russia conducted military exercises near Florida? Unnecessary violations of Crimea borders are shitty too, although not illegal in international law.

You keep making whataboutisms about the US. I have criticized US imperialism many a times here on reddit. It is not a valid excuse and again the US troops stationed in Europe are not at treat to Europe.

>Not true

We have bombs that go on planes, not short range missiles that were banned by the treaty you mentioned.

>Because it's impossible. That's how revolution in Ukraine happened in 2014. The democratically elected president decided to agree to Russia's requests and was kicked out. If you are talking about relations with the west, it isn't happening too. That's what Russia tried before 2008.

Of course it's possible. Ukrainians didn't revolt against Russia, they revolted against Russia supporting corrupt oligarchs to do their bidding.

I am Bulgarian. I'd like nothing but good relations with Russia, but your government is not interested in good relations, investment, tourism, education etc... They are only interested in special interests to serve Russian oligarchies and thus they support the biggest criminals and most vile of Bulgarian politicians as long as they do their bidding.

Thankfully we are in the EU, otherwise during our 100 day protests against the criminal government last year, Putin would have sent ""security"" forces just like he did in Belarus and Kazakhstan (while making the state his vassal).

Had it not been for Russia's ""security"", Lukashenko would have went down just like our [criminal PM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyko_Borisov#Controversies) did.

If Russia simply acts like a friendly state no part of this will be necessary, but Putin needs to brew external conflicts to distract from the fact that Russians are now poorer than almost all of their Soviet subjects, despite their country having infinite natural resources and pristine land unlike the other soviet states.

and so on and on... you are being taken for a ride. This is not about Russian security, it's circus to distract you from Tsar Putin's regime.

They revolted against Ukraine staying closer to Russia instead of leaning towards the EU. 
And then elected an oligarch as a president. 

>but your government is not interested in good relations, investment, tourism, education etc...

Our government is a security freak. The problem is you being in NATO and having US military bases. Finland isn't doing this (for decades) and the relations are friendly. Ukraine leaning towards the west and it was a threat to our base in Sevastopol. That's why Crimea happened. I don't like this move, but I see the reasoning behind it. It's hard to geasp how important the base actually is from a regular citizen perspective. We don't know all the intelligence, we don't know what world leaders talk about behind closed doors.

>like he did in Belarus and Kazakhstan (while making the state his vassal).
>Had it not been for Russia's ""security"", Lukashenko would have went down just like our criminal PM did.

There were no Russian forces taking part in Belarus protests. CSTO forces were used in Kazakhstan for the first time ever. And in Kazakhstan they were just protecting the new president in his fight against the old president and his allies. It wasn't about an actual revolution. If you read about it, it becomes clear from the actions of Kazakh authorities. Russian forces (and Belorussian, Kyrgyz, etc.) didn't take part in suppression of the protests.

>Russians are now poorer than almost all of their Soviet subjects

He doesn't care about this. It's a very minor factor in his decision. He still has the support of 2/3 of the population, and actually, foreign policy isn't their favorite. He cares about security and his legacy, thus, that's why all the negotiations now are written on paper - so they will last longer than him.

Poorer than who? Baltics? That's it. Natural resources don't mean shit. Kongo has a ton of them - piss poor country.

Here's a strange take - thinking a universally respected general who has served in dem and republican administration's somehow represents trumps base. That's a really really bold take. But like everyone who's  ever worked for him, Trump turned around and shit on him. 

Here's some facts. 
The target for NATO countries to reach 2% is 2024 so its not even here yet. Your question of how long should they be allowed to stay in NATO is even more ridiculous with this in mind. However, it won't happen anyway. 

The U.S spends about ~3.5% of GDP on defense. That doesn't mean the U.S. contributes 3.5% to NATO. This includes supporting 50k in Japan. Troops and system in S Korea. Iraq. Qatar and other non-NATO related costs.

When it comes to ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUNDING OF NATO, BY 2024 Germany will be virtually tied with the US, contributing 16% of the budget each. Yea, that country you keep ragging on will be funding just as much as the US. 

The number 2% is completely meaningless and the agreement was asinine. One country can spend 1% on paying its soldiers and another 2% on the same. The percentage is meaningless. What matters is capability and interoperability with the U.S and that's a hole that needs fixing. That's where the attention should be, not some boohoo America

Goodbye launching point for any move against Russia.  Goodbye democracy in Europe.

How do you not see the break in your own logic? To say Trump is a populist (aka fighting for the people) but then to ignore the ""Universally respected General"" that the people support is so dumb.

""In ***2006***, NATO countries signed an agreement to spend at least 2% of their GDP on military spending, ***but by 2017 this standard was still unfulfilled by everyone except for the United States, Greece, Great Britain, Estonia and Poland.*** Meanwhile in 2018 the US military budget grew to $ 692 billion (twice the 28 other members of the Alliance)."" [https://uwidata.com/55-the-stumbling-blocks-of-nato/](https://uwidata.com/55-the-stumbling-blocks-of-nato/)

That's right, the 2% budget was agreed upon 16 years ago already and somehow there spending hasn't gone up but down. 

""As General Scowcroft, from whom you just heard, will remember -- several decades ago there was a heated debate within NATO to get countries to spend 3% of their GDP on defense-related issues. Now just a handful of our allies spend even 2% of GDP. If we ever needed more capabilities, it is now, with so many critical operations underway. We also must spend right, to make our forces as flexible and responsive as they need to be:""

>The U.S spends about \~3.5% of GDP on defense. That doesn't mean the U.S. contributes 3.5% to NATO. This includes supporting 50k in Japan. Troops and system in S Korea. Iraq. Qatar and other non-NATO related costs.  
>  
>When it comes to ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUNDING OF NATO, BY 2024 Germany will be virtually tied with the US, contributing 16% of the budget each. Yea, that country you keep ragging on will be funding just as much as the US.

I don't get why you're talking about Nation's direct contributions to NATO? That wasn't even brought up here. We're talking about NATO members GDP invested into their own military spending, which is literally the whole point of the 2% figure that you even talked about. Why are you going off topic? 

>The number 2% is completely meaningless and the agreement was asinine.

No way you actually believe this right? 2% is the fairest way of doing this. We're obviously not going to expect other nations to match dollar for dollar spending so we used percentages. 

>What matters is capability and interoperability with the U.S and that's a hole that needs fixing. That's where the attention should be, not some boohoo America First whiney bullshit.

Yes by all means argue in the opposite direction of what you're defending lol. They're not even hitting the minimum requirements now you want to claim the problem is they're not matching the US capabilities? Holy jesus dude... 

>I'm glad you finally admitted Trump was trying to dismantle it. Thank you.

If they're not going to meet the minimum requirements sure. In the mean time it had some of the desired effect of bolstering there own spending on there own defense because surprise Russia is still being assholes. Expecting the US to bail every other nation out when they're not even trying to defend themselves is stupid.

>Of course an alliance can have problems. You work with allies to solve then, not spit in their faces.

They're not even trying to work through there problems though, they're actively doing less and less until someone like Trump threatens to dismantle the whole thing.

""In 2020, 10 Nato countries (in addition to the US) reached or exceeded the 2% target - two more than in 2019 including for the first time, France and Norway.

The rest (including Germany, Italy and Spain) spent below that in 2020, even though they've all increased their spending as a percentage of GDP since 2014 (when the 2% target was agreed).""

Same article. 

I know it hurts to think critically. Do you care if Italy spends 2% of its GDP paying for soldiers to wear Nike underwear or do you care if that money is used to actually be helpful to NATO? The number itself is meaningless its not spent properly. 

So all of your ""facts"" are SHOCKER, wrong. 

NATO members have been giving more and more not ""less and less."" 

Trumps base is not republican. Trumps base is a bunch of right wing lunatics who can't rub two brain cells together. How can I prove that? Pretty easily. Despite losing almost every almost down ballot race, Democrats won the presidency in 2020 with a record number. Millions of Republicans rejected him and didn't vote for trump while voting red the rest of the ballot. A base does not and has not ever meant the whole of a party. It's a segment of a population who simply won't vote any other way. 

Lastly, factually again wrong about the invasions. 

Russia invaded Georgie in 1991 and 1993 under Bush Sr. 

Russia again invaded Georgia in 2008 after NATO promised them eventual membership under Bush Jr.

So Trump's rhetoric was working, countries were bolstering there own defense so we could stop playing world police great to hear. :)

>The rest (including Germany, Italy and Spain) spent below that in 2020, even though they've all increased their spending as a percentage of GDP since 2014 (when the 2% target was agreed).""

And these Nations still aren't meeting expectations. By the way, the original agreement for 2% was 2006 but hey I guess even the BBC is capable of being wrong. 

>I know it hurts to think critically. Do you care if Italy spends 2% of its GDP paying for soldiers to wear Nike underwear or do you care if that money is used to actually be helpful to NATO? The number itself is meaningless its not spent properly.

You're really trying to turn this argument into 'If they have to spend 2% of there GDP then it's going to be on stupid crap' Instead of ya know, enlisting more soldiers or developing better weapons or developing better counter terrorism tech. No is suggesting they just throw money to the wind, in fact that's directly against the idea that the 2% is meant for there own defense.

>So all of your ""facts"" are SHOCKER, wrong.

You think my facts are wrong? When you're trying to move the goalposts and going on tangents just to win arguments that aren't even taking place. LMAO The facts you have actually stated that pertain to our discussion have all reaffirmed my assertion. Why you fail at seeing this is beyond me.

No, I didn't said that every journalist that died in Russia is linked to Kremlin. You asked to give you proof of Kremlin/ Putin killing journalist and I gave you a list that contains journalists murders linked directly to Kremlin. These also aren't some far away timeline of different age, entire article is 1992+ . On top of all that we have this:  


""When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%).""  


TL;DR when journalists in Russia have been murdered in cases where it's not related to their job conviction rate is around 90%, when it's directly linked to their journalist work it's 20%.   


How do you explain this statistical abnormality? How can you say that Russia has freedom of press when journalists who are killed for political reasons see almost no justice and when journalist who are killed for other reasons magically get the justice?  


>So the US doesn't have any freedom of press too? I don't get why this argument doesn't work the same way for both countries.

Because in US when journalist is killed there is investigation and a conclusion, it's open to criticism and discussion. Citizens can take US to court and win. Your list barely even has any journalists that were killed by US government.  


I'm going through the list and the ""newest"" journalist that could even be a little bit linked to government in 1949 W.H. Bill ""Bill Mason"" who was shot by deputy because he most likely knew about senate candidate corruption... And we know about it because literally local newspapers and journalists wrote about it, his own tombstone reads ""He had the nerve to tell the truth for a lot of little people."".  


>It's not whataboutism. It's you providing invalid proofs and me pointing that out, by making the same argument for an obviously invalid point. A shitty list isn't a proof.

  
What invalid proof? Where did I spoke about US? I am not from US, my knowledge about current situation doesn't come from US.   


Now even if I take your bite and speak about US, it's so clear that freedom of press in Russia and US is a world apart in US favor, since the only example counter to it you provided me was a case from 1949 that was exposed by US own press.  


There is a reason why Russia universally ranks low in all independent polls of freedom of press. If you think that ""everyone else is wrong, but Russia is right"", then I think you have the case of eating the propaganda up.   


On top of all that the whole narrative that ""corrupted West"" is saying propaganda while Russia ""is telling the truth"" is ridiculous if you think about it for at least 5 seconds. What is there to gain for European countries to paint Russia wrongly? Literally nothing. Half of Europe is semi dependent on Russia's gas, we need Russia to be friendly, we want it's gas and oil, it's cheapest place you can get it. If there is a war in Ukraine US and Europe will have to apply some sort of sanctions, which is again, economically damaging to both EU and US.  


There is no reality where conflict with Russia is good for EU and US in any shape or form. The only reason you could give is very ridiculous one, which is EU and US wants to take over Russia and take over it's resources, which is ridiculous, because it's furthest point from reality. Not even for a second have Western countries threatened Russia's lands and for most European countries conflict with Russia would be too costly and the cons would outweight the pros, not to mention that in democratic countries you can't just storm people into war, there are no draft in most of them and you would simply not get elected.   


Ukraine has nothing to gain with war with Russia and absolutely everything to lose. There is no scenario where Ukraine war with Russia is positive for Ukraine.   


The only party that has something to gain from this conflict is Russia. However, if you think from the prism of average citizen, it is also a loss and not a gain, because people who are drafted will die, country will get sanctioned and have even bigger economical punishment. The only body that has something to gain is Putin and his friends who see this as an opportunity to flex to the West that they are still a superpower and is angry that eastern European countries are facing away from Russia towards US, NATO and EU. He also wants to posture against it's own population, because when everyone with an eyes can see that Russia's economy is falling and slowly most western countries are developing their energy  infrastructure that is independent from Russia, you have to make some hail mary moves.

How am I supposed to argue against a list? Do I argue against all of them or one case of my choice? Select one or two and we can talk.

>How do you explain this statistical abnormality?

First of all, you start by saying that Putin kills and then continue by saying he doesn't prosecute/investigate. It's very different.

Secondly, it can be easily explained. A typical murder in Russia is one drunk killing another drunk. Super easy to investigate and prove. Same goes for people killed in traffic and etc. So, cases where the murderer hasn't planned it and often doesn't even try to hide it. When someone is killed for their work, it's a carefully planed and executed crime, much, much harder to investigate and prove. I bet the ratios are the same in most countries for regular murders vs murders by professional killers/well prepared killers

>How can you say that Russia has freedom of press

I never said that everything was fine. I said that there is SOME freedom of press. There are independent media: Novaya Gazeta (Nobel prize), Meduza, Echo of Moscow, Kommersant and many smaller media outlets. Quite a few, actually. It's not like in Turkmenistan or something.

>What invalid proof? Where did I spoke about US?

A list isn't a proof, I said why above in this comment. I used this argument in support of an obviously false point: ""US doesn't have freedom of press"". To show that it's a bad argument.

>freedom of press in Russia and US is a world apart in US favor

Yes, that's why it's obvious an argument of a list is invalid.

>There is a reason why Russia universally ranks low in all independent polls of freedom of press.

Partly because it's true, partly because of an anti-Russian bias and anti-Russian climate in western media.

>What is there to gain for European countries to paint Russia wrongly?

To a degree it's a tradition dating back even before the USSR, but greatly worsened during the USSR. On the other hand, Russia is often used as a political tool. Look how often Russia is used as a synonym for bad in politics here on reddit. For example, the case of Trump and Russians. This creates a positive feedback loop of people saying something positive about ""horrible"" Russia being suppressed, which further worsens the picture of Russia in western public eyes.

>There is no reality where conflict with Russia is good for EU and US in any shape or form.

Yes, that's why it's being used as a tool for negotiations between the US and Russia. It's not much more than a tool for these negotiations (mainly security protocols US quit during Trump's term and was reluctant to come back to in Biden's term).

>Russia's economy is falling

It literally isn't, it's been flat since 2014. Agricultural countersanctions worked and agriculture is on the rise. Industry is being developed too. Rosatom is now the world leader in nuclear reactors under construction, they've released their first product in biomedical field, built a full cycle (from oil to fabric) carbon fiber factory. UAC's new A320/737 competitor has just received a basic certificate (with CFM engines), new Russian engines (PD-14) are in certification; prototypes of CR929 are being manufactured. New Angara (Proton-M substitute) rockets are finally in serial production, and the first one of the bunch has been launched recently. Some great developments are seen in IT, Russian made servers are being deployed. Like 3 new CPUs are in final stages of development and it seems like MCST is finally getting the support they need to get somewhat commercially competitive with Intel and AMD in server applications. OCSiAl (overwhelming world leader in graphene nano tubes) is also a cool project that came to be because of the government.

Over all, the economy isn't great because of all the sanctions, but I see a lot being done. Another example is a recent ban of export of raw wood, which is going to promote local manufacturing.
