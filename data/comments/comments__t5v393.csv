- His ""minute of silence"" lasted a couple of seconds and then someone off-camera told him to start up again; a later broadcast will probably display some patriotic image or something for the full minute before returning to him.

- At the end he said he'd turn to a minister for a military update, and then just sort of drifted into silence. There was no minister, and nobody provided any update. Then we cut back to him.

Alot of the news sites are moderated for comments, so look for niche forums on things like IT, hobbies, etc.  The sanctions are affecting everybody, so people are talking about the situation pretty much everywhere.  You can see there's alot of internal wrestling with how to think about the conflict, and people are still processing all that's happened.  Try to be respectful and understanding.

* The U.S. government has committed over $118 million in equipment and training to Ukraine’s security forces to help Ukraine better monitor and secure its border, operate more safely and effectively, and preserve and enforce its territorial integrity.  Ukraine’s security forces include their Armed Forces, State Border Guard Service, and National Guard.
* This assistance includes the provision of body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, patrol boats, rations, tents, counter-mortar radars, uniforms, first aid equipment and supplies, and other related items.
* The United States has also begun a process led by U.S. European Command and Department of Defense civilian and military experts to work with Ukraine to improve its capacity to provide for its own defense and set the stage for longer-term defense cooperation.  This includes medical and security assistance advisory teams.

* The U.S. bumped up its military support in 2014, soon after a popular uprising ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Russian troops annexed the Crimean peninsula while fomenting a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region. The vast majority of the funds, approved with bipartisan support in Congress, has financed items such as sniper rifles; rocket-propelled grenade launchers; counter-artillery radars; command and control and communications systems; night vision goggles; medical equipment; as well training and logistical support.  
* “There has been a tangible, measurable impact,” added Omelicheva, who visited the Ukrainian training center in March. And beyond that, she said, the help created “an immeasurable, psychological impact — that the U.S. has our back.”

We need to mobilise and intensify our efforts as much as possible,

One post in the Telegram channel read.

More than 237,000 people joined the Telegram channel in the days after Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov put out a call for the country’s network of hackers to join the cyberwar against Russia.
“There will be tasks for everyone,” Fedorov tweeted.

We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.

> - Russia exports about 95 billion euros of goods to the EU

> - Any exports still going into the EU would be hit with tariffs

> The European Union is seeking to remove Russia’s most-favored nation status at the World Trade Organization, a move that could further hit 95 billion euros ($105 billion) of Moscow’s exports to the bloc with tariffs.

> The sanctions already imposed by the EU have closed off a significant portion of financial and trade ties with most European companies. Ending most-favored nation status would increase costs via tariffs for any EU companies still doing business with Russia.

> “In reaction to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the EU has adopted sweeping sanctions vis-a-vis Russia, which undoubtedly have a major impact on trade,” European Commission Spokeswoman Miriam Garcia Ferrer said in an emailed reply to Bloomberg. “We are discussing options available to us in the WTO context. This includes the possibility of removing MFN treatment to Russia on the basis of the WTO national security exception.”

> The EU has already adopted broad sanctions against Russia, including banning transactions with the Russian central bank and cutting some Russian lenders from SWIFT, the global financial-messaging system. The move at the WTO would further isolate Moscow from the EU. 

**Petroleum, Agriculture**

> The commission is in talks with member states and allies about the move and the proposal is a work in progress, according to a person familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The move would be technically complicated and they’re still working through the details. 

> The EU is Russia’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 37% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world in 2020. Total trade between the two regions that year amounted to 174.3 billion euros, and the EU’s top import from Russia is petroleum -- worth about 67 billion euros a year. 

> Russia also exported to the EU 4.3 billion euros worth of agriculture and raw materials, 4.1 billion euros of chemicals and 4 billion euros of iron and steel. 

> Separately, Canada revoked most-favored nation status for Russia and Belarus on Thursday and Ukraine on announced this week a “complete economic embargo” on Moscow and said it would no longer apply the WTO agreements with regard to Russia.

> **National Security**

> The government in Kyiv said its decision to withdraw WTO benefits to Russia is consistent with the WTO’s national security exemption, which allows a country to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.”

> This week U.S. lawmakers in the House and Senate proposed legislation that seeks to end permanent normal trade relations status with Russia and urges President Joe Biden to begin the process of suspending Russia’s membership in the WTO.

> WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the organization is “deeply saddened by the continued suffering and loss of life,” according to a statement on Wednesday. “We are also concerned about the trade implications of the conflict, especially trade in agriculture and food products and the rise in energy prices and their effects on the impacted populations.”",False,1646326010.0,t3_t5v393,t3_t5v393,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Kotin said Ukraine still controls both plants including Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but Russian troops have advanced to within 21 miles of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the South Ukraine power plant.

The mayor of Enerhoda, in which the Zaporizhzhia plant is located, said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops for control of the south-eastern city.

Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said.

Another adviser, Vadym Denysenko, described the situation as alarming.

Russian forces took the Chernobyl plant last week. Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Kotin described Russia’s capture of the defunct nuclear power plant as “nuclear terrorism”.

*- asks for minute of silence for foreign soldiers (?)*

*- lists specific Russian generals were able to break ""enemy lines"" - mentions one specific Russian general who managed to break lines without ""loss of human lives"".*

*- soldier X fought until the end, then threw a grenade and blew himself up, together with Ukrainian enemies. They are neo-Nazis - they are killing and torturing their prisoners.*

*- I am Russian in my genes.*

*- We are all Russian, and I am proud to be part of this people that is made up of so many different groups. And I will never give up on my conditions that Ukrainians and Russians are one people. Ukrainians have been brainwashed that this is not true, through propaganda.*

*Some willingly chose this - these are the same people who stood by Hitler in WWII. They are neonazis*

*- These neonazis and terrorists from Middle East use humans as human shields. You have seen their cities. (?)*

*- Rather than removing their military material from houses and hospitals, they continue to put these items in residential areas. They are using foreign students as hostages. X Indian students and over > 5000 Chinese students were held as hostages. Others were held in Kharkiv and were not allowed to leave - it was suggested that they leave through Poland, which is of course very risky for them - we have offered their evacuation.*

On top of all this coming to light of how useless the Russian military actually is, the country is essentially going bankrupt for the foreseeable future.

lol you mean the Ukrainian army that routed the Russians in Luhansk?

The Ukrainian army which currently possesses in country more anti tank weapons than Russia possesses tanks?

The Ukrainian army that has killed three high ranking generals in 6 days?

The Ukrainian army that’s inflicted almost 10k casualties in a week on the Russians?

The ukrainian army that has destroyed and halted the convoy north of Kiev, which has now been sitting stationary for 4 days?

The Ukrainian army which has just been bolstered by almost 20,000 foreign fighters, trained and experienced in urban warfare?

The Ukrainian army that has a hotline to US intel, which has successfully projected all Russian movements over the last month?

The Ukrainian army that has been cycling out troops in Donetsk and Luhansk over the past 8 years so that now over a million Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have recent combat experience against Russian forces?

The same Ukrainian army that Russia wasn’t able to gain an inch of ground against over the last 8 years in the regions where they’ve propped up separatist regimes?

That Ukrainian army?

Ok my dude.  I wonder if they’ve hiked your pay now that the ruble is worth less than $0.01USD.

There’s no victory for Russia. It’s all bad news, all the way down.

Either they retreat and lose face, stay and lose the entirety of their mechanized army, or try to dig in and fight a war of attrition while their economy shrinks by orders of magnitude with each passing day.

What happens when the Moscow stock exchange reopens?

What company will invest in Russia in the future after they’ve nationalized foreign companies and seized their assets?

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”.

Speaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president addressed Putin:

We are not attacking Russia and we do not plan to attack it. What do you want from us? Leave our land.

Referring to the Russian leader receiving world leaders at a now-famous enormously long table, Zelenskiy said:

Sit down with me. Just not 30 metres away like with (French President Emmanuel Macron).

He also called on the West to increase military aid to Ukraine , warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia is allowed to advance.

If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!

If we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next. Believe me.

Russia didn't send in shit troops first, they are just getting their asses handed to them by a smaller army with less (and largely much older) equipment.  You don't put your very best equipment in the hands of your very worst troops.

>We are witnessing, literally watching live, Putin commit genocide on an industrial scale in Ukraine while the most powerful military alliance in history stands aside. It's impossible not to be emotional, but let us also be rational and focus our rage on the facts.

>Putin once again told Macron to go to hell, no surprise. NATO/EU has already told Putin they won't touch his forces, so why should he listen? Russia is lifting target limitations and the death toll is rising every hour and lack of water & electricity is critical.

>No treaty forbids NATO nations from fighting to defend in Ukraine. It's a choice based on the risk of Putin going nuclear, many say. That arming Ukrainians is an acceptable risk of WWIII & the citizenship of the pilot or soldier changes Putin's nuclear calculus, or NATO's.

>If they care so much about the fine print and think Putin does too, ask Zelensky to issue Ukrainian passports to any volunteer to fly in combat. Sell jets to Ukraine for €1 each and paint UKR flags on them. Do you think Putin will care? Is it worth the lives lost?

>This is already World War III. Putin started it long ago & Ukraine is only the current front. He will escalate anyway, and it's even more likely if he succeeds in destroying Ukraine because you have again convinced him you won't stop him even though you could.

>Biden & others insist NATO would retaliate should Putin attack Baltic members. Watching Ukraine, I am not sure of that at all, and Putin won't be either. If the calculation is about nuclear risk, it's no different over Estonia than Ukraine. Don't say ""Putin would never"".

>If this sounds familiar, it's the same argument from 2014, when Putin invaded E Ukraine and annexed Crimea. It was too risky to stop him, I was told, as I pleaded for intervention and warned he would never stop there. Here we are, with bombs raining down.

>Risk and costs are higher now because the ""reasonable"" people in the West always choose lower risk today to guarantee higher risk tomorrow. Clearing the UKR skies after a warning period is risky. Letting Putin destroy Ukraine is riskier, & a human and moral disaster.

>There is no waiting this out. This isn't chess; there's no draw, no stalemate. Either Putin destroys Ukraine and eventually hits NATO with an even greater catastrophe, or Putin falls in Russia. He cannot be stopped with weakness.

all of over 300 national groups of ethnic groups in Russia is simply impossible to list I think you understand me but I am proud that I am part of this world of the mighty strong multinational people of Russia at the same time, I will never give up my conviction that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, even despite the fact that some of the inhabitants of Ukraine were intimidated by many only with analytical propaganda, and someone deliberately. Hitler and it is that we are fighting against her by the Nazis shows the very course of hostilities, nationalist and non-Nazi formations, and among them there are foreign Mercenaries, including those from the Middle East

covered by civilians as a human shield I already said there are absolutely objective photographic data of how they place heavy military equipment in residential areas of the city together works that way with the most extreme bandits instead of keeping the promise to remove this equipment from residential development from kindergartens of hospitals, on the contrary, it additionally transfers artillery mortars to tanks there

they also took hostages of foreign citizens, including 1,000 young students who were studying in Ukraine, so they kept 3,179 Indian citizens, mostly students, at the railway station in Kharkov for more than a day, and most of them continue to be held until now, including 576 people in the city of Sumy no, the Nazis opened fire on Chinese students who tried to leave Kharkov, two of them were injured, I repeat hundreds of foreigners, they try to leave the zone, they don’t let them do it, they actually hold them hostage, they take time or they offer to evacuate through Lvov to Poland, that is, to drive through the entire war zone putting them at risk

our military personnel provided corridors in all major clashes without exception provides transport so that civilians of foreign citizens have the opportunity to a safe place again emphasized the nationalists do not allow this to be done moreover now they are instructing foreign citizens to contact their authorities And they, in turn, will have to apply to The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine actually enter just throw it under fire

even worse for me we eat treat their own citizens with their population the same said they hide behind people like human shields our military also note such facts, When in the cities of the people's republics of Donbass in Severodonetsk Lisichansk other residents of apartment buildings are rounded up, the average expectation of the lower floors breaks windows and walls expose heavy equipment cannons there Tanks are driven on the roofs and machine guns snipers only the Nazis conquered So stop without humane attitude to the civilian population when Soviet troops fought, including liberating the territory of Ukraine

I repeat, our soldiers and officers are striving to prevent civilian casualties and, unfortunately, they themselves suffer losses, our duty is to support 7 1 comrades who fought for the security of the fatherland for our people for the people of Russia to all family members, servicemen during a special military operation on Ukraine will be transferred the insurance coverage provided for by law and a one-time allowance up to 7,000,000,421,1000 rubles. Monthly monetary compensation will also be paid to each member of the family of the victims. But in addition, I consider it necessary to establish an additional payment to each family of the deceased soldier of the Ministry of Defense of military personnel and employees of other law enforcement agencies participating in the operation

in the amount of 5 million rubles All military personnel wounded during the operation will also receive appropriate insurance and a one-time allowance for injury to injury or concussion. case of disability monthly monetary compensation all these measures are already provided for by law

together also believe that it is necessary to provide for additional payments to the military personnel of the Ministry of Defense, military personnel and employees of other law enforcement agencies participating in operations and injured at the cost of 3 million rubles now on Ukrainian territory our soldiers and officers are fighting for Russia for a peaceful life for the citizens of Donbass for denazification demilitarization of Ukraine so that no anti-Russia created by the West for years right at our borders threatens me, including with nuclear weapons, as it was recently

our people are proud of their armed forces, we will always remember our fallen comrades in arms, we will do everything to support their series, then their education will support relatives and friends I ask you to honor the memory of our soldiers who died in the line of military duty during a special military operation in Ukraine

please dear comrades, I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding in strict accordance with the schedule according to the plan all assigned tasks are successfully solved

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

#• Putin contemplates invoking martial law - what does that mean?

Martial law essentially means the suspension of civil law and that the army or military bodies will enforce strict rules like for example curfew's or to prohibit big public gatherings of people.

Usually martial law is invoked to suppress people and prevent them from rising up and voicing their dissent with the current ruling party. 

In this instance it would likely mean that russian people wont be able to protest the war anymore without gettinf severely punished. [will be updated once we know more - rumor has it that it will be announced friday the 4th]

Russia isn’t going to have the infrastructure, talent, or resources to continue meddling as deeply into national affairs. The dissent Russia has been trying to sow among the US’ population is about to meet them right at their doorstep. 

China is going to absolutely bully Russia in all aspects and molest them for cheap resources, labor, whatever they want. What is Russia gonna do? This in turn might turn Chinas focus from the US onto Russia. 

At the very least, America has gained some much needed respect and credibility from the world after the Trump fiasco. 

To top all of that off, I think Ukraine is far from done. Everyone is discounting their defense as “only a matter of time before they fall.” I don’t necessarily think that’s true. The way Putin is running his troops into the sawmill there is a serious opportunity to wear them down and push back. Home field advantage is a massive asset.

She was speaking as EU interior ministers agreed on a temporary protection directive that will grant Ukrainian nationals the right to live, work, access healthcare, housing and education immediately for up to one year, without the requirement to go through lengthy asylum procedures.

If the conflict continues, or refugees cannot return safely, that status could be extended for a further two years. It will not offer any such rights to people from elsewhere who are in Ukraine as temporary workers or as students.

The European commission’s original proposal was also watered down in relation to so-called ‘third country’ nationals who have long term residence in Ukraine. National asylum laws will apply to them.

It is understood that Poland and Hungary were the most vocal in opposing the initial proposal.

Where is the line? Chemical weapons, starving people with siege tactics? Ukraine? Moldova? Finland? 

When they start throwing nukes they know they are doomed, it’s a last resort for everyone.

Should Russia (Putin's) aggression remain unchecked, I don't see how this ends without a more thorough Russian loss and Putin's removal from power. While this in isolation could favor China (a regional power and their northern border becoming economically, politically, and militarily neutered), I HAVE to believe that they would instead prefer a compliant Russian ally to help them against the USA and Western allies. Removing Russia as a threat to Europe allows Europe to instead to push to provide economic and political support to African countries (which China has been aggressively developing) and the USA and Asian allies can more directly focus on countering a growing Chinese presence in the Pacific.

But, a Russian loss is even worse for China than that! Consider the potential possibility of a Ukrainian victory coupled with Putin being removed from power. If Russia could truly be subjected to an internal political reform (whether via Navalny-led opposition or other), over the ensuing years, Russia may even evolve to be neutral (or less likely, more economically and socially allied) with a forgiving Europe. China losing a geopolitical regional ally in Russia, AND having them potentially become more of a threat, seems like too big of a risk to accept.

India has, like many other countries, followed the principle of non-allignment since its inception.

This has helped India in forging many alliances and furthered its goal of non-allignment. But the problem is that there will always be conflict. India typically just tries to stay quiet, which also happened when India and China recently had heightened tensions with both sides losing several soldiers in an escalation when Russia decided to stay neutral and passive due to its relations with both countries.

First and the most public reason is the claim that the certain regions of Ukraine are more populated by Russians and have a Russian background so they should be part of Russia. Seeking to rebuild the Russian Empire. It's a weird motivation for the year 2022, but whatever.

Second Ukraine offers multiple things geographically that Russia wants. It further insulates Russia from the EU/Nato. Russia knows if they continue their current aggressions that EU/Nato could use Ukraine as a staging area to keep troops close to Russias heart. Ukraine also has access to much of the black sea which would benefit Russia from a logistics point of view for both military and trade actions.

1. Ukraine serves as a buffer zone between Russia and NATO. If Ukraine is under Russian control it makes an invasion of Russia very difficult. So, from Putin's perspective, it's geographically advantageous for Russia.
2. Putin wants to restore the USSR. After Ukraine they will likely try to grab Moldova.
3. Ukraine is sitting on natural gas, and in fact started hiring oil and gas companies to look into extracting the gas to be sold. If Ukraine joined NATO and the EU, they could become a supplier of this gas to the west, which would effectively further limp Russia's economy. When Russia grabbed Crimea in 2014, it also gained control of a ton of untapped natural gas off the coast of Crimea. This also applies to the Eastern ""breakaway"" regions of Ukraine - there is untapped natural gas there. Russia is moving to take control of Ukraine so that they can either tap these natural gas deposits for themselves or prevent Ukraine from tapping them so Russia can continue to be Europe's biggest gas station
4. On top of all of this, Russia pays billions to Ukraine in tariffs per year to have their gas flow through Ukraine to Europe.

Russia’s sense of geopolitics is still Soviet in mindset in that it sees the world in terms of power centers and spheres of influence. They see Ukraine in a way that is similar to how the U.S. would view Canada (not a perfect analogy but sort of works). A close neighbor and cultural ally. 

The idea that Ukraine wants to become more democratic and open and culturally western is deeply threatening and Putin wants to stop that, and will destroy it if need be. He doesn’t want his own people getting any ideas about democracy, and he doesn’t want Russia to be humiliated that a close neighbor is rejecting its style of government. And not only that but doing it to join his biggest rival, the west. 

It is a fear based mentality at the core.

2. They already have crimea but its not internationally recognized and as Putin said if ukraine joined Nato they could claim a war on Russia for invading crimea (they held it since 2014).
3. Strategic positioning for sure. The land is very flat from ukraine to moscow this was the route Napoleon and Hitler used to attack moscow. Also belarus is a sitting duck if the enemy controlled ukraine.
4. They have this fear that they will be invaded since mongolians took Russia and held it and sfter that napoleon and Hitler tried to. Their crazy logic tells them to invade first to not be invaded which ironically leads to making more enemies.
5. Crimea used to be Russia during soviet time. It was in soviet republic and fully russian. Soviet leader gave it as a gift to ukraine (these happened in other parts of soviet too). At the time they thought soviet is forever so changing border between soviet ukraine and soviet Russia meant nothing and was symbolic. So they feel they are rightful owners of crimea. Ironically even erdogan from turkey has claimed crimea is historically theirs.

These are not justificstion to invade they should have just accepted the borders and work with ukraine. Ukraine did increase the land lease on sevastopol and gas tarifs etc which lead to Russia getting angrier before 2014.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

While this in isolation could favor China (a regional power and their northern border becoming economically, politically, and militarily neutered), I HAVE to believe that they would instead prefer a compliant Russian ally to help them against the USA and Western allies. Removing Russia as a threat to Europe allows Europe to instead to push to provide economic and political support to African countries (which China has been aggressively developing) and the USA and Asian allies can more directly focus on countering a growing Chinese presence in the Pacific.


No matter how you shake it, Russia as more of a pariah is a Russia China has more control over.  And if China acts against ""Russian"" interests, they lose power.  Also, this could very easily end with Putin still in power.


> 
But, a Russian loss is even worse for China than that! Consider the potential possibility of a Ukrainian victory coupled with Putin being removed from power. If Russia could truly be subjected to an internal political reform (whether via Navalny-led opposition or other), over the ensuing years, Russia may even evolve to be neutral (or less likely, more economically and socially allied) with a forgiving Europe. China losing a geopolitical regional ally in Russia, AND having them potentially become more of a threat, seems like too big of a risk to accept.


A Russian loss doesn't necessarily mean Putin removed from power, much *less* reform.  Again, a battered Russia with no friends is one over which China can exert a great deal of influence.

>	Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993 when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997 he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he lost to the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player when he retired from professional chess in 2005.

>	Since retiring, he has devoted his time to politics and writing. He formed the United Civil Front movement and joined as a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed ""official obstruction"", he withdrew. In the wake of the Russian mass protests that began in 2011, he announced in 2013 that he had left Russia for the immediate future out of fear of persecution. Following his flight from Russia, he had lived in New York City with his family. In 2014, he obtained Croatian citizenship, and has maintained a residence in Podstrana near Split.

1) Putin begins a long-term occupation of the country with Russian forces, in which case he's going to face an extremely powerful insurgency, which would turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan.

2) Putin attempts to install a friendly/puppet central government and/or break the country up into a mix of autonomous entities and annexed provinces, and thereby cripple the central government.  If he does this, however, he'll likely just face another Euromaidan.  Whoever he installs there will *still* need a huge Russian military presence to protect them from the population and Ukrainian military that survived the invasion.

3) the end-game is simply Zelensky's exile, or his/his successor's (and Western countries' agreement) that Ukraine will never be a member of the EU or NATO.  But this requires him to win the war or gain enough advantage to actually oust Zelensky or put Ukraine into a position where they feel forced to bargain.

They are destroying a lot of the Russian assets with shoulder fired weapons. If you tried to meet the russian Armor head on it would play directly into their strength.

The fact that the entire world has been hearing about this Russian army traffic jam for a week, amd the Ukrainians have not annihilated it points to the conclusion that the Ukrainian army does not have the equipment to engage them effectively.

There are twofold reasons for this: 1, politically, fighting a defensive war is far easier to justify. 2, a defensive battle is far easier to supply. Offensive operations require anywhere between 3 and 5 times as many troops, and then they need 3 to 5 times as much supplies as the same number of defensive troops. 

As for why armored vehicles, helicopters, and jets aren't being sent, specifically: they aren't simple weapons that soldiers can be trained on in a matter of hours. You need whole armies of logistical troops, engineers, supplies, spare parts, and months of training to make such systems effective. It's much better to supply Ukraine with weapons already integrated into their training and command structures. Western nations don't have any significant number of such vehicles that Ukraine is able to integrate quickly.

You can actually see exactly what happens when you don't have the logistical support necessary for complex weapons systems with the helpful demonstrations being put on by the Russians: starving, demoralized troops; broken, malfunctional vehicles; stalled and vulnerable columns. Even when we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of support, that isn't enough money to pay for the support behind even single-digit numbers of major weapon systems like military aircraft...

It's also good to note that while there's news of Putin getting 'deranged', there's several levels of approval that need to be escalated before a nuke is launched. Lots of people on his inner circle - while they may fear Putin - likely aren't psychopathic, just drunk on power, and still fear death. If you nuke a place, you risk having other countries retaliate in kind. They know that, and don't want to lose their precious lives and material wealth in an instant. 

It's also worth noting Putin doesn't want nuclear warfare. Despite what he claims, it's likely not the case. He's using the threat of nukes in the same way that he's threatening the Russian people with imprisonment and death for protesting - to bully other Nations into backing off and letting him take Ukraine. He WANTS people to be terrified so that regular citizens will call upon their leaders to ""stop pissing him off"" and ""stop sanctioning him"" because they don't want to die in nuclear warfare. 

If he uses nukes - he will likely be retaliated against in kind. He wants to be God-King of the Soviet Union. You can't be God if your subordinates and the people you want to subjugate are reduced to ashes. You can't be God if the entire city you claimed to liberate was completely wiped off the map. You can't be the all-powerful ruler of nothing - on top of the fact that he will likely die with the entire world snapping and deciding if he won't play by the rules, then they won't either. 

Putin is a megalomaniac. He wants power, worship, and glory. He wants to be able to control any country he wants, and bully them into giving him whatever he wants.

While I agree that Ukraine is unlikely to beat back Russian Army the rest you are not correct. This from even novice observation is a complete and absolute miscalculation and failure. The logistics, organisation, deployment, fighting style, teater tactics and basic understanding of seasonal weather tell you that this is an absolute failure.

Even if just 20% of Russian losses are true it's more than what US has lost in 20 years. It is by all accounts incompetent and incapable. The fact that they knew very well what the terrain in Ukraine is like at this time of year and what the weather is like, the fact that they will be stuck to using roads which end in funnels making them easy targets I mean there is just so much to unpack here. After 8 days they have not secured a single objective.

&#x200B;

>The bulk of Russian forces have not entered into fighting yet. The Chechen fighters are now engaging. And they are only slightly behind their own (captured) timeline.

90% of deployed forces have entered Ukraine not just Russian but also Cechnyan and Belorussian 

&#x200B;

>More and more tanks are entering artillery range.

Which are shit for this season, this terrain and this warfare tactics. On one hand you have artillery and tanks from 60s and 80s, stuck to roads or stuck in mud, without much forward recognisance against highly mobile infantry using Javelins, NLAW, RPGs.. Good luck with that.

&#x200B;

>Soon it'll become a more constant bombardment.

Short of nuclear weapons there is nothing more the Russian arsenal has to offer in this regard. There is also nothing more left to bomb. Also missile strikes have heavily been reduced so the lack of missiles has been confirmed they have resorted to using vacumm bombs and ordinary artillery hardly effective against a highly mobile infantry in a ruined city.

&#x200B;

>Civilian casualties will skyrocket.

They already have. As will Russian losses. There is no scenario where Russia takes and holds Ukraine. None 0. Not with this Army not with this economy not with these logistics and not with this morale.

&#x200B;

>And all Putin has to do is keep his fight in the Ukraine, to keep NATO out of it.

You need money for a war of this scale and you need resources to maintain yours. Good luck with that with these sanctions. Good luck on population control. NATO had a shit time fighting farmers with AKs in middle east. Good luck fighting a highly motivated, highly armed and supplied infantry.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

I don't know where you're getting your information, but this is what Martial Law specifically means in Russia.

If foreign troops attack Russian soldiers, where ever they are... or say... a blockade of a Russian coast, Russia can declare Martial Law. 

And here's what Russia can do in their Martial Law Zone.  
special operation of critical infrastructure and hazardous facilities;  
Evacuation of important objects and people;  
Strengthening the protection of public order, critical infrastructure and other important facilities;  
Restriction of entry, exit and freedom of movement, search, restriction of choice of place of residence;  
Curfew;  
Military censorship in the field of communications;  
Increased secrecy in state and local authorities;  
Restriction of the sale of weapons, dangerous substances, drugs, drugs and alcohol, their temporary withdrawal from citizens;  
Ban on rallies and strikes;  
Prohibition of public, international or foreign organizations that undermine the country's security;  
Forced labor for defense needs, to restore destroyed facilities and fight fires and epidemics;  
Seizure of private property with subsequent compensation;  
Internment of unreliable citizens and citizens of aggressor countries (applies only directly in case of aggression and in order to prevent riots).

Lavrov essentially goes on to say, ""Well WW3 would be nuclear, but that is not on the minds of anyone in Russia"".

And 35 years later, they are using the same equipment.

But what's worse, they are using the same tactics. And since then, there have been major advancements in repelling their old tactics. Specifically, drones and single-man anti-air and anti-tank weapons. Drones give you two major advantages: First, you can drop bombs without having air superiority. Second, you can use drones as artillery spotting. And I don't think the Russians adapted their doctrine to drone spotted artillery.
