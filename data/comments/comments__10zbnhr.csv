The gist is that after initial assault an breaking up early Ukrainian defences by 155th, there should be an immediate follow up with other units to reinforce the flanks and secure the gains. Apparently commanders of those units (which were consisting of battalions of mechanized infantry with about 70% of mobilized men) reported full readiness of those units, when in reality they were still in preparation phase. They supposedly did that to avoid anger of their superiors. So when the assault started, 155th went forward, but units of 41th army didn't follow. They followed only a day after, when 155th was trying to survive and was doing some back and forth maneuvers losing about about 100 people. The following days mobik units noticed that the field wasn't fully demined (Ukrainians correctly focused fire on engineering vehicles) and that only a narow path was safe. So they made a column. That of course was what Ukrainians wanted. They started to shoot the front and back vehicles. When the column was blocked, some vehicles tried to move forward, avoiding fresh wrecks. Some succeeded, others exploded on mines. That caused the lower level commanders to order retreat. Veterans tried to save equipment, mobiks just opened hatches and ran. That made the retreat of 155th difficult as there was no safe passage at that place. They lost two tanks trying to find safe passage, but they were able to finally get away. 

Total loses of this assault are staggering. Russians are estimating that at least a few dozens of armored vehicles can be repaired, however mobiks left the hatches open and Ukrainians dropped a grenade or two to each of them. Approximation is over a hundred vehicles were lost in this operation. Loses on Ukrainian side (Russian assessment) are assessed to be in area of 200 KIA. Which - considering it was combined arms operation - wasn't worth such armor and aviation (not mentioning 14th Spetsnaz that lost more soldiers than in Afghanistan).

Russians are now at the stage of looking for scapegoats responsible for this failure, so we can start to assume the operation failed and Vuhledar will get some breathing space.",False,1676119118.0,t3_10zbnhr,t3_10zbnhr,,0,125,0,125,0,0,

Kharkiv was a catastrophic rout for Russia, but it holds no significant value for Russia or the soldiers themselves.

However, since then, we have received footage from one volunteer who was on scene in his vehicle across the road that caught the first 3 seconds.
This footage, broken down into stills clearly shows that they were targeted with an Anti-tank Guided Missile.   
To put this all into context, This was not a case of mistaken identity. Pete and all his team were in civilian clothing and civilian vehicles.
This was not an accident, this was a targeted strike by a Russian Anti-tank crew.

- Cosmopolitans

- Nihilists

- Loyalists

- Globalist Patriots

- ‘Ura (Hoorah)-Patriots’

The Ura-Patriots are what the rest of the world would consider dangerous extremist nationalists. The Russian government also fear this segment of the population because they believe foreign powers can use them to divide the ""multi-ethnic Russian nation"". The ""Globalist Patriots"" are also extreme nationalists but are less likely to support or commit violence against the Russian state and minorities.

The other segments are self-explanatory. The Nihilist segment thinks Russia is a shithole but are otherwise apolitical. The loyalists are the Russian boomers who believe everything Russian TV says. The Cosmopolitan segment is the only one that is sympathetic towards Ukrainians.

Nowadays the Russian government often do polls to measure how these segments feel about the war. The polling is outsourced to external institutes. The official published poll results are Kremlin-approved and should not be trusted but it reveals a lot about how the Russian government segments the Russian population:

If Russia’s gets artillery is neutralised, do they have have a meaningful way to take take territory in Ukraine anymore?

Russia’s biggest win after May 2022 was Sievierodonetsk and this was achieved by masses of grinding artillery.

This is notably reduced these days. Bakmut is taking artillery but is not enough to dislodge the Ukrainians there.

The most notable number yesterday after the 1140 infantry losses was the 19 arty pieces destroyed. I’m n fact, there are some reports that due to their superior range and accuracy, Ukraine is winning the artillery duels now.

Russia has stated it is going to commit 300k soldiers to this new attack. At current trajectories these troops will be neutralised by the end of May.

The meat waves aren’t working. It took 30k casualties to take Soledar. I also strongly doubt mobliks will willingly go along with these tactics at any significant scale like Wagnar’s prisoners did.

Russia’s tanks and IFVs have been neutralised by Ukraine’s minefields, ATMs and artillery. I don’t see that changing.

Russia’s airforce has been largely absent for over 6 months now. They don’t seem to have the means or the doctrine to make up for any shortfall in artillery.

Without overwhelming artillery, I really don’t see how Russia can make meaningful advances in Ukraine anymore.

23-year-old Kivill Aleksandrov was from tiny non-ethnic-Russian Chuvashia. He grew up in a small village, population 601 (now 600) and according to his parents ""wanted to be a soldier all his life"" because ""he loved to serve"". He made the faithful decision to sign a three-year army contract in 2020 and became a private with the 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade.

Private Aleksandrov and a bunch of his buddies met their end on March 9, 2022 during yet another failed attack on the Hostomel airport near Kyiv. 

His body was eventually repatriated and buried at his home village. They also had a ceremony, TV cameras and everything, [dedicating a study desk](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1527013943285276673/photo/3) to him at his former school. 

His loving family is in the news again this week. 

> In Chuvashia, the mother and widow of the deceased in the Special Military Operation received 6 million each. Now they're fighting over their share in court.

> Irina says that her son got married in the summer of 2021. In January 2022, Kirill fulfilled his old dream, got his driver's license and bought a used Chevrolet Cruze for 700 thousand rubles. The car was bought with money gifted to the newlyweds, and half was taken on credit.

> The wife did not claim the car and said that she would leave it to his mother. After the funeral, both women received 6.7 million rubles in compensation from the state.

> Over time, the relationship between the two women began to deteriorate. Irina felt the former daughter-in-law did not fully share her grief. Later, Kirill's widow filed a lawsuit with the Kanash District Court to take the car from his mother, paying her one-fourth as the legal heir to Kirill's property.

In order to set that up you need a lot of guns within about 20 km of the grid square you are about to obliterate.  And at each of these guns you need hundreds of rounds of ammunition.  Then you take gun crews and feed the ammunition to them over and over again.  

This is very difficult to set up if the big pile of immunition you are planning to feed into the gun tomorrow can be destroyed with one shell from 70 km away.      

The way you protect yourself from that is by starting 80 km away and lugging all the ammunition with you.   

Now... let's look at the territory that has to happen in.  Fields, mud, hedgerows, and very few decent roads.   By the time you get from 80 km away to 20 km away, you have to have passed through a maze of pre-sited intersections.  You might get the first volley off, and a well dug in defense only needs to duck and cover through the first bit, and then rain precise counter-battery fire on whoever you are, while you are moving ammunition from trucks to emplacements.   Sucks to be you at that point. 

Basically, Ukraine has almost completely neutralized soviet doctrine of artillery saturation.  They can't bring in air power, if only because of friendly fire, which leaves them with armor and infantry.

Then there's the problem of propaganda. At it's most basic level there are two demographics. The older demographic tend to get their news from the Kremlin controlled TV. They tend to support Putin. The younger demographic tend to get their news online and tend to dislike Putin. Plus, the major cities tend to dislike Putin more than people in the most rural areas.  

Another major problem is that the Russian people fear what would happen should Putin die. They know that things can always get worse. They fear Russia collapsing as the Soviet Union did. Back then their money was worthless and they and their families starved.  

If that weren't enough, should the Russian people speak out all that will happen is the brutal police will attack them. Even before the war the ""justice"" system was designed to leave them with crippling debt and a criminal record to make it very hard to pay back.

c5e3671995eea155d3caccfd05147354,10zbnhr,j85ke6p,"Let's pretend for a moment we are in an alternative universe. 

Imagine that in this universe, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is (was) a coldly calculated mission of denial.  Waged purely for economic benefit by a criminal empire in order to avoid disintermediation of its only significant market:  Europe, and it's thirst for energy, food, and resources.  Because if this criminal empire is denied Europe, then it would have to bow and develop a market with its culturally sworn enemy:  China.

In this parallel universe, disintermediation would be threatened by an independent Ukraine, situated smack between Russia and its primary markets in Europe, fully aligned with and embraced by EU.  While lacking the resources to shut Russia out of the market, an independent wholly functioning Ukraine would have had sufficient resources to thwart any extortionist attempt to withhold critical energy, food or resources.  Sitting between Russia and its market, Ukraine represents a tollgate, and a throttle, and a pressure relief valve on extortion all at once.  

In that parallel universe, even stalemate at the current borders achieves something of a denial objective.  Without Donbas, and the gas in Crimea, and with the threat of rockets and arial lawnmowers inbound from time to time... nobody is going to be able to fully exploit Ukraine's resources.  A Korean-style truce coupled by renewed economic ties (and face it, cheap gas is cheap gas, and money is what makes diplomacy matter) would ultimately achieve at least that objective. 

In order to force a loss on Russia in that context, the west would have to sever economic ties with Russia even if the conflict stalemates.  And Putin could bet that this won't happen.  In such a situation, the criminal enterprise he runs could eventually pillage enough of what he is able to maintain to make the carnage ""worthwhile"".  Particularly if he counts the lives of Russians to be worth approximately one sack of carrots and another of potatoes. 

As far as the loss of military capability... those tanks and shells are rusting anyway.   The probability of Russia winning or even initiating a protracted land-war vs NATO in that parallel universe by now is precisely zero. So what do they need tanks for?  The probability of the west invading Russia with whatever is left of its ""ferocious"" nuclear arsenal is also zero. So these things are not really needed.  Like plaques that mark historical spots, they serve merely a historical purpose.  Even if they lose half of what's left in combat, that is not really much loss after all.  It saves space in the boneyards.

Finally, as crappy and depleted as Russia's military is in our parallel timeline, even half the remnants are still powerful enough to crush the remaining small satellites in its orbit.   As long as its massive police force is intact, it can continue to repress the empire it currently holds. It can't get any bigger.  But it can also avoid coming apart.  As long as it achieves some sort of stalemate.  And the criminals in charge can continue to exploit markets for their resources.  Because in the end, markets win out over politics. 

Consequently, until in that parallel universe there are costs to Russia that exceed the resource capacity of Crimea and Donbas (measured in a few hundred thousand sacks of potatoes and carrots) there is no reason for Putin to stop.   Potatoes and carrots rot anyway, and Russia has those in abundance. 

Now imagine Putin and the majority of Russia believes they live in that alternative universe.

Yeah, and thats the point you completely misunderstood! When Putin is speaking about brother-peoples and Ukraine threating Russia ... He has some kind of a point:

Ukraine kicked out three corrupt governments in the last two decades. While the Ukrainian state still sucks in a european comparison, they had bigger progress in fighting corruption than most other countries in the world (even with still a long way to go). Ukraine is developing a civil society that is starting to fight back against the corrupt systems and looking west.

Ukrainians and Russians lived in the same state for more than three generations. Most Ukrainians speak russian (at least as secondary language). Many of them studies in todays Russia, have (or had) friends and family members in Russia. And those connections between Russians and Ukrainians are a big problem for ""Russia"" (Putin that is). No matter how many newspapers he shuts down, how many TV stations he controlls, or internet sites he blocks, he will never get control of these personal connections. And if Ukraine becomes successfull, gets rid of its corrupt elites, turns west and has a similar economic developments as for example Poland after joining EU .... word will get into Russia that there is another way, even in a ""russian"" culture. And that is a deadly threat to Putins regime.

The war thus achieves two things: It severs the connection between Russian and Ukrainian people and it ensures that Ukraine will take a long time to get back to its feet (Neither will Russia, but that is a problem for after Putin is dead).",False,1676161980.0,t3_10zbnhr,t1_j8561r3,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

But let's say you believe the source did tell Hersh the US blew up the Nordstream pipeline. For me to even remotely believe the US did it you'd have to come up with a compelling theory as to *why* the US would do such a thing at that time and that's where the logic totally falls apart.

At the time the US wanted NATO and it's other close allies to help aid the Ukrainian government financially and with military equipment, not to succumb to Russian energy blackmail and for Ukraine to show it could win the war. And when Nordstream was bombed the US had it's allies onside, the energy blackmail wasn't working and Ukraine had started to demonstrate that it could win back large areas of its territory.

So when the US is achieving all its aims why would it risk disrupting that? When someone is already winning they rarely do anything to upset the situation because they're already winning, blowing up Nordstream doesn't allow them to win any harder. In fact it only risks destabilizing the situation which has them winning. From a game theory perspective it makes little sense and goes against basic human behavior.

The US didn't bomb Nordsteam because it would bring it no extra positives, in fact the act would only risk upsetting its allies and fracturing unity on Ukraine, that's the complete opposite of what the US would want.

Russia has vast numbers of tubes and shells...

But the guns are all of varying ages and calibres. The current standard that their modern guns and almost all older SPGs use is 152mm. They have a large stockpile of these shells and can produce a large number from several factories. Similar to their tanks, there should, in theory, be thousands of 152mm barrels for the main 5 tubes/SPGs that use it. But many of these will be over 50 years old and have been left to rust, were sold off from corruption, or literally lost somewhere. This has meant that their logistics has been rather lurching - artillery gets delivered, used to death for a couple of weeks, then nothing much happens whilst the teams wait for replacement parts that hopefully aren't rusted to death to get delivered from some field in Siberia. Their logistics for shells is not great either, each shell is delivered in individual wooden boxes which must be transferred between vehicles by hand.

Then there is everything else. There is the big calibre 203mm, but we just haven't really seen them so presumably there is some problem with supplying these. Then there are a dozen smaller calibres in use being fired from guns dating back to 1940. Most of that crap they initially gave to the DNR/LNR conscripts. Supplies for these started to become a problem 3 months into the invasion because no one makes them. The shells being supplied by NK were these eclectic ancient calibres. They also frequently fail - Donetsk city has been shelled from the East at least 6 times now due to shells being aimed over the city falling well short. This has left the parts of the front allegedly manned by these forces with essentially no artillery support.",False,1676154041.0,t3_10zbnhr,t1_j85yg3l,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

He's seen what people did to dictators like Saddam and Gaddafi. Then the Euromaidan protests happened. The idea of democracy (or America/CIA in his ultra paranoid KGB mind) coming so close to the Kremlin and to Putin himself was the final straw.  

That's one of the major reasons why he's gone to war. That and the fact that he genuinely doesn't believe Ukraine exists as a real country. Putin thinks of it as merely land, part of the Soviet Union and therefore already belongs to him. To him the Cold War never ended. In his mind he's fighting America, not Ukraine.  

Julia also mentioned that when American politicians publicly spoke of their support for the Euromaidan protestors that just strengthened the deep rooted paranoia in Putin's KGB mind that America and the CIA were behind *everything* bad that happens to him and Russia. It was an alarm to him that America is going to topple him next under the guise of democracy.  

This whole war is basically Putin trying to push democracy as far away from him and the Kremlin as possible. If democracy works in Ukraine and the Russian public look and notice that it's working, they may want it too.  

That's an existential threat to Putin. He doesn't want to be tried and hung like a criminal or bayoneted by an angry mob. To Putin it doesn't matter how many Russians or Ukrainians die in the war. All that matters is that the Russian dictator, Putin, gets to live yet another day.  

As for presidents, Julia said that Putin wanted anyone, absolutely anyone, but Clinton in the Whitehouse. She was one of the politicians who spoke in favour of the Euromaidan protestors and was therefore a threat to Putin's reign.

First, even if Putin had geopolitical cover to pretend it wasn't an outright invasion, nobody in 2015-16 thought Trump would win.  Putin was focussed on Brexit.  And despite how easy it is to click a few mouse buttons and assemble an army in video-games, these things take a lot of time to prepare.  It takes a long time get thousands of vehicles, men and tons of ammunition, supplies and equipment staged to jumping-off positions close to a major front - more than a year it is being done ""stealthily"".

Also remember that the initial plan was predicated on a government decapitation, and the placement of Kremlin-friendly assets to control key territories.   Again, setting this up takes time.  2017 was still very early in Poroshenko's presidency, Ukraine was still very politically excited over Euromaidan, fighting tenaciously in Donbas... Invasion would have been viewed very critically by a European military  on high alert due to Brexit.   And there was no political cover.  Poroshenko wasn't defeated until 2019, after which time it appears that Russia's preparations began in earnest.  There are likely significant political machinations that were upset by Zelensky's win.  Which nobody was really prepared for either.

Finally, overt military action in 2017 would have certainly jeopardized the interests of those putting huge capital investments behind NortStream 2 - which was just crossing the finish line (from the capital negotiation perspective) and there were too many of Putin's powerful allies who could have been financially cut off at the knees.

&nbsp;

If you want to start handing out truth bombs to people, here's a little tip; it starts by knowing what the truth IS first.

&nbsp;

NATO countries agreed at the yearly summit in 2006 on a *guideline* of spending 2% of their GDP on defence. In 2014, after Russia invaded Crimea, at *that* years summit, they all agreed to **reach 2% spending by 2024**. Fyi; there are other provisions in that agreement that never gets talked about, like a 20% rule that states that amount of their spending must be used on heavy assets. You should read up on it, its really interesting. Now, it can be argued that some countries were not speeding up spending by the time of Trumps Presidency, but his Precidency was 2016-2020. It ended 4 years *before* the deadline set to increase spending. Germany as such, and ""some"" others were as such not holding back spending as per existing agreements. Trump btw, never even understood the concept. The deal is for those countries to spend 2% *on their own armed forces*. Trump misunderstood and thought they were supposed to pay the sum to NATO.

What I think has happened, (aside from the HIMARS destroying a lot of good guns), is that the Russian guns are now warped, inaccurate, and useless. Unless the Russians have a capability to repair and replace all those gun barrels, they simply are too inaccurate to do a good job anymore.

----------

What I'm saying is: is this really an M777 vs Msta-B fight? I don't think so. This is strangely a fight for **gun barrels**. Artillery is being used so much, that we're even seeing Ukrainian footage of these gun barrels exploding from over-use. (I'm sure the Russians are worse on that front)

What's the count of gun **barrels** on the front? Its very possible Ukraine has more barrels than Russia. Its one of those counts that I don't think anyone has been tracking too accurately too. Its not like we know how many replacement gun barrels explode in each HIMARS attack.",1676145721.0,1676145401.0,t3_10zbnhr,t1_j85ex1e,,3,12,0,12,0,0,

It's about a leader of a revolution who turns into a dictator, just like the person he toppled. He finds a mirror which shows him the image of his would-be future assassins. He becomes very paranoid. Every person he sees in the mirror he has executed, even old friends.  

Finally he sees his own reflection, throws the gun at the mirror and as the gun falls and hits the floor it goes off and kills him.

Hell, I live inside the 2nd biggest city in Russia and it's impossible for me to make confident judgements about how many people support it or not. Different experts / political analysts on Russia have various rules of thumb but I would probably go with 20/60/20 of fascist/apathetic/liberal as something closer to the truth. My suspicion is something between that, and 10/80/10. Where you are and what kind of people you talk to makes a big difference. In Petersburg it could easily be more like 5/75/20, while in some poorer Siberian regions you could get 30/69/1. 

There's a couple of other problems that make it hard to gauge. Right now, organized unrest or protest is impossible, as there are no leaders (all dead, in jail, or hiding abroad), no way to communicate or organise without FSB at your door within hours, and probably the main problem is that there is no alternative or opposition to fight for, so any public action is basically just risking your life without any objective or hope of change, and people naturally want something a bit more concrete than that if you talking about throwing your lives and family away. People can still spontaneously act of course, without planning or organization, but it takes a very brave soul to go and do that alone, knowing no one will help you or follow you, because the vast majority of the country are in a bubble of ignorant bliss. For a spontaneous uprising to have any chance of success, you'd need enough to overwhelm the 1.5 million members of the police state (police, Rosgvardiya, OMON, etc). Hoping a million people are just going to independently rise up in Moscow is a happy dream, to say the least.

And that's honestly the main problem here. It's not that the vast majority support the war or are against it. They just don't know, and they don't want to know, because deep down they know they will hate the reality if they confront it, and it will force them to take a side (and deep down I do believe most would side against Putin and the war if they were forced to). But that's it. No one's forcing them to, yet. Life in Russia carries on mostly unchanged, especially in cities. It would be quite easy in Petersburg or Moscow, if you didn't read the news, to have no idea what was happening in Ukraine. Bars are packed, supermarkets full, prices haven't changed much - some foreign companies left but actually most western products are still here.

And this is by design - all of it. The Kremlin wants it this way. Propaganda doesn't care about convincing people. They simultaneously have a dozen different conflicting narratives. They're not incompetent or hypocritical - when you are surrounded by nonsensical information and truth every day from every angle - the ""firehose of falsehoods"" some call it - at some point most people just can't handle it. It's not uncommon for me to hear people here talk about truth like it simply doesn't exist at all - like it's impossible for anyone to catch it, and they don't trust anyone who claims to have it. And the second thing the Kremlin does is make sure these apathetic people in the cities are fed and the trains run on time. The cities are the only places that matter, politically.

I could go on for ages but I guess this covers my main points - that lack of action doesn't necessarily mean support for the war. Cowardice, maybe.

I would like to be clear that I'm not justifying our lack of action or suggesting that we all deserve sympathy or understanding here. We will all of us get what's coming, whether we support Putin or not. 

Personally, as a teacher, my goal is to keep the faith and hope alive in my teens (who are overwhelmingly anti-Putin and depressed and angry that their futures have been ruined), and hold out hope myself for a day when this apathetic majority won't be apathetic any more.

It might be possible that Ukraine in this case benefits from the huge variety of weapon systems, because each one has the potential to overlap an others weakness.

For certain, Ukraine's military planners have no shortage of diverse tools to apply to any plan, and as such can tailor the forces tasked to solve each particular problem.
