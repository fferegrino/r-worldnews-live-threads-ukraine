Normally, you'd want to lay the ground work internationally for something like this - establish a quasi-compelling narrative.

You all have it right when you say they could not look any more villainous than they do. It makes me think that this is a war that Putin wanted - instigated - and more or less told his various mouthpieces and generals that there would be no discussion or debate, no need to determine objectives or narrative.

You may see a Russian ambassador to the UN who is evil, and he may well be, but I see this as a man who knows what he must argue but who is completely underwater -out of his depth - and maybe even personally bewildered by the decisions of his government. In the United States, we saw this frequently among the spokespersons for the President when he would make a decision on a whim and leave those who need the world to make sense to find sense in the shattered jigsaw puzzle of id and emotion that he left in his wake.",1645833389.0,1645833233.0,t3_t1hkmj,t3_t1hkmj,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

&#x200B;

A roar of explosions rolls across Kyiv tonight.

Air raid sirens blare warnings to residents to take to their shelters.

It is set to be another long, anxious night underground as the sounds of war grow ever louder and closer in a capital now in Russia’s sights.

Missiles slam into the edges of this beleaguered capital. The rattle of gunfire pierces the sky. Explosions are still distant from the centre; they're now about 10 miles away.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former boxing champion now armed and in uniform, said Kyiv had entered a difficult night, a defensive phase.

He reported five blasts within three and five minutes near a power station in the north of the city.

Just before nightfall, we drove through eerily deserted streets. War has pulled life from what was once prized as a vibrant European capital. Soldiers check cars, take up positions outside key buildings, and along strategic junctions.

In one northern neighbourhood, we saw two new rhythms of life filling the same street.

A gaggle of residents nervously rushed past, suitcase wheels screeching as they made haste to reach somewhere safer.

Heading in the other direction, a crowd of men floods a yard where volunteers gathered to sign up for a territorial defence force.

“You really believe in the might of the Russian army?” a bespectacled young man asks me with a patriotic swagger.

“We had a lot of clashes today, in Obalan area,” he said, referring to an area just north of the city.

“Our planning is now in hours, not days,” he pointed out, as he hurried away to pick up his gun.",False,1645831599.0,t3_t1hkmj,t3_t1hkmj,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

People's Daily;

BEIJING, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday held a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Lavrov briefed Wang on the evolution of the situation in Ukraine and Russia's position, saying that the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have broken their commitments, continuously expanded eastward, refused to implement the new Minsk agreement and violated the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2202.

Russia was forced to take necessary measures to safeguard its own rights and interests, Lavrov added.

Noting that China has always respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, Wang said that China recognizes the complex and special historical context of the Ukraine issue and understands Russia's legitimate security concerns.

China maintains that the Cold War mentality should be completely abandoned and a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism should be finally established through dialogue and negotiation, Wang said.",False,1645831994.0,t3_t1hkmj,t3_t1hkmj,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

The world said Russian army was overwhelmingly powerful, yet they sent you not an army of soldiers, but they sent you untrained men.

The world said they were tactically superior, but they have shown blunder after blunder.

Putin said you were doing evil deeds and must be stopped, yet they target a single child for a strike, missile strikes to homes, hospitals, schools, and shelled non-military targets.

They say you are weak, but you are strong! Your leader fights besides you as one of you, not cowering in some far away place barking orders. Your leader is strong, you are strong. Their leader is weak and afraid.

If the enemy has to break so many international war laws to fight you, that is not a sign os strength, that is a sign of desperation of a weak force.

If the enemy has to threaten nuclear Armageddon for even giving you a bottle of water, that is not strength, that is weakness.

If the enemy has to desperately try to get your soldiers to run and hide by playing mind games, that is not strength, that is weakness.

They are afraid, they are hungry, tired, and weak.

You, who are able to tell a warship to go fuck itself, who strikes fear in a so called powerful leader, that is strength, you are strong.

They say russain army is going to make a large scale advance, but remember, you are strong, do not falter and punch them hard in the balls to kindly remind them that you said please when you asked for peace, and they said peace is no longer an option.

They haven't waged a serious war since Afghanistan--and that was the USSR (which had a much bigger population, military, and GDP).  In the last 30 years, they've had just a handful of military interventions, and all of those were a pretty small footprint, with very little logistical coordination needed, where they can lean on the small minority of their forces that are very skilled/experienced soldiers, and can utilize the small fraction of their military equipment that is modern and well-maintained.

It's not easy to invade a large country.  It's not easy for the U.S. to invade a country the size of Afghanistan or Iraq.  The U.S. makes it LOOK somewhat easy on television.  But the U.S. defense budget is half the size of the entire Russian economy.  And it's what the spending pays for -- which is extreme, extreme depth in planning, training, and logistics.

However, just because the US has a disreputable record doesn't mean every other country can do whatever they want. The US was wrong back then, just like Russia is wrong now. Whataboutism is not a valid argument.

Even if Iraq had WMDs, that still wasn't a good enough reason to invade. Just look at the repercussions of the invasion of Iraq 2 decades later, it is a fucking mess in the Middle East. After the Arab Spring, I think the western public has wised up to the reality that sometimes stability is better than democracy in regions not quite ready for the latter. Instability is Russia's goal in Ukraine. It began with the Donetsk region, and it has since expanded from there. The more unstable Russia can make Ukraine, the more likely they can keep western influences from gaining a stronger foothold in Ukraine.

Consider if Ukraine had hypothetically been co-opted by Nazis in the aftermath of the overthrow of the government back in 2014, there remains no evidence that those hypothetical Nazis have done anything bad to any Russian speaking ethnic groups in Ukraine. On the contrary, there is evidence of legitimate elections being held in Ukraine. Nevermind that the reality is that the Ukrainian president is literally Jewish. In summary, there is no humanitarian crisis that could justify an invasion of Ukraine.

This invasion, just like the Iraq invasion, is taking place for any number of boring reasons relating to natural resources and political power. Instability is the aim of the game in order to expand Russian's political power in Ukraine and perhaps siphon some resources and labour from Ukraine in the process. I suppose you could say that chaos is the ladder of Putin's choosing.",1645834642.0,1645834534.0,t3_t1hkmj,t3_t1hkmj,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

It was at that time Russia (the then USSR) came to help india making sure US doesn't interfere.

Adding to that, Ukraine never ever helped India. They were always opposed to india in every UN platform. From providing arms to Pakistan to voting against India performing nuclear test, Ukraine was never the good ally for India.

Whether you want to admit it or not this is a scary prospect for Ukraine, there are about 12k Chechens ready to go. People might not think a warrior class means much anymore, but these people are soldiers by trade. 12k Chechens is worth many more of some of the slobs you've seen being taken in the early hours, which leads me to believe Russis has dedicated their worst forces towards invasion so far in the hopes even that was enough to make significant headway. That plus the fact those 12k chechens are only around 10% of the of the total russian forces that still havent been sent into Ukraine yet

Senior Fellow, American Statecraft Program at Carnegie Endowment, Visiting fellow at Yale Center For Global Legal Challenges:

Premature and irresponsible to call for arming a Ukrainian insurgency that does not yet even exist. Who would we be arming? To what end? With what consequences? Have we learned nothing from recent missions that made wars only longer and deadlier?

In Syria, the United States trained and equipped rebel forces, only to lengthen the war without dislodging dictator and President Bashar al-Assad from power.

Some call for turning Ukraine into ""Russia's Afghanistan,"" but what would this mean? In the 1980s, the United States aided the forces from which al-Qaeda would emerge. For the past two decades, it created a client state dependent on U.S. support and continual violence.

We have covered the list of countries that will support Russia in our article today. Check out!

Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Belarus which were earlier part of the Soviet Union will take the side of Russia in this ongoing conflict.

Cuba, a close ally of Russia also extended its support to Putin.

While India has maintained a neutral stance being a non-aligned state as it has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine.

China has aimed to strike a fine balance between Russia and western countries and act diplomatically. Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, asked all parties involved to “exercise restraint.” China cannot endorse the invasion of Ukraine by Russia as it would deteriorate its relationship with Western nations and on the other side, Chinese president Xi Jinping is looking forward to strengthening its relationship with Russia.

From all I know maintenance of nuclea warheads has to occur regularly, 10 year-ish and is hugely expensive. According to [Schwartz (1998)](https://www.brookings.edu/the-hidden-costs-of-our-nuclear-arsenal-overview-of-project-findings/) 4.5 Billion was spent annualy just on maintenance in the US back in the day. Keep in mind the US has less warheads than Russia. However, it would be interesting to see more recent data on this.

But then again... Russia has a considerable uranium sector itself and its neighbour Kazakhstan (the one they had ""peacekeeping troops"" in just a bit ago) is the biggest supplier of uranium worldwide - so the costs might be considerably lower. There is a major dependency on cheap uranium out of these states that isn't nearly as much talked about as when it comes to fossil fuel dependency.

In short, maybe the budget is so humongous to, in part, maintain the immense nuclear arsenal. Maybe it's because of corruption and in truth only a fraction of the nukes are in good shape.

It seems likely given how long US intelligence has been revealing Putin's plans that the Ukrainians knew at least the broad strokes of the invasion plan in advance. They would have been able to relocate critical hardware to hiding places, establish remote posts, etc.

And, it seems like their air forces were on high alert and likely flying sorties almost constantly in the 24 or 48 hours before the primary invasion, so they weren't destroyed on the ground by Russian cruise missile strikes.

Add to that the significant amount of MANPADS that the West and other allies have been supplying for a while now (again going back to US intelligence), which is quite a bit harder to take out than a static SAM sight - a Stinger can be manned by one or two soldiers and are easily cached at strategic locations and, at least from the evidence we've seen so far, they've been at least partially effective at downing Russian helicopters and planes.

Thing is, the league only had as much power as the members themselves, so if the members were not willing to use military force or sanctions to back up the resolutions passed, a country could effectively ignore them. 

The league effectively disintegrate just prior to WW2 when multiple world powers began leaving due to the league passing resolutions they did not like. Japan left when the League passed a resolution for Japan to end it's war in china for example.

The league was reorganized into the United nation after WW2. A body that arguably better reflects the reality of geopolitics.

>Post war trials, notably the Nuremberg Process, have since confirmed that it is lawfull for a soldier to disguise himself in the uniform of his enemy and in that disguise to approach objectives which he intends to attack. What he may not do is to carry out an armed assault while still wearing disguise. Before he opens fire he must first discard the enemy clothing and must be seen to be wearing the uniform of his own Army. A similar situation has allways been accepted in naval warfare.

That was a huge mistake Russia made early on; compare the Russian attack on Ukraine's air force [to what the US did during Desert Storm.](https://youtu.be/zxRgfBXn6Mg) Basically everything the US did right in Desert Storm, the Russians did wrong in Ukraine - and that's what's costing them.

Russians don't want to destroy airstrips since that's how they plan to land troops - they were going for hangars and supply depots. But their limited attack (and Ukraine's superior Intel, very likely with Western assistance) has caused the Russians massive headaches as Russia cannot achieve true air superiority.

The Ukrainians don't have the capability to keep air superiority, so they have to strike strategically. Their small air force is being used as a guerilla force against Russian landing operations, striking out at limited targets. The Ukrainians have downed several Russia fighter jets as well as a troop transport aircraft.

The Ukrainians do not have much in the way of a bomber force, although they do have some missiles they've used. A Ukrainian missile destroyed a Russian airbase yesterday.",1645835643.0,1645835168.0,t3_t1hkmj,t1_hygakwu,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

This of course is no consolation or comfort for those people of Ukraine who need more than just words. Any immediate military response would have to be done through NATO or bilaterally from a major power.

Occasionally certain flash-points will bubble up where people discredit or over-state the science in order to try and win the moral point, but for the most part, all modern western democracies are ""science-based.""

India are slowly being wedged between choosing sides, but for now money and guns matter more:

""Indian sympathies for Russia — and Russia’s support for India — reach back to the early decades of the Cold War, when Washington often sided with India’s archrival, Pakistan, over issues including the contested Kashmir region. In 1971, when India fought Pakistan over Bangladesh, the United States backed Pakistan in part because it was a crucial party to a plan by President Richard Nixon to secretly establish relations with China. In the ensuing years, Indian military imports from the Soviet Union soared, while at the diplomatic level, it maintained a stated policy of nonalignment.

Today, Russia has leased a nuclear submarine to India. Russian scientists are helping develop India’s hypersonic missile program. Russian T-90 tanks form the backbone of India’s ground forces, and Russian MiG and Sukhoi fighter jets are mainstays in its air force. The Indian navy’s flagship is an aircraft carrier — a “Kiev-class” — purchased from Russia.""
