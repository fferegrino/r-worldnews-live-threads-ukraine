Day 307-308 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday it was a mostly quiet day, there was just one country-wide air raid alert that turned out to be uneventful in the end. They were trying to scare us by flying their bombers along our borders as usual, but they used their MiG-31K again, which is basically a sure sign that they are just trying to intimidate us, as they pretty much never use their Kinzhal missiles, they are mostly for show.

Today was a different story, as the day started with a missile strike here in Kharkiv, which was pretty unexpected. At 9:02pm an air raid alert starts and about 5 seconds later we hear an explosion. We are pretty far from the place that was hit, so the sound of explosion had to travel for about 30-40 seconds to reach us, which means the explosion actually happened before the alert and it was triggered late.

There were 2 explosions total, both sounded pretty loud for us despite happening about 13-16km away from us. We don’t know what was hit yet, it doesn’t seem like they hit our energy infrastructure this time, as no blackouts were reported anywhere. Our metro was stopped momentarily, but it started working again just 5 minutes later, so it was probably turned off intentionally. We do know that at least one civilian was injured, but nothing else is known right now, hopefully there aren’t more casualties.

Yelchenko doesn’t know all the details, says the gist:

> “Perhaps they took a piece of paper and drew what would happen to the Russian Federation if they used tactical nuclear weapons. Firstly, there will be a physical destruction of Putin, the United States has the tools and capabilities for this. Secondly, instantaneous, within 20-30 minutes, the destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation. All military groups located near the borders of Ukraine. And the next step will be strikes on all military bases and strategic facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, including Moscow and the Kremlin,"" the diplomat explained. 

According to Yelchenko, only conventional weapons will be used by USA:

> ""This is not about nuclear weapons, but about conventional ones. Because, unlike the Russian Kinzhal cruise missiles that fall on us, American Tomahawk cruise missiles and other weapons are more accurate. They hit the target with an accuracy of 15-20 cm. All this was presented to the Russian side. After that, all talk about nuclear weapons by the leadership of the Russian Federation stopped,"" he added.

*Note: While my first thought was, “how would someone outside of current diplomatic channels know this?”—actually, it’s very possible that such an interaction took place. For example:*

Vladimir Putin wants very much to make ‘Russophobia’ a thing. His propaganda leans heavily on the idea that people hate all Russians, so hating them back is righteous and justified.



In the opening weeks after the full invasion the caretakers of these threads busted up a Russian troll network that wasn’t posting anti-Ukrainian things, they were posting virulently anti-Russian things. They were posting calls for the extermination of all Russians. Those posts got a ton of up-votes. They were trying to generate content that would support their theory that their adversaries were driven primarily by Russophobia. And it worked!


I hate Vladimir Putin. He has revealed his character, and it is detestable. Many other Russians have revealed their detestable characters, too. I hate all of them. But if the only thing that I know about someone is that they are Russian? Then I have no opinion about them. Even if I can guess that they are probably awful based on the odds? Odds aren’t reality. Every person is entitled to speak and reveal their character for themselves.




“If you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”



I do understand it. I understand why someone might hate all Russians at this point. I would just encourage people to not fall in to the type of thinking that has penetrated so deeply in to the Russian consciousness.

On the opposite side of those two towns, to the east, is a whole lot of not much at all. Forested hills, small roads that are easily watched, etc. And beyond that is one of two Russian rail links heading north from Luhansk.

So basically, Ukraine taking those towns means they get an improved logistical situation, while Russia's gets worse. A net gain of +2 supply routes. Furthermore, right now Ukraine is at a disadvantage in the area because they're having to attack across countryside, while Russia is in those towns. Once that's flipped, Russia has no real hope of regaining those towns. The countryside they'd have to operate in is too difficult.

What is missing is the fact of current suffering.  It is somewhat of a Russian thing to suffer and struggle towards relief.  People who suffer escape by looking backwards to better days or forwards to the promise of tomorrow as a mechanism of self-protection.  It is intellectually appealing, even if untrue (and in the case of the future, unmeasurable).

What better way to direct a suffering people to a desired outcome than to promise them that tomorrow will look like the better days of the past, if only they do what you want them to do? 

That is furthered by promulgating two simultaneously desirable myths:  the first of better times in the past, and the second a sense of superiority.   

In such a situation, even in a head-to-head battle with a free press, propaganda will win simply because when faced with two ""truths"", people will choose to believe whichever they find more desirable.

I first applied this to Red States where Trump enjoyed Saddam Hussein-level approval ratings. Trump would constantly say and do all these stupid and evil things, and his followers would support them without a second thought, yet once I started criticizing these places, people (mostly liberals, ironically) would jump in and say ""You're being so unfair, there's plenty of good people in those places, it's not their fault they worship the shittiest person on earth.""

Likewise, I'm sure there are many, many wonderful people in Russia. There's wonderful people everywhere. There's nice Trump voters. I'm sure there were tons of extremely nice Nazis working at the fringe of the movement who only cared about bland pleasantries like ""I want my people to be happy and productive"" without getting deeply invested in the violent ethno-nationalism.

That's just basic probability: Given a sample size of millions, you'll always find plenty of good people.

But here's the problem: Just because you find some good people doesn't change the fact that many cultures--Russia, in this case--are just fucking awful when it comes to their most fundamental value system.

>  he desperately needed to reclaim Ukraine to defend one of them

The Bessarabian gap is *west* of Ukraine. They need Moldova too. It's not an accident that there's an irredentist Russian state on internationally recognized Moldovan territory (Transnistria). Russia tried to link up with Transnistria but Ukraine stopped them early in the war.

> let alone the sole reason. 

Obviously it's not the *sole* reason. Ukraine's agricultural and mineral resources are a big part of it too, as well as the geopolitics of the expansion of both NATO and the EU. And there's also the idea that Russian citizens can't be allowed to see their kin in Ukraine prospering in a Western-style capitalist democracy, they have to be kept under the neo-feudal/authoritarian thumb. But the Greater Russian types in power aren't ever going to feel secure until they control those gaps, regardless of all the other economic and diplomatic stuff going on.

Zeihan sometimes overstates things, I think.

As to Kh-55 you are partially right. However they displayed a flaw in their navigation system (they don't have satellite updates, just TERCOM + INS) that resulted in almost 40% failure rate of following the preprogrammed path when launched. To circumvent that they devised a procedure to launch them from known coordinates where the entry point is known to be recognized. On the other hand I am happy those are not nukes - imagine 40 percent of nuclear strike unable to follow the path. Due to inaccuracy those old missiles are used only as decoys. They were upgrading them to Kh-555 standard, but as over 70 percent are shot down, Russia just decided to use them as they are and use Kh-101s to make the actual strike. However they again have the procedure of launching them from the Caspian sea region that takes timing into account (they launch Kh-55s first, then they are launching Kh-101s about 20 minutes later, so when the AA defense is reloading, they can fly through - it sometimes works).",False,1672236088.0,t3_zwzq2p,t1_j1yih1p,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

Yes and like you said Ukraine need tanks to help end this war sooner. I would add offensive weapons in general to that. Too often weapons only go to Ukraine after Russia has shown limited success in some area. There are not enough proactive or offensive weapons being sent. It's impossible for Russia to improve much anytime soon, but we shouldn't risk giving Russia the time to pull off some kind of miracle. 

My point on driving a wedge between China and Russia would require the further weakening of Russias military. Military failure would threaten Putin's regime more than most other Russian failures.",False,1672260352.0,t3_zwzq2p,t1_j1zl27p,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
