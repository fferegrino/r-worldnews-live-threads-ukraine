Day 67 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today my area was relatively quiet, around 1 PM there was some shelling, like literally just 3-4 explosions, followed by return fire from our artillery within 2 minutes and then it got quiet again. There was also some shelling around 2 hours ago, but right now it’s quiet again. 

At the same time today it was advised to residents of eastern and northern parts of the city to not go outside at all. While shelling around my area actually became way less frequent with liberation of Ruska Lozova, in other districts like Saltivka shelling still continues like it did before. 

And also around 2 hours ago another residential building was shelled in an unspecified district, which again caused a really big fire. Apparently the explosion was really loud (but we didn’t hear it personally, as it was too far away from us), so it might have been another cruise missile.

I really don’t understand what Russians are even planning to do, they erected [yet another Lenin statue, this time in Nova Kakhovka](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1520391464773206019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and of course hung even more USSR flags, who the hell is their target audience? It’s like they are marking their territory with those Lenin statues, this is so bizarre.

What is even Russia at this point? They are using more and more USSR flags and less Russian flags, are they saying that Russia is no more and USSR has returned or something? It’s like they are stuck in the past, [in Melitopol they are again using more USSR flags and play old songs about WW2 on the speakers](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/ug66xp/russian_army_raised_huge_soviet_red_flag_with_its/). Nobody wants that here Russia, just go away.

Just 2 days ago one of our acquaintances from Crimea that lived there even before it was occupied, said that people arriving to Crimea from Mariupol are happy, what the fuck does that even mean? Are they happy that their city was razed to the ground and that they were deported by Russians? 

That same person said that they are now receiving strawberries and greens from Kherson, just like it was before 2014, yeah fucking stolen crops from our farmers. But of course she also said that business in Kherson is now booming (paraphrasing) and people there are also happy (as you can see Russia only brings happiness everywhere it goes). 

She said that this was relayed to her by people she personally knows from those places. She is either blatantly lying to our faces, or Russians truly live in an alternate reality where Russians are the good guys that are saving people from Nazis, I really don’t see any other options.

I have to think that a presidential visit is something under consideration, but only a question of how soon that will be feasible,"" Schiff told CNN's Jim Acosta. Schiff noted the delegation did not discuss the topic on the call with Biden Sunday. 

Schiff said the meeting with Zelensky focused on what his priorities are for further assistance, especially as Ukrainians enter a new phase of the war with more concentrated fighting in the eastern part of the country. Members of the delegation subsequently relayed the information to Biden on the call, Schiff said, and made recommendations to the President.

Asked what Zelensky thought about the $33 billion price tag Biden requested in his supplemental aid request for Ukraine to Congress, Schiff said: ""It's his job to say that nothing is enough and, you know, we understand that, we respect that. Nonetheless, I think he's very grateful for what we're doing.""

""We wanted to discuss with him, within that really vast sum, what is the priority in terms of what weapons that he needs, what other assistance that he needs,"" Schiff said. ""We went through a detailed discussion of the next phase of the war. It's moving from a phase in which Ukrainians were ambushing Russian tanks -- it was close-quarters fighting -- to fighting more at a distance using long range artillery, and that changes the nature of what Ukraine needs to defend itself.""

Schiff said they discussed a variety of issues, including ensuring he's getting the military equipment he needs and is getting it quickly. They discussed the humanitarian crisis, refugees, war crimes, and he said, ""I wanted to make sure as the intelligence chair that he's getting the intelligence that he needs.""

Schiff said members of the delegation wanted to communicate to Zelensky at the meeting a message of support because, ""If Russia can get away with this, this naked aggression, this invasion of their neighbor, you know, what's to make us think they'll stop with Ukraine.""

This, he said, happened the day after the publication of a post with his anti-war stance on Instagram. The Russian presidential administration threatened to nationalize the bank if Tinkoff did not sever ties with it and if Tinkoff did not change its name, the businessman said.

On April 28, 35 percent of TCS Group Holding, the parent structure of Russia's Tinkoff Group, was bought by Vladimir Potanin's Interros Group from Oleg Tinkov's family. Tinkov described it in an interview with the NYT as ""a desperate sale, a sale at a discount"" imposed on him by the Kremlin.

""I couldn't discuss the price. It's a hostage state - you take what's offered to you without negotiation,"" Tinkov said. I built this business for 15 years of my life, even when I thought I was about to die of leukemia I refused to sell it.

The entrepreneur did not name a specific price, but said he sold his stake for 3 percent of its ""real value."" ""They forced me to sell it because of my statements. I sold it for pennies,"" he said.

Tinkov also said that many Russian businessmen stand in solidarity with his position on Ukraine, which they told him privately, but ""everyone is so afraid”. 

Businesses abroad often have authorities, while in Russia, authorities have business.

After his famous Instagram post where Oleg Tinkov called the war a senseless and brutal massacre, many assumed that he had said enough for a criminal article.

The businessman also said that he hired bodyguards after acquaintances with connections in the Russian security services told him that he should fear for his life because ""the decision had already been made."" Although he survived leukemia, ""the Kremlin will probably kill him,"" he added.",1651496160.0,1651485071.0,t3_ug6fnw,t3_ug6fnw,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

From CNN’s Hannah Ritchie

Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, was hit by two explosions in the early hours of Monday morning, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a Telegram post. 

Thirty minutes ago, I woke up to two strong bursts. According to the operational headquarters, there is no damage or destruction. There are no casualties,” Gladkov said around 2.40 a.m. local time.

Monday's explosions come after a large fire broke out at a Russian Ministry of Defense military installation in Belgorod on Sunday. The cause of the incident was unclear.

Right now you're seeing Ukraine recover more ground then Russia is taking, all of which is in the Kharkiv region.  Ukraine is playing the smart move and taking ground in area's in which they more then likely out number Russia by a fair margin.  Right now the cost of counter attacking into Izyum is too high, the concentration of troops there is extremely high and all it would achieve is maybe spoiling an imminent attack.

It's important to point out the right now Russia is probably out numbered at this point in Ukraine, they're using large numbers of troops in a localized capacity to make costly advances, costs they cant continue to afford.  This will only make the numbers game worse.  Finally, by the end of summer the training and mobilization of Ukraines forces will more then likely give them as a high as a 3 to 1 advantage over Russia.  Wars take time to develop, and eb and flow in the beginning... this war by historical standards is extremely young, I dont think Russia has a chance even in the near future.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,ug6fnw,i70fukp,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said over the weekend that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had “Jewish blood,” prompting a furious response from Israel on Monday.

“Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,” Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said.
“Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of anti-Semitism.”

Lavrov made the comments on Italian television on Sunday, repeating Russia’s claim that its invasion of Ukraine is to “de-Nazify” the country.

He shrugged off the fact that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.

“He [Zelensky] puts forward an argument: what kind of Nazism can they have if he is a Jew. I may be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood. It means absolutely nothing. The wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews,"" Lavrov said.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian Ambassador to Israel on Monday over Lavrov’s remarks.

Dani Dayan, who chairs the Yad Vashem Holocaust remembrance site in Israel, said it was “completely unfounded” to say Hitler was of Jewish descent.

And he slammed Russia’s labelling of Ukrainians as Nazis.

“Equally serious is calling the Ukrainians in general, and President Zelensky in particular, Nazis. This, among other things, is a complete distortion of the history and a serious affront to the victims of Nazism,” Dayan said on Twitter. 

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the remarks made by his Russian counterpart were ""heinous.""

""FM Lavrov could not help hiding the deeply-rooted antisemitism of the Russian elites,"" Kuleba said Monday on his official Twitter account.
""His heinous remarks are offensive to President [Zelensky], Ukraine, Israel, and the Jewish people. More broadly, they demonstrate that today’s Russia is full of hatred towards other nations.""

The Associated Press

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian army said a Russian offensive along a broad front in the country’s east has been stalling amid human and material losses inflicted by Kyiv’s forces.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Sunday on Facebook that Russian troops were trying to advance in the Sloboda, Donetsk and Tauride regions but were being held back by Ukrainian forces who continue to fight village by village.

Separately, Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian forces of destroying medical infrastructure, taking equipment and denying medical care to residents in several occupied cities and towns.

In a Facebook post Sunday, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry claimed that ventilators and other equipment that had been provided since 2014 by international donors and the government of Ukraine were removed from a hospital at Starobilsk in the eastern Luhansk region.

The post alleged that tuberculosis patients were denied medical care in the Kharkiv region at Volchansk while several facilities were used to treat wounded Russian troops.

The claims could not be immediately verified.

Ukrainian officials also said Sunday that internet and cellular communications were cut in a large area in the Russian-occupied Kherson region and part of the Zaporizhzhia region, and they blamed Russian forces. The London-based internet monitor Netblocks said the Kherson region lost 75 percent of internet connectivity beginning Saturday evening.",1651476726.0,1651476596.0,t3_ug6fnw,t3_ug6fnw,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

But what if it is a practice run for something really stupid?

There is another area nearby that is similar geographically - the lower Dniester. And interestingly, the only thing stopping Russia from moving ships into the lower Dniester and thereby: putting pressure on Moldova, getting very close to linking with Transnistria, and putting pressure on western Ukraine - is a particular bridge between Odesa and Zakota. A bridge that the Russians have been repeatedly attacked using very expensive and increasingly limited in supply Kalibr missiles. 

It doesn’t make any sense whatsoever for Russia to attack that bridge thinking it has strategic importance for Ukraine, or that it is to scare the Moldovans. That bridge might just in the way of something else.

(On the plus side, it means that when and if Lyman falls, Russia will be stuck on the wrong side of the Siverskyy Donets river, further hampering their advance.)

 [Motti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_\(military\)#Motti) 
 
 >Motti is Finnish military slang for a totally encircled enemy unit. The tactic of encircling it is called motitus, literally meaning the formation of an isolated block or ""motti"", but in effect meaning an entrapment or envelopment. The word means ""mug"" in many Finnish dialects; an alternate translation refers to a cubic meter of firewood, a relatively small area in which an encircled enemy could be ""cut down"" like trees. motti is thus related to kessel.

The Duma and the higher echelons of Russian society seem to be the same. There are no dissenting voices. It’s become and echo chamber, and has been that way for decades now.

People are saying that Putin has surrounded himself with yes men and that’s the problem. I think it runs deeper than that. The whole Russian power structure has become an echo chamber where the political elite have become absorbed in repeating each other’s ideology to the point where they have become completely divorced from reality.

It’s not just Putin. If it was just Putin, he would have been removed from power by now.

I think Russia will move to a general mobilisation soon, simply because Russia’s political system is literally unable to do anything else.

When there are too many people saying the same thing, then it’s human nature to believe it’s true. This force is incredibly strong, and now it’s driving Russia into the stone age. 

I don’t think Russia could change their course now even if they wanted to.

Russia is dangerous af.
