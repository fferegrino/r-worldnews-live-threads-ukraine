Day 67 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today my area was relatively quiet, around 1 PM there was some shelling, like literally just 3-4 explosions, followed by return fire from our artillery within 2 minutes and then it got quiet again. There was also some shelling around 2 hours ago, but right now it’s quiet again. 

At the same time today it was advised to residents of eastern and northern parts of the city to not go outside at all. While shelling around my area actually became way less frequent with liberation of Ruska Lozova, in other districts like Saltivka shelling still continues like it did before. 

And also around 2 hours ago another residential building was shelled in an unspecified district, which again caused a really big fire. Apparently the explosion was really loud (but we didn’t hear it personally, as it was too far away from us), so it might have been another cruise missile.

I really don’t understand what Russians are even planning to do, they erected [yet another Lenin statue, this time in Nova Kakhovka](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1520391464773206019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and of course hung even more USSR flags, who the hell is their target audience? It’s like they are marking their territory with those Lenin statues, this is so bizarre.

What is even Russia at this point? They are using more and more USSR flags and less Russian flags, are they saying that Russia is no more and USSR has returned or something? It’s like they are stuck in the past, [in Melitopol they are again using more USSR flags and play old songs about WW2 on the speakers](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/ug66xp/russian_army_raised_huge_soviet_red_flag_with_its/). Nobody wants that here Russia, just go away.

Just 2 days ago one of our acquaintances from Crimea that lived there even before it was occupied, said that people arriving to Crimea from Mariupol are happy, what the fuck does that even mean? Are they happy that their city was razed to the ground and that they were deported by Russians? 

That same person said that they are now receiving strawberries and greens from Kherson, just like it was before 2014, yeah fucking stolen crops from our farmers. But of course she also said that business in Kherson is now booming (paraphrasing) and people there are also happy (as you can see Russia only brings happiness everywhere it goes). 

She said that this was relayed to her by people she personally knows from those places. She is either blatantly lying to our faces, or Russians truly live in an alternate reality where Russians are the good guys that are saving people from Nazis, I really don’t see any other options.

I have to think that a presidential visit is something under consideration, but only a question of how soon that will be feasible,"" Schiff told CNN's Jim Acosta. Schiff noted the delegation did not discuss the topic on the call with Biden Sunday. 

Schiff said the meeting with Zelensky focused on what his priorities are for further assistance, especially as Ukrainians enter a new phase of the war with more concentrated fighting in the eastern part of the country. Members of the delegation subsequently relayed the information to Biden on the call, Schiff said, and made recommendations to the President.

Asked what Zelensky thought about the $33 billion price tag Biden requested in his supplemental aid request for Ukraine to Congress, Schiff said: ""It's his job to say that nothing is enough and, you know, we understand that, we respect that. Nonetheless, I think he's very grateful for what we're doing.""

""We wanted to discuss with him, within that really vast sum, what is the priority in terms of what weapons that he needs, what other assistance that he needs,"" Schiff said. ""We went through a detailed discussion of the next phase of the war. It's moving from a phase in which Ukrainians were ambushing Russian tanks -- it was close-quarters fighting -- to fighting more at a distance using long range artillery, and that changes the nature of what Ukraine needs to defend itself.""

Schiff said they discussed a variety of issues, including ensuring he's getting the military equipment he needs and is getting it quickly. They discussed the humanitarian crisis, refugees, war crimes, and he said, ""I wanted to make sure as the intelligence chair that he's getting the intelligence that he needs.""

Schiff said members of the delegation wanted to communicate to Zelensky at the meeting a message of support because, ""If Russia can get away with this, this naked aggression, this invasion of their neighbor, you know, what's to make us think they'll stop with Ukraine.""

This, he said, happened the day after the publication of a post with his anti-war stance on Instagram. The Russian presidential administration threatened to nationalize the bank if Tinkoff did not sever ties with it and if Tinkoff did not change its name, the businessman said.

On April 28, 35 percent of TCS Group Holding, the parent structure of Russia's Tinkoff Group, was bought by Vladimir Potanin's Interros Group from Oleg Tinkov's family. Tinkov described it in an interview with the NYT as ""a desperate sale, a sale at a discount"" imposed on him by the Kremlin.

""I couldn't discuss the price. It's a hostage state - you take what's offered to you without negotiation,"" Tinkov said. I built this business for 15 years of my life, even when I thought I was about to die of leukemia I refused to sell it.

The entrepreneur did not name a specific price, but said he sold his stake for 3 percent of its ""real value."" ""They forced me to sell it because of my statements. I sold it for pennies,"" he said.

Tinkov also said that many Russian businessmen stand in solidarity with his position on Ukraine, which they told him privately, but ""everyone is so afraid”. 

Businesses abroad often have authorities, while in Russia, authorities have business.

After his famous Instagram post where Oleg Tinkov called the war a senseless and brutal massacre, many assumed that he had said enough for a criminal article.

The businessman also said that he hired bodyguards after acquaintances with connections in the Russian security services told him that he should fear for his life because ""the decision had already been made."" Although he survived leukemia, ""the Kremlin will probably kill him,"" he added.",1651496160.0,1651485071.0,t3_ug6fnw,t3_ug6fnw,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

From CNN’s Hannah Ritchie

Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, was hit by two explosions in the early hours of Monday morning, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a Telegram post. 

Thirty minutes ago, I woke up to two strong bursts. According to the operational headquarters, there is no damage or destruction. There are no casualties,” Gladkov said around 2.40 a.m. local time.

Monday's explosions come after a large fire broke out at a Russian Ministry of Defense military installation in Belgorod on Sunday. The cause of the incident was unclear.

Right now you're seeing Ukraine recover more ground then Russia is taking, all of which is in the Kharkiv region.  Ukraine is playing the smart move and taking ground in area's in which they more then likely out number Russia by a fair margin.  Right now the cost of counter attacking into Izyum is too high, the concentration of troops there is extremely high and all it would achieve is maybe spoiling an imminent attack.

It's important to point out the right now Russia is probably out numbered at this point in Ukraine, they're using large numbers of troops in a localized capacity to make costly advances, costs they cant continue to afford.  This will only make the numbers game worse.  Finally, by the end of summer the training and mobilization of Ukraines forces will more then likely give them as a high as a 3 to 1 advantage over Russia.  Wars take time to develop, and eb and flow in the beginning... this war by historical standards is extremely young, I dont think Russia has a chance even in the near future.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,ug6fnw,i70fukp,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said over the weekend that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had “Jewish blood,” prompting a furious response from Israel on Monday.

“Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,” Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said.
“Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of anti-Semitism.”

Lavrov made the comments on Italian television on Sunday, repeating Russia’s claim that its invasion of Ukraine is to “de-Nazify” the country.

He shrugged off the fact that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.

“He [Zelensky] puts forward an argument: what kind of Nazism can they have if he is a Jew. I may be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood. It means absolutely nothing. The wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews,"" Lavrov said.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian Ambassador to Israel on Monday over Lavrov’s remarks.

Dani Dayan, who chairs the Yad Vashem Holocaust remembrance site in Israel, said it was “completely unfounded” to say Hitler was of Jewish descent.

And he slammed Russia’s labelling of Ukrainians as Nazis.

“Equally serious is calling the Ukrainians in general, and President Zelensky in particular, Nazis. This, among other things, is a complete distortion of the history and a serious affront to the victims of Nazism,” Dayan said on Twitter. 

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the remarks made by his Russian counterpart were ""heinous.""

""FM Lavrov could not help hiding the deeply-rooted antisemitism of the Russian elites,"" Kuleba said Monday on his official Twitter account.
""His heinous remarks are offensive to President [Zelensky], Ukraine, Israel, and the Jewish people. More broadly, they demonstrate that today’s Russia is full of hatred towards other nations.""

The Associated Press

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian army said a Russian offensive along a broad front in the country’s east has been stalling amid human and material losses inflicted by Kyiv’s forces.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Sunday on Facebook that Russian troops were trying to advance in the Sloboda, Donetsk and Tauride regions but were being held back by Ukrainian forces who continue to fight village by village.

Separately, Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian forces of destroying medical infrastructure, taking equipment and denying medical care to residents in several occupied cities and towns.

In a Facebook post Sunday, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry claimed that ventilators and other equipment that had been provided since 2014 by international donors and the government of Ukraine were removed from a hospital at Starobilsk in the eastern Luhansk region.

The post alleged that tuberculosis patients were denied medical care in the Kharkiv region at Volchansk while several facilities were used to treat wounded Russian troops.

The claims could not be immediately verified.

Ukrainian officials also said Sunday that internet and cellular communications were cut in a large area in the Russian-occupied Kherson region and part of the Zaporizhzhia region, and they blamed Russian forces. The London-based internet monitor Netblocks said the Kherson region lost 75 percent of internet connectivity beginning Saturday evening.",1651476726.0,1651476596.0,t3_ug6fnw,t3_ug6fnw,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

But what if it is a practice run for something really stupid?

There is another area nearby that is similar geographically - the lower Dniester. And interestingly, the only thing stopping Russia from moving ships into the lower Dniester and thereby: putting pressure on Moldova, getting very close to linking with Transnistria, and putting pressure on western Ukraine - is a particular bridge between Odesa and Zakota. A bridge that the Russians have been repeatedly attacked using very expensive and increasingly limited in supply Kalibr missiles. 

It doesn’t make any sense whatsoever for Russia to attack that bridge thinking it has strategic importance for Ukraine, or that it is to scare the Moldovans. That bridge might just in the way of something else.

MH didn't say stupid btw.  Just me nut-shelling it.

About 2 weeks ago, I saw a redditor facepalming over how the Russian army is like WWII Italy.

That gave me a chuckle, because even though WWII military stuff are not my cup of tea, I know enough to auto-get that Italy was just... ""useless"" in WWII.

*Now ancient history is my cup of tea*, so 'imma gonna say that the Russian army makes me think of how the Persian army got curb-stomped by Alexander the Great's Macedonian army.

And MH thread just now is making me (shakes head), because it reminded me that one of the pretty big reasons why the Roman (not Italian) army curb-stomped a LOT during their heyday was that each legion could operate independently enough to grab initiative without asking for permission from central command.

*Basically, Russian army sucks at delegation.*

> Delegation – giving others the authority to act on your behalf, accompanied with responsibility and accountability for results. A leader cannot do all of the work for an organization; if one tries, he or she will not be successful at. leading.

The article claims that they drove from Mariupol to Warsaw in 5 days, via Russia and Lithuania.
There is no direct border between Russia and Lithuania, except for Kaliningrad Oblast, but that's irrelevant in this case. So they probably took the route via Russia and Belarus, or north via Latvia.
I guess there was no way to reach Poland directly thru Ukraine, I'm not one of the map guys, still I know of course that Mariupol was besieged/encircled, so maybe this big detour really was the fastest way.

Currently the US-Military trains ukrainian soldiers on german soil, and the german military is set to start with it soon  aswell.

My personal opinion: Continue training, send more weapons, and live with the uncertainty it creates. Freedom is worth defending no matter the cost. However, dont stop talking to Russia, diplomacy must always have a chance.

 [Motti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_\(military\)#Motti) 
 
 >Motti is Finnish military slang for a totally encircled enemy unit. The tactic of encircling it is called motitus, literally meaning the formation of an isolated block or ""motti"", but in effect meaning an entrapment or envelopment. The word means ""mug"" in many Finnish dialects; an alternate translation refers to a cubic meter of firewood, a relatively small area in which an encircled enemy could be ""cut down"" like trees. motti is thus related to kessel.

If you log onto r/trump or r/conservative right now you’ll see lots of people very loudly agreeing with each other. Add in the very willing troll factory element, and you can really see people inventing an absolute truth from an endless positive feedback loop.

I’m not saying this is peculiar to those groups, but it’s a very obvious example right now. In, fact it probably happens here a little bit!

The Duma and the higher echelons of Russian society seem to be the same. There are no dissenting voices. It’s become and echo chamber, and has been that way for decades now.

People are saying that Putin has surrounded himself with yes men and that’s the problem. I think it runs deeper than that. The whole Russian power structure has become an echo chamber where the political elite have become absorbed in repeating each other’s ideology to the point where they have become completely divorced from reality.

It’s not just Putin. If it was just Putin, he would have been removed from power by now.

I think Russia will move to a general mobilisation soon, simply because Russia’s political system is literally unable to do anything else.

When there are too many people saying the same thing, then it’s human nature to believe it’s true. This force is incredibly strong, and now it’s driving Russia into the stone age. 

I don’t think Russia could change their course now even if they wanted to.

Maybe it's the reverse.  Hard to know when folk can be jailed so readily for opposing the war.  Fearful people tend not to be honest with polling.

But... there are significant reasons to believe that, at least at the level of the affluent or influential, there is *a ton* of support for the general ideas that are behind Russian imperialism and expansionism.

It is important to underscore that *all* of the reasons proffered for this ""special operation"" are lies.  Fear of NATO expansionism?  Lies.  Fear of border security?  Lies.  The deeper truth is a centuries old vainglory of self-deluded desire for global importance.

Even the genocide and reabsorption of Ukraine is but a stepping stone along a broader goal which involves breaking apart NATO, conquering the Baltics, pushing all the way to take Moldova, etc.

These talking heads on TV are espousing this self-delusion of how great Russia was, is and will be.  To them, this ""special operation"" is akin to spanking a wayward child.

It’s a way to offset attempts to hold corporations accountable for whatever they do that warrants “cancelation”, by increasing support among his followers.

Here's what I've written on his the [last time it was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/u9wv3s/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i5v8nj4/):  

The things that separated 20th century fascists from these other types [of right-wing autocracy] were:  

- a particular focus on racial 'purity'
- promotion of the military including a merging of the military and the police
- a systematic dismantling of the aristocracy
- the dismantling of corporations and the nationalization of any company useful to war efforts or military supply (a far more limited definition of capitalism, more like the ancient Roman system)

Your typical free-market espousing corporate apologia can still lead to right-wing autocracy, but it wouldn't be fascist autocracy.  American grassroots fascism tends to still be anti-corporate, but elected officials accused of fascism are all extremely pro-corporate, even if their abject racism invites fascist comparison.  

Russia, however, has increasingly met each and every one of these criteria.  It has always suppressed non-Russian ethnolinguistic parties.  The police have military authority over civilians and are supported by two intelligence networks.  Russian oligarchs who made their money in the 90s no longer control the country and have effectively become a new aristocracy, one which Putin is now attacking.  And now it's started nationalizing companies, both foreign and domestic.  The murder of billionaires and their families and nationalization of their assets is textbook fascism.  

So even by the strictest definition of the term, Russia is actually fascist or in the process of becoming fascist today.",False,1651451404.0,t3_ug6fnw,t1_i6yps2v,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Russia relies on a council of shadowy people who many people never heard of, and new faces show up every so often. By definition, Russia is synarchist which is a very distant variant of fascism.

You must realize that communism and fascism take 2 different routes, lets use illness as an example:

- Communism is like a cold, its very similar to a cold in another person's body and often relies on a ""purity"" test because its either a cold or not. Communism relies on adhering to arbitrary rules which is why communist sects hate each others guts. Their rules are the seen as the only rules.

- Fascism is like a cancer. Genetically and physically it is different to cancer in another body, but its still cancer. Fascism does not care about the ""purity"" of following the rules, it cares about attaining power. Just like cancer cares about growth and nothing else.

While it might seem that the aid should have been provided earlier, and in most cases in my opinion it should have, the administration of France, Germany, the US, Britain et al has to take everything into consideration, not just a desire to help Ukraine win.  

Providing huge pieces of equipment, like S-300’s, can be game changing for Ukraine, but if they are given and then taken off the battlefield because Russia finds them, they then become major losses for morale and future donations of similar equipment will be met with more criticism.  

Ukraine has been doing amazing, and is getting training that will only make them better once the equipment starts to be fielded more and more regularly, but the West has to ensure that the equipment is going to be useful, as safe as can be expected, and Ukraine can maintain and utilize it effectively.  

Finally, if we throw everything up front, like Sanctions and embargo’s, and all of our top of the line equipment that really won’t make a difference unless it’s utilized and defended appropriately, it leaves no room to escalate against Moscow to force them to bow out.  Degrade Russia’s capabilities then more and better equipment comes in to allow Ukraine to push back more forcefully.  

Keep in mind that in Democracies Leaders are not elected to be nice or helpful.  They are elected to ensure posterity.  In this case Ukrainian posterity is increasingly tied to the West’s reputation, so Ukraine will get more and more as conditions allow for escalation.",False,1651470988.0,t3_ug6fnw,t1_i6zp11b,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

- Russia's older population supports Putin but is just as strongly anti-war.  That's kind of why they do it.  They think strongmen are a deterrent against the kind of chaos that war can come from.  They hear 'police operation' and think that sounds like something that will stop something far worse, let's do that.  This attitude influenced Gorbachev's entire foreign policy, and these are the people Putin plays to.  Note:  Putin, not media.  
- Experts seem to agree it'll take 6 months to a year to get results from such an action.  Even if they half-ass it, as they would, there has to be minimal training.

If it does happen, there is a very possible outcome where Russia's pathetic defense budget, specifically regarding their nukes, means most of them don't work. Nukes are not something you get to build and then just forget about. They require constant, very expensive maintenance. Russia has not been doing that. They keep their rockets fueled, which lowers the likelihood of a successful launch. That fuel is corrosive and eats up the boosters. Additionally, during the denuclearization efforts of the past decades, several hundred Russian nukes were disassembled by western workers. A large portion of them were found to have cores that were assembled in a manner that would not have resulted in a successful detonation. This could only be found by disassembling the nuclear package. So its likely they don't even know which ones work. Combine that with the booster failures, and you've got a much smaller amount of nukes that would ever work. 

Once you weed out all the ones that don't work, you have to look at how the ones left are actually getting anywhere. Most of those nukes are not ICBMs. They are ordinance that is to be dropped from planes. The Tupolev Tu-95 is their main heavy bomber, and it has 0% chance of ever making it to a meaningful target in western air space. It's old, slow, and has no stealth. Their other option is the Tupolev TU-160. While fast, they only have 27 usable bombers, and it's still gonna get shot down by any country with 4th gen fighters or better. So conventional bombs aren't going to do anything. 

That leaves Russia with a handful of ICBM and submarine launched missiles that would A) actually work, and B) not explode during launch from bad maintenance. Current western missile defense capability is classified well beyond anything the general public will ever have access to. The best estimate you can make is taking what you know the west is capable of and raising it by a few decades. Western nations, the US in particular, do not share anything with the public that is cutting edge. If you know about it, they could do it 10-20 years before you found out about it. So with that, Russia has to do the math and calculate, on a guess, how many would actually get through. If that number isn't enough to make sure that every man, woman, child, and cockroach is dead when its over, then there is no reason to push the button.

Insurance agencies are legally allowed to keep 20% for overhead. Just replacing them with a government agency like Medicare would reduce the spending that is done to insurance agencies by 16.5%. Medicare runs at 1.7% currently and is expected to grow to 3.5% with something like M4A. Since 2 trillion is paid to insurance agencies yearly it would be a 330 billion dollar savings.

Then you remove 90 billion that it is estimated to cost to insure those that have no insurance. Reduce another 50 billion it is expected to cost to raise the under insured to Medicare standards. That still leaves the US with a savings.

The US is ranked 37th in health care quality, first in spending. The 36 countries listed before us all use different forms of universal healthcare.

No equipment is better than a healthy and well taken care of, body.

Yep, of the  many russian strategic failures this war,  drinking their own bathwater about what units like the VDV are capable of.

Elite troops, whether airborne infantry or special forces capture public and political imagination because they're really cool. People love the idea of highly trained ubermensch who can appear out of nowhere and perform dramatic feats on the battlefield. And there are plenty of examples of what they can do and how valuable they can be when used right.

But as far back as WW2 Germany, and then the US and UK learnt two lessons about elite troops the hard way.

1. Airborne troops are only as elite as the units that transport them and the plan in place to get them safely to their objective. The huge losses during the german drops on Crete, some of the chaotic allied airdrops in Normandy on DDay, the disaster that was Op Eagle Claw, and the losses sustained in Mogadishu during Gothic Serpent (ie the 'Blackhawk Down' saga) highlight how highly trained, elite troops are still vulnerable if their transport is poorly planned and executed, or the enemy knows they're coming and has AA weapons. The millions of dollars, careful selection process,  years of training and state of the art weaponry of an elite paratrooper unit mean nothing if the pilot flying them to the mission crashes the plane or takes them to the wrong place or isn't prepared for an enterprising defender with a stinger missile at the exact wrong moment.

2. However skilled and brave they are, an elite light infantry unit which is limited to the equipment each man can carry will quickly become ineffective if pinned down without resupply or air support. Again, there are multiple examples of this through history, starting with the british paratroopers in operation market garden, but simply put, airborne troops and special forces are there to strike unexpectedly, take objectives and either get out/be resupplied or be relieved. Man portable quantities of ammunition are used incredibly fast in a firefight, humans will quickly exhaust any supply of water they are capable of carrying, wounded need treatment and evacuation or they will quickly make it hard for a unit to move and fight, and whatever their level of training infantry are always going to start to take heavy casualties if they are trapped and hammered by armor and artillery.

Russia basically ignored both of these rules from the get go and have are a bunch of dead VDV to show for it.

I've no doubt  the utter shambles that was Hostomel airport happened in part because Putin wanted some dramatic photogenic footage of elite russian paratroopers descending without warning from the skies and rapidly seizing an objective whilst the world looked on in awe.",1651479645.0,1651479122.0,t3_ug6fnw,t1_i6zzc0a,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The western approach is largely about taking and maintaining air superiority, and then relying on close air support/high level precision bombing to fulfil the role of artillery. In every war they've fought over the past thirty years, air superiority has quickly been followed by the utter obliteration of conventional enemy forces.

If the US went all in on this war tomorrow, what you would see is a few days or maybe a week where they went all out with drones/F 35 and F22s/long range missiles to find and destroy every long range russian anti air unit  and signals unit in the area around Donbas, sink their black sea fleet, intercept and destroy russian fighter planes and, assuming they wanted to go there, destroy any airfields nearby.

Then, once they were confident the environment was reasonably safe to fly in, it would be B52s, more F35s and F15s, and for any russian soldiers who weren't dead yet but would soon wish they were, Apaches and A10s.

The US would probably lose some planes from that sort of campaign but they could easily turn every russian tank, apc and combat soldier in Ukraine into shrapnel flavored tomato puree inside 30 days, without firing a single artillery round.

The hoax was plagiarized from several earlier sources, some not antisemitic in nature. It was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. It played a key part in popularizing belief in an international Jewish conspiracy.

 >The 1998 United States embassy bombings were attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998. More than 200 people were killed in nearly simultaneous truck bomb explosions in two East African cities, one at the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the other at the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks, which were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and their terrorist organization, al-Qaeda, to the attention of the U.S. public for the first time, and resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placing bin Laden on its ten most-wanted fugitives list.
 
**[Khobar Towers bombing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khobar_Towers_bombing)** 
 
 >The Khobar Towers bombing was a terrorist attack on part of a housing complex in the city of Khobar, Saudi Arabia, near the national oil company (Saudi Aramco) headquarters of Dhahran and nearby King Abdulaziz Air Base on 25 June 1996. At that time, Khobar Towers was being used as living quarters for coalition forces who were assigned to Operation Southern Watch, a no-fly zone operation in southern Iraq, as part of the Iraqi no-fly zones. A truck bomb was detonated adjacent to Building #131, an eight-story structure housing members of the United States Air Force's 4404th Wing (Provisional), primarily from a deployed rescue squadron and deployed fighter squadron.

Sure, Finland COULD build a ""smart wall"" with seismic sensors, thermal cameras, etc but that will take significantly longer to build. This WOULD be very effective, and is the sort of project you might want to set up if you're expecting things to be relatively peaceful for a decade or more. Particularly since you're going to want to spread out the huge cost of setting that system up across a long period of time.

My point about the tunnel is that if your objective as the fence/wall builder is to stop saboteurs from crossing the border, what this REALLY ends up meaning is that the wall is acting as a visible tripwire for crossings. Patrol by any given section every few hours, glancing around to see if a hole was cut through. Raise the alarm if such a hole is found. The cost of actively patrolling the entirety of that fence/wall more frequently than this would be astronomical and ongoing. As such, the utility of the tunnel is simply that if the patrol group is only looking at the fence, rather than also examining out 50 ft either side of the fence, the patrolling people will likely never notice that it's being bypassed and never raise the alarm.

> whether your massive tunnelling operation is more costly than what the Russians would currently need to do

I'm not imagining a tunnel that's going to slip a tank through unnoticed, just a man-sized tunnel with those little slider-rail skids. If they were going to send a tank over, they will just run over the fence because a full outright attack is in force. When it comes to things like sending saboteurs, you don't REALLY care that the tunnel might have cost a hundred thousand dollars (it wouldn't be anywhere near this costly, but I'm making a point) because what you're frequently trying to accomplish by sending in a saboteur unnoticed is ""worth"" more than this.",False,1651472794.0,t3_ug6fnw,t1_i6zxwv6,,5,0,0,0,0,0,

Why not? Pretty much every story about the filtration camps I've read thus far mentions ones within Russian-occupied Ukraine (many stories describe ones within or near Mariupol) or just across the border within Russia. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61208404

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-filtration-camps-osce/31825625.html

Here's another mentioning a filtration camp near Kherson:

>the reason for them being “filtered” in the first place is because of an illegal war of aggression which has seen russia commit every war crime and atrocity in the book from genocide to raping toddlers all documented live on tik tok. 

I totally agree, and have made no attempts to deny this.


>So take your pandering drivel and shove it up your collaborating, soulless ass.

I'm not the guy you were arguing with before, I was simply pointing out a relevant detail. 

The guy above made a good point, hundreds of thousands of Russian-aligned civilians were evacuating from Donetsk and Luhansk into Russia just prior to this conflict intensifying in late February. You know, like these people who were issued & accepted Russian passports:

https://www.euronews.com/2022/02/17/russia-has-issued-720-000-fast-track-passports-in-separatist-held-areas-of-eastern-ukraine

And the calls for civilians to evacuate given by the Donetsk rebel government in the weeks before the invasion:

They also generally do not have the range to reach the US. Even if all of them worked perfectly (lol at that notion after Ukraine) they would only be able to take out urban centers, not salt the earth across entire continents as you suggest. Most American industry is now highly decentralized often spread in clusters along the interstates of the vast American heartland. Russia would have to choose between hitting urban areas and trying to take out like five factories in the middle of nowhere. If they hit the cities then the US industrial base is relatively unscathed and is unleashed on them. 

But this isn't worth explaining to you, obviously you have no knowledge of the topic. In fact, we don't need to argue about it because actual scientists have already dissected the matter and found that:

>This full-scale nuclear war was estimated to cause 770 million direct deaths and generate 180 Tg of soot from burning cities and forests. In the US, about half the population would be within 5km of a ground zero, and a fifth of the country’s citizens would be killed outright.
