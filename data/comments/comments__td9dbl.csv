Putin said in April, 2014, soon after the annexation of Crimea, that it was “necessary to defend the interests of Russian speakers in Ukraine.” People here in Kharkiv would disagree. The war has destroyed millions of lives in the densely populated region, divided families and breaking friendships, but there is one area where the violence has succeeded: galvanizing much of the population against Russian aggression. “We have two veteran artists at our theater, who are in their 90s. They say that they loved Russia as their motherland until the first shot of separatists at Ukrainian citizens,” the director of Saxalin-UA, Evgeny Safonov, tells Rolling Stone. “Today, when the Russian army is on our border threatening another invasion, Putin should understand that he has lost the most important people.

>Now, he said, Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred.",False,1647205607.0,t3_td9dbl,t3_td9dbl,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

China really has two options.

1. Do not help Russia and Russia will still beg to be connected to the Chinese economy because they have no other options atm so buying the Russian economy at a discount if possible
2. Help Russian and Russia will still beg to be connected to the Chinese economy and will still offer their economy at a discount but at the same time China will get sanctions from the west and will have a harder time selling its products in the west.

The only rational reason why I see China helping Russia is if Russia goes full Africa and gives China some major bonuses like selling off the entire port city of Sevastopol, Africa style, or literally selling half of the country's oil fields to China. Something exaggerated like that which has been unprecedented in Russian history(although not quite because they did sell Alaska quite cheaply once).

My guess is that China will give Russia some symbolic yet useless help in order to give Putin a reason to claim at home that he is an ally of China while not enough to incur a severe western response.

**Putin's time as a KGB Officer During the Cold War**

Putin was a 37-year-old KGB Officer stationed in East Germany when the Berlin Wall fell. Referring back to this time later, he remarked:

>First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century

Embarrassed by the might of the USSR seemingly falling overnight, he maintained that bitter resentment over the years and stoked the embers of disdain for the West from the likes of Clinton's airstrikes in Serbia, to the wanton neoconservative aggression stemming from Cheney & Rumsfeld's war in Iraq under the Bush Administration. He began shaping his plans, using past instances of wrongdoing as precedent to permit further atrocities at the behest of his own legacy and Russia.

**COVID Lockdown Madness**

Speculation by intelligence officials and ambassadors claim Putin's mental health has declined considerably during covid lock-down protocols within Russia. There, isolating himself from a wider range of voices, he was surrounded by the most ardent Yes-Men and extremist voices within his bunker. In Stalinistic fashion, anyone who dissented would've liked been seen as traitors and summarily fired or worse. It's thought that during this time his most radical ideas floated were lapped up by his ardent loyalists and amplified back to Putin, pushing Putin to act on what he otherwise might have more cautiously resisted. 

**Putin's Playbook, and His Own Personal Rasputin**

It is unforgivable to discuss Putin's influences and motives without mentioning Aleksandr Dugin—the modern Rasputin, if you will—and his book, *Foundations of Geopolitics* written in the '90s. When Constanze Stelzenmüller talks about, ""Only Putin's inner-circle of hard-men, the siloviki,""—not even the oligarchs overall, mind you—""can change Putin's mind,"" chief among them is Alexsandr Dugin. His book has been Putin's Playbookfor Russia's actions for the past 2 decades, including the disinformation, gaslighting, projection, and so forth. Dugin is, quite openly, a neo-nazi fascist. It comes as no surprise that Putin has followed through such a playbook from his atrocities in Chechyna to now, and conveniently projecting the ""denazification"" of Ukrainians.  Most relevant is the fact that in his book, Dugin calls for the outright annexation of Ukraine. Amid COVID Lockdown paranoia, who do you think Putin was most-isolated with?

**Putin's 5,000-word Essay of July 2021**

This likely led to Putin foreshadowing the Ukrainian invasion in his 5,000-word published Essay on thew Kremlin's website. In it, he talks at length about restoring Russia to its former glory as the Russian Empire. Within that, he explicitly notes that the entirety of Ukraine is of Russian territory and that, ""Russia was robbed."" 

This is thus much larger than any immediate economic gains; Putin wants blitzkrieg gains in territory for Russia, and he wants to cement his legacy as a leader who helped to restore Russia to its glory-days by way of military conquest. With covid-lockdown madness, he seemingly abandoned his attempts at soft-power, for it was taking too long. Or he utterly miscalculated in a blunder so big it now puts himself in check, let alone possible checkmate.

**How does Putin Justify This?**

Cutting through the propaganda of the official line, how does Putin justify the actions he knows he's taking to *himself*? 

As with most autocrats, ethics and morality are largely tossed out of the window with an, ""Ends Justify the Means"" mentality, substituted by a deflective Tu Quoque fallacy of, ""You Did it, Too!"". Simply by saying, ""This is for the greater good and you'll all be happier once we're through this,"" Putin likely rationalizes that this is the needle of a vaccine before inoculation. In his own words, Putin believes that ""If a fight is inevitable, you should be the one to throw the first punch."" This of course speaks to his Cold War grudges and alludes to what he may have done during the Cuban Missile Crisis, contingent on the false-premise that the fight was ever inevitable in the first place. 

In his past, Putin has had no qualms with supporting dictators like Assad who used chemical-weapons blatantly on his own people. He's had no problem killing off or throwing opposition in prison via Kangaroo Courts. Even the Apartment Bombings of 1999 are considered by many a false-flag to bring him to power, journalists ruthlessly murdered who started connecting the dots with ease. 

This has nothing to do with Nazis in Ukraine (reminder, Zelenskyy himself is Jewish, and Russians just hit the Holocaust memorial as they killed civilians int he process); that is propaganda to rally his own troops and domestic support. It has nothing to do with Ukraine, a sovereign independent nation, joining a defensive alliance like NATO—that was only to ensure Ukraine remained vulnerable to seizing. Ukraine or NATO was never a ""security threat"" to the borders of Russia. In fact, neo-nazis have been on the rise in Russia perhaps more-so than many other nations. The reality is this conflict has everything to do with Putin ""rightfully taking back"" what he believes is his. *Whataboutism* AKA ""Two-Wrongs-Somehow-Make-a-Right""/Race-to-the-bottom propaganda, is just a convenient excuse. Even now, there are suspicious users online incessantly spamming these rhetorical deflections to divert attention away from the Present, timely, and large-scale atrocity that isn't a matter of history but ongoing and can be stopped in its tracks *now*. Be wary of users like this, for their end-goal is that same race-to-the-bottom mindset. 

Ultimately, it is a race against time on whether the blanketed economic sanctions return Russia to the collapsing soviet union faster than Putin can rally these forces and take his gains... But lingering around every dinner-table in Russia and even among the Oligarchs is: ""How is this worth it to Russia?"" The value of Ukraine in its entirety gained means nothing to the crippling financial costs that will sustain against Russia for years to come, leaving them as isolated and marginalized as North Korea. Even more so, the ironic thing is that if Russia takes Ukraine, that puts their border up against NATO no differently than what they were alleging to care about in the first place. 

**Why did Putin Pick Now?**

Putin is personally living the good life. He has a MASSIVE mansion, yachts, and the balls of a nation largely at his grip. You thought Fox News was bad. Propaganda runs deep in Russia, and dissent is brutally-oppressed. The only thing left for him is cementing his legacy. On the verge of 70, Putin knows his final years are upon him. Whatever action to ensure that legacy and his goals, he must take now. Now consider:

- Trump lost when he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet, for whom he and Oligarchs invested a lot of time and money, would withdraw or defund NATO as Trump publicly and privately floated. 
- Covid further happened, which likely delayed his plans.
- Putin then likely opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew and engaged with Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- The mud of Spring was fast-approaching, leaving a mechanized offensive vulnerable to further logistical challenges. 
- The domestic grip of his country is slipping, and historically there is no better way to rally domestic control than start a conflict somewhere and start stoking the feelings of Patriotism. Interestingly, this isn't working too well this time, it seems.
- Provided that most countries have been desperate to restart their economy post-coronavirus, Putin was hoping to avoid the worst of expected sanctions, thinking Europe and US wouldn't risk raising gas-prices further that might harm their domestic image. 

There were many things that didn't go as planned for him: dissent among his military; low morale; confusion; logistical challenges; poor maintenance of equipment; dissent within his borders; unprecedented unity among the West. The outward propaganda and his online misinformation war got summarily rebuked, and this conflict went on already twice as long as anticipated, according to intelligence probes. It was supposed to be a blitzkrieg, but now it's going to turn into a financially-draining and publicly-humiliating occupation that could go on for years. The public attention by Western nations got ahead of Russia's plans, seemingly causing them to hesitate and then jump the gun. It bought enough time to bring threatening Anti-Air and Anti-Tank weaponry that significantly delays Russia's advancements. It put Russia in a position where they could only hit targets from afar via cruise-missiles / artillery-strikes. But lurking around every corner are loyal Ukrainian citizens fighting for their homes, armed to take out an enemy who isn't even sure why they're there and why they aren't being greeted as liberators. This to me is partly suggested by the fact that 90+ attack-helicopters remained staged on the border of Belarus for so long.

This ultimately seems to fork Russian plans: They either must (a) Continue with the bullshit premise that this isn't an outright war and a special operation intended to mitigate civilian casualties, and thus cannot blatantly bomb city-centers and target the civilians (I know, they have), thereby exposing your true motives, or (b) Sit back with your mechanized infantry and support helicopters and tediously precision-target installations because you're too afraid to advance your tanks and air because of the literally thousands of NLAWS, AT4s, Javelins, and manpads waiting dispersed among the ground.

Even if they did, there is no guarantee it would work, so why risk it, even if they aren't afraid of sanctions (big if) and undo decades of hard work to establish them as a serious player?

Taiwan is a completely different kettle of fish. China sees it as its sovereign territory in a way Russia can't say about Ukraine, their support is tenous at best for this invasion, and if anything it makes it harder to seize Taiwan if the West wakes up to this threat, which is likely to the annoyance of Beijing hardliners. And they'd never make such a gamble unless they thought Russia would win- they are much more cautious than Putin, dispassionate amd not making decisions based on funkiest telling Xi what he wants to hear.

 Putin is likely trying to either stir the pot with the west to slow down or divert support, or to try and manipulate China into stepping in to give his side more clout, even if it's only limited supplies, it strengthens his hand. Most likely though its just stoking WW3 fears among some in West, not seriously but as a sort of sick mind game.

As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.

As well, this is a strong message to NATO that pouring resources into far less costly (when compared to a tank) and advanced missile systems (for armor, air, and sea) can be a strong deterrent to the russian military.

We have forgotten the fear of a looming Ukraine-Russia conflict and Moscow rancour over the future of Crimea and the Donbas was on the minds of the key players in 1991.


As he galloped towards his country's independence, after the collapse of central Soviet authority post-coup in August 1991, Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk warned of ""serious conflict"" and refused any ""change of status"" over Crimea. The topic had more than just arisen.

In Moscow, Gorbachev's adviser Anatoly Chernayev told the UK Ambassador: ""He appropriates nuclear missiles, and Donbas, and Crimea, what an idiot, does he really believe Sebastopol belongs to him?"" Even a super-democrat, if he is a Russian democrat, would stand up against this!""

Meanwhile, Oleg Rumyantsev, head of the constitutional committee of the Russian parliament said: ""Russia is much larger than the RSFSR appendix"" and that if Ukraine was excluded from this new state that was emerging ""the issue of Crimea will have to be raised.""

In denial, Georgy Shakhnazarov, one of Gorbachev's closest aides, thought that Ukrainian ""sovereignty"" was something vague and that people in southern and eastern Ukraine should be rallied to oppose Ukrainian ""separatism"" and ""support common statehood.""


Specifically Georgy Shakhnazarov, kept telling Gorbachev, he wanted to urgently work with the parliament of Crimea, which was then insisting on a referendum to return the province to the incoming Russian Federation and had declared itself autonomous.

These emotions were across Russian politics. The young  Vladimir Putin's boss, St. Petersburg boss Anatoly Sobchak even told the UK Ambassador the West was courting Ukrainian separatism, that it would encourage the break up of the union and ""kill Russian democracy.""

When the UK Ambassador countered to Anatoly Sobchak that this was simply recognising realities that Ukraine was becoming independent, then Putin's boss countered in eerily extreme language: ""It was the West's policy of 'recognising realities' that allowed Hitler's rise to power.""

Average price for monopoly currently on amazon is around $35... each game comes with 15,140 dollars. 15,140 / $35 = 432 so $1 is worth 432 monopoly dollars. ruble is currently sitting at 134 to the dollar. Therefore a ruble is worth just over $3 monopoly dollars.

It's worth less if you want to try to figure out the value of the board/pieces/houses ect and subtract that from the price of the game before calculating what each $1 is worth. If we assume 60-70% of the cost of producing the game goes towards packaging, the board, game pieces ect then a ruble is about equivalent to a monopoly dollar.

EDIT someone pointed out you could just buy the money for $12.99 = 1166 MM to USD (rounded).  Also I did the math wrong for the 2nd half, divided instead of multiplied due to lack of sleep.$151,40 / $12.99 = 1166 MM to 1 USD, so a ruble is actually worth just over 8 times a single monopoly dollar.",1647191918.0,1647191006.0,t3_td9dbl,t3_td9dbl,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

[Russia asks China for military assistance](https://www.ft.com/content/30850470-8c8c-4b53-aa39-01497064a7b7)

""*Russia has asked China for military ​equipment to ​support its invasion of Ukraine, ​sparking concern in ​the White House that Beijing ​may undermine western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country.*

*US officials told the Financial Times that Russia had requested military equipment and other assistance since the start of the invasion. They declined to give details about what materiel Russia had requested.*

*Another person familiar with the situation said the US was preparing to warn allies about the situation amid some indications that China may be preparing to help Russia. Other US officials have also said there were signs that Russia was running out of some kinds of weaponry as the war in Ukraine approaches the start of its third week.*

*The White House did not comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for a comment.*

*The revelation comes as Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, heads to Rome for talks on Monday with Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official. People familiar with the situation said Sullivan would sternly warn China that any efforts to help Russia prosecute the invasion or avoid western sanctions would have consequences.*

*Before leaving Washington on Sunday, Sullivan warned China not to try to “bail out” Russia by helping Moscow to circumvent the sanctions that the US and its allies have imposed on Putin and his regime.*

*“We will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses,” Sullivan told NBC television on Sunday. “In terms of the specific means of doing that, again, I’m not going to lay all of that out in public, but we will communicate that privately to China, as we have already done and will continue to do.*

*”The request for equipment and other kinds of unspecified military assistance comes as the Russian military struggles to make as much progress in Ukraine as western intelligence believe they expected.*

*It also raises fresh questions about the China-Russia relationship, which has grown increasingly strong as both countries express their opposition to the US over everything from Nato to sanctions.*

*China has portrayed itself as a neutral actor in the Ukraine crisis and has refused to condemn Russia for invading the country. The US has also seen no sign that Chinese president Xi Jinping is willing to put any pressure on Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart.*

*The two leaders signed a joint statement in Beijing last month describing the Beijing-Moscow partnership as having “no limits”, in another sign that the two capitals were drawing even closer together.""*",False,1647201629.0,t3_td9dbl,t3_td9dbl,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

My limited understanding of US law is that a contract signed under pressure or duress has the potential to be voided. Are peace treaties / agreements treated in any comparable manor? For example, if Ukraine signed an agreement to stop the Russian invasion which included agreeing not to join NATO, could it later be voided on the grounds of signing under duress / force?

I’m guessing that like anything there has to be a body able to enforce the contract, so if no entity with the power cares to enforce it, and NATO chose to ignore it, Ukraine could just ignore what they signed and do as they choose?

It is because of their military theory of ""Escalate to Deescalate"".  What this means (in summary) is that they will continue to escalate their use of force and the weapons they deploy until the opponent sues for peace rather than lose more from the continued escalation.

Ukraine has made it pretty clear that they are prepared to fight to the last, so it seems like Russia may have to escalate to the point of getting nothing from what is left of Ukraine in victory.  By their theory then, pissing off NATO is likely the best route Putin has to getting a positive result from this, because escalating to bring in NATO will cause deconfliction talks with NATO.  And NATO negotiators will be more open to giving Putin half of Ukraine (desire what they may want) as a means to appease him and end any further escalation.

If this sounds crazy... It is because it is.  But it is a strategy that has worked for them in the past in other conflicts.

But this is also why NATO is very strictly staying out of the conflict and reiterating that they are only going to defend NATO nations.  But they are perfectly happy supplying weapons, money, and volunteers to Ukraine, and allowing Putin to grind his army down on the Ukrainian resistance.

This is going to lead to a terrible amount of death and suffering, this is true.  But it is much less potential death and suffering in the long run, than would be inflicted by an emboldened Imperialist Russia.",1647192910.0,1647192734.0,t3_td9dbl,t3_td9dbl,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

From an American volunteer on the front lines outside of Kyiv: 

""Sitting close to the frontline, the last safe mode of transportation leaves for greener pastures. A core group of about 30 foreign fighters remains out of around 200 people who were here just minutes ago...

""The base we came from was struck by rockets in the early morning hours. People we lived with for a couple days are confirmed dead. It is only a matter of time before our location is targeted. We are about to be cut off by a Russian tank column any day now..

""Food, water, and ammunition dwindle slowly. The mood is somber, people are sending their last messages to friends and family.”

""Where is NATO? Where is the supposed good of western civilization?"" end.

It is somewhat more possible to guess that Russia’s nuclear weapons are inoperable, but this is also a very, very bold claim that requires extreme evidence.

So here’s a little rule of thumb. Take a probability percent. Let’s just use 1%. Now take a ‘payoff’ — in this case, an estimate of people killed in a nuclear conflict. You can find lots of projections for that.

But for the purposes of this post, let’s conservatively say 500 million dead.

So we multiply .01*500 million, giving us 5 million dead.

Mind you, that’s an incredible conservative guesstimate. My own assessment would be: under a NATO NFZ or other direct combat intervention in Ukraine, the chance of nuclear escalation would be 30%. I believe 2-3 billion would die under a maximal conflict. I’ll call it 2 billion.

The results of such a referendum would be a foregone conclusion. 


> 
> A joint survey by American government agency Broadcasting Board of Governors and polling firm Gallup was taken during April 2014. It polled 500 residents of Crimea. The survey found that 82.8% of those polled believed that the results of the Crimean status referendum reflected the views of most residents of Crimea, whereas 6.7% said that it did not. 73.9% of those polled said that they thought that the annexation would have a positive impact on their lives, whereas 5.5% said that it would not. 13.6% said that they did not know.
> 
> A comprehensive poll released on 8 May 2014 by the Pew Research Centre surveyed local opinions on the annexation. Despite international criticism of 16 March referendum on Crimean status, 91% of those Crimeans polled thought that the vote was free and fair, and 88% said that the Ukrainian government should recognise the results

One of the leading theories I heard in the early days was that these helicopters, and their forward operating bases, were only being equipped to support one sorty at a time rather than stockpiling. The reason being that Russia's early paradrop attempts to seize airports near Kyiv were supposed to have succeeded, which would have allowed Russia to move those helicopters forward and resupply them at the airports through heavy lift aircraft.

And when the paradrops failed to hold any airports, they were reluctant to start stockpiling supplies for a proper attack-sorty cadence, because they were continuously planning new attempts at the airports which SURELY will work THIS time...",False,1647191519.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0i2n92,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Probably *not* Dugin. There was an [article a few years back](https://providencemag.com/2019/07/west-overestimates-aleksandr-dugins-influence-russia/) detailing how Dugin likely isn’t the mastermind behind everything Russia has done for decades. Dugin is and has been a fringe character for most of his career, aside from a few years in the early 2000s.


There are areas where Dugin’s thought coincides with Russian foreign policy, but that’s correlation more than causation. He’s taken pretty run of the mill far-right Russian nationalist ideas - antipathy toward the West, viewing Ukraine as belonging to them - and just delivered them in an especially bizarre and esoteric way. Nothing he’s recommended is actually all that novel. The disinformation angle of how he supposedly spearheaded Russian interference in American politics is… pretty predictable, really, it was more or less just taking advantage of problems in rival countries. The US has done the same for decades, I wouldn’t take that to indicate the CIA is run by Eurasianists or something. There are also hilariously blatant areas where Dugin’s “strategy” is completely insane and unlike what has actually happened, e.g., invading China and dismembering them since he thinks they pose a threat to Russia.


If anything Dugin is probably more influential among the far-right abroad in Europe and the U.S., he’s fairly popular among a specific demographic of weird terminally-online neofascists. It’s worth noting that *Foundations of Geopolitics* is really hard to actually find in English, you’d have to buy a not-inexpensive physical copy to read the damn thing. Like 90% of the time when people talk about Dugin they haven’t actually read or heard much of what the man thinks, there’s just a veritable cottage industry of people skimming Wikipedia articles and then talking about how he’s some kind of mastermind.",False,1647186918.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0i2n92,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

d4be0b0808fe1cbdeeef06bdd804f717,td9dbl,i0ifhj5,">Very long Sunday thread on the extent to which we overestimated the Russian military, a bit about the war, and on how we should think about Russian military power. 1/

>First impressions tend to be imperfect at best. You're working with an incomplete picture, anecdotes, and guessing at causality. How much of it is a bad plan, lack of organization, terrible morale, or failure to execute the basics - perhaps all of the above. 2/

>The initial Russian operation was a shambolic attempt at regime change, with little planned or organized. In some ways closer to an attempted raid. I think we've seen a smart UKR effort to defend, and a unimpressive Russian attempt to adjust and prosecute this tragic war. 3/

>But did the community generally overestimate Russian military power, especially in this case? In short, yes, but that's the least interesting aspect of the conversation. I would add, we may have just as underestimated UKR military as overestimated Russian performance. 4/

>I caveat this by saying we probably know very little about the state of UKR military right now, the fog of war persists, and we likely have a one sided perception of how the war is going. UKR is doing a good job dominating the information environment. 5/

>The challenge with assessing military power is that it needs a context to express itself. I've said this before in other venues. You can't assess military power in the abstract, it is not like counting money. Forces never walk off paper neatly onto a battlefield. 6/

>I’ll offer an example. How you assess Chinese military power in the context of a war over Taiwan is going to be different than how you might view it in a hypothetical war between China and India. The conditions and assumptions really matter. 7/

>In the same manner, I'm unsurprised that we got a number of things wrong looking at the Russian mil in the run up to this war. And there will be a debate on which lessons can be generalized about Russian military performance, versus more specific to this context. 8/

>Some clearly carry over, like tactics & looking at the fundamentals, but with others it depends. In the same way that US performance in Afghanistan, or Iraq, may not be reflective of US performance in a high end fight against a near peer opponent. 9/

>So, why did we overestimate aspects of Russian mil capacity & capability? First, few comparative examples of performance - they haven't tried anything on this scale, against a country the size of Ukraine, and an opponent with some significant parity of capability. 10/

>Limited force employment in cases like Syria, or UKR 2014-2015 give you a very stylized perception of military capability. Russia could dictate pace of operations, send optimized forces, etc. Even then, they revealed challenges that the Russian military had yet to overcome. 11/

>Large exercises, which I covered regularly on my blog over the years, are scripted affairs. They are closer to theater than anything else. They still tell you useful things, but folks like me took most of what we saw there with large grains of salt. 12/

>It's important to remember the community tends to focus on some contexts over others. Whereas the Russian mil may have big logistical issues fighting in Ukraine, along multiple axes, in a different context the terrain or expected distance of advance might prove much easier. 13/

>Next, Ukrainian forces are leveraging the urban terrain smartly, ambushing, and engaging in small unit tactics. They're forcing Russian forces into a fight where mass or a larger cohesive force doesn't convey advantage, trading space for time. 14/

>And, looking at the choices in Russian mil strategy, that military was not built for this war. In terms of manpower, readiness, and logistics, it was not designed to sustain strategic ground offensives or hold large tracts of terrain, especially in a country the size of UKR. 15/

>All of that of course doesn't explain why parts of the effort are an omnishambles. Logistics, comms, weak air defense performance, precision issues with strikes, moving about without recon, etc. I'm seeing adjustments in week 2, but all these issues persist. 16/

>I've seen some folks say that there were regular reports of problems from local papers, troops complaining, etc. I've seen those consistently factored into analysis, but generalizing from either positive or negative anecdotal evidence can be an exercise in confirmation bias. 17/

>The Russia mil analysis community is far from monolithic, but there was a basis for the perception of Russian mil power heading into this war. It was not driven by positive Russian self-assessments, defense mil PR, or glowing articles in Izvestiya. 18/

>Folks in the community take account for the bad news stories along with the good ones. The effects of corruption, or incompetence. Yet these do not easily explain specific or divergent outcomes. Asserting causality requires more than allusions to pervasive conditions. 19/

>Often the assumptions, especially in the more applied side of the field, calibrate towards overestimation. You assume a lot more will work, or that opponents will have a good day, for the simple reason that it is better to overestimate than to underestimate. 20/

>This war will undoubtedly set the Russian military back by years and severely damage its reputation. But the 'so what' is a more open ended question. How will they adjust? What should we take away from Russian mil performance in this context, and how best apply it to others? 21/

>After 2014-2015 I found myself regularly arguing that the Russian mil is not 12ft tall. After 2022 I will probably spend much of my time arguing that it isn't 4ft tall either. History teaches us to moderate these kinds of impressions, neither extreme is especially helpful. 22/",False,1647191465.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0iektg,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

My only counter to the idea of abandoning Putin to repair the relationship in the west would be if China thinks the west is already going to go all in against China regardless of what China does here…if that’s the calculus they might as well prop up Russia and escalate the conflict so the west is bogged down.  Or remain neutral on paper but prop up Russia behind the scenes with fresh equipment and technology to help turn the tide and further the conflict for the west without officially losing face.

Every single second that Russia continues to commit war crimes against its citizens just hardens Ukraine's position and further weakens Russia's ability to negotiate anything for themselves.

It's more accurate to look at it as a series of risk-benefit calculations, where every action has a non-zero chance of escalating things, and some actions are riskier than others (eg: providing jets came with the risk of NATO forces engaging with Russia in transit, and providing other aid had bigger bang for the buck, risk-wise).

Unfortunately, even civilian deaths in the thousands are probably inadequate to budge this type of risk calculus, especially if it looks like the current efforts will be sufficient to win - even if that win looks like Russia taking Ukraine but losing after a long, bloody insurgency. Which is not to say that we won't see some calling of Putin's bluffs in the next few weeks/months that will be absolutely *terrifying* (but, plebs like us probably won't even know how close we got until decades after the fact).

My gut tells me that, in the event that Russian atrocities started echoing the horrors of the Nazis in scale (eg: industrial style death camps for Ukrainians) the world would not stand by, even if it means betting the future of human civilization on coin flip odds.

There are three Russian cities with populations over 1 million that are under 200 miles away from Ukraine's eastern frontier. In order to not feel like they constantly have a NATO knife posied next to their liver, they need Ukraine to be at worst neutral. All the better if they are friendly. Intolerable if they are hostile. 

They failed at using the soft power of their economy and cultural ties to pull Ukraine eastward into union (as they did with Belarus). Then they failed at using the subversive power of election meddling, assassinations, and economic threats over gas to coerce them eastward. Then they failed at using limited military incursions and separatism to scare them eastward. And finally, having failed to ward off the western alliance from supporting Ukraine throughout, they've resorted to overt invasion to force them eastward.

A leader other than Putin may not have failed at each of those stages before this point. Ukraine and Russia do have a long history of unity and familial bonds. They should be a natural bloc in world affairs that mutually benefit each other. But Russia failed to make that case to the Ukrainian people. Young Ukrainians saw opportunity, free ideals and an ascendant global culture in the west, while Russia did not provide a viable alternative, demonstrating only corruption, malaise, decline, and creeping authoritarianism.

By the time Maidan happened, it was already too late to try the carrot again. In the last 8 years since Russia took Crimea without firing a shot, the Ukrainian military (with western help) has rapidly strengthened and modernized. If Russia didn't act now, they assessed that it would be too late to act later. Hence, the stick.

When Russia says this will end when Ukraine's government steps down, their military scales down, and they pledged to stay neutral to NATO, they mean it. That is the outcome they will accept whether that means Ukraine agrees to it or not.

The only question is how much it will cost in fortune, blood, and isolation for them to achieve that outcome, and whether it will have been worth it.",1647206654.0,1647206389.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0jbsaz,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The fears of mass civilian causalities are begining to be realized. Mariupol is taking noncombat death in the thousands, and with the population starving those numbers will only go up. The idea that citizens of the free world are going to be able to watch this play out without demanding their governments take direct intervention seems impossible to me. There is no threat Putin can make that can terrify people more than the threat that they will now be the ones who learn that they stood by silently as the holocaust was carried out.

Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! People know full well what escalation with Russia means, they just don't care.

When Putin threatens Nuclear Annihilation because he isn't given free reign to impose his ambitions on his neighbors, the free world is obligated to respond ""No"". There is no action NATO or the EU can take that can force Putin to retaliate with Nukes if he was already unwilling to end the world in nuclear holocaust. There is also no action NATO or the EU can take that can prevent Putin from launching if he is already willing to end the world in nuclear holocaust.

Part of what makes it a little difficult to separate the signal from the noise, is that what constitutes ""captured territory"" in this current circumstance is WEIRD and amusingly more reminiscent of capture-points from an RTS.

Namely, imagine a tiny nameless town somewhere. Russia sends over a couple armored personnel carriers, a supply truck, and like 30 guys. Cool, they've captured it. They aren't going to KEEP it with such a tiny force, even an approximately equal counter-force with some artillery or drone support will kick them out.

So this is why you have some places going back and forth seemingly by the hour.

Overall, Russia is GRINDINGLY advancing, but just because they are making progress doesn't really mean they are being successful, somewhat counterintuitively. Take the mythical 40 km convoy. It took it like a week to advance a couple miles while suffering constant losses of equipment and manpower. Is that progress? Yeah. Is that successful progress? Most people would argue no. The cost/benefit of what it took to move such a short distance was not worth it relative to the potential for that material to have done literally anything else anywhere else.

Russia's got quite a few ticking clocks for a variety of Bad Things (like all those debts that they've technically already defaulted on, but only are TRULY considered to have defaulted on once their 30 day payment period expires in a couple weeks).

Right now the only sane and sensible goal for Russia is to take enough of Ukraine that they either force the legitimate government to surrender, or they have their puppet government surrender. Specifically in a ""We surrender and acknowledge that Russia's rational for the events of the last month was justified."" style, in order to TECHNICALLY cut out the legal justification behind the sanctions imposed against them.

It's not a GOOD plan, but it's what they've got.

So basically, Russia IS advancing, but they are doing it so slowly that short of some unexpected major military success, there's no way they will be able to accomplish that goal before their currency and economy is so trashed that the people working the trains and warehouses for supplying the front just stop showing up to work.",False,1647196626.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0ipkzn,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

&#x200B;

Putin and Russia drastically underestimated the level of response they would get.    While he planned a financial ""fortress"" for Russia that made his country ""sanction proof"", his entire ""fortress"" was based on the perception that our response would be similar or slightly greater than what we did in response to their actions in Crimea.

&#x200B;

  
Instead, the West engaged in the equivalent of financial nuclear war with Russia...who is not, *at all*, a ""financial nuclear power.""   I can't understate how non-hyperbolic that statement is, though it may seem that way.  


  
The West's response to this has kind of been in many ways unprecedented.   It's not that we're taking steps we haven't done before; we have supplied weapons to countries defending from aggressors and leveled sanctions against aggressors for decades.  It's that we are doing these traditionally unescalatory actions *in extremis.*   Russia's economy has been painfully ripped from the global system in a way that all but guarantees a default, and we're supplying an order of magnitude more weapons to Ukraine than we ever have to a defender. *(it's hilarious in videos because almost every Ukrainian soldier has some kind of anti-armor weapon slung around their back)*   

&#x200B;

Russia did not expect *anything like this*.  They did not prepare for a level of resistance from the West *or* Ukraine of this magnitude.

&#x200B;

We may not be directly intervening, but that's no reason to feel impotent.    On the contrary; you wouldn't be wrong for feeling in awe at realizing that after decades of squabbling with each other and dicking around in the Middle East, the West finally remembered who it really was.   The West has put Russia in a position where it cannot possibly win in the long term; where their entire country might collapse without the West so much as firing a single missile at them.

Maintaining altitude is much easier than gaining altitude and stretching a coast is easier than that.  A small electric propellor could glide assist to Kyiv.  A quadrotor drone's software is more complex than what you need for glider controls.  You could use three three toy drones and some string as pitch, yaw, and roll control for a much larger glider (though that is not optimal)

A variety of companies have researched drone delivery, most famously Amazon. The technology works fine.  We don't see it because of airspace restrictions.  Rwanda does all of their blood supply flying drone.

They've lost so many troops and pieces of equipment that at this rate in the coming days or weeks they'll either be forced to send reinforcements from their reserves or halt the offensives in some areas. This estimate is based on the war continuing to go down the same path, its possible that both Russia or Ukraine manage to pull off stunning victories but either those would conjecture at this point with the information that's publicly available. The bottom line is that while Russia is gaining ground they have lost a lot of troops estimates are  20-24 thousand are either killed, or injured. That's not including how many have surrendered or fled their posts. On top of this hundreds of vehicles, and dozens of aircraft have been lost as well and when you are attacking heavily defended positions like in cities you need at least a 3:1 but should have 5:1 ratio to the defenders. Basically if Ukraine and draw this out and keep their supply lines open they'll eventually win the war as Russia can't sustain these losses for a long time especially with their economy getting destroyed.

In my opinion, I don't think it's possible for Russia to win the war at this point.

I think it's incredibly important to understand Ukraine has embraced the Cossack identity.

I can't speak to the Russian attitude on their cultural Cossack identity but Ukraine has put that identity into it's national anthem, for example.

That's pretty prominent.

However you slice the hegemony of the area, the Cossacks have been the unique cultural identity to develop. And they have exerted an autonomy since the ebb of the Golden Horde. Officially recognized at times.

All of the Slavic nations share culture.

As so many of the Latin nations share culture.

Claim? 

Russia is not doing any of this based on cultural love and appreciation.

The defining characteristics of their suzerainty has been exploitation and subjugation. Death. That is THE reason Ukrainian resistance is so united and fierce. They know the nature of Russian rule.

The Russian separatists? Either outright oligarchists or simply indoctrinated. Economic opportunity for wannabe warlords. Seeing the emerging embrace of the oligarch system in the States, it's simply about getting one's own super yacht.

The Venice Commission declared that the referendum was illegal under both Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions, and violated international standards and norms.[94] The Venice Commission stressed that self-determination was to be understood primarily as internal self-determination within the framework of the existing borders and not as external self-determination through secession. Moreover, the Venice Commission opined, any referendum on the status of a territory should have been preceded by serious negotiations among all stakeholders, and that such negotiations did not take place.

In any case, Putin's methods align with many of Dugin's; whether that's coincidental or by design is almost irrelevant. While it may be influential to the ""West,"" it oddly inconsistent to claim it's influential to western right-wing extremist groups despite simultaneously noting its difficulty in finding a translation. It kind of speaks to the fact that it would have greater influence within Russia.

Of course it would also be in the interest of Russia, mind you, to downplay the connections,muddy the waters, and gaslight in this instance. Besides, in such a vacuum, Putin's influences must inevitably come from somewhere—so far nobody or group is mentioned who more closely reflects the beliefs and actions of Putin at this moment; and Putin's own essay simply provides *more* correlation.

>This attitude also has profound roots in Russian history, especially the Russian belief that Orthodox Christianity is superior to the West’s liberalized Christianity, which Putin and other conservative Russians view as corrupted by Enlightenment ideas. In the early 19th century, the Russian answer to the French Revolution’s Enlightenment creed, “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité (Freedom, Equality, Fraternity), was “Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality”—which Sergey Uvarov, minister of public education to Tzar Nicholas I, formulated as the conceptual foundation of the Russian Empire. This tripartite credo isn’t mentioned in Putin’s speeches and writings—he still likes to pretend Russia is a democracy—but it has been invoked by the far-right thinkers said to influence Putin, including Aleksandr Dugin, Lev Gumilev, Ivan Ilyin, Konstantin Leontiev, Sergei Petrovich Trubetskoy, and others dating back 200 years.

Those travelling to the Americas would go (wicky wicky wild) west.

It started in the 15th century, across Europe but mostly in Britain. The Brits set definitions for: the Near East (Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania...) Which was basically the boundaries of the Ottoman empire. The Middle East, which is the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, Iran, Iraq etc. And then the Far East, which includes East and Southeast Asia.

Russias boundaries fulfill several of the old categories, covering areas mostly in near and far east depending on the old maps you look at. Most maps lump it in with Eastern or Northern Europe, due to the location of Russia's primary population centres. 

Obviously definitions have changed a lot since then. The modern versions you could say were around the end of WWII but it's a shifting definition as now would include the likes of Japan which certainly wasn't a western aligned country in WWII.

I’d also add that Ukraine is unlikely to except a compromise, Russia has broken treaty after treaty and intel is saying that Russians want a compromise so they can regroup and attack again, meaning the odds of Putin getting a war goal is small because it’s better for ukraine to keep going as time is against the russians",False,1647205118.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0jafhy,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Russia had prided itself for decades on the power of its military and still defined itself by its defeat of Napoleon back in 1812, but the Crimean war brutally exposed how out-of-date Russian tactics, structures and equipment were. 

Smashed by a coalition of western powers, and technologically humiliated by Britain and France, the peace treaty in 1856 forced Russia to withdraw navally from the Black Sea (a crushing blow given that Crimea's strategic importance to Russia was as the empire's primary naval base) and removed its ability to project power in what is now Moldova, Romania and Serbia. In the wake of the defeat, the new tsar scrambled to modernise by ending serfdom and reforming the military. The future of Russian America also made it onto the agenda: it was expensive relative to its resource wealth, the distances and terrain involved made it difficult to administer, and the fact was that if the British opened up a theatre there in a future war, Russia would be completely unable to defend it.

Russia has asked China for military ​equipment to ​support its invasion of Ukraine, ​sparking concern in ​the White House that Beijing ​may undermine western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country.

US officials told the Financial Times that Russia had requested military equipment and other assistance since the start of the invasion. They declined to give details about what materiel Russia had requested.

Another person familiar with the situation said the US was preparing to warn allies about the situation amid some indications that China may be preparing to help Russia. Other US officials have also said there were signs that Russia was running out of some kinds of weaponry as the war in Ukraine approaches the start of its third week.

The White House did not comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for a comment.

The revelation comes as Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, heads to Rome for talks on Monday with Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official. People familiar with the situation said Sullivan would sternly warn China that any efforts to help Russia prosecute the invasion or avoid western sanctions would have consequences.

Before leaving Washington on Sunday, Sullivan warned China not to try to “bail out” Russia by helping Moscow to circumvent the sanctions that the US and its allies have imposed on Putin and his regime.

‘A serious failure’: scale of Russia’s military blunders becomes clear

“We will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses,” Sullivan told NBC television on Sunday. “In terms of the specific means of doing that, again, I’m not going to lay all of that out in public, but we will communicate that privately to China, as we have already done and will continue to do.”

The request for equipment and other kinds of unspecified military assistance comes as the Russian military struggles to make as much progress in Ukraine as western intelligence believe they expected.

It also raises fresh questions about the China-Russia relationship, which has grown increasingly strong as both countries express their opposition to the US over everything from Nato to sanctions.

China has portrayed itself as a neutral actor in the Ukraine crisis and has refused to condemn Russia for invading the country. The US has also seen no sign that Chinese president Xi Jinping is willing to put any pressure on Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart.

The two leaders signed a joint statement in Beijing last month describing the Beijing-Moscow partnership as having “no limits”, in another sign that the two capitals were drawing even closer together.",False,1647201132.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0j1qzx,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Putin’s departure from China’s support will most likely end the war, or at least not dare to escalate the war.

There was one instance back in 2005, recounted about 10 years later, when I knew that Putin was a purely evil megalomaniac. Now, I am not a big football fan, but I have a healthy respect for what Kraft has done with the Patriots...despite the cheating rumors, etc...they have had a good system there for 20 years.

Kraft was in Russia for some reason and a friend told him to show Putin the ring. Putin asked to see it, put it on, said 'I can kill someone with this' and walked off, security closing ranks behind him.

The White House told Kraft basically to let it go...it was not worth it, and Kraft decided to make a 'gift' of it to the Russian people.

It might seem inconsistent, but the weird Dugin fanboys I’m talking about also probably haven’t read that much of the guy’s writings. The world of niche internet extremism is less about actual in-depth reading and more about cobbling together bits and pieces of whatever seems appealing. Steve Bannon has said he’s a fan of Julius Evola despite the fact that the American right-wing seemingly *wouldn’t* enjoy an esoteric Hinduism-obsessed fanatic who wrote about sex magic and alchemy, but that hasn’t stopped them. 


They know Evola was a fascist and something called a “Traditionalist,” so maybe he’ll work in a conservative sense, they suppose. And they know it seems to bother people they dislike, and that’s all they need. Going back even further than that, Nietzsche has been consistently lionized by some on the right-wing despite vocally hating anti-Semites and nationalists, *especially* German ones. It seems like it doesn’t make sense because *it isn’t supposed to*, it’s just a collage of things they like and things their enemies dislike.


> This tripartite credo isn’t mentioned in Putin’s speeches and writings—he still likes to pretend Russia is a democracy—but it has been invoked by the far-right thinkers said to influence Putin, including Aleksandr Dugin, Lev Gumilev, Ivan Ilyin, Konstantin Leontiev, Sergei Petrovich Trubetskoy, and others dating back 200 years.


Which kind of circles back to my saying Dugin actually doesn’t seem terribly creative. He’s taken very long-running themes present in Russian nationalist thought for centuries and dressed them up in bizarre modern esoteric trappings. He’s a *part* of that political discourse, but he isn’t really a vital part, given that some of what he’s said has been completely contradictory to what’s happened.

Russia has also asked China for additional economic assistance, to help counteract the battering its economy has taken from broad sanctions imposed by the United States and European and Asian nations, according to an official.

American officials, determined to keep secret their means of collecting the intelligence on Russia’s requests, declined to describe further the kind of military equipment Moscow is seeking. The officials also declined to discuss any reaction by China to the requests.

President Xi Jinping of China has strengthened a partnership with Mr. Putin and has stood by him as Russia has stepped up its military campaign, destroying cities in Ukraine and killing hundreds or thousands of civilians. American officials are watching China closely to see whether it will act on any requests of aid from Russia. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, is scheduled to meet on Monday in Rome with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Politburo and director of the party’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission.

Mr. Sullivan intends to warn Mr. Yang about any future Chinese efforts to bolster Russia in its war or undercut Ukraine, the United States and their partners.",False,1647212293.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0jjlf5,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

NATO military plans for a WW3 ;conventional *or* nuclear; were centred in and around a Theatre Europe. Basically the plan was to put Europe back in the Middle Ages while saving Russian and American soil. 
Anyway, that was then and this is now. This war will drag on for years if something isn’t resolved soon. This has changed Europe, the UK and Eire forever, in ways we won’t see yet. This is nothing like Crimea or the Donbas region. It’s a full scale military invasion by Land, Air and Sea.

#The concept goes like this:

There’s a limited number of steps (basically 5) humanity can take towards full scale nuclear war. Once you take a step, it’s impossible go back. The cats out of the bag, so to speak.

—The Manhattan Project was step 1. You can’t go back and uninvent the A-bomb. Nukes are with us forever.

—Hiroshima and Nagasaki were step 2. Nukes are now viable, war-winning weapons. If a country wants a hope of winning a war with a major power, they need nukes.


—The Cold War was step 3. Every country with global ambitions stockpiled nukes and improved delivery systems: MAD is discovered as the final, catastrophic stage of nuclear war.

>>EVERYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT IS HYPOTHETICAL — but make no mistake, over the past 70 years, the brightest minds and institutions on our planet have gone over and over these scenarios.

—Limited Nuclear Exchange is step 4. Humanity came very close to this during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A limited exchange would be undertaken to accomplish discrete military objectives - regardless of the outcome, it’s likely that both foes will be left standing at the end, and that they’ll retain some or most of their nuclear weapons capacity.

>>PAUSE here to note that, once we hit step 4, we CANNOT GO BACK. To avoid MAD, the only option is to: 

>>DO NOTHING, meaning nobody fires nukes ever, ever again. How likely is this? We have two nuclear powers who just exchanged nuclear blows. Chances are, they’ll strike again — maybe within seconds of the initial exchange. After all, they’re still at war, they’ve both proven they’re ready to use nukes, and nobody has won yet. But even if they magically don’t strike again, the Cat. Is. Out. Of. The. Bag. You can’t uninvent nukes. Somebody else will build more. And eventually, we’ll run into another crisis, and that’s when we move to…

—Step 5: Unlimited Nuclear Exchange. That’s MAD, that’s doomsday, all the stops are pulled and humanity obliterates most of itself in nuclear hellfire. The survivors will lead lives of radiation-poisoned abject misery. Human civilization will be forever changed.


>>Now zoom back in. Look at Ukraine. Weigh the stakes there vs the stakes of engaging a nuclear power in direct conflict and moving humanity to step 4. Is it worth it?

>>Mathematically, the answer is a resounding NO.",1647200969.0,1647200452.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0ipwl7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Personally, history is extraordinarily important but not in the same way other scientific endeavours are. Chemistry gives predictive power, but historical theory does not. What it offers instead is explanatory power and so histories can be judged by their explanatory utility. Essentially - does this historical theory help me ignore all of the non-essential elements and does it give me some insight into the behaviour of key actors (whether people, corporations, nations, etc)? However, it does not offer any predictive utility.

Well, put it this way as an absurd consequences example. If no one saw Hitler coming, then that suggests that historical studies are not capable of predicting major future events.

On the other hand, if people saw Hitler coming (because it was historically inevitable due to something about that particular region's history), then why was it not stopped. Was it because UK history means they could never prevent a criminal dictatorship? 

As for the tweet author. It's absolutely nothing disrespectful. I'm sure he is excellent at:

>His main focus of interest is the identity politics in post-Soviet Russia, the ethnification of Russian nationalism and the crackdown on the ethnic republics. Galeev completed a Master’s in Economics and Management at Peking University China and then an MLitt in History at St Andrews, the UK. He is an activist of political opposition, briefly incarcerated for participation in the 2020 protests.

And clearly is a modern hero. However, this is not the field of study required to make such sweeping statements. I don't even think anyone could do so.

Adding to that was the Marshal Aid plan (drawing on lessons from the Versailles treaty) plus alterations to Germany's constitution plus a long period of economic expansion all made a Nazisque ""stab in the back woe is us"" mythos a very hard sell. 

Add to that the fact that Germany had to come to terms with the holocaust  and yeah, I think the two time periods were very different.

Also, Poland was about to send planes to the Ramstein U.S. airbase.  Before the U.S. retracted its previous statement and nixed the deal.

There's a lot of stuff missing with this description of what happened. The countries had the green light to *directly* give the planes to Ukraine however Poland surprised the US with the public announcement they were sending them to the airbase. The US said that was too convoluted and Germany whose land the airbase is on also said no. I think it's possible something could have happened however *both times* someone in Poland went to the press about it which is unfortunate. Given how public the whole thing ended up being, the Pentagon weighed the pros and cons and determined that the planes would not change things significantly enough for Ukraine in order to justify a potential escalation. Which is unfortunate and I also disagreed at first but once more complete explanations were released and information about anti aircraft weapons that are being sent instead was shared publicly, I changed my mind and saw their perspective.

But for the grace of god - it could've been us (and it was us 70 years ago).

Does the fact that probably 10s of thousands of civilians died or will die? Absolutely. But here's the thing - they will die anyway if Russia annexes Ukraine, same as they did 70 years ago, same as they did 50 years ago etc. If Ukraine surrenders, the West won't step up to stop Russia from ""cleansing"" Ukraine, destroying livelihoods, plundering, raping, murdering etc. UN is virtually a worthless organisation at this point.

>Now imagine that but with modern tech against an amphibious assault. Boats are... not fast. Missiles... are.

Yep..noone really knows if an amphibious assault is possible against numerous, well equipped defenders in the modern era.

Honestly, after seeing the extent to which portable missile systems have dominated this war, I'm not sure it is. 

Drone surveillance, javelins and stingers and antiship missiles are going to make it extremely hard to land and supply an invading force. Javelins are going to carve through landing craft like tissue paper, anywhere inside a kilometre from the shore, and at longer ranges Taiwan has both a large number of foreign purchased Harpoons and mass produces its own antiship missiles with a range spanning the entire 180km of the sea between China and Taiwan. Given those missiles take around 5-10 minutes to hit anywhere in the taiwan straits during the 3-4 hours it takes most ships to cross, and given any smaller craft that somehow runs that gauntlet and gets within visual range of the shore is going to be easy meat for one soldier with a javelin the maths are overwhelmingly in favour of the defenders.

The answer for an attacker has to be air power, but we've also seen how quickly close air support gets cooked by stingers (of which Taiwan have several thousand) and  Taiwan also has quality high altitude anti aircraft systems.
 
Put those things together and even if China's troops are better trained and motivated than their russian buddies in the axis of incompetent evil, they are going to face a similar logistical challenge- if they successfully land a surprise force, how on earth do you keep them supplied when Taiwan has about ten times the number of antiship missiles it would need to sink every PLAN surface ship?

I think a lot of military planners are going to be going back to the drawing board after this war. Until this invasion we've never really seen how much of an advantage a well trained a modern military has when defending in the age of drones and portable AT and AA missiles.",False,1647210620.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0jb5nv,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

There are many more important factors.

The way he's (Putin) manufactured the war and the narrative has many similarities but I don't think there would be many that wouldn't agree.

Just to nitpick one example; the fall of Tsarist Russia had FAR more to do with the domestic situation than anything else. AND if you were to pick a war that had an impact on the collapse; World War 1 was far more impactful.

But point is - drawing conclusions from parallels in the small wars is a classic case of correlation does not mean causation. But even more so because the wars aren't THAT similar when you get into the details.

This threat was made because of nearly all of the countries not meeting their military goal.  At the time it was said we aren't here to be world police, you guys have to do your part too.  He felt, and many Americans felt this way to, that Europe wasn't doing enough to defend Europe that they were leaving it up to the United States.  

Please keep in mind that as per the NATO agreement you're supposed to be spending 2% of your countries GDP on the military.  Off hand I believe it was only 2 European countries were meeting that goal and you have countries like Germany that were sitting at barely 1%. 

Shortly after the threat was made, many of the countries that were lagging agreed to increase their funding and meet their actual goals.

> Refuse to sell weapons to Ukraine

It should be pointed out that Crimea was taken when Obama was in office.  It has been noted several times that Obama refused to sell Ukraine better weapons as he felt it would ""cause Russia to escalate conflict.""

There is no source out there that that I could find that Trump refused to sell weapons to Ukraine.  In fact in 2017 Trump sold them 210 Javelin missiles and 37 launchers.

> Hold Ukranian funds hostage unless Ukraine would fabricate evidence against Joe Biden

$400million was withheld from Ukraine for 55 days.  There are a myriad of reasons given as to why it was withheld ranging from Quid Pro Quo (Hunter Biden Issues), Europe needs to do more for Ukraine and of course there was corruption in Ukraine.

The issue at hand is that he shouldn't have withheld the aid at all.  However, to the point we are talking about right now.  Wouldn't that have been a perfect time to attack Ukraine?  When you know $400 million in aid isn't coming in.

So that gets to the heart of the matter.  Why didn't Putin attack when he supposedly had a president who was in his pocket in charge vs. one who he knew he didn't have in his pocket.",False,1647194866.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0ib7tk,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia and China have both had ambitions of superpowers, but their ridiculously outdated and destructive social policies undermine their advancement.

The UK did not complete a weapons test until the 50s and France's nuclear deterrent was explicitly about protecting themselves in the event of an invasion of France should the US refuse to use its own nuclear weapons. NATO was not believed to be capable of stopping a Soviet invasion of Western Europe using conventional weapons, as the West had demobilized while the Soviet army simply did not. Both France and UK developed their nuclear weapons out of fear that the Americans would either not use their nukes in the event of a war or would attack targets that wouldn't protect them.

Again, NATO was developed as the formalization of the US nuclear umbrella. That was the point. Everyone in it is under American protection and is inherently a junior partner in the alliance.

Edit: I replied before you edited it - but the US did not station very many troops in Western Europe. Not enough to turn the tide in the event of a full-on invasion by the Soviet Union. By the time we mobilized, the war would have been over if we were solely trying to win a conventional war. We did station nuclear weapons in airbases that were capable of striking Soviet targets prior to ICBMs and SLBMs - this was the US ""nuclear sharing"" program. The intent was that we would use nuclear weapons if the Soviet Union invaded to protect NATO members, and that was made explicitly clear - it was called the doctrine of massive retaliation.",1647192331.0,1647191074.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0icz4d,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

NATO has no military spending goal. The oft-cited ""2% of GDP"" was a self-imposed benchmark that NATO countries agreed to _try_ and meet _by 2024_. The only NATO-required participation comes when one member nation invokes Article 5. The North Atlantic Council (NATO's governing body) voted in 2006 to make that 2% of GDP an official NATO goal - but it is in no way a condition on NATO membership. 

That Trump used it to sow division within NATO just served Putin's interests in facilitating a more divided West. 

>It should be pointed out that Crimea was taken when Obama was in office. It has been noted several times that Obama refused to sell Ukraine better weapons as he felt it would ""cause Russia to escalate conflict.""

The Obama Admin did not prevent the private sale of weapons to Ukraine. [Nearly $100m worth of arms sales were approved by Obama's State Department in 2015 and 2016](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/lethal-weapons-to-ukraine-a-primer/). 

>So that gets to the heart of the matter. Why didn't Putin attack when he supposedly had a president who was in his pocket in charge vs. one who he knew he didn't have in his pocket.

There is no shortage of anecdotes from former Trump Admin officials (both during his tenue and afterward) who expressed the belief that Trump might leave NATO if he were reelected. Regardless of the truth of the idea, if Putin believed that the US would leave NATO then he would absolutely wait to see that come to fruition. Europe, without the US and heavily reliant on Russian oil to survive, would not dare respond aggressively to Russian action in Ukraine. 

Keep in mind, Russia did not expect the US to use intelligence to run circles around Russian disinformation campaigns. They expected this to be another Crimea invasion, leveraging conflict in the East to undermine Zelensky and topple his government without open war coming to Kyiv.

This is 100% incorrect.  This is taken directly from their website.

> In 2006, NATO Defence Ministers agreed to commit a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defence spending to continue to ensure the Alliance’s military readiness.

> While the 2% of GDP guideline alone is no guarantee that money will be spent in the most effective and efficient way to acquire and deploy modern capabilities, it remains, nonetheless, an important indicator of the political resolve of individual Allies to devote to defence a relatively small but still significant level of resources. In 2014, three Allies spent 2% of GDP or more on defence; this went up to 11 Allies in 2020 and a majority of Allies have national plans in place to meet this target by 2024.

poster War_WarNeverChanges stated that we are in unprecedented historical territory and that a no-fly zone would result in a shooting war between russia and the us, which would lead to a nuclear conflict. 

you then responded that they were wrong, because actually we are in precedented historical territory. we nearly lost in korea but did not deploy nuclear weapons.

after you jerked off a bit about how you know more about history than other people in this thread, i pointed out that most military experts think a nfz leads to war.

you have now claimed that in fact, you weren't talking about a no-fly zone. you rebutted that one specific claim for no particular reason, a mere historical curiosity. and that i am the idiot for not understanding that you actually are just some guy who goes around dropping historical tidbits for no reason in random threads, like some sort of History Fairy, without caring at all about the actual context or conversation.",False,1647199106.0,t3_td9dbl,t1_i0iwqvl,,2,0,0,0,0,0,
