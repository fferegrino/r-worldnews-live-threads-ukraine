Day 237 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with a missile strike, and they fired a lot of them too. They launched 8 S-300 missiles in the direction of Kharkiv at 8:25am. Some missiles were intercepted, but about 6 of them did make it through and hit a humanitarian aid warehouse. It had no military value, just some food, but they destroyed it anyway, because terrorizing civilians is all they know how to do.

Russians in their telegram channels are very happy when they are firing missiles at Kharkiv, but then they complain when missiles fly in their direction. Unlike their missile strikes, ours are actually aimed at military targets, which is why our response this time was to destroy their ammo depot somewhere in Belgorod oblast, it happened at around 10:30pm today. The fact that now we finally started responding to Russian missile strikes from Belgorod by bombing their military infrastructure feels amazing.

And now Russians are in a “no panic” mode in Kherson, which is definitely great to see. Last time when they had no panic they lost almost the entire Kharkiv oblast in a single week. Now we have to wait and see what will happen next, because Russians are already saying that battle for Kherson is imminent. There are probably a lot of things happening right now that we don’t about yet, because of the media blackout in Kherson from our side, and also because Russian propaganda channels have been warned not to post about their military’s movements/losses, so now there’s basically no info from any side.",False,1666140615.0,t3_y6w90v,t3_y6w90v,,0,151,0,151,0,0,

Bakhmut, is under attack by russian forces! Oh, realllly! It's been like this for months, back and forth, back and forth and the area now looks like the WWI trenches, not a tree left standing or a blade of grass in sight.

The new classic is a two parter, russia is evacuating civilians from Kherson because they are going to blow the dam! Yeah, they are evacuating civilians, russian civilians that is. 

I'm almost positive the banks of the Dnipro will protect Kherson's right bank and most of the left bank area is low lying swamp which might flood east of the M14/P57 area but that would be short term and there isn't too much that would be affected.

Only at the Al-Nasiriyya power distribution substation did the graphite munition cause a fire that disabled the substation for a month. All other substations were back up in just hours or days.

Thinking further in the grand scheme of things Russia is just a small fish in that market.

dc21335f4535c26e72d2fdeace23ed51,y6w90v,istwp7y,"I know. I know. Nuclear fear mongering and all that nonsense. 

But this has been buzzing around in the back of my head, and I'm only seeing increasingly concerning signs that Belarus will soon reopen the Kyiv front with the help of roughly thirty-thousand Russian conscripts. I worry that Lukashanko is about to deploy his security retinue. 

Why should we give a shit about this? Russian conscripts and the so-called Belarusian regulars will simply lead to a worse outcome than the Battle of Kyiv. After all, now the roads are mined and the bridges fitted with explosive charges. Defenses are in place. The Ukrainian army is bigger, better equipped, and better trained than they were eight months ago. The civilians are even more determined (and probably still have a healthy store of molotovs, if they didn't drink them all in celebration). 

As delusional as Putin has become, he has to understand that a second assault on Kyiv would mean suicide. So we need to look at the surrounding factors. 

1. Putin blew up the Nordstream pipeline to 'burn the boats' and stabilize the domestic situation. Taken alone this isn't concerning--it's just a sign of RF instability. 

2. Russia is building up forces in Belarus. Something is going to happen there, regardless of whether it's well thought out. You don't stick several-thousand Russian servicemen on an inactive front to guard against 'NATO aggression' and then leave the Finnish border unguarded. 

3. [Lukashenko's government is recalling servicemen from retirement to bolster the existing armed forces.](https://twitter.com/Faytuks/status/1582411482004066304)

4. Lukashenko is laying the ground work for mass mobilization. He's been doing this for most of the year. 

5. Putin is holding nuclear drills. This could be chest beating, or it could be preparation for something more serious. Again, the only person who can say for certain is Putin himself. 

6. [Putin appears relaxed for the first time in several, several months. Now either he's discovered the joys of cannabis, or he believes he's got an ace up his sleeve.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ_WCy6gXU8)

7. Over the course of this war Putin has responded to every challenge / setback with escalation. The long-term pattern of behavior is obvious. 

8. Putin's propaganda (not to mention official statements) are attempting to normalize the deployment of nuclear weapons. 

9. Russian southern  logistics are now in a full state of collapse after the crippling of the Kerch bridge. Any support they still have must flow through Melitipol, which is the obvious next place the Ukrainians will strike. 

10. Over the last week Putin has launched several missile attacks on Kyiv. These attacks waste precious guided munitions, but while they serve to firm up the support of the hawks, they lack military utility. The nominal goal is to cripple the civilian infrastructure. But what if that's a secondary objective? These attacks also shed light on Kyiv's current aerial defense capabilities. 

11. [NATO apparently felt the inexplicable compulsion to make this statement.](https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-nuclear-strike-would-almost-certainly-draw-physical-response-nato-2022-10-12/)

I know a few things for certain. 

* Something is going to happen in Belarus soon. 

* A repeat of initial assault on Kyiv would be a failure, and all parties involved understand that fact; this means something will be different. 

* Russian forces are on a path of inexorable decline. 

* The domestic situation in Russia is worsening for Putin's regime. 

* The only weapon available to Putin to radically change the situation are weapons of mass destruction. 

Given the above, I believe the best move for Putin is to attempt decapitation. The sudden deployment of a nuclear device in (or around) Kyiv could generate enough confusion to allow the joint Belarusian and Russian conscripts to seize the city. Putin may believe that if he can seize Kyiv in matter of days (if not hours) and force surrender then the West will not have time (nor stomach) to respond. He's hoping the West won't risk their own necks to salvage a government that has already capitulated.",False,1666115521.0,t3_y6w90v,t3_y6w90v,,0,-34,0,-34,0,0,

What he did: He founded a cybersecurity e.V. (eingetragener Verein, something like an official club with certain benefits according to German law) together with another guy, Hans-Wilhelm Dünn. And Mr. Dünn was for example in russia as an election spectator following an invitation of russian duma and signed a cooperation agreement with a russian version of a cybersecurity e.V. in 2019.

Schönbohm is still somehow involved in this club (held a speech for the 10 year anniversary, which was approved of by the corresponding German ministry he is subordinated to in his official function as chief.

A TV segment now picked up on this and published a piece on it, which led to him being sacked (for now).

There are active investigations in a possible involvement of Schönbohm with russian contacts, but we will not be getting any info anytime soon I guess. The relevant counter-espionage departments are not known for sharing a lot of news.

Andrey Medvedev Surovikin just said:  “Further actions with regard to Kherson will depend on the emerging military-tactical situation, it is not an easy one, and difficult decisions cannot be ruled out .”  It is clear that many expected something else from him. After a week of attacks on the infrastructure, I think many people thought they would hear something in the style of: wow, we are now bang, so bang.    


But hatred never helped anyone. And the unpleasant truth is always stronger and more important than the most beautiful lie, wrapped even in the wrapper of a report, even a presentation.  In war, yes, difficult decisions are often made. This is clear. But please, accept them so that we all know for sure that this is not in vain. Do it in a way that really saves people.    


However, I would like to draw your attention to this. We finally learn about highly complex solutions before they are implemented. We learn about difficult decisions publicly, from the commander of the NWO . This is a fundamentally new approach, very different from the one we were used to.  I wrote before: do not rejoice in the days of small victories, and do not despair in the days of defeats .   


Here, however, there is no defeat. Surovikin said clearly, difficult decisions, difficult situation. And what is interesting is that the world did not collapse, the country did not fall apart, no one began to convulse at the TV. Yes, it did not add joy, but nothing, we will be angrier, and the situation with us will still be for a long time.  We have a lot ahead of us, our common path goes through trials and hardships.   


We walk through the darkness into the light. But at least we now understand that we are all going together. We talk to each other and hear each other.  And most importantly, we realize that the truth only makes us stronger. If you are not afraid of her. As you know, God is not in power, but in truth.

I wrote several months ago that if the Russians are pushed out of the city they will absolutely blow up the dam. 

Whenever you are looking at Russian military actions you will note that they always choose the most sadistic course of action. 

It is part of the Russian military culture where higher ranks dominate lower ranks. This sadism gets projected outwards also in their military planning. 

If you look at their actions in Mariupol they specifically targeted civilian shelters in order to demoralize the civilians.

If they loose that city in their way of thinking they must create a sadistic response in order to show the rest of Ukraine that they will be punished for fighting back. 

In other words there is no scenario where the Russians loose the city where they can allow themselves to not blow up the dam.

Russian forces loosing the city would be a big psychological boost for the Ukrainians thus the Russians would need to negate that by creating a big psychological loss. 

Blowing up the dam would help them hide the mass murders they have likely already committed in the city and would hinder Ukrainians from crossing in a follow on attack.",False,1666118476.0,t3_y6w90v,t1_isu1t89,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

But I know music fairly well and this article connects a lot of puzzle pieces for me about the musics of Russia and Eastern Europe.

The overlapping and intertwined histories and cultures of the region explain many of the similarities to be found. Russian influence on the art music of Eastern Europe is pronounced and clear even without significant study. But what this article helped me understand is the nature of the divergences between Russian music and the music in old Soviet bloc nations. It's impossible to discuss music of the last few centuries without exploring the moods and *affekts* present therein. And what stands out most to me in listening to musics from this region is that there is a fundamental lethargic sadness in Russian music that isn't always present in the musics of the Baltic states. I'm generalizing, of course, and there are certainly counterexamples.

The article mentions areas of Russia lacking in many comforts or even necessities. One illustrative example was a chair or chairs on the verge of collapse and, rather than undertake any effort to repair or replace them, a certain torpor pervades and the mental state of the people was one of a surrender to fate. This attitude is not missing from Russian music. At the risk of erecting a wall of text, I'll only point out that one of the hallmarks of Romantic era Russian music is a tendency toward repetition. Thematic development is often underexplored in favor of a cyclical compositional process. Some of this is due to the repetition inherent in the folk music that inspired and informed much Russian music, but it also creates a sonic torpor not dissimilar to the chairs rotting away whilst the world turns around them.

By way of counterpoint (pun intended), Estonian composer Arvo Pärt also makes extensive use of repetition, but does so in an additive way, layering textures and phrases in new ways to both create interest and build tension or excitement. The aforementioned torpor is not present, as his music charts a definitive course from beginning to end.

It's easy to cherry pick examples to make my point here, and it makes me want to write an article of my own that's a far better medium for expressing and exploring these ideas which are still percolating in my mind. Thank you all for your continued comments in these daily threads. I have learned a great deal from them and I look forward to learning more.

An injustice that sends Parisians out onto the streets won’t make a single resident of Novosibirsk scratch the back of their necks.

Huh. It's interesting how writers get things wrong. I'm thinking of Frank Herbert, in *Dune*, with his portrayal of the idea that suffering and oppression creates the greatest soldiers. The Sardaukar, from their prison planet, are considered to be the best soldiers, until they come up against the Fremen, who are from an even more brutal, unforgiving environment.

And yet the Russians, who are ""accustomed to suffering,"" who are tortured with *dedovshtshina* upon recruitment... aren't very good soldiers. They're **brutal** soldiers, yes, committing unspeakable crimes against the people they invade... but they're undisciplined, have no sense of tactics or strategy, and just generally seem unmotivated to win the war or even fight it.

These are the closest thing to Sardaukar and Fremen, in terms of upbringing, that we have in real life, and I can't help but wonder what Frank Herbert would say if he could observe how they actually perform in the field.",False,1666109875.0,t3_y6w90v,t1_ist73br,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

They will blow up the dam as soon as they have moved out the majority of their troops. 

There is no scenario where the Russian army is forced out of the city where they dont blow up the dam. Whenever you are assessing the Russian armed forces possible actions always go with what is the most sadistic course of action and you will predict them quite well. They always and consistently choose the most sadistic course of action as that is what the whole Russian army is built on. They sadistically haze the new recruits and this goes on in their officer academies as well thus their whole military decision making complex is built along sadism and being as sadistic as possible. That is the only way to rise up in the ranks.  

Blowing up the dam secures their west flank, covers up the mass killings they have likely already conducted inside the city and it creates a big psychological hit to the Ukrainian people thus negating the psychological boost the liberation of the city would entail. 

They will make it obvious they blew it up and everyone will know they blew it up and they will then accuse Ukraine of having blown up the bridge as part of their psychological warfare effort.

Russia has made Syria its client state, and filled it with Russian weapons and some soldiers and aircraft. Syria lies right on Israel’s border, and the two nations have been at low intensity war for many years. 

Syria had little ability to hit Israel right now. However, Syria acts as a transit for Iranian arms to flow to Iran’s proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Israel every so often attacks these shipments. 

Russia, who is close to Iran, can easily make life very difficult for Israel, simply by protecting or encouraging these arms shipments. Israel, while more powerful than its neighbours, is pretty tiny compared to Russia plus Iran. So Israel really does not want to add to its already long list of enemies by directly antagonizing Russia. 

However, this is changing, as Russia pulls out of Syria and is revealed to be a bit of a paper tiger. While still remaining wary of Russia, Israel is in fact supplying weapons to Ukraine - only doing so under the table a bit. For example, it came out last month that Israel was supplying anti-drone weapons to Ukraine via Poland.

 I think if UAF really wanted to they could attempt to blitz the city and take it, but not without taking many unnecessary casualties. Most of the supply lines into Kherson are damaged or destroyed and Russia has to expend a massive amount of effort just to keep its Kherson troops supplied. 

The theory that some experts have proposed is that Ukraine is keeping Russians pinned there while they focus on liberating other areas like Kharkiv because it’s a place to effectively trap a large portion of the Russian army so they can’t help out in other areas of the conflict.

To have a drone that is both fast enough and accurate enough to effectively intercept another drone is a pretty huge design problem. 

Adding complication is the asymmetrical costs associated with drones vs missiles or jets. If an AA missile shoots down an asset valued at tens of millions of dollars, it's fine if that missile costs $1 million. If it's intended to shoot down a Shahed-136, which reportedly costs about $20,000, suddenly that doesn't make sense.

These drone attacks are not going to cost Ukriane the war, not even close. Look at some history and you'll see how aerial attacks against civilian targets almost never win a war, in fact it just makes who you're attacking more committed to the fight most of the time. English cities were savaged by German attacks in world war 2 and it didn't matter much for the overall war effort. Hell even allied attacks on German cities which were much worse barely affected their war production long term, the Nazi's produced more in 1944 than any other year of the war.

If they start to run low on AA missiles they will stop targeting so many and have to let more through to make sure they can still keep Russian planes and helicopters out of the sky, a terrible decision to have to make but it's what they'll do.

And even if every single drone got through these attacks aren't even remotely close to that scale, like not even comparable. It might cause some electrical outages and make for a miserable winter, it will sadly kill even more innocent people, it will not materially affect the outcome of the war.

Russia is rich in natural resources to export, which props them up somewhat, but its industrial base doesn’t have the ability to produce things like semi-conductors, computer chips, ball bearings*, etc. When they are able to get that stuff at all, sanctions ensure that it is both more expensive and inferior quality. They’re forced to pay because their trade partners know they have them over a barrel. 

Ex: I’ve seen chatter that the chips Russia is buying from China right now have a 40% failure rate. Traditionally China’s best chips end up in Western markets and they keep the worst for their domestic market because they’re cheaper. Now they’ve got a willing customer with no other choice.

Those shortages affect weapons production, but also civilian industry. 

For example, they have a car manufacturing sector, but most of the components are produced elsewhere and Russian plants just import and assemble those pieces. Those pieces aren’t coming in any more.

>Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is near the frontline of the war in Ukraine and has been under the control of Russian forces since early March, although it has continued to be operated by its Ukrainian staff. Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree last week saying the plant was now Russian and run by a new Russian operating company. Ukraine has rejected the decree as illegal and ""null and void"".  
>Energoatom president Petro Kotin, also acting direct general at Zaporizhzhia, said staff were being pressured or forced into signing contracts to keep their jobs with ""the newly created fake 'Zaporizhzhia NPP' with a legal address in Moscow"" and he urged them ""not to be swayed by such offers"".  
>  Grossi was also asked whether he would boycott any move to force the plant’s employees to transfer to the newly created Russian operator. He said: ""I can neither boycott or play along, I have to do the right thing and the right thing in this case is first of all to look after the security, the safety and the well-being of the staff and, when it comes to the contractual changes that may be coming as a result of the announcement, that is something that I will have to be discussing in Russia in the next few days.  
>IAEA's Grossi said: ""Almost every day now, there is shelling in the region where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located and where the plant workers and their families live. The shelling must stop, immediately. It is already having an impact on the nuclear safety and security situation at the plant.

Like a wall around a prison. If you leave the fence there but remove all of the security guards the inmates will eventually get out. The purpose of the fence around the prison is to slow the inmate down enough so the guards can spot and catch them.

What matters ultimately is the integrity of the electrical grid.  When one part goes down, ordinarily power can be redistributed from other sources within the grid.  When you run out of ways to do that, you don't have a single system anymore, but multiple closed systems.  Losing your source in a closed system means the system stays down until it is repaired which means it's down much, much longer.  That's been Russia's goal in doing this.  

Ukraine has been targeting power stations in neighboring Russian territory, to show they can do the same thing, but there's so much of it it's kind of an undertaking to threaten to turn Belgorad or Kursk into closed systems.

Without that dam, which is holding back this large body of water, these very good reasons evaporate.  For want of a better word.    

Further, your argument that blowing the dam will flood Kherson and hide atrocity fails for a simple reason, called gravity. Water does not flow uphill.

If you look at this handy map posted down thread https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfXrGtqWAAYB_Cm?format=jpg&name=4096x4096 you'll see that Kherson city is already higher than the surface of the water held back by the dam.   So Kherson won't flood.

Only one nation can carry out such an attack, so it wouldn't really be covert. The problem with launching such an attack is:

1. Iran is a supplier of weapons to Russia, so if you bomb them then it means that countries supplying Ukraine are fair game for retaliation.
2. If Iran launched a drone at Raytheon and took out a manufacturing facility, we'd call that a terrorism, thus doing the same to Iran would be potentially viewed as such within Iran.
3. A direct attack on Iran would necessitate a firm response. What would their response be?
   1. Attack US assets around the Persian Gulf, in Iraq, in Syria, etc.
   2. Launch a missile strike on Saudi oil facilities causing oil prices to skyrocket, thus affecting US mid-term elections.
   3. Launch several dozen missiles at Israel population centers and nuclear facilities.
   4. All of the above.

A lack of leadership means no deployment of reserves. Minor punctures in the line then become massive holes as more forces pour through the gap.

Most significant, I believe, is that it was designed and built by general atomics.  The tank people.  Lockheed, Boeing, and the anyone else in the aircraft wing of the military industrial complex wants to sell expensive jets.  They want the planes to shoot expensive missiles.  

There is always tension between ground forces and air forces.  An air force likes to fight with other air forces.  An army on the ground is already fighting.  Infantry want to have planes overhead attacking the enemy soldiers that they are fighting.  A lingering plane that maintains fire on troops as they emerge is better.  Air Force pilots prefer to fly superfast, drop something, and fly away super fast.  

This dynamic conflict has existed for over 100 years.  It persists in multiple generations of aircraft.  There is always a trade off.  Any plane can be built slightly better for ground support or slightly better for air superiority.

It's a manifestly incorrect assumption that 'the people' overthrow dictators. It's the story we tell ourselves, but it's pertinently untrue.

The 'court' overthrows dictators. When key political forces like military, law enforcement, business interests, etc. feel like they will be better off with another dictator, they will 'allow' the people to storm the palace, sidestepping the risk of a direct confrontation with the dictator, and then step in during the chaos to grab control or side with another party that will allow the court to keep its power and influence.

The 'average' Russian is very much a victim in all of this. 

Sent to war, under the guise of patriotism, to grab resources, they themselves will never have access to. 

People may claim the Russian people are morally corrupt, but these people have  never known anything different than brutal ruling classes that show no hesitation to murder you to stay in power. That's what Russia has been like for.literally.centuries. 

I think it's wise to pause a second before we claim the moral high ground over the 'morally corrupt average russian that should just be overthrowing their militaristic dictator'. Because when push comes to shove, only desperate people will risk their own lives, and those of their families for some change(maybe).

Heck, if some dictator handed me a gun and told me at gunpoint to shoot a stranger, It'd be a toss up between not wanting to live in this shitty world or live with the regret of my actions.

Original Shahed 136 had thermo camera to help identify the target, 50kg warhead, simple INS and GPS navigation. Russia asked for some modifications for their batches - thermal camera was removed, GPS receiver was replaced with GLONASS, INS stayed the same but it's used only if nothing else is available. But the most notable change was adding a datalink, so the drone target can be updated via another drone. Those changes reduced the warhead size from 50kg to 30kg. However as you will take a closer look at the explosions - they look very like Hollywood style, because most of it's 140kg load of gasoline is still there. The HE warhead while exploding atomizes the fuel mixing it with air, creating a simple version of fuel-air explosive.

But I do agree. This conflict is indeed unique in his own right (like all the others) and that why I emphasized the importance of not neglecting the differences. When one does neglect the differences, you do get skewed comparisons like: ""vaccinations passports are like jew stars"" or ""that politician that I don't agree with about climate change policy whould stand trial at a tribunal!"" (indirectly making the comparison that they are war criminals and should be treated as such). 

The intent of the indiscriminate killing of civillians is hard to prove, but it is highly likely this is part of the psychological warfare. It's a hit or miss, because morale can be weakened or can be strengthened by bombings (in the latter case: Britain during WW2). But at the moment of writing there are also signals that the bombings are retaliation for the bridge that connects Russia and Crimea and the bombings in Belgorod - as stated by Putin and the shell part that said:""this one is for Belgorod"".

But [a pickup truck with a radar and actuators is a pretty good AAA and has precedent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M53/59_Praga)  That one has no AAA, just optical spotting, and was still effective--like most optically-guided SHORAD, if you feed it radar rangefinding or use a LRF, it's still *actually really effective*.

edit: while I think about it too I wanted to mention, the west didn't really abandon SPAAGs actually.  It's more that the US and the west rolled those abilities into existing platforms as fire control got better.

In the era of SPAAGs, often it was either radar (costly option) or LRF + optical (cheap option) 23-35mm.  Gepard, ZSU were radar, M163, M53/59 and earlier were optical.  Compare an 80s US formation if M247 had been built--a single radar-guided 40mm protecting some helpless Bradleys--versus a modern one--*all* the M2/M3s double as light anti-heli SPAAG, plus stingers are plentiful, so even if they're not as good one to one as a dedicated machine, they still have greater overall air defense capability against helicopters at close range, plus the same or more at far range due to accompanying Stingers.

This is part of why CV90s are so popular, because the stock version has truly excellent air defense ability and range.  I'd predict that the future will see the IFV and SPAAG fully merge into something with perhaps a rapid 40 or slower 50mm, a high quality FCS with autotrack & image processing, a smaller carrying compliment, and a mixed armament of like 1x-2x SAM + 1x-2x AT missile, and a remote + antidrone 7.62.",1666088330.0,1666085847.0,t3_y6w90v,t1_isryikg,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The policy hasn't changed, they hit anything and everything in Kharkiv for months when they were closer to the city. It's not new.

Obviously losing the top end of the command structure wouldn't help but you might be surprised how well the Ukranian's would continue to function.

The system is designed to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs; it has a range of up to 7 km (4. 3 mi), too close for the Iron Dome system to intercept projectiles effectively. In addition, the system could also intercept unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Manafort, of course, worked with Yanukovych, who was run out of Ukraine by the Euromaidan Revolution.

Yeah not like they send these same drone swarms into US bases that are littered all throughout the middle east or anything. Or just start sending troops to help Russia. Or just mass bomb any US allies in the region. I'm sure everyone in America is just raring to go back into wasting swathes on money in the middle east right? 

>Training personnel, building new facilities will take time and money. 

Do you think making new factories means finding a new plot of land and building it brick by brick? They will take already existing factories for similar stuff and adjust them. 

And no, training personnel for stuff that's basically rudimentary by modern standards does not take time. As for money, it'll take some but they also have a pretty robust defence budget. They likely won't lose more than a small percentage anyways unless you saturate dozens of facilities with nukes, in which case you may get upto a thrid, and honestly, making these does not take major expertise. 

I love how you're basically so confident that Iran can't start making lawn mower engines and bombs again if the US blows up like 5 buildings with a cruise missile.

What fantasy? Do point it out. The fact that the drones are pretty crude? Or that not all people that work at a factory stay there 24/7, or that all people don't die when you bomb a building unless you literally saturate it, or that teaching engineers how to work with a pretty simple assembly line is not extremely time consuming? Or that there's lots of US bases and allies in the middle east which the entire Iranian military can successfully attack, or that they have significant stockpiles of weapons which can easily be supplied to Russia. 

Iran has an awful government and significant internal issues but they are not militarily a lightweight nation. They can and will respond to attacks on their defense structure in a strong manner, and unless absolutely crippled nationally in a very aggressive and large scale operation, have absolutely the capacity to wage long term war against the US unless the US also wants to do a costly invasion on very defensible terrain. 

It's more logical at this point for the US to work on countering these drones, producing better versions of these on their own, ensuring further sanctions on Iran, and work on furthering and arming any possible revolutionary movement in their state. I'd even be in favour of bringing back the classic assassination style diplomacy for the CIA to take out the Ayatollah while his regime is weak. At worst Iran will turn into a battlefield for a civil war which can no longer supply Russia due to internal troubles at best they will flip to a more liberal and pro US regime that does not want to deal with sanctions anymore.
