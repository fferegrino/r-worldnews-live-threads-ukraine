Day 442-444 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past couple of days were mostly quiet, but today Russians launched a new missile strike aimed at Kharkiv about 4 hours ago, exactly at midnight. They fired at least 3 missiles from Belgorod, the first one landed somewhere in Kharkiv and the explosion was pretty loud. There was a fire, but we don’t know what was hit yet. People reported that the second missile landed in Zolochiv, and the third missile blew up in the air over Belgorod immediately after being fired.

They also launched missiles/drones at couple of our cities when the Eurovision was starting. it’s obviously not a coincidence as they specifically targeted the city of our contestant, they are so incredibly petty, just wow. There are also more missiles on the way right now, they were launched about an hour ago and they are now entering our airspace, so a countrywide air raid alert has just started.

I guess they are also doing those missile strikes to try to stop people from talking about them shooting down 4 of their own aircraft in the span of a couple of hours today. How the hell does that even happen? It’s understandable that they are now panicking about the Storm Shadow missiles we just received and used, but to shoot down 4 of their own aircraft in their own airspace without even stopping to check what they were shooting at is just wild. And that’s after they just shot down another one of their own helicopters in Crimea just 2 days ago, they just can’t stop hitting themselves it seems.

Of course, Russians said that it was some partisans with MANPADS that shot down their aircraft and not their own air defense, but that doesn’t really make them look any better, as in that case they don’t even control their own borders at all and anyone can just cross it with whatever weapons they please. I guess they actually understood that, so to appease their people they claimed that they shot down the plane that fired Storm Shadow missile at Luhansk yesterday. Obviously, they didn’t provide any evidence of it happening, so we just have to believe their words.",False,1684026553.0,t3_13g6q0u,t3_13g6q0u,,0,133,0,133,0,0,

""Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni pledged unwavering support to Ukraine, saying Italy was ready to support its partnership with NATO, after what Meloni described as a ""long and fruitful"" meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at Rome’s Palazzo Chigi on Saturday. 

""We are ready to support a further intensification of Ukraine's partnership with NATO, we will discuss it in Vilnius at the July summit; it will probably be the central theme,"" Meloni said.
“For as long as needed, and beyond, our nation will continue to provide bilateral and multilateral assistance, and there will be our staunch adherence to sanctions enforcement arrangements and our support for peace, provided it is a just peace,"" she added.

Meloni said she believes Ukraine will win the war and will be ""reborn stronger"" and ""more prosperous than before.""

The prime minister went on to blame Russia in some of the strongest language her government has delivered on the conflict. She said peace will only come when ""Russia ceases hostilities,"" calling on Moscow to withdraw its troops.

""We are in favor of a diplomatic solution to the conflict,"" Meloni said. ""We support President Zelensky's 10-point peace formula. And we recognize the legitimate European aspirations of Ukraine, an outpost of security for the entire European continent.""

She added that she was happy Zelensky visited Pope Francis, and concluded her speech by emphasizing Italy's continued support to Ukraine.

""We're betting on Ukraine's victory,"" she said.

[**Russia tried to destroy a US-made Patriot air defense system in Ukraine last week with a hypersonic missile**, two US officials told CNN.](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/politics/russia-patriot-missiles-ukraine/index.html)

The attack failed, and the Ukrainian military **instead intercepted the missile using the Patriot system**, the officials said, marking their first known successful Ukrainian use of the advanced air defense system only weeks after it arrived in country.

**The Ukrainian air defenders fired multiple missiles from the Patriot at different angles to intercept the Russian missile**, demonstrating how quickly they have become adept at using the powerful system, one official said.

**US officials believe the Russians picked up on signals that are emitted from the Patriot, allowing them to target the system using the hypersonic missile**, known as the Kinzhal or Killjoy.

The Patriot missile system has a powerful radar to detect incoming targets at long-range, making it a potent air defense platform capable of intercepting ballistic missiles and more. But **the radar emission necessary to spot threats at a distance also makes it possible for the enemy to detect the Patriot battery and figure out its location**. And unlike some shorter-range air defenses provided to Ukraine that are mobile and harder to target, the large Patriot battery is a **stationary system, making it possible for the Russians to zero in on the location over time.**

There are ways to camouflage those signals to some extent, officials said, but the **Russian military was evidently able to figure out the rough location** of the Patriot stationed outside of Kyiv. The interception took place there on the night of May 4, Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, said last weekend.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has previously said that the Patriots would “definitely” be a legitimate target for Russian forces.

Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder confirmed earlier this week that the Ukrainians had used the Patriot system to intercept the Kinzhal, which can reach hypersonic speeds.

Ukraine has received at least two Patriot systems, one from the United States and one from Germany, to enhance its air defenses, which have previously been unable to intercept more modern Russian missiles such as the Kinzhal.

When the US first announced it would send Patriot missile systems into Ukraine, the timeline for delivery was months, given the complexity of the system and the need to train dozens of Ukrainian troops on how to operate the battery, which has multiple components. But the Ukrainians were already well versed in the use of air defense systems, allowing the US to compress the standard training program of approximately one year into several months.

The final check of the Patriot systems took place in mid-April, where US, German, and Dutch trainers joined Ukrainian service members for a last inspection of the systems before they were shipped into Ukraine soon after.",1683957022.0,1683956649.0,t3_13g6q0u,t3_13g6q0u,,0,82,0,82,0,0,

""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the ""first important steps"" of a highly anticipated military counteroffensive against Russian forces ""will be taken soon.""

""We are preparing very seriously, and there will definitely be very serious steps,"" Zelensky said in a conversation with top editors of Italian media in Rome on Saturday. 

""I know that we are all motivated, and not only those who know this plan, but our people ... I cannot tell you (when). But you will definitely see it, and Russia will definitely feel it,"" he said. ""... We believe in victory and believe that the first important steps will be taken soon."" 

Some more context: Ukrainian forces have begun ""shaping"" operations in advance of the expected counteroffensive, a senior US military official and senior Western official told CNN.

Shaping involves striking targets such as weapons depots, command centers and armor and artillery systems to prepare the battlefield for advancing forces. It's a standard tactic made prior to major combined operations.

Zelensky said on Thursday that his country still needs ""a bit more time"" before it launches a counteroffensive, in order to allow some more of the promised Western military aid to arrive.""",False,1684009277.0,t3_13g6q0u,t3_13g6q0u,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

>#
>*For a long time, Germany has been reluctant to supply arms to Ukraine. But the new weapons package has it all: It is full of modern defense systems, battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The value of the supplies is in the billions.*
>#
>The federal government has put together another arms package for military support to Ukraine. According to the Defense Ministry, Ukraine is to receive additional weapons worth around 2.7 billion euros from Germany in the coming weeks and months.
>#
>""With this valuable contribution of urgently needed military material, we are showing once again that Germany is serious about its support,"" said Federal Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, according to a statement. ""We all wish for a speedy end to this terrible and illegal war by Russia against the Ukrainian people."" Unfortunately, this is not yet foreseeable, said Pistorius, so Germany will provide any help it can ""as long as it takes"" - in German: ""Solange, wie es nötig ist"".
>#
>The list includes another 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, 30 Leopard 1 A5 tanks, 18 wheeled howitzers, 15 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 200 reconnaissance drones, four additional IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems including ammunition, additional artillery ammunition and more than 100 armored combat units and logistic vehicles. It is therefore the largest package of weapons that Germany has provided to strengthen the Ukrainian armed forces since the beginning of the war in February 2022.
>#
>##Selenskyj could come to Germany
>#
>According to a report in Der Spiegel, the package is to be announced as a symbol of German solidarity with Ukraine, parallel to the presentation of the Aachen Charlemagne Prize to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Selenskyj may come to Germany himself for the award ceremony.
>#
>With the new delivery of weapons, the federal government is once again focusing on strengthening Ukraine's air defense system. The federal government plans to deliver four more IRIS-T-SLM air defense systems and twelve IRIS-T-SLS launchers along with hundreds of guided missiles for the system.

Oil/Gas prices were hitting record lows in 1980-1985, and the prices are really low now as well. Both are leading to a huge problems in USSR's/Russia's economy, but now they have to deal with international sanctions on top of that.

There were rebellious movements and battles for political power in late USSR, with a 'factionising' CP and republics rebelling against Moscow, now we have Prigozhin/Girkin/Kadyrov and other warlords who are the bosses of their own and might rebel at any moment.

On the one hand, you have the Crimean annexation in 2014. Putting aside the illegality and sheer villainy of the act, no one can accuse him of being hesitant or passive. He (and by ""he"" of course I don't mean him alone, but his entire power structure) saw an opportunity, judged correctly that he would largely get away with it, and sure enough Crimea was in Russian hands almost before the West could blink. 

His subsequent war in the Donbas was also an opportunity that benefited him and his goals in the region for nearly 8 years. 

I suppose this is what some people kept in mind, those who thought of Putin as a ""master strategist"" or ""cunning politician"". 

However, when the odds are stacked against him, this so-called genius seems to become immobilized and impotent, as we can see now. While Zelensky tours the battlefield, goes from capital to capital raising awareness and support, and puts his displays of leadership right out on centre stage, Putin is once again almost invisible. His rare public speeches and appearances are transparent regurgitations of tired and uninspired cliches.

It shouldn't be much of a surprise. During Covid, Putin and the Kremlin were very slow to act. Regional governments were basically ghosted by Moscow, and were left to figure out their own covid policies until the capital got its act together. Businesses that had to shut their doors were ghosted by Moscow despite promises of financial aid. Struggling families just had to figure it out. Putin had no great options there either, so he did nothing. 

The same can also be said of his approach to raising retirement age, a thing he promised at the start of his career as president that he would never touch. While the economics of it grew less and less sustainable, he naturally sat on his thumbs until the problem couldn't be ignored any longer. 

I'm looking forward to seeing how much longer Putin can sit on his thumbs. Now, more than ever before, the weight of his troubles must be crushing all the circulation out of them, and at some point they will get gangrene and fall off.",False,1684010912.0,t3_13g6q0u,t3_13g6q0u,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

1. Ukrainian incursion with manpads. This is unlikely, as the shootdowns video and the debris show that both the Mi-8 and the Su-34 got hit with something bigger 

2. Russian air defense friendly fire. If this was just one aircraft, this would be the likeliest explanation. With two we have on video, an idiot mistake is less likely. With four, this suggests deliberate intent of some kind.

3. Ukrainian air defense at long range. The shootdowns are technically within Patriot range from the border. This could be Ukraine taking a massive risk and it massively paying off.

4. Ukrainian air force incursion. It's been so long since we've seen Ukrainian fighters we almost forgot about the possibility. However we know that Ukrainians got tons of aircraft recently, and they got various NATO weapons. Ukraine certainly has air superiority fighters on hand. They also almost certainly have air-to-air missiles that can hit targets at 50 kn.

So, to me, the Occam's razor explanation seems to be... 2, 3, and 4.

My comments thus far:

- it was the “humanity in the recon drone operator, natural mercy thats in all people”, seeing the pleading by the Russian on his, that initially gave pause and mercy to move on.  The feed was visible to the control room who also has the attack drones, and they determined he wasn’t doing any movements that showed aggression 
- when surrendering, the shots fired came from other Russians
- the russian who suicided was the surrender-guy’s friend—he was injured, no comms, and if tried to retreat that day would’ve been shot anyway.  
- that being dropped off w no provisions or radios is common there, no rescue if injured.  Just have to wait out a rotation, which may or may not happen.
- that proactively surrendering (ie, not when encircled) is uncommon, though happens on occasion.  Other front it happens in is Lugansk, and more often there, actually. (Luhansk is more rural/isolated, can be cold; implication that doesnt happen much in other sectors of Donetsk, or Zaporizhye or Kherson.)
- the trenches seen in videos around bakhmut (which are at varying depths) were dug by Ukrainians, by machines, many months ago, in preparation (ie, preliminarily as lines of defense, behind). There’s a ... trowel? a child’s size shovel? next to surrendering soldier in video.
- this all happened may 9, so uploaded same day bc the significance of the date—contrasting the surrender and the suicide
- that osechkin says it has had a profound impact on his Russian viewers, that they are very grateful that Ukraine spared his life, that think this shows humanity in Ukrainian soldiers, and received 1000+ comments of thankfulness by them (his viewers are already predisposed to be anti-Putin Russians, though)
- that when asked what messages he’d give to Russians, this ukrainian didn’t really want to say much, it was as if he’s fed up with Russians, and was indicating that there’s no magical sentence that will now, suddenly, make them see the light of day.  But does indicate this war will impact the Russians future generations negatively. 
- the Ukrainian speaks Russian perfectly in the interview (Russians denigrate Ukrainians’ accents when speaking Russian, when it suits them—that they sound like yokels/hicks/rednecks/provincial/bushies/rednecks; obviously, other times, pretend like they are ‘our people.’)  I mean, I’m American and I can’t always perceive accents, but I don’t hear his.",1684012959.0,1684012529.0,t3_13g6q0u,t1_jk1afbb,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

The heaviest-lifting stores pylons on the Frogfoot can only accommodate weapons of 1,100 pounds, and heavier weapons are rarely ever seen on early-model MiG-29s.

He does point out that a close-to-border portable AA trailer could have these in range.

There was that Russian fighter GoPro video from last week that showed the pilot flying in loops over their own territory (possibly trying to map AA over the border).

Russia would be a lot more powerful if the entire military and intelligence was under the command of one person who could arrange and manage everything effectively but doing so is a threat to Putin himself and makes a coup more likely. A divided command structure with lots of infighting decreases the odds that someone can successfully organize a coup as does letting those in the military steal and be as corrupt as possible.

So he's positioning himself as someone who gives a shit about regular Russian soldiers (a massive load of bullshit, but anyway) and as someone who can say, ""I told you so!"" when all the shit finally hits the fan.

If Russian MoD killed him and then lost Bakhmut (and if they kill him they almost certainly would) then it just reinforces Prigozhin's narrative, pisses off his loyalists, and only creates more problems for the Russian government as a whole. So it's too risky to try. (And that's not even accounting for the reality that if it was as easy as just sending some people with guns to just walk up and kill Prigozhin, Ukraine would've done it a long time ago.)

So Prigozhin is effectively blackmailing the Russian MoD to give him what he wants. Ammo, power, troops, command, etc. He's got them over a barrel right now as he's clearly the most effective fighting force in the region. They *already* very badly wanted to kill him. So all this talking does is make that harder to do actually. He's actually in the area, shouting and screaming, while where the fuck is Shoigu? The optics are terrible for the MoD. That's why Prigozhin actually has the leverage. But only as long as he stays talking. Public figures are inconvenient to disappear like that, even in Russia.

Zelensky himself in an interview with the publication, answering the question whether he proposed to occupy part of Russia, rejected the published documents of American intelligence as ""fantasy"", but defended his right to use unconventional tactics to defend Ukraine.
Zelensky's direct speech: ""Ukraine has every right to defend itself, and we are doing it. Ukraine did not occupy anyone, on the contrary. When so many people died, when there are mass burials, when our people are tortured, I am sure that we should use any wiles"".
More details: Asked about intelligence suggesting he was considering using long-range missiles to strike Russia, Zelenskyy said that was not something Ukraine was entertaining.
""No one in our country gave orders for offensive actions or strikes on Russian territory,"" he said.
The Biden administration said that the intercepted comments of Zelenskyi were not the reason for the refusal to provide ATASMS.
""Ukraine has repeatedly undertaken to use weapons provided by the United States responsibly and strategically when necessary to counter Russian aggression, and we are confident that this will continue to be the case,"" said a representative of the US Ministry of Defense on condition of anonymity.
Zelensky promised that Ukraine would not use American weapons to strike Russian territory, and the White House believes that he has fulfilled that promise.
""President Zelensky has fulfilled the promises he made to President Biden, and we don't believe that will change,"" said a high-ranking administration official.

Edit:

I should have checked your post history... (Sorry everyone else).

Peace is something that happens when at least one side is exhausted.

That is not true yet.

Making peace now for anything other than Russia's withdrawal is pointless.

Ukraine will fight on and be supported, Russia will continue to be ostracised.

Any peace that makes even 1 concession to Russia encourages this type of behaviour and it will happen again.

Ukraine wins or international norms and law fail.

Even from a 'realpolitik' perspective, the allies would be stupid AF to let Russia achieve anything it wants in Ukraine.

But realpolitik is garbage, people and nations have ideals and emotions, nothing is simple, cold logic. Ukraine is fighting for all of us, fighting for democracy, sovereignty and basic humanity.

Thus peace MUST be Russia pulling out of all of Ukraine, at minimum.

And anyone who knows anything will tell you if you want peace, prepare for war because while you may want peace, the other guy may want war...",1684023823.0,1684023171.0,t3_13g6q0u,t1_jk27pe4,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

In that context the suicide guy did the right thing because he was wounded and he knew no help was coming.

* There is no protocol for surrendering to a drone operator, but the Russian solider in the video did everything right (i.e. dropped the weapon, acted non-aggressively and actively tried to communicate with signs) and it should be used as a reference

> Russian officials and a ""senior Ukrainian official"" speaking to The New York Times said the explosion was from a bomb loaded onto a truck.[1] The BBC claimed it was more likely caused by a maritime drone.

Immediately when it happened, we all thought it was a maritime drone, and this is the context in which the BBC article was written. The NYT came later. At this point, I believe the NYT. If you believe the BBC, you can disregard the rest of my post here.

One of the reasons given by experts who know about explosives, is that the destruction seen on the Kerch bridge is consistent with a few tons of explosives. It has been explained that hundreds of kilograms of explosives would not suffice, which excluded special operation forces, various missiles (Neptune) and the [Ukrainian maritime drones](http://www.hisutton.com/New-Ukraine-Maritime-Drone.html) that attacked the russian ships.

So if indeed you need tons of explosives to blow up that bridge, then you need a fairly large bomb or missile. The [Storm Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Shadow) has a payload of 450kg. It might be possible to seriously damage the bridge with this sort of missile, but by tonnage, you might have to land several of them on the exact same spot.

The context of all this is that people were not sure that even ATACMS had enough firepower to do the job, at least you'd have to land multiple missiles on the same spot to destroy the bridge.

To compare, this is the [Wikipedia article on the Antonivskyi Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonivka_Road_Bridge). This bridge is much smaller than the Kerch bridge. Ukraine attacked it with HIMARS on at least 4 separate days, and at least 16 damage holes were observed on the southern end of the bridge. So it was hit by an enormous number of missiles before it was finally destroyed.",1684019955.0,1684002245.0,t3_13g6q0u,t1_jk0wol9,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

It almost sounds like there was some blanket order to intercept everything fitting a certain profile (inbound, low-level, flying at this speed, etc.), without special care taken to ensure that Russian air force traffic is safe, i.e. fly at this altitude, talk to these people when you're inbound, etc., or to actually get authorization to launch.

Nor would the idea of an automated intercept mode on Russian systems surprise me either.   Given the quality and training of their conscript pools, I suspect it was an easy way for overwhelmed crews to respond to high-intensity air attacks, without training multiple levels of the air defense units to handle such things.

I think what Prigozhin is doing has gone further than that, though, and it's anyone's guess what's really happening in the shadows. 

On one hand, Putin may well be already at the point of looking for scape goats, but I'm skeptical that he'd throw Shoigu under the bus in favour of Prigozhin. On the contrary, I think Putin would prefer the opposite. Shoigu is a far safer option for Putin's War Minister and one of the most powerful positions in the Kremlin. They also have a longer history together, and Shoigu also serves to keep the Tuvan region patriotic and aligned with Moscow. On the other hand, Prigozhin is a career businessman, does not have an intelligence background and is not part of the silovik elite, displays overt ambitousness and ruthlessness, and is not afraid to say the quiet ethnofascist parts out loud.

For this to actually happen several things need to be true:

1. Nuclear confrontation turns into a commitment to nuclear war

2. On both sides, everyone involved in the chain of command to launch follows orders, knowing the consequences

3. The majority of technical systems involved work as they are supposed to

4. A sufficiently large number of weapons are used to “kill us all”

5. Defensive systems fail to intercept


Lastly, if “all” is even the population of only the USA, there are an insufficient number of weapons to kill the entire population directly.

It is junk science.

While up to several hundred million people could die from nuclear weapons or their immediate aftermath, the 5 billion number comes from an expectation of starvation.

The cause of this is agricultural failure, caused by a “nuclear winter”, which is a bit of an oxymoron as there isn’t anything nuclear about it.

The claim is that several hundred nuclear weapons would create several hundred firestorms. And that these firestorms would be so powerful as to push soot into the stratosphere above all weather patterns.

Most of these models use the bombings in Japan for their models. These both turned into firestorms, but neither ended up putting any measurable soot into the stratosphere. Those cities had a large quantity of buildings made of wood and paper. Factors such as local weather patterns, and how the weapon is detonated also matter. The likelihood of a firestorm occurring is not 100%.

Additionally, we have evidence from other firestorms, including the Kuwait oil well firestorms (which were massive and burned for many months / years in some cases) that demonstrate that it is nearly impossible to put significant amounts of soot into the stratosphere.

The closest known process that has actually done this are meteor impacts, with total energy output at least six orders of magnitude more than if we detonated all nuclear weapons in existence.

So, in short:
- As per my last comment, it takes something special (lots of things have to go right) to get to total nuclear war
- In a total nuclear war, a few hundred million would die within the first week or two
- A sufficiently large number of blasts would need to generate firestorms
- a sufficiently large number of those firestorms would have to be large enough to put significant amounts of soot into the atmosphere
- it is unlikely that even the combination of nuclear blast and firestorms have sufficient energy to do this
- If it does happen, it will take >10 years to kill 5 billion",False,1684008997.0,t3_13g6q0u,t1_jk08jic,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

I wouldn’t want to bet my life and the lives of all of my loved ones on straws like this though:

2 - of course individuals *can* refuse orders, and if they hadn’t historically we wouldn’t be here, that’s pure survivorship bias. In no way does it guarantee that the vast majority - or even a single individual - does so again.

3 - given all of the arms control treaties including frequent mutual inspections that were active until very recently, it’s safe to assume that the vast majority of the Russian nuclear arsenal will have been very well maintained; if you have your nuclear adversary checking out your arsenal frequently, you will under no circumstances risk them discovering that they could win in a first-strike scenario at this moment

5 - of course we have strong AA - but there is absolutely no way to intercept even just the vast majority of inbound ICBMs if they’re launched from a variety of airborne, submarine and bunker-based launch platforms and a large number of them will be MIRVs with many warheads per missile 

I’m not dismissing any of these points as flat-out wrong; what I’m saying is simply that even if every one of them were to reduce the number of missiles that reach their target by a staggering 50%, we’d still be facing 5.000 x 0.5^3 = 625 nuclear warheads hitting their goals, and those would be sufficient to cause 90% of the damage that the full 5K would.

You’re right in your reasoning, but you’re neglecting the fact that this precise reasoning has been already factored in to the very nature and state of MAD for the last seventy years - this is why nuclear powers don’t just have a few nuclear warheads, they have thousands of them spread across many locations and launch platforms in their nuclear triad, so that the very points you’re making no longer matter in the calculations concerning risks of nuclear war.",1684011025.0,1684010792.0,t3_13g6q0u,t1_jk1gah2,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
