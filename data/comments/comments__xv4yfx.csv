In a week since the beginning of the draft, 194,000 Russian citizens have crossed the borders of nearby countries: 53 thousand people arrived in Georgia, 98 thousand - to Kazakhstan, 43 thousand - to Finland and another 3 thousand - to Mongolia (according to local authorities).

> ""People are preparing for a deterioration of the situation,"" states Sofia Donets, Chief Economist of Renaissance Capital for Russia and the CIS: savings are transferred to a more liquid form, which will be required for settlements outside large cities even when inside the country.

B: *Who will protect the motherland if not a real man?  Should we push women and children there?  Let's do it then...  During the Great Patriotic War they protected us, and now they're running away...  like dogs.*

C: *Someone has to protect the motherland.*

**1420**: Who are we protecting it from?

C:  *Who?  It's clear to everyone that from Ukrainian Nazis which are controlled by the overseas player.  They raised a whole generation of people that are suffering from russophobia.*

2. Avoids the risk of trapped Russian units fighting to the death out of desperation
3. Saves time and avoids the UAF getting bogged down in liquidating pockets, thus allowing for continued offensives
4. Still inflicts heavy casualties, as the UAF can funnel the Russians into a single escape route and pound with artillery. Ex. Lyman
5. Maximizes the amount of equipment and vehicles left behind by Russians, who flee rather than use more ammo stocks to defend

They laughed, they mocked.  AFU ground on, destroyed lines of supply and fought hard successfully for some key tactical bridgeheads. 

And then all of a sudden on 6th September there was “no panic in Balaklia” 

After sucking in the Russian reserves to the Southern front the AFU dramatically and oh so skilfully sucker punched in The East and started the headlong race to the Oskil and beyond culminating (well, so far) in the fall of Lyman. The disbelief as they went further and further and the reports coming back seemed more and more unbelievable and yet they were true, all of them. There was no panic in Balaklia because there was panic everywhere in Russian held areas of Kharkiv Oblast.

Day 223 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet again, there was no shelling or missile strikes. In yesterday’s missile strike they did indeed hit a transformer substation in one of our districts, killing 1 civilian and cutting their electricity temporarily, but it has already been restored. All it did was delay some trains for about 30 minutes and that’s it.
 
Their lines are disintegrating again, and they still waste their missiles on civilian infrastructure which brings them no closer to victory. In a way that’s a good thing, because they are sabotaging themselves by wasting their missiles, but at the same time civilians are getting hurt or even killed in those mindless attacks. Just about an hour ago their sent some kamikaze drones to hit infrastructure in a town Bila Tserkva under Kyiv, which is completely useless to them, it won’t help them retain Kherson, but they do it anyway.

Today there were also some weird light pillars in a couple of Russian cities, I’m pretty sure we even saw the glow from them all the way from here, in Kharkiv, it was visible on the horizon in the direction of Belgorod. At first nobody understood what they were, but a bit later Russians started saying that it was their Peresvet anti-satellite system, which supposedly makes satellites go blind, but I’m not sure how true that is. If it is Peresvet, then it’s pretty weird that this system basically paints a big target on itself when it’s being used, that’s a pretty fatal flaw, as you can literally see that pillar from another city.",False,1664932048.0,t3_xv4yfx,t3_xv4yfx,,0,136,0,136,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Zmiivka, or Gammalsvenskby (‘Old Swedish Village’) is quite well known here due to a large part of its inhabitants being descendants of Estonian Swedes who were driven to the area in the 18th century.

During the war, the villagers (the ones who didn’t flee) have managed to maintain regular contact with friends and family in Sweden. There have been stories coming out about, among other things: a shortage of bread and medications in the area, not being able to harvest the crops (too dangerous to step in the fields), a forced swap of currency from hryvnias to roubles, artillery fire right above people’s houses, low-flying fighter jets, explosions nearby, and so on. A few weeks ago, there were reports of drunk Russian soldiers who “borrowed” cars in the village and went for joyrides. One even crashed into a house. (No, the villagers do not think highly of Russia and its referendums).

And today, the fascist tanks rolled in. Presumably, they are positioning themselves for defense of the area.

One can only hope for these desperate, demoralized nihilist troops not to loot, rape and murder their way back to where they come from. It’s harrowing to think about what it is to be a civilian in Zmiivka or one of the nearby villages right now, waiting for the liberation…",False,1664918760.0,t3_xv4yfx,t3_xv4yfx,,0,42,0,42,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

- On 30 September 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an order for the routine autumn conscription cycle, which aims to train 120,000 conscripts. These conscripts are legally not permitted to be deployed outside of Russia. This is separate from those individuals being mobilised as part of the 21 September 2022 partial mobilisation order.

- The conscription cycle will begin on 01 November 2022, a month later than usual. The late start to the cycle is an indication of growing pressures on Russia's ability to train and equip a large number of new conscripted personnel.

- The challenges of accommodating, training, equipping and deploying mobilised and conscripted personnel are significant. Deficiencies within the Russian administrative and logistical systems will continue to undermine these efforts.

Center for Strategic and International Studies ⁦: ([Registration link](https://www.csis.org/events/nafo-and-winning-information-war-lessons-learned-ukraine))

Wednesday, October 5, 2022 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm

Online-Only

Concerns about the scale and reach of Moscow’s disinformation capabilities have been mounting for years. Yet the war in Ukraine – and the online discourse surrounding that war – arguably demonstrates that the information landscape has shifted, and that new opportunities and methods exist for countering disinformation machines. Not only has the Ukrainian government demonstrated a masterful ability to shape the international narratives surrounding the war, so has the **North Atlantic Fellas Organization** (#NAFO). NAFO (official Twitter account: \@Official_NAFO) is an organic, ***online gaggle*** of pro-Ukraine supporters that has gained the attention of policymakers and global leaders for their creative use of digital media to take on key sources of Russian disinformation.

This discussion will examine several questions. What does the activity of #NAFO tell us about information warfare today and in the future? What broader lessons can be drawn from the Ukraine experiences? What risks arise from these kinds of information warfare, and how might they be mitigated?

**Kathleen J. McInnis**, Senior Fellow, International Security Program and Director, Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative at CSIS will be joined by **Seth G. Jones**, Senior Vice President, Harold Brown Chair, and Director of the International Security Program at CSIS; **Emily Harding**, Deputy Director and Senior Fellow in the International Security Program at CSIS; **Matt Moores** (USMC, ret.), NAFO Co-founder; and **Iuliia Mendel**, (Virtual from Ukraine), Ukrainian journalist and President Zelenskyy’s former spokesperson.

Any theories why Russia didn't use any high-altitude bombers at any point? I feel like for most of this conflict, they could have been dropping guided bombs from above air defense range.

I know Ukraine would scramble their own jets if that threat came, but that's why the bombers would have their own fighter escorts.

I would have thought that would have been part of their '3-day decapitation strike' in the first days, but as far as I know that never happened - anyone know why high-altitude operations weren't part of the strategy? Especially since these aircraft can deploy not only bombs, but missiles, meaning they could not only be high up but also not directly over the battlefield, staying out of AA range.

Maybe it did happen and I missed it...

Edit: thanks for the answers. I didn't know the S-300 was that capable and frankly forgot about it because I hadn't heard it mentioned in this conflict for a while. I was Googling various air defense systems being donated (Starstreak, etc) which are MANPADs and have a much lower effective altitude...

It may test you resolve to stay in position on the line if rumors start to spread that the line collapsed somewhere, which could then turn into a very real collapse if units lose their confidence and break.

This isn't all too unlikely, without good command and control and communications, at night it may be impossible to know what is happening 20km away from you.

** RUSSIAN SIDE**

**Troops**

Russia lost much of its elite troops at the start of the war.  It's current troops are poorly trained but many are experienced with 6 months of fighting.  Russia is not able to raise volunteers even with cash offers.  It is down to forcibly drafting soldiers and loosening the age and health restrictions.  So far Russia has not been able to raise enough new troops to make up for its losses.  With mobilization that may be possible, but the quality of the troops will go down significantly.  Winter may give the drafted troops 6 months to get experience with limited fighting, but it is not going to turn low morale old men into competent soldiers. 

We thought Russia could not mobilize a large number of effective soldiers and what we are seeing is bearing that out.  Russia's troop situation situation will just get worse.  Raising a horde is not really possible for them and even if they did it would not really help them.

**Heavy Weapons and Equipment**

Russia has lost most of its modern tanks and other vehicles.  It has shot its modern missiles.  It is keeping its air force out of the battle to preserve its planes - so it has modern planes but it cannot actually use them.  Russia is making more tanks and other vehicles.  But the sanctions are preventing them from getting the parts they need for truly modern vehicles.

Russia seems to have enough equipment in storage that they can piece together tanks and other vehicles to field.  The newly drafted troops were given some tanks.  But they tanks keep being older and older designs.  Russia's heavy equipment situation is getting worse.  They are not going to be able to manufacture enough to become stronger.

**Supplies**

It seemed unlikely that Russia could run out of basic supplies.  But discovering that 1.5 million winter uniforms they thought they had did not exist makes it seem that there is enough corruption that Russia really could just run out of the basic things people and soldiers need.  The supply situation will just get worse for Russia.

**Foreign Aid*

No country not controlled by Russia is giving them aid, and even those (like Chechnya) are reducing their aid.  Supposed allies like China are abstaining in purely token voting in the UN.  There is no reason to think that any country will give significant aid to Russia.  The sanctions are almost certainly having an effect here.  No major country wants to get hit by sanctions.  And sanctioned countries like Iran cannot afford to give aid.

**Foreign Purchases*

Russia has bought drones from Iran.  We now know that these are not military grade.  They are far less capable than what Ukraine is getting. And that is the best Russia can get.  And selling oil at half price, Russia is running out of money to spend.  There is no reason to think Russia will be able to buy anything to help them get stronger.

**Officers**

Sometimes wars swing when better people get promoted.  Grant and Sherman changing the course of the American Civil War, for example.  But Putin has to value loyalty over competence.  And obedience over competence.  There is no evidence that Russian commanders are getting better.  It is simply not a merit system.

**Nukes**

Russian leaders know that a nuclear war will end them.  They cannot win one.  The only question is if they get petulant enough to not care.

**UKRAINIAN SIDE**

**Troops**

Ukraine can call upon a million eager volunteers.  Their new troops are being trained for months by NATO.  They have a nearly endless supply of new, well trained and equipped troops.  Russia cannot hope to win the war through attrition against Ukraine.

**Heavy Equipment**

Ukraine is getting more and better heavy equipment, although not tanks from NATO (they get them from Russia).  The key here is that the equipment comes from the west.  If the west stopped providing it, Ukraine would suffer heavily.  But they are getting it from many western countries.  Any one country stopping aid at this point would not have a major impact.

**Supplies**

Ukraine is well supplied by the west.  They are almost entirely dependent on the west for ammunition, uniforms, etc.  If the west stopped providing it, Ukraine would suffer heavily.  But they are getting it from many western countries.  Any one country stopping aid at this point would not have a major impact.

**CONCLUSION**

Everything is going against Russia at this point.  Their only ""realistic"" hope for any sort of victory is a massive collapse of support in the west so that all of the major western countries stopped supplying Ukraine.  There are just no other realistic options for Russia.  They have tried everything else and it has not worked.",False,1664905161.0,t3_xv4yfx,t3_xv4yfx,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

This is a bit muddier, and goes back to those same people giving not giving Ukraine weapons when they asked for them back then.

Ukraine asked for better weapons and the Obama administration refused to sell them or give them any advanced weapons.  So they never had a real chance to try and defend Crimea.

Now you may remember Trumps first impeachment trial.  It was over a quid pro quo in some eyes and others it was over trying to look at actual corruption.  This was Ukraine receiving more Javelins well before Russia was set to invade.

In the early days of this war, Ukraine held up because they had very good use of the Javelin weapons system.  Once they started holding up you saw other countries give them more weapons, to the point where they now have some of the most advanced weapons systems in theater today.

They know using nukes to attack another country would mean getting a similar if not stronger attack and NATO and US can bring a devastating attack even without using nukes.

The message seems aimed to russian people. 

""NATO will never bomb us"" and Putin need to clarify this on daily basis because he sold the fake idea that they're literally at war against NATO and US. 

So nukes threats against western countries seems the ultimate attempt to keep russians quite and make them feel safe, and even if this may sound absurd, it probably works just fine for them.

So the idea is, whatever we did in Ukraine nobody will ever do the same against us.

Hold what positions you can, including withdrawing from overextended positions in Kherson that you can't effectively supply.

Build up increased supply caches in Russia proper and reinforce logistics especially road/rail connections from these locations to your planned frontline staging areas.

While the weather is poor and slowing offensive operations *actually* train your conscripts for more than a few days, or even just a few weeks. Get them a couple months of training - yes Russia will likely lose more territory while waiting but the idea is if they don't do something to change they lose anyway.

Russia would have to re-invade from Belarus in the North towards Kyiv using 2/3 of their mobilized forces and use the other 1/3 for reinforcements/reserves. This could also allow for troop rotation since some of their units have been on the line this entire war.

I don't perceive a big difference between doing this with the Mohajer vs the Orlan series (both are surveillance drones).  The reason we're seeing this as an independent story is simply because Iranian drones have just arrived and are still being sighted and tracked.  And remember the Iranian drones don't necessarily represent more advanced technology; Russia just can't produce their own anymore and doesn't want to deplete supplies of Orlans.  

Controlling one disrupted drone doesn't create any such scenario where you can control all the others.  You have to be in the physical location with the right equipment.

Ukraine has both russian and western anti-air defense systems in play whereas ukraine used himars to blow up russia's anti-air very effectively.

So Russian Air force has been conservative....plus lack of western components means repairing or replacing jets is very difficult. Plus the best pilots probably refused to fly suicide missions hence why some jet kills have over the hill retired pilots in the seat. Can't exactly replace a jet pilot with newbies like you can a tank crew. If he won't fly into Nato anti-air voluntarily, tough \*\*\*\*.....

And they had a severe dearth of skilled pilots(and the ones they had only flew a fractions of the hours NATO pilots do). So the RuAF wasn't all that well at the beginning. 

Then once the war began Russia super botched up the mission to destroy the UAF and Ukrainian anti-air network. Russia never really trained much for ""Wild Weasel"" missions, choosing to use cruise missile strikes instead. Only they most took out Apt. building, Art Museums, and Schools. So rather than destroy the UAF they lost a good chunk of their inventory for little effect. 

Then the mix of sanctions for Russia and aid to Ukraine hit. Russia lost the ability to manufacture high tech parts and weapons, or to acquire the parts needed for their planes and choppers. While Ukraine has been given those parts. This also effected Russia's anti-air capability with them running low of needed AA missiles. 

Then around Aug. Ukraine and the US completed the project to allow Ukraine jets to fire the US HARMS anti-radar missile. Ukraine immediately went ham and started taking out Russian AA platforms left and right. Ukraine also used a method they are STILL hush-hush about to destroy many Russian jets on their bases in Crimea.

As has been mentioned here many times before, the social contract going back to USSR times was the government saying ""Don't question or mess around with us, and we'll leave you alone"". 

It's a misconception that Russian propaganda aims to convince people to be pro-Putin or pro-war. Propaganda has always aimed to make people skeptical of politics and feel helpless to change it, and that it's pointless to try. Over the years they have been quick and consistent to make examples of those who try to change it.

I think we should be more realistic. 

The fights, if going like that, will take long time even for the main land. The rain season will start = no satellite recon, hard moving, limited drone coverage. If the winter is mild, even worse - even more rains, bad roads for months.

If RU decide to keep Crimea and abandon the rest, they can do really, really well, no matter what (unless USA hands over all their fleet). After all, RU army exists and they have the time to build a 20 fortresses one behind the other there. Will they do it is a question, but surely they have the ability. RU will have to defend smaller and smaller front, We also have to keep in mind that we mostly see one-sided story. We don't see how many UA heroes dies, how many depots were bombed, how many tanks were lost. We cheer for every liberated place, but every single one has some very hard cost attached... 

It is a narrow land to defend, the reserves can get some kind of training (if they save it for the purpose and not just sacrifice them in plugging hopeless holes), there will be lots of RU soldiers available in 6 months time. They can keep all the ""classic"" russian borders almost unguarded and just poke UA from time to time.

But probably Putin will get some kind of window exit by spring, so it should not matter. My hope is that the successor will not be one of the mad dogs and this special RU humiliation collapses...

To regain momentum (not even win, just stop losing) Russia would need to:

- get a competent unified command, 
- strengthen and expand logistics and supply capacity, 
- rebuild their recon/Intel networks since it's obvious they lack good info, 
- rebuild a more robust communication system, 
- actually train their mobilized forces for a couple months while the weather is poor,
- spend enough time to rebuild their equipment reserve rather than piecemeal repair and ship it to the front immediately (t-62s were sent to the front not because they didn't have T-72s or t80s but because they could get those up to the front quicker than they could get the other ones ready)

They would basically need to start the whole thing over while having far less capable soldiers, officers, equipment and the morale of an Army having to start over. 

All the while Ukraine is getting stronger and stronger. EU reporting they'll train 15,000 - UK offering separate training, US setting up a dedicated Ukrainian Command and sending more and better equipment as Ukraine builds it's capabilities.

Early in the war, Ukraine was asking for everything (as you might expect they should). M1 Abrams, F16s, A-10s, etc.

They didn't get these because, besides the training aspect, if you don't have an exceptionally thorough supply chain and procurement process for the regular maintenance and sustainment functions required to keep these things operational, then you might be able to use them *once.* Then they become multi-million dollar paperweights.

The US helped Ukraine work backwards from realistic goals to give them what they need and help build that supply chain in a deliberate manner. HIMARS, howitzers, troop carriers, etc.

This was done in tandem with a summer of wargaming the tactical ins-and-outs of the operations we've seen in the past several successful weeks. It's worked to wonderful effect against the disorganized Russian forces.

My point is this: there is no shortage of US/NATO leaders working with Ukraine to dictate what the battlefield will look like and how to win the necessary battles over the next 1, 3, 6+ months. There is also no better hivemind of military professionals to ensure the right equipment is being trained on and provided at the right time. For all we know, crews are being trained on ATACMS right now that will go live in December. Who knows.

The Kharkiv and Luhansk area is extremely wet and muddy in the fall and was taken during the Russian blitz in spring. As such the terrain and infrastructure there is relatively untouched making it Russia's preferred supply route into the East rather than trying to supply the Severodonesk and Lysychansk areas through the absolutely destroyed terrain they just ground out from Lysychansk East. 

If Ukraine can take Northern Luhansk back before the Rasputistia muds start, then they will have severed Russia's ability to supply the East, and therefore the South as well to some degree, from the North. They will also have a couple of months of Fall mud to protect them while they dig in new defensive works along the pre 2014 borders. 

That's when they will strike. Cleave the land bridge and force everything Crimea and North that Russia still occupies through the Kerch bridge. The same Kerch bridge that is within HIMARS range of the north coast of the Azov Sea. If they can punch through to the AZOV and more or less put all of South of Ukriane and Crimea that Russia occupies into a giant encirclement.

There's a giant natural barrier extending southwest from Zaporizhzhia, namely the part of the Dnipro River where it becomes more or less a lake. So any Ukrainian advance south of there risks becoming surrounded on three sides before it takes a useful objective like say, Melitopol. Liberating some farmland isn't very meaningful. And likewise, for Russia to move north puts them almost immediately between Zapo and Kramatorsk. Again, without taking those cities, occupying land in between them isn't very useful.

So what would make sense for Russia to do is try and encircle Kramatorsk. Which is what they were working on some months ago. But the key forward base necessary to make that happen is the town of Izyum. Which they lost rather recently. 

Also the overall picture here is that Russia needs to keep supply lines open through Luhansk and Donetsk to support  Melitopol, Crimea and Kherson. Ukraine retaking Izyum and Kupyansk' directly impacts the rail lines needed for resupply. Once Russia starts losing the ability to run trains through Donetsk, Melitopol becomes a whole lot easier to retake.

In general, don't get confused by the fallacy of retaking land. The focus is on destroying Russia's ability to resupply. They are extremely reliant on artillery shelling, and that is a hungry beast requiring constant feeding (especially since Russia seriously sucks at hitting specific targets, they have to blanket a whole area to hit one target).",False,1664899751.0,t3_xv4yfx,t1_ir0sld6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

He basically reverse-psychologied himself out of direct involvement by asking to be a colonel in the Russian Army which resulted in his exclusion from any formal role.    

Then he broadcast the invasion plan (I can’t believe that was unintentional).  Then he managed to keep Belarusian troops out of direct involvement.  I would suspect that he might even be an asset for the US, but if that were the case Trump would have burned him like our other informants.   

Then a week or so somebody (American) connected (Patreus?) said that Lukashenko is allied with Russia “for now”.

bd69b15a73579d51a4b0dfc8c846b977,xv4yfx,ir0beh5,"Twice recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the prospect of using nuclear weapons in the war he launched to destroy Ukraine. With Russian forces retreating in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Mr. Putin’s threats amount to desperate saber-rattling intended to frighten all. But his threats must not be brushed off completely, given Mr. Putin’s record of folly and recklessness.

What weapons are we talking about? Not the nuclear warheads carried by continent-spanning intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of city-busting strikes with limited warning, which defined the Cold War. Rather, according to the authoritative Nuclear Notebook in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, by Hans M. Kristensen and Matt Korda, Russia possesses 1,912 nonstrategic or tactical nuclear weapons, designed to be launched from ground-based missiles, airplanes or naval vessels. This total might include warheads that are retired or awaiting dismantlement, so the actual deployable force might be smaller. No treaty has ever limited these weapons, although in 1991, President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to voluntarily pull many of them back to warehouses.

Opinion writers on the war in Ukraine

The Russian warheads are kept in storage under the custody of the defense ministry’s 12th Main Directorate. If Mr. Putin were to deploy them, his order would be transmitted to units. Then the weapons would be released from storage onto transport by trucks or helicopters. Once deployed on delivery vehicles — say, missiles or airplanes — Mr. Putin would have to issue a direct order to use them. Each step might be detected and provide the United States and its allies time to react. Early warning would — and should — trigger intense diplomatic and other pressure on Mr. Putin to stop before setting off a nuclear catastrophe. Preparing to exploit this warning is the best defense against disaster. No doubt, Mr. Putin might want to play out such a deployment to ratchet up the pressure. But in so doing, he would escalate the risk of error or miscalculation. Nuclear gamesmanship toys with existential danger.

A nuclear blast in Ukraine, even low-yield, would kill civilians as well as soldiers and contaminate Russia, Ukraine and beyond. President Biden has properly warned of severe consequences, and Mr. Putin would be wise to listen. Former CIA director and retired Gen. David H. Petraeus suggested incautiously on Sunday that NATO should launch a massive conventional — that is, nonnuclear — military response, including sinking Russia’s Black Sea fleet, if the Kremlin used a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. This appears to be a recipe for wider war with Russia. Far better to stop Mr. Putin before the cataclysm.

In 1962, the world stood at the brink when the Soviet Union deployed nuclear warheads on missiles in Cuba, then stood down and took them home.

But in the context of the paragraph this lies in they are talking about the Soviet Union standing down to end the Cuban Missile crisis. So I hope they mean Putin should stand down the nuclear weapon threat and end the war.

Ukrainian troops are advancing towards Svatove using the highway from Kupiansk, they seem to have made good progress, but it is unclear exactly how far they've reached, some reports of Russian military police being encircled in some town, and Ukrainian units bypassing it.

Ukrainian SOF appears to be operating freely in the woodland area between Svatove and Kreminna, with some reports that some Ukrainian SOF units have crossed the p-66 highway and are fighting to take a small town - don't remember the name now -. Overall Ukrainian forces continue to push at a steady pace. There are now some Russian reports from Svatove that the Russians are trying to mass troops in that area to perform a counter attack against the Ukrainian advance.

edit: Kyslivka is the town where some Russian military police units were encircled by Ukrainian troops - this comes from the War in Ukraine  channel, whom i judge to be decently accurate when it comes to reporting the front line situation.

Krasnorichens'ke is the town where - again according to the War in Ukraine channel - Ukrainian SOF units are either in the process of attacking the town, or have taken it.

It's also important if the village was heavily fortified and/or strategically important. Think of it like a hill somewhere in the frontline, the taking of that particular hill may not be that significant in terms of overall territory taken, but if the hill commands a significant portion of the frontline, it could spell the doom for that section of the frontline.

We saw a little bit of this with the fall of Popasna for Ukraine. The city itself was completely destroyed, so its capture meant nothing in terms of population loss, or territory taken, or economic loss etc.., and also the Russians spent a long time fighting for it and took significant casualties clearing it, but Popasna was situated on a high ground, and the loss of that high ground that made the Ukrainian salient of Sieverodonetsk/Lysychansk especially vulnerable to be enveloped. Which is what slowly started to happen to the Ukrainian defenders in that salient, eventually forcing the Ukrainians to abandon Lysyschansk because the threat of being encircled was very real due to the progress that the Russian troops made after taking Popasna.

In Kherson the same is the same but in reverse, the individual villages being recaptured by the Ukrainians don't mean much in terms of population centers, or economic output, or maybe even in terms of territory taken, but the rate of progress and the direction of that progress creates a real chance for the Russian forces in that frontline being enveloped and cut off from reinforcements.

While most empty farmland *can* be fortified, it can't be fortified as quickly, easily, cheaply, or effectively as an urban area, and it may be more difficult to supply (something Russia is already struggling with). Certain territories are valuable because they represent naturally superior defensive positions and/or important logistical hubs. And either way, a Russia retreat means their immediate efforts must be directed towards fortifying and supplying their new lines, not preparing for a new offensive.

The nature of the Ukrainian advance also sometimes says more about scale of the victory than the amount of land taken.

Withdrawing a short distance, in good order, to a superior position or to counter a potentially threatening enemy maneuver doesn't necessarily indicate much. Withdrawing in a disorganized panic, or worse, a complete rout, indicates much larger problems within the Russian military that speaks to its rapidly declining morale and combat effectiveness.

What looks like a small amount of ground lost by Russia could be accompanied by a catastrophic loss of trained soldiers and equipment. 

Think of it this way: In the first week of the war, Russia had the capacity to make rapid advances. The Ukrainians slowed their advance to a (very costly) crawl, then fought them to a standstill. From there, they organized a successful major attack of their own near Kharkiv. Now we're seeing Ukrainian forces make gains on multiple fronts at once.

After this is all over, there are many factors that will be studied as to why things happened the way they did. 

The one of most interest to me is this: how did Ukraine, a nation mired in corruption and with a shambolic army, manage to train up an armed forces capable of taking on Russia? 

Certainly, they got and are getting piles of NATO equipment and pots of cash from the West. But as we all know, that is not enough to root out corruption and military inefficiency - far from it, getting piles of free stuff can exacerbate both problems. Look at Afghanistan. 

Also true that the West put in years of effort training the Ukrainian army (and this is probably more important even than the gear they are handing over, if less invisible). Once again, training itself is not enough. 

Somehow, Ukraine has found within itself the resolve to turn away from post-Soviet shambles, at least where its army is concerned. How they did that is the single most important thing to understand.

If you read some of the intercepted calls you can even hear some of the soldiers comment on this. They say the Ukrainians hit them as soon as they fire their artillery. It took them a long time to get permission or approval to fire back. The Russian army functions top down. Not like the US, NATO, or other modern forces. We allow our boots on the ground to make primary decisions in these cases. Allowing quick reactions. The Russians need to ask permission from a higher up. Higher ups that were being killed every day. 

Even if the Russians knew the military targets they either failed to attack in time before they moved, didn't attack at all, or attacked and were pushed back. Like Battle of Antonov Airport. Even when they chose to attack they were defeated or pushed back. 

Civilian targets on the other hand are much easier to target. An apartment building doesn't change grid squares. People still need hospitals, schools, and transit. 

The Russian tactic has always been one of war crimes, bombing civilian populations, and throwing their soldiers into the meat grinder. They especially increase the bombing of civilians when they get frustrated with conventional progress. 

It's not that they didn't strike military targets. They simply couldn't. So like any frustrated child they just break stuff. They got angry they could not blitz towards Kyiv. It was clear they were overextended, under equipped, and failed to achieve that goal. Then they hoped to hold territory and slowly advance as far as they could. This all started to fail. So they just leveled entire cities.

This is assuming you had multiple Mia Khalifa laying down shoulder to shoulder and head to toe, and no over lapping or wrapping (no arm on arm, no feet next to the ears of the one below, etc.) So that each mia khalifa takes up a square area all to her self.

Mia khalifa is apparently 1.57m tall and her measurements are apparently 40-20-36. Mia has quite large breasts, and since the average shoulder-to-shoulder width for a woman is apparently about 37cm, 40cm seems ok for us to take for Mia at her ""widest"".

So one Mia Khalifa under these specifications would take up 157x40=6280cm square.

1000km square is 10000000000000cm square. 10000000000000/6280 =1592356687.9.

So I believe the answer is ""Just a bit less than 1,592,356,688 Mia Khalifas""

All this was done because I was sat waiting for my food in the oven so it is both wildly approximate, useless, and probably full of errors. I welcome any discussion in providing clarification and the usefulness of Mia Khalifa as measurement of surface area.

BTM-3 Trenching Vehicle

The BTM-3 is a Soviet trenching machine. It is based on an AT-T heavy artillery tractor. Production of the BTM-3 commenced in 1957. It is officially designated as a ""High-Speed Trenching Machine"". This machine was used by motorized and mechanized infantry units. Each Soviet motorized or mechanized division (10 000~13 000 soldiers) had 3 of these trenching machines. Successor of the BTM-3 became the BTM-4M Tundra.
  
The BTM-3 could dig straight, zigzag, or curved trenches. The rotor unloads the soil next to the trench, creating front and rear parapet of the trench which is around 0.5 m tall and provides additional protection.

This machine carries no defensive armament. There is provision for mounting an R-113 standard tank radio, though the radio was not fitted as standard. The BTM-3 was equipped with PNV-57T night vision goggles, so it could travel and operate at night.

The AT-T, as well as the BTM-3 are based on chassis and drive system of a Soviet T-54 medium tank, however their ends were swapped in order to make an engine compartment at the front. So the AT-T and BTM-3 are essentially driving backwards comparing with the T-54 tank.

   This machine is powered by an A-401 diesel engine, developing 305 hp.",1664909251.0,1664908042.0,t3_xv4yfx,t1_ir1r5qm,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

Basically, this means that Ukraine would have Nova Kakhova within the sights of a large number of traditional artillery guns, which are very hard to stop - unlike rocket artillery which can be countered (sometimes) by anti-air weapons, there's little to no equipment out there that could even *attempt* to intercept an artillery shell in flight. The usual counter to artillery fire from guns is to locate the guns using direction finding and then fire your own artillery back at them. Ukraine has longer range artillery than Russia now, and it's much more highly mobile. So counter-battery fire, as it's called, isn't really a choice for Russia in this location.

 >A light pillar is an atmospheric optical phenomenon in which a vertical beam of light appears to extend above and/or below a light source. The effect is created by the reflection of light from tiny ice crystals that are suspended in the atmosphere or that comprise high-altitude clouds (e. g. cirrostratus or cirrus clouds).

*Skilled* Japanese pilots were generally used as exactly that, *skilled* pilots.  Occasionally skilled pilots would kamikaze when they had little other option, a way to ""go out with a bang"", but that wasn't just Japanese; famously a US B-25 tried to kamikaze the Akagi at Midway.  If you're going to die, take the other guy with you, that kind of deal.

Kamikaze pilots were usually *not* skilled pilots.  Japan *did not have* skilled pilots by the time they were using kamikazes en masse in any sort of reasonable numbers, and those few skilled pilots were generally used to protect kamikazes to get them to their target.  Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, and Leyte had essentially wiped out their skilled air corps; for example, the torpedo plane attacks at Midway had casualty rates averaging over 75%, most of the Guadalcanal raids had similar or worse casualty rates for the IJN, and most Japanese pilots when/if they ditched, died.  And many of their carriers went down with a lot of their pilots.

Finally, weirdly enough, by the end of the war there was a pretty decent logic to kamikaze attacks, because a non-kamikaze attack was equally as suicidal.  [Consider this; the entire video is useful, but this segment in particular is very.](https://youtu.be/QqwDvxLVZII?t=25)  And this is probably very thin in estimates for AAA effectiveness.

Honestly, Russia's best (and probably only) shot was right at the beginning of the war, if they had actually successfully pushed into Kyiv in the first few days. It doesn't mean they wouldn't face resistance and insurgency for a long time after, but:

1. Such a resistance would have a lot less western support than the army does now
2. Russia's sheer brutality when it comes to citizens is probably more effective at dealing with insurgency than most, because they ultimately have no problem displacing or murdering entire populations to quell local unrest, or oppressing the shit out of everyone so you don't even have the chance to fight back

Russia's poor maintenance, nonexistent logistics, batshit communication plans (usage of civilian networks that Ukraine controls and has access to???) and reliance on blockable roads completely fucked their only chance in the war. As long as Ukraine continued existing, it could continue fighting back, and everything (Western support, sanctions, morale, mobilization, etc.) would favor Ukraine over time.

>During its existence, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army fought against the Poles and the Soviets as their primary opponents, although the organization also fought against the Germans starting from February 1943, with many cases of collaboration with the German forces in the fight against the Soviets. From late spring 1944, the UPA and Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-B (OUN-B)—faced with Soviet advances—also cooperated with German forces against the Soviets and Poles in the hope of creating an independent Ukrainian state. The OUN also played a substantial role in the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of Volhynia and East Galicia, and later prevented the deportation of the Ukrainians in southeastern Poland.

UPA and OUN were responsible for deaths of 50,000-100,000 Poles - mostly civilians.

I support Ukraine, but honestly these flags rub me the wrong way. I understand that they were fighting for independence, but independence did not have to come at a price of slaughtering women and children, like it happened in Volhynia. The barbarism was insane - there were cases of infants being nailed to wooden planks, alive. I don't see why they should be wearing these flags today... They're not partisans anymore. They criticise Russians for the slaughter, yet they waive the flags of those who were doing the slaughtering with pride.

And before someone calls me a Russian troll - no. I just know of people whose family members survived this massacre. It's not uncommon in Poland to have known someone who had suffered in the eastern regions of second Polish Republic, although that generation is certainly fading away, and very few are left. Scars remain though.

 >Able Archer 83 was the annual NATO Able Archer exercise conducted in November 1983. The purpose for the command post exercise, like previous years, was to simulate a period of conflict escalation, culminating in the US military attaining a simulated DEFCON 1 coordinated nuclear attack. The five-day exercise, which involved NATO commands throughout Western Europe, was coordinated from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) headquarters in Casteau, Belgium.
 
**[Korean Air Lines Flight 007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007)** 
 
 >Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KE007/KAL007) was a scheduled Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On 1 September 1983, the flight was shot down by a Soviet Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but owing to a navigational mistake made by the crew, the airliner drifted from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace around the time of a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission.

But Germany also admitted some losses, like Stalingrad, though they framed them in different ways. Like “The brave Wehrmacht has loss the battle of Stalingrad. The surrounded men fought to the last, and took many more Bolsheviks with them. Let us remember these heroes as we rid the world of the Bolshevik scum!”

Of course, the truth was many did surrender, and while that was an exaggeration what I just said it wasn’t much of one. The one advantage Germany had was that many of it’s soldiers knew how badly they had treated Soviet civilians and POWs, and so those soldiers often *were* willing to fight to the death unless completely surrounded- because they had no doubt that the vicious treatment meted out to the Soviets would be returned in kind to them.

And of course Japanese soldiers were often willing to fight to the death both due to lies by their leaders (they too were told Americans would murder them, and they knew what that had done to allied prisoners) and their own fanatical beliefs. It’s worth noting I have seen *some* pictures and books where marines collected Japanese skulls and the like. The Pacific War was easily one of the most brutal conflicts in history, but our total air superiority (and naval superiority) combined with the lack of supplies the Japanese had on defense led to lopsided battles starting in mid 1942.

 >A flash suppressor, also known as a flash guard, flash eliminator, flash hider, or flash cone, is a muzzle device attached to the muzzle of a rifle that reduces its visible signature while firing by cooling or dispersing the burning gases that exit the muzzle, a phenomenon typical of carbine-length weapons. Its primary intent is to reduce the chances that the shooter will be blinded in low-light shooting conditions. Contrary to popular belief, it is only a minor secondary benefit if a flash suppressor reduces the intensity of the flash visible to the enemy.

Their economy is fucked, and if they retreat today, give back Crimea, it still won't fix anything because they are too far gone, the effects of the sanctions aren't even felt in full and are devastating to their economy.

In the late 00s there was a big push from the Kremlin down to law enforcement to shake up the bad treatment of foreigners that was admittedly notorious during the 90s and still somewhat into the early 00s. Of course no system is perfect but I've always heard a general consensus that police started treating foreigners much better after that, because Russia was getting a reputation and around that time they were really trying to open up to tourism. 

I don't think it's about looking or acting like foreigners. Me and my American/British/Canadian friends often go to bars and other places and quite openly speak English. If anything, it gets annoying how friendly people are, when you get asked for the thousandth time if we want to hang out with them or speak English with them. I can count on one hand the number of times we had a difficult encounter with someone in ten years of being here. People are always incredibly polite and inquisitive, especially now, about foreigners, especially western ones. 

In the interest of having a civil discussion, I decided to move on from anecdotes and try to get a little handle on what statistics say about this. A data aggregator called Global Economy (dot) com shows that (by 2017 data) Russia is near the bottom of theft and robbery rates in Europe, though is in first place for homicides (wiki list supports that). Numbeo has a safety index comparison for 99 European cities and Nizhny Novgorod ranks 24, Moscow 45, and Petersburg 51, all of these ahead of such cities as Berlin (58), Frankfurt (62), Glasgow (65), Stockholm (67), Milan (74), Barcelona (75), Dublin (77), Rome, London, Athens, Paris, etc. 

I'm not a statistician and I can't say these are definitive sources of proof, but as I say, I feel way safer here than in Auckland from NZ, and I couldn't imagine living in the US at all with all those guns. 

 I can't really find any other sites that clearly compare thefts and other petty crimes though, so maybe I'll do a little more digging on that front.",False,1664908285.0,t3_xv4yfx,t1_ir1hez7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Go back a few decades and it was more practical to fortify a position by digging trenches, essentially. Because most weapons had to fire directly at their targets. Put your tank behind a nice thick dirt wall, and it's really hard to attack. It meant there tended to be a lot of fighting along a static line followed by a breakthrough that allowed the advancing side to get behind the fortification and wreak havoc. And even then there was artillery that could drop shells down inside the fortifications.

Now there are 'shells' that are also missiles, they can identify when they're over a tank or some other target and shoot downwards. So sitting still is mostly asking to die. Ukraine is winning in no small part because they have been better at coordinating their movements. So in the early days they would withdraw while frequently sniping at the Russians moving forward. Hit the first and last tank in a convoy, stop the rest from moving until the wrecks are clear. Constantly wear them down. Russia needed to blanket am area with artillery to defend themselves. And then Ukraine got the HIMARS short range rockets, which are still longer range than the Russian artillery, and this.magnified their superior mobility. A truck can shoot those rockets from out of Russian artillery range, then drive away before return fire can be coordinated.

Ultimately though, Russia is defeating themselves because they are unwilling and/or unable to do coordinated retreats where they can wear down Ukrainian forces.

And you know what? That's a great idea. Does the company making the game pay taxes in Russia, indirectly supporting the war effort? If so, then review bomb that motherfucker to the ground. Wipe it off the face of the Earth. Drop those 0's.""

as for the quote as for how sanctions directly impact the people before the brass, yeah that's how it works. the issue is that literally the Russian people don't have control over their own situation at the moment. ruining a single indie dev's career over it isn't really going to accomplish much other than ruining their job in the middle of a massive recession. you don't make an activist, just a person homeless.

there's also other ways that the US and EU can use to target the oligarchs also: travel bans and asset seizure. not to say that sanctions are bad of course (they're **much** more than optional as of now) but the economic impact of targeting video game devs end of day will be negligible, nevermind how this would probably drive a good number of those devs to be more nationalistic by having a more direct link to their issues other than ""the war/nato killing the economy""
