The result is a culture that is deeply cynical towards politics and government and is habituated to taking the path of least resistance for survival. 

Furthering that point, soldiers were sent to Ukraine without being informed what they were doing. 

What is the consequence? Lack of solidarity, confusion about goals. They are given specific orders as to their next step but after any interruption in communication (I am speculating here) they don’t know how to take initiative and adapt, they’ve never been empowered to take initiative and have in fact spent their whole lives being informed that it is risky to do so when it comes to collective goals, and they don’t know the general plan anyway so even if they wanted to support it they wouldn’t know how until they get a specific command.

> It was echoed by the Russian embassy in UK today. 

> Let's take their claims one by one.

> Marianna Podgurskaya, the woman they claim to be a crisis actor, is indeed a beauty influencer who actually lives in Mariupol. Multiple recent images show she's heavily preganant, which is why she'd be at a maternity hospital yesterday.

France and Russia have a long history of intertwined political and artistic relationship. We've both been a major influence to each other over time, bouncing between admiration and conflict.

The dream of each French president when they are elected is to manage to normalize the relationship with Russia and maybe someday help it become a European nation like all the others. And of course they all fail because the current Russia does not care about being ""normal"", it still has imperialistic aspirations. It is not different for Macron: the first thing he did once elected was to invite Putin to Versailles to discuss the French-Russian relationship. Of course, like the others, he failed. I think Macron lost all his illusions about this relationship but as long as he's here he will always try to talk to Russia and find some diplomatic solution.

I believe it was his thinking that western reaction would be a linear progression from Crimea to Ukraine. Harsher, yes, but manageable economic pain. It was more of a risk assessment than a gamble. Turns out the progression of Western reaction was not linear, it was exponential. What can explain the geometric expansion of western revulsion to his adventurism as compared to the reaction to Crimea. One of the reasons, I think, is that Western intelligences have had a pretty good struggle with Russian internal meddling for the last several years, and there was a great deal of banked up desire in the west to see that put away. I think most western citizens have grown tired of it all. It felt like a threshold moment to everyone.

Putin will level as much of Ukraine as he can but be forced to withdraw.

Russians will hate the west extra more but Putin will live out his life in a bunker somewhere, well fed and providing green-screen addresses. Sanctions will remain in place but a black market will bypass much of it and it will be a bonanza for a few robber barons.

Since so many people look at the government for issues with gas prices, which last I checked would pretty much be a form of socialism, what I’m hearing is the US should just nationalize the oil / gas industry and remove the profit portion altogether.

Hear me out first, and please correct where I am mistaken.


I am told that Manpads and the anti air going to Ukraine can't take out supersonic jets or high flying tactical bombers.

However, I have seen zero reports of Russia using supersonic jets or high flying tactical bombers.

In fact, all the videos , articles, pictures, etc talk about or show Russian jets flying low and slow.  That the anti air we are sending Ukraine right now is effective and working.

That Russia is using ""dumb"" bombs that require their planes to fly low and slow.

Thanks  to these two facts that Kyiv has succesfully repelled all aerial attacks on them in the last two days.

I have also seen reports saying that Russia has good anti air capability set up in the south/ east.  Right now Ukraine is relying on the TB2 drone which is much smaller and apparently evades Russian AA detection.

  That Migs would be suspectible to Russian AA. With many of these longer range SAMs being behind the Russian border and out of tb-2 range.

Losing the stock market, the airplane industry, and the whole expropriation of foreign industries and assets is much worse as it has real and tangible consequences. Having no countries/companies that wish to engage in trade, losing skilled people, no support from the people that made the software or hardware you use, no one qualified wants to work with you anymore, or being able to buy parts.. thats an issue.

The default is another issue but not as big. Once Russia defaults, they will not be able to issue bonds in foreign currency in international markets. Considering no one (investments banks, large financial companies, countries) wants to give them money today, this is certainly not a problem for them. They can always issue bonds locally, that will not be very successful move, but they can do it.

People/companies could sue Russia and try to get paid for their debts by seizing certain assets, but thats a very long process and one very difficult to make it happen (you cant take over an embassy for instance, unless that country wants to start a war). It is not the same as when a company defaults. No country will force a war because you lost some money with a bond. There is no one that can force a country to comply (certainly not a judge from another country).

If they come back to the real world in 10 years they will pretty much have to pay back some of what they owe if you are lucky (at a discount), their new bonds will need to pay much higher rates that other countries (a bond from usa or france will pay you less because there is less risk they will default), but it is not the end of the world.

Just a bit of insight on this specific matter, coming from Argentina gave me some experience as I have certainly seen this before (default, technical default, lawsuits in foreign countries, paying back old debts, issuing new bonds, dealing with the imf, etc).

Hi everyone! I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to provide some alternative views to some common views by redditors I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.  
  
To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the discussion points below.  
  
Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…  
  
**View:** “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to organges.  
  
In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.  
  
In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.  
  
**View**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.  
  
**View**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine. As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.  
  
**View**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”  
  
**Alternative perspective**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…  
  
**View**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",False,1646933251.0,t3_tb3p09,t3_tb3p09,,0,19,0,19,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

I've pulled the numbers from all the previous threads, with roughly how many threads per day we are getting through and number of comments per day, etc.

We are currently running at around 4 threads per day. The status quo so far has been for the number to stay pretty steady and then half after 5 days.

For example:
Day 1-5 had between 13-17 threads per day
Day 6-10 had between 6-10 threads per day
Day 11-14 had between 4-5 threads per day

At this rate, day 15 I'll have 4 threads.

Day 16-20 will have between 1-3 threads on average.

From day 18-19 I would expect us to probably be averaging just one daily thread a day.

So for those asking if the threads will reach 4 digits. I hope not, because that will be in around 4 years, assuming we maintain a daily thread and it isn't eventually moved to a weekly thread.

This also assumes no other massive events taking place, which would obviously spike interest and activity.

They could still integrate further into the EU without being part of NATO, like Sweden and Finland.

I just worry that the longer this goes on and the more ground Russia gains, the more they’ll be able to control of the final outcome. Sadly, I don’t think it’s possible that Ukraine won’t have to cede to at least some of Russia’s demands. It’d be better for Ukraine to at least maintain economic autonomy vs. becoming a total Russian satellite state.

Edit: I will leave this post up even those it’s getting downvoted like crazy. We know that NATO is unwilling to intervene directly, no-fly zones are unlikely to happen, Russian forces continue to gain ground.

Even during the suprise attack when the Tet offensive was launched by the Vietcong, the US ended up winning that battle. However, it did cause morale to sink quite a bit. Which pretty much sums up most battles won in that war, it didn't do anything to win the hearts & minds in Vietnam or at home.

So far it looks like Russia has already lost many battles. Even if Russia ""wins"" the regular war in the long run, it will probably be considerably worse than how the US fared in Vietnam.

The French can at least act as the mediator and try coaxing Russia into eventually righting itself.

Ultimately Russia needs to get it's ass handed to it in all of this but afterwards there needs to be a push as well to encourage Russia to abandon the fallacy of East/West enmity that they've been unable to let go of all these years since the Soviet Union collapsed and that which Putin and his cronies exploited. That East/West mentality should have died at the end of the Cold War. It serves noone to continue it and Russia had it joined the rest of Europe would likely be a richer more powerful country with friends today if it had gotten a leader who knew this lesson.

France knows this lesson well as it had a bloody relationship with Germany for decades until the ruin of WW1 and then the greater Ruin of WW2 hit both of them.

Imo, I think it's clear that the quote has a long history, with it being most recognisable from Samuel Johnson onwards.  
I think Ethel Annakin, an educated and political woman in her own right, had probably read it in other works (including the several newspapers around the 1914 era) and although rephrasing it to what has become the eponymous quote, shied away from taking credit - as she had built it on the shoulders of other authors.  
I think this has stronger credence by the fact that her husband, Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden used it in his book written in 1916 (which still predates Hiram Johnson's alleged 1917 usage). I would suspect that potentially the two of them coined it together, as a political and well-read husband and wife duo, and neither wished to take credit over the other.  
I say alleged, about Hiram Johnson, because there is no confirmation (at least in that article) that he ever said it in 1917. The first evidence they could find was 1929 - which is quite significantly after the husband and wife duo of Ethel Annakin and Philip Snowden had used it. I think it's likely he had probably picked it up from Snowden's book, rephrased it to be more snappy (like how Ethel Annakin did it 1916), and received all the credit for it from the US press.   
I think it's quite a shame to not give credit to at least the earliest documented user of the quote, even if Hiram Johnson did publish it in 1917 (which seems like it has no documented proof). Especially as women - such as Ethel Annakin - are so often strongarmed out of history anyway, when they have such fascinating roles in politics in general and throughout history!",False,1646941947.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i0581xf,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

""Mariupol maternity hospital third to be destroyed in Ukraine, UN official says
Wednesday’s air strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol that reportedly left three people dead, including one child, marked the third time Ukrainian maternity hospitals have been destroyed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UN said.

The United Nations’ reproductive health agency said two other Ukrainian maternity hospitals had been attacked before Russia’s strike on a facility in the southeastern city of Mariupol yesterday, AFP reports.

The hospital in Mariupol is “not the only one” that has fallen under assault, Jaime Nadal, the Ukraine lead for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), told reporters today.

In Zhytomyr, the maternity (hospital) was completely destroyed. In Saltivsky, the maternity (hospital) was also destroyed.

Nadal did not specify who launched the other attacks or if there were any victims.""",False,1646934011.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i04qvs4,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

What they're doing is being stubborn, stupid and spiteful because ultimately they've already lost and secretly they KNOW this, even if they DO capture Mariupol, they won't be able to hold it indefinately the west has blackballed Russia's economy big time and the longer this goes on the more strength they lose until their whole country buckles under the weight of punishing sanctions.

Their only way out of this if they want the sanctions removed is basically to capitulate, they've blown any chance of victory by pissing off so many countries at once. They fucked up big time, killed innocent people and even threw their own people into a meat grinder for nothing. In the end it's the most humiliating Military defeat they've suffered since Tsar Nikolas II's decision to pick a fight with Japan in 1904 and ultimately they will have to give up ALL of Crimea as well as remove themselves from the Donbass because that's the price they're going to have to pay for attacking Ukraine.

Wow, I can't believe this is actually true. How did the birds not catch on fire while flying?

&#x200B;

>Olga then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulphur bound with small pieces of cloth to each bird. At nightfall, Olga told her soldiers to set the pieces aflame and release the birds. They returned to their nests within the city, which subsequently set the city ablaze. As the Primary Chronicle tells it: ""There was not a house that was not consumed, and it was impossible to extinguish the flames, because all the houses caught fire at once.""\[15\] As the people fled the burning city, Olga ordered her soldiers to catch them, killing some of them and giving the others as slaves to her followers. She left the remnant to pay tribute.

In 2014 Ukraine had just, and was still undergoing a change of leadership after they had to throw a dictator who got himself elected by promising to join the EU, but then sold out to Russia instead. At the time many supported Russia, supported the former President, but a larger majority wanted to join Europe. The differences were stoked by russian propaganda. And the Ukrainian army had a lot of 5th coloumnists who supported Russia. Russia took advantage of the still chaotic situation and took Crimea and organized ""the uprising"" in the East.

&nbsp;

2022: Noone supports Russia anymore. Even those who liked Russia back then, are *really* upset at Russias betrayal and theft of Ukrainian territory. There were MORE volunteers for the armed forces from the east than from the west. And the Ukrainians used the 8 years of Donbass conflict to galvanize their army, running tens of thousands of recruits through active combat to build experience. Took in tons of western advisors and trainers. Built confidence, built competence and more than anything built the good kind of nationalism and pride. All of this was readily apparent to anyone who paid attention. And Putin somehow didn't get that part.

Other notable mistakes are the two you mentioned, and how he has increasingly used terror and fear to rule.

The biggest pain in all of this is that while militarily the Russians could easily be crushed by NATO forces the danger is Russia lashing out or launching Nuke's in a chain of escalations. In the current situation the Russians cannot lash out at NATO or the EU without provoking them to attack, NATO can't get involved without provoking an escalation from Russia as they would have to attack Russian positions INSIDE Russia itself to neutralise their AA. 

That Being said at some point Russia isn't going to be able to keep it's internal discontent from boiling over. They can tell their people it's the west's fault but that means fuck all when your pay is worthless, businesses are closed and people are queuing up in Breadlines trying to keep the hunger at bay. Neither can they trigger general mobilisation, their own people would likely revolt and NATO would likely consider this an escalatory position and be forced to increase military readiness as well.

You know how Russia goes on about their new hypersonic missiles and the media eats it and regurgitates it back out again? 

Well the United States had a missile called the Sprint missile that was used as a defensive weapon and once launched from its silo could reach Mach 10 in 5 seconds. 

The nose cone was made of a material that would ablate so that it didn't self destruct under the intense friction. 

In warhead was another small nuclear bomb that would either send out an EMP or explode far enough away from people that they weren't killed by the blast. 

It was meant to be a last line of defense against ballistic missiles and this was 1975 technology. 

There are interceptors that can guide themselves to the warhead while it's still in space and impact them.  

The problem that hypersonic missiles raise is that instead of taking 30 minutes to reach their target like ICMBs they can be launched from a submarine and reach their target in less than just a few minutes.

I do know believe that Russia would have had the chance to field these in any substantial numbers yet.

THAAD, and land based patriot and seaborne aegis missiles are a good missile defense as well. It's been determined that using the hyper velocity projectiles meant for the planned railguns can give a regular howitzer performance that almost comes close to a railgun. Other methods of burning powder more efficiently, like ETC (electro-thermo-chemical) propulsion have a similar effect. The two technologies combined could.in theory create a weapon that makes building a railgun with our current resources unnecessary. Hence the scaling back of research in that field.

During World War II, the Soviet Union took parts of the Moldavian ASSR, which was dissolved, and of the Kingdom of Romania's Bessarabia to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1940. The present history of the region dates to 1990, amidst the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established in hopes that it would remain within the Soviet Union should Moldova seek unification with Romania or independence, the latter occurring in August 1991.

Kazakhstan refused to send troops to help Putin a couple days after the invasion started.

The Belarusian military refuses to cross the border, and the extent of their involvement is to let Russia use its border crossings and air fields. Lukaschenko thought he'd get a nice strong man photo op after the country was conquered, and now he's watching a meat grinder of Russian soldiers.

Russia was able to hire a few hundred Syrian troops, either mercenaries or Syrian Civil War vets, but they're slated to only do ""guard duty"". In coalition forces like that it's common for patron countries sending guys to put caveats on what their troops will and will not do.

Their only option was to move the rest of the invasion force, 150K guys, into the country. It's important to note that only a fraction of that force is meant to be the combat forces while the majority are supposed to be the support guys. So that's not 150K fighters, but it's likely Putin will push using more of those guys as cannon fodder, but that will only work to a point.

The original invasion force was about 170K guys + equipment so that's the max allocated to this invasion.

One of the retired US generals mentioned that the first thing they'd have to do is take out anti-aircraft weapons *in Russia*, which is the main problem with anyone else imposing a NFZ since it'd be an act of war. For Ukraine, do they really want to risk pilots doing that? You're right, Russia really isn't using their planes very much, mostly ground based weapons.  

I think it's more that planes for Ukraine would help with the convoys, but that's already being done with other weapons. In theory Russia could send in more planes, but they seem very reluctant to risk them, which is interesting. Personally I'd go for quietly getting some US drones, less risk for pilots and far more effective than the Turkish ones (obviously also cost a lot more, but it's not like Ukraine would have to pay for them...). Russia is using planes to drop bombs, but the UK Starstreak is going to be very useful there. 

The desire for a NFZ is understandable, but I also think they'd be huge targets for Russia's larger air force. Planes need maintenance and weapons would need to be located in a semi centralized location. Right now they can more around much more freely, so less of a target for Russia.

It seems to all point to Putin and his cronies in Kremlin being worried that their regime falls if they are forced to abort without achieving anything of consequence, after their original ""decapitate the government and blitz the rest of the country with troops"" plan fell apart due to miscalculations, arrogance, and incompetence. So now they're relentlessly pushing on likely in the hopes of swiftly shell-shocking Ukrainians enough to get a peace agreement which allows them to save face (and not end up mired in Afghanistan II which would end up with Russia's military being slowly ground to paste or be forced to withdraw without gaining anything).",False,1646941907.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i05a2b1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Russian_Ground_Forces

Hopefully someone that knows more about the tanks can answer this, but some potential reasons for holding the newer stuff back:

- Fear of newer equipment getting captured and giving their opponents vital info on their capabilities

- Older equipment may be easier to maintain in the field

- The T-80 looks like it's held back for use in arctic conditions.  It also uses more fuel than the T-72

- The T-90 was originally going to be called the T-72BU.  For one it has upgraded optics.

- There are different variations of the T-72.  Even though the overall platform is the same, inside and out the tank has gotten upgrades throughout the years.  Good platforms can last a really long time. Example: the B-52 had it's first flight in 1952.  The USAF expects to keep using them until at least 2050.  Though the airframe is the same, the electronics, control systems, and engines have been upgraded throughout the years.

- Russia might not have the available resources to fix and maintain a large number of their more modern tanks on the field",False,1646950171.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i05sx74,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Good discussion, too. Turns out during the cold war, the local fallout shelter was the locker rooms at the high school (LOL, no, zero protection) but there were some practical suggestions for what might work for the town, including one I hadn't thought about. We don't have a lot of deep basements and absolutely zero parking garages or tall buildings with sub-basements here. The few homes with basements generally are walk-in basements built into the side of a hill, so not really any protection.

There is not nearly enough shelter for the estimated 20K people in the area, unfortunately. Not even close. Might be able to fit a few hundred people into the locations suggested, and keeping them there for weeks would be impossible. No supplies and no room.

By your logic here, the cold war should have been full of conventional wars between the US and Soviet, with both sides just choosing not to use nukes. Except that didn't happen.

Thanks for the reply! I agree that we both most likely have pre-determined views on this situation but I would honestly like to try to better understand your certainty that Russia would use a nuclear weapon in response to being pushed out of Ukraine. Would you mind sharing your viewpoints and what evidence leads you to the conclusion that Russia would likely deploy a nuclear weapon for something like the situation in Ukraine?   
In my time at the UN and with Senate Foreign Relations, it was understood that Russia's true red line was Russian territory and that they were not willing or even likely to use a tactical nuke unless there was a direct threat to their territorial borders.   
I think Russia would be likely to use a nuke if Russian territory (maybe even Crimea) were encroached upon, but I am very confident that Russia would not use a nuclear weapon to project authority into Ukraine. Even Russia is walking back their nuclear escalation claims today. https://www.reuters.com/world/nuclear-war-russias-lavrov-says-i-dont-believe-so-2022-03-10/  
It is my opinion that NATO - or another group of allied powers - could draft clear rules of engagement that outline a clear intent to preserve the Ukrainian borders as they stood in January 2022. That is, Russia would still maintain control over their separatist regions and Crimea, but would need to forfeit the rest of Ukraine.

5% is... a lot. We don't know how much of that has been borne on primary fighting units - that Russian vehicle losses are closer to that 10% mark suggests that is a good bar.

And even then, losses aren't evenly distributed. Some units or batallions have seen heavier losses - seemingly those around the north.

Its not surprising thats where we've seen more pullbacks and stalls. Often, its assumed units can see up to 30% casualty rates before combat effectiveness is hindered. But, importantly, the strategists who write on this topic note that morale severely skews a unit's ability to maintain effectiveness in the face of losses.

In other words, some - if not many - of Russia's battalions are likely nearing the point where their combat effectiveness starts to decline, though this may be more true in the north. Their forces are fully committed (so far), so degraded units can't be replenished from new forces.

One thing we *dont* talk about is that we have no insight into how Ukraine's warfighters are faring. We have to assume significant casualties there as well. They have two primary advantages: one, they have much stronger morale, and they have some capacity to be replenished through TDF units, or other conscription methods. But losses of capable fighters hurts, and conscripts are often as harmful to units as not replenishing the unit.

I think many analysts expected that the Ukrainians would put up a military resistance that whilst keen, would quickly collapse, and that the civilian population would be mostly docile and compliant, with any further resistance being mostly token shows of dissatisfaction.

What they got instead was a nation proud of its identity and willing to defend its freedoms and way of life with a ferocity not commonly seen. Perhaps the years of subjugation the Ukrainian people have been subjected to, and the re-emergence of their national identity after decades of suppression, are things that unite and galvanise more than anyone anticipated.

I'm quite convinced neither Ethel Annakin, Philip Snowden nor Hiram Johnson coined the phrase, and I'll certainly agree that it seems unlikely Hiram Johnson actually said it in the speech referred to after researching it further myself.

Therefore I will change the quote attribution to ""Unknown"" for future publication.

 >In the context of war, perfidy is a form of deception in which one side promises to act in good faith (such as by raising a flag of truce) with the intention of breaking that promise once the unsuspecting enemy is exposed (such as by coming out of cover to take the ""surrendering"" prisoners into custody). Perfidy constitutes a breach of the laws of war and so is a war crime, as it degrades the protections and mutual restraints developed in the interest of all parties, combatants and civilians.

 >The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), derisively nicknamed the ""Star Wars program"", was a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles). The concept was announced on March 23, 1983 by President Ronald Reagan, a vocal critic of the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which he described as a ""suicide pact"". Reagan called upon American scientists and engineers to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete.

The bargaining chip to the West is the politicians saying, “Our sanctions prevented a greater travesty!” And he’ll let them say that so long as he keeps his gains. Of course, he will also ask for the alleviation of some sanctions.

His army is being decimated (literally, they've lost 10%) in Ukraine and those are unsustainable losses in a week. The more troops he commits to this war, the weaker the power he can project elsewhere. Even with mobilisation and conscription Russia will struggle to create troops as fast as the war consumes them. Also, no replacements for modern technical equipment (e.g. electronic warfare systems) because of the semiconductor embargo, so everything they lose in terms of new equipment is a permanent loss.

The only way out of an inevitable huge hit to the Russian armed forces (which will lead to either crushing defeat or the most Pyrrhic victory since Pyrrhus) is to escalate, and escalation may well result in NATO intervention - any kind of NBC weapon / WMDs used against Ukraine risks a NATO response.

Combine that with an economy that relies on imports, isn't self sufficient, and is seemingly on the brink of total collapse, and things really don't look great.

This is a real thing that afflicted all levels of the Soviet Union. 

>	“In the late 1970s, one of our double agents in Germany, who was really working for us but had tricked the CIA into thinking he was cooperating with the Americans, managed to win the trust of his U.S. handlers. Our double agent was preparing to return to work in the Soviet Union, and his CIA contacts had given him a featherweight, palm-size radio device so they could contact him inside the USSR. The gadget greatly enhanced the audibility of radio transmissions, so that when our double agent used his receiver on a certain wavelength, he would be able to pick up communications from the CIA that would be all but inaudible to us.

>	I knew that Andropov was fascinated with spy technology and the intricacies of the double agent game, so I brought him the small, elegant transmitter and reported on our success in running the double agent. We had scored a major coup, because this was the first time the KGB had gotten its hands on this latest piece of CIA hi-tech wizardry. Andropov turned the tiny “toy” over and over in his hands, obviously impressed with the engineering. He then asked the head of domestic counterintelligence, who was in the room, whether we had anything comparable. The counterintelligence man hemmed and hawed, finally saying he knew how the device worked and claiming that domestic counterintelligence was using similar receivers. But the experts at the equipment operations directorate had just informed me that they had never seen anything like this. I told Andropov so, and he seemed distressed.

>	The chairman then summoned his deputy for scientific and technical research, Nikolai Yemokhonov.

>	“Have you ever seen anything like that?” Andropov asked Yemokhonov.

>	“No,” Yemokhonov replied.

>	The research director asked me to describe what it did. Then Yemokhonov said casually, “It’s nothing special. We have similar devices. We could make one like that.”

>	Andropov shot Yemokhonov a look of displeasure and bored in on him.

>	“But you said you’d never seen one like that.”

>	“Well,” replied Yemokhonov, “we don’t have devices this size.”

>	“What size have we got?” asked Andropov.

>	“Ours weighs about a kilogram,” said Yemokhonov.

>	The American device weighed only a few ounces; everyone in the room knew that the bulky two-pound Soviet transmitters and receivers were a great hindrance in clandestine work.

>	Andropov had had enough.

>	“We spend so much money on technology and we still can’t produce modern equipment!” he exclaimed. “Can we at least reproduce this thing here?”

>	“No,” said Yemokhonov.

>	“But why not?” asked Andropov. “What is it that you don’t have?”

>	“We just don’t have the technology,” answered Yemokhonov, keeping his cool. “That is the reason our missiles are twice as heavy as the Americans’ and why if we wanted to reproduce a Mercedes car we’d have to hand-assemble it.”

>	Andropov’s reaction was surprisingly meek, and his recommendation for action utterly futile: “Let’s send a memo to the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers. How far behind we’ve lagged! We’ve got to put things right!”

The USSR was years behind the West at its manufacturing peak. At times, it was more like decades. Most of the ""best"" Soviet products were overbuilt versions of obsolete Western gear, which was great if you wanted rugged, rubbish if you wanted ergonomic and convenient. Soviet cameras were reasonable, most were decent copies of older Leicas without any finesse. Cars were... weird mishmashes of licence built Euro designs. Many other sectors were just shadows of the ""real deal"".

Russia lacks several of the most influential areas of the USSR, has suffered 30 years of brain drain, and its domestic manufacturing is a mere fraction of what the USSR could provide. It can't even meet domestic demands let alone export demands. Most of the USSR factories are gone and closed and outsourced. Even the few actually ""made in Russia"" interesting brands of today (Vostok are a watch nerd's secret) are interesting because they're archaic relics from another era, not because they're good.

Oh, and even the USSR never mastered CPUs, their microelectronics programme was, truthfully, pathetic.

The only people who could support Russia with their tech manufacturing needs are China and that's a fast way for them to join the group of pariahs who don't get access to Western tech and designs (which they don't have, and even the ones they reverse engineer they can't manufacture). All of their manufacturing customers from the USSR have turned to China, and China won't want some Russian upstarts wading in on the turf they've claimed.

This nuclear warning shot carries the risk of igniting a tit for tat uncontrollable nuclear escalation, or just a straight up misunderstanding that causes a nuclear exchange.

> The United States generally avoided taking sides between Japan and China until 1940, providing virtually no aid to China in this period. For instance, the 1934 Silver Purchase Act signed by President Roosevelt caused chaos in China's economy which helped the Japanese war effort. The 1933 Wheat and Cotton Loan mainly benefited American producers, while aiding to a smaller extent both Chinese and Japanese alike. This policy was due to US fear of breaking off profitable trade ties with Japan, in addition to US officials and businesses perception of China as a potential source of massive profit for the US by absorbing surplus American products, as William Appleman Williams states.[124]

> From December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay and the Nanjing Massacre swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to China. Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned iron ore exports in 1938.[125] However, in July 1939, negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Khatira and the British Ambassador in Tokyo, Robert Craigie, led to an agreement by which Great Britain recognized Japanese conquests in China. At the same time, the US government extended a trade agreement with Japan for six months, then fully restored it. Under the agreement, Japan purchased trucks for the Kwantung Army,[126] machine tools for aircraft factories, strategic materials (steel and scrap iron up to 16 October 1940, petrol and petroleum products up to 26 June 1941),[127] and various other much-needed supplies.

> On 24 July 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the US and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. This was a decisive moment in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long-term basis. It set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies, including the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.",False,1646940346.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i055emi,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Only one group has made this happen. The rest of the world has, in my opinion, failed to love their neighbor.

Russia will not be taken to task and sanctions are meaningless. They will not only embitter the Russia nation to the rest of the world, they could very well create the problems our children will deal with. 

The moral question is whether or not we (whoever we is, but in this case I mean the west) should be willing to discard our notions of comfort and peace for our brother, for our neighbor. If we decide to say no, as we have done (and I don't mean a nfz, I mean full on, end it now conflict) then we are not only enabling (by creating conditions in which it is possible) we are actively being helpful. If, on the other hand, we were to intervene and stop this, we would restrain those attempting to kill, destroy, and pillage, that is, we would stop those seeking harm.

Sure, we think the consequences are nuclear war, that that means we have to stay out and let it happen.

We are no different than the frat boy who watches another frat boy committ rape and do nothing to stop it. We say, well, I won't sell you stuff or buy your stuff, but you go ahead and keep going.

Some things are more important than money. Than safety. Than comfort. I find it morally bankrupt to stand by and think our soft soap matters. 

We either love our neighbor or we let him be consumed. Sure, we've given them weapons. And money. And they have resolve. It hasn't stopped the onslaught.

Ukraine isn't Poland, they are Czechoslovakia. Crimea and Donbas are the Sudetenland, the price we were willing to pay to preserve peace. Now Putin wants the rest of the pie and our leaders admit the only thing he will understand is force, yet the only thing they will use to stop him are words and restricted trade. News flash, dictators thrive in restricted trade. Germany closed their own economy to the outside world because it gave Hitler more control and an enemy to point to.

Ukraine trusted US and there is nothing you can say to convince me that every dead civilian isn't the result of our inaction. Putin threatens WW3 and nukes and we give him what he wants.

Now I think enough people are between Putin and launch that someone else would stop him. I no longer even really believe that the missiles are functional and I believe that US intel on the ground is so damned good I should believe Biden when he says something that definitive.

US intel has been...so...good. I'm proud to see America behaving as though they're actually a responsible world power. I'm also enjoying that Biden is essentially calling every shot and then siphoning SOME of their expertise into Ukraine and still kicking all of Russia's might around the block. Not to diminish the suffering of Ukrainians in the meantime, but I can't see the US doing it better with the agreements they have in place with other nations in order to not exacerbate tensions and add to collateral damage.

 >The Battle of Castle Itter was fought on 5 May 1945, in the Austrian village of Itter in the North Tyrol region of the country, during the last days of the European Theater of World War II. Troops of the 23rd Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division of the US XXI Corps led by Captain John C. ""Jack"" Lee, Jr., a number of Wehrmacht soldiers led by Major Josef ""Sepp"" Gangl, SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt-Siegfried Schrader, and recently freed French prisoners of war defended Castle Itter against an attacking force from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division until relief from the American 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th Division of XXI Corps arrived.

Plus, Taiwan has explicit military intervention from the US if attacked, which Ukraine does not - this is what such a nation can do *without* US forces being directly involved on the front line, if they were actually brought into play it would already be game over for the Russians.

US estimates for Ru casualties are between 5,000 to 8,000 KIA. A general was saying that you look at roughly a 3x increase in your casualty number for the number of wounded. Lets go with 5k as our 'hard' number for casualties, meaning there are ~15,000 wounded Russian soldiers as well. Combine this number with an unknown number of deserters and prisoners (not giving any number as we just don't know), you're then dividing this 'known' 20,000 people off the field by the number of deployed soldiers. 

Estimates were around 150,000 Russian soldiers were used for this operation (with expected Belorussian reinforcements that didn't show up), so you take that 20,000 out of the 150,000 and you're looking at roughly 1/8th of their fighting force has been removed from the field by injury or death. That is 12.5% of their total fighting force being diminished. When you factor in prisoners and deserters (I'm being extremely conservative), it's easy to see a few thousand people disappearing here which puts us in that 14% realm.

You also have to hobnob with rich donors to the college as part of the operation of the football team, and those donors are probably the same people who are running the local political action committies and large-scale campaign fundraisers in the state. Tuberville was also directly allied with Donald Trump and received campaign assistance from Trump's former White House press secretary.

Another big piece of the puzzle is Jeff Sessions - he used to hold that Senate seat, then was appointed by Trump to be the Attorney General of the US. Because of that, Alabama had to hold a special election to fill the seat in 2017, which *should* have easily gone to the Republican candidate, Roy Moore. Except that it came out at the last minute that Roy Moore was basically a pedophile, and he suffered a crushing, surprise defeat to the Democratic candidate. Meanwhile, Jeff Sessions ""betrayed"" Trump as the Attorney General by *recusing* himself in all matters related to Trump's ties to Russia in the 2016 campaign. Although this was the ethically right thing to do, it made Trump and Trump supporters kind of hate him. Sessions was eventually replaced by Trump, so he ran for his old Senate seat again in 2020. Tuberville managed to beat Sessions in the Republican primary that year basically because Tuberville was a new, friendly face who was a close ally to Trump, while Sessions was seen (by Republicans) as a deep-state beaurocrat. So I guess you could say Tuberville fell into the job because Sessions was too ethical to stay in Trump's favor, which is kinda awful because Sessions is a terrible racist piece of shit himself.

Now what we are seeing is targeting of hospitals. To me this is a sign of weakness not strength. They can't kill civilians rapidly enough to force a surrender. This may sound horrible but if you look at the numbers you realize it for fact.

They have killed and wounded around 5k civilians out of a population of 44m. And this is using all of the fancy toys like thermobarics. We don't know how much materiel is left, but according to FSB leaks they are running out quickly. The letter I read from two days ago (it was linked on this sub but would have to go digging), said that Russian would be compeltely out of munitions by June 15th. Three months from now if they continue at this rate they will not have hit 100k. Event factoring the complete fall of Mariupol, Nykaliev, the will not hit 500k. Complete slaughter of both cities would lead to a backlash and we would (in my estimation) see a no fly zone.

The destruction in Ukraine thus far has been great fodder for political theatre but not militarily significant, except for the taking of the nuclear plants. We'll see what happens with those, but I don't think Putin (or more to the point the people under him) are insane enough to initiate massive fallout zones in the country they wish to annex.

But you are correct, I have no way of knowing because 1. I know of no nation who's military would have me in my present state, given my age and my type 1 diabetes. But assuming I could, I have to believe it would be worth it.

See, I don't think that's the same. People dying, of course, is a tragedy. But to suppose that suddenly a vast wave of conventional weapons or of anything like it would suddenly occur is outside of the narrative by far. The USA and the UK are poised and capable of having soldiers, right now, in contact and fighting the enemy within 6 hours or less, including air and naval elements. If the information being given is correct that the Russian military has lost a great number of men and material then there fighting and response capabilities are all but spent. Nuclear weapons would fail to achieve any strategic aim. For them to do so would assume that Russia was capable of maintaining operational control of their assets which. I would wager a large sum of money, are already well tracked. We know for a fact that their entire intelligence system is low in quality.

I certainly don't advocate lightly. I advocate because I firmly believe that it is in the west's power, fundamentally the entirety of Nato or the west more generally to stop this, and to stop it before more people died.

Alas, I admit, the prospect of hundreds of thousands dead is not a treasured one, I have to say, morally speaking, all that is keeping them from conflict is by watching....and doing nothing. What happens when it's them next? A hundred thousand but not today, let the future deal with it?

Trump [called Tuberville](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/538704-tuberville-defends-account-of-trump-call-during-capitol-riot) on the afternoon of Jan 6; during the attack itself. It's not entirely clear what Trump wanted to talk to him about, or what his response was. The way Tuberville tells it, it was a very short call during which Tuberville didn't really say anything except ""I've got to go"", but he could easily be lying. Personally, I would speculate that Trump was basically trying to ensure that there were Senators on his side who would go along with his plan to have Pence override the electoral college count, *or* just talk to someone in the building who would further convince/pressure Pence to enact said plan.

So... yeah, Tuberville is very close to the heart of the insurrection, clearly.

 >The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent the aeolian processes (wind erosion) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves: 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the High Plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.

You think it is a near certainty that Russia will fire a tactical nuclear 'warning shot', because of NATO intervening directly in Ukraine. Correct? 

I don't think that they will - I think they need the ""nuke card"" for a fallback if NATO decides to intervene in Ukraine in order to make sure NATO or any unfriendly neighbors don't try to take territory from Russia after an offensive in Ukraine.... and I think that is supported by these things...

1) the fact that the logistics needed on the ground to deploy a tactical nuke have not even begun the earliest stages of preparedness. ^(1)

2) Russia knows members of congress in the US are calling for a no fly zone or increased intervention, yet Russia is signaling that they do not want to ratchet up the threat of nuclear war as recently as today ^(2)

3) US Intelligence has claimed... “We assess that Russia does not want a direct conflict with U.S. forces,” the document by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. “Russia seeks an accommodation with the United States on mutual noninterference in both countries’ domestic affairs and U.S. recognition of Russia’s claimed sphere of influence over much of the former Soviet Union.”^(3)

4) In terms of realpolitik - Russia has nothing to gain from deploying a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine / against NATO forces. The only outcomes would be bad for Russia. Either it starts a nuclear war and Russia no longer exists, or it creates an even more enhanced global condemnation against Russia losing its few remaining key allies - that are now Russia's only lifeline to fix its economy. 

It is my opinion that NATO should make a crystal clear rules of engagement that NATO will push Russia out of Ukraine as far as Crimea and the Separatist held regions and then stop short of the Russian border. But, NATO will not tolerate any member-state setting foot in Russia.

I don't think there is any need to call ""NATO intervening in Ukraine"" anything else than just a NATO/Russia war.

I think invading Russian territory is well well well past the point of a warning shot. I think Russia would be making full use of tactical nukes by the point that NATO troops had crossed into Russia. Not with the intent to escalate, but to deter and to physically stop the NATO advance, because they lack other effective means to stop NATO. But NATO knows this so it wouldn't come to that point, its almost silly to discuss a conventional NATO invasion of Russia because it would just lead to unrestrained nuclear use.

Just to respond to you point by point:

1. If the situation called for it, Russia would not stop itself from firing a nuclear warning shot just because they lack the immediate logistics to deploy a short range ground based nuke in the local vicinity of Ukraine. The article you linked is making strange assumptions. A detonation over the black sea doesn't have to be fired from a location anywhere near Ukraine. Similarly I don't see why Russia cant fire a mid range low yield missile from its territory at a target near Ukraine. That article also makes some wild claims about a single strategic nuke destroying an entire state, which is certainly, certainly not true. I think that may be a bad source.
2. Russia has always maintained a strategy of signaling publicly like this. One day they are conciliatory and the next they are hell bent on war. What Russian officials say does not change the underlying planned contingency of a military scenario.
3. This is absolutely true, but once a conflict has already begun, Russia would have to do what makes sense for itself militarily (nuclear warning shot).
4. It is the deterrent aspect that matters here. NATO knows that Russia is expected to fire a nuclear warning shot, and Russia knows that NATO knows, and NATO knows that Russia knows that NATO knows, etc. That is why NATO will not intervene in Ukraine. It is in absolutely no ones interest because a war with Russia would lead to that nuclear warning shot, and the possible resulting escalation.

And after all of that, there is the fact that the Russian regime can be expected to take action to preserve itself, at any cost. Not the Russian people, but Putin's regime. If NATO intervenes and defeats Russia in Ukraine, and all of this was for nothing, Putin and his regime are doomed. In that sense, his only real option is to fight back against NATO, and his only way to fight back against NATO is to stop them in their tracks with a nuclear warning shot. He essentially has no choice but to take that risk logically in a hypothetical war with NATO.",False,1646944747.0,t3_tb3p09,t1_i05cm0c,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Nuclear winter is a severe and prolonged global climatic cooling effect that is hypothesized to occur after widespread firestorms following a large-scale nuclear war. The hypothesis is based on the fact that such fires can inject soot into the stratosphere, where it can block some direct sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth. It is speculated that the resulting cooling would lead to widespread crop failure and famine.
