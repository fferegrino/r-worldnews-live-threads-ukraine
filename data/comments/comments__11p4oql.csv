Day 381-382 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were pretty much completely quiet, there were no missile or drone strikes, but as usual we still had some air raid alerts. I guess the only notably bad thing that happened in our city is that some guy killed himself with a grenade in one of the residential districts, and we don‚Äôt know why it happened. There was no follow up to this story as far as I know, it could have been either mishandling or suicide.

The electricity is already almost completely restored after the last missile strike. There are still some problems, like simply not having enough of it and voltage not being strong enough, but that‚Äôs just because the infrastructure is still being repaired, which is why there are some limitations in place right now, along with emergency blackouts (though those are rare and most of the time very short). 

For example, right now our electric public transport doesn‚Äôt work and our subway has increased intervals between train arrivals to 15 minutes instead of the usual 4-5 minutes, but that is to be expected. The situation should improve pretty soon anyway, just yesterday we had no heating or hot water in the tap, but it was already restored this morning, because our repairmen are absolutely incredible.",False,1678666961.0,t3_11p4oql,t3_11p4oql,,0,176,0,176,0,0,

‚ÄúWagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin said that he would transform the Wagner Group into a hardline ideological elite parallel military organization after the Battle of Bakhmut. Prigozhin stated on March 11 that the Wagner Group will start a new wave of recruitment after the envisioned capture of Bakhmut and reform itself into an army with an ideological component.[5] The Wagner Group has recently been expanding recruitment centers throughout Russia, including centers and programs focused on recruiting youth.[6] A Russian regional news source stated on March 11 that the Wagner Group has opened six recruitment centers in schools and youth sports clubs in Altai, Zabaykalsky, and Krasnoyarsk krais and Irkutsk Oblast.[7] A Russian opposition news source reported on March 11 that the Ministry of Education in Apatity, Murmansk Oblast included Wagner personnel at a career guidance lesson to tell ‚Äúheroic stories‚Äù and promote the Wagneryonok [‚Äúlittle Wagner‚Äù] youth group and summer camp in Crimea.[8] The Wagner Group likely aims to recruit more impressionable recruits through these youth-focused campaigns and instill in them Prigozhin‚Äôs extremist ideological brand of Russian ultranationalism.

By Stuart Ramsay, chief correspondent.

Ukrainian fighters say civilian bodies are lying on the streets of Bakhmut and they're unable to retrieve them because of the intensity of the battle raging in the eastern city.   

Speaking to Sky News by phone Khalid Makiazho, part of a Ukraine-supporting Chechen battalion described a landscape of utter devastation, continuous barrages of artillery, and ""chaotic shelling"".  

He says remaining civilians are cowering in basements, and only come out to get food.

""There are people in the city still, some of them are very old, there are also dead bodies of civilians, we are trying to retrieve the bodies but there is no way to get to them.""

Crucially, Khalid Makhiazo says that the Russian forces have not taken the centre of Bakhmut, and were still on the outskirts, despite their claims.  

But he conceded things can change on the ground incredibly quickly. 

""They're on the outskirts, yes they are there, but the city is under our control. I think the fighting will go on... there will be a fight and we will not give up the city just like that.""

>If the UA Army retreats from Bakhmut, the next defensive line would be very close to the administrative border of Luhansk. From here it won't be very difficult for the Russians to seize the entire Luhansk. Even if it might take many months, it won't matter that much to them

>because they have the resources and enough cannon fodder. After that they will go full defense mode and according to every military strategy manual, the attacker loses around 3x more men and resources than the defender. Right now UA is defending but if Bakhmut gets conquered 

>the status will reverse. Which means NATO will have to send 3x more ammunition and weapons to Ukraine given the fact most stocks are already depleted and in some NATO countries the support for UA starts to fade away slowly. For example, at the beginning 

>of the war 60% of Americans were in favor of sending weapons to Ukraine while last month according to a public poll the support dropped to 48%. And it might continue to go down if the living standard continues to deteriorate.

Other rules apply to decommissioned systems than to other Swiss weapons, especially since those of the Rapier type were manufactured by Great Britain.

> According to a Federal Council decision from 2006, foreign weapons systems can be sold back to the country of manufacture without any conditions once they have been decommissioned.

> However, there are no plans to deliver the systems in question to the UK. On the contrary, the Swiss Armed Forces are currently in the process of scrapping the 60 Rapier systems in three tranches, as Armasuisse spokesman Kaj-Gunnar Sievert confirmed to the ""NZZ am Sonntag"".

And then what? They complain that UA defends Bakhmut? 
>Multiple administration officials have begun worrying that Ukraine is expending so much manpower and ammunition in Bakhmut that it could sap their ability to mount a major counteroffensive in the spring

What UA is lacking, is ammo and armor. But lets not give UA tools they need to win, and then state that ""it hinders chance for counter offensive"". I think that Ukraine getting Abrams in 2024, not getting new planes and no ATACMS (and new gliding bombs when? September?) hinders chances for successive offensive more.

So Russia is entitled to UA soil because it ""captured it nearly a decade""? Because ""escalation"". How about you strangle Russia so hard, they will beg you to give Crimea and all other occupied lands away for removal of harsh sanctions? 

Instead it puts pressure on Ukraine and paints us as ""unreasonable"" for not wanting to deal with known cheats and liars, who proven that they WILL break all and any deals you make with them.

This essentially means that the russian armed forces are rapidly being de-mechanized. I suspect we're going to see many more days like this.

On another note the AA loss figures deserve a mention. russia has tons and tons of AA systems so the losses in a vacuum aren't that dire for them. The interesting development here however are the drone/missile attacks on russia proper. Ukraine is essentially forcing russia to choose whether to focus their AA over high-value targets within russia or on occupied territories. Early in the war russia didn't have to make that choice so the air cover within occupied territories was probably much stronger than now. Even though RUAF has lots of AA systems they also have so much territory to cover that it's slowly but surely becoming impossible to  keep all territories within a 1000 km radius protected. The air cover is going to start unraveling for russians sooner rather than later. Once it does, we will see the effects in either many more successful strikes on russia proper or as an inadequately protected air space during the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Lastly obviously even though RUAF has a lot of AA systems they probably don't have an equivalent number of trained men to man them all at once. Each loss of of an AA system thus may mean a loss of AA personnel that will deteriorate AA capability in the short-medium term more than the figures themselves would suggest.",1678605156.0,1678603931.0,t3_11p4oql,t1_jbwgcd0,,1,95,0,95,0,0,

The reason I don't like it is it's not measurable or influential in decision making when it happens. It's just something we assess after the fact.

An attacker isn't thinking about culminating but about an effective use of resources to achieve goals. The defender isn't thinking about it apart from a dream for it to happen soon, it's not changing decision points, it's about resources to task.

None. Nada. Zilch. There are guesses aplenty, however I think, from aggregating the Ukrainian news about families of dead soldiers and related periphery information, that the numbers have been considerably smaller than losses on the side of Russia, where the Russian state's laughably bad coverup of these numbers paradoxically puts them into high relief. 

Given the nature of the battles we've seen since the start of this war, I have no reason to believe the loss ratio has *ever* been 1:1, even on Ukraine's worst days. Ukraine values the lives of her soldiers, and given a bad situation will withdraw them. And 1:1 losses is a terrible trade given Ukraine's situation. Completely unacceptable. 

But to your question, the more important thing we can take from this is that anyone claiming to actually *know* these numbers, to have *real* information, is at best talking out their ass in panicky, self-important speculation, or more likely spouting Russian propaganda. Either way they are not worth listening to, as you will likely be less informed after listening than before you started. 

Twitter is sometimes the only source of information from the frontlines, but we cannot forget that Twitter is an absolutely terrible source of factual information. There are so many people and bots pretending to be people is can be impossible to sort fact from fiction, or propaganda from some kid in Canada pretending he's on the front lines.

Then again, it isn't the most comparable situation, because Russia withdrew in its own as it was cut off from supplies, due to their positions being practically an island divided by the Dnieper.

Vlad had experience with impaling people on spikes through the anus so the person would live for days while being unable to get themselves down. They would slowly slide down onto the spike until it ruptured something vital and they died. So the enemy came across thousands of their own men screaming in pain. The enemy turned around and went home.

The Kremlin pumps out plenty of propaganda so the Russian public will never know the truth. Not only that, but it is believed that Putin and the Kremlin also believe their own propaganda.  

I can understand a dictator with a massive ego believing their own greatness, but it's rather dangerous for the government to also believe their own lies. That leads to mistakes and overconfidence.  

Julia Ioffe said even the elites in Russia believe the propaganda.  

As for the public, generally speaking the older demographic tend to get their news and information from the Kremlin controlled TV. They tend to believe the propaganda and also be pro-Putin. The younger demographic tend to get their news online. They tend to be more anti-Putin.  

The level of support towards Putin depends on location too. Those in the biggest cities tend to be more anti-Putin than those out in the most rural areas.  

All of that is kind of meaningless at the moment though. Before the war the brutal police would beat the hell out of an anti-Putin protestor and the ""justice"" system would cripple them with debt for the rest of their life. As a Russian told Julia Ioffe, if a man knocks on your door and asks if you support Putin you say yes. That goes all the way back to the KGB and secret police fears of the Soviet Union.  

It's that bad now that many children, not just adults but *children*, are being detained by the police for anti-war protests. Even the FSB is involved in investigating such cases.

They simply regurgitate what's in the air and summarize it, without any fact-checking. They do not employ fact checkers, there's no budget for that. Thus sometimes they get it right, and sometimes get things very wrong, and it can be quite hard to tell the difference. They lean right-wing, but that seems a combination of the sources they are aggregating and the eyes they tailor their clickbait for, because they need those eyes to survive, rather than by purposeful intent. 

What this adds up to is a systemic unreliability and surface, often hot, takes on complex subjects. You can easily end up less informed and not realize it because you have been given bad information as hard fact when the truth is more complex. Summarizing complex situations is hard work and they don't have the staff for it. They don't hire researchers. 

FOX has a known agenda, and says what it says with a purpose. The Daily Mail is a dismissible tabloid that sensationalizes to draw in readers with lurid details. Newsweek was once a very credible news magazine that has fallen on the skids and now must do what it does to survive. I don't think they are outright trash, or lying for profit like some of the others, but they simply don't have the talent they once did. They don't hire proofreaders, and it often shows in the writing, sometimes ridiculously. One article I read was so badly written I got curious and did the research to figure out what the fuck happened to them, and so now I relate that to information to you. They're a brand slowly burning what's left of their goodwill and it's a shame. I envision an office with like six people in it, but I don't know the facts on that. Maybe just freelancers, an editor , an accountant and an IT guy.

Newsweek can get it right, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they try, but unfortunately as I said I can't really trust them to so at this point I avoid them. That, at least, is my take on the situation.

The most generous theory I've seen is that they have a pile of troops just north of the eastern front and are waiting for a breakthrough to cause the Ukrainians to divert and commit their reserves to plugging the gap, however I haven't heard any substantiation of that in some time.

So at the moment the way it looks is that when things dry up, russia's approach will not change, but Ukraine may go on the offensive somewhere. I suspect they are setting things up like they did for Kherson/Kharkiv. Make it seem like they are focused in one area (in this case Bakhmut) to get russia to divert supplies and troops, feeling it's safe.

That's about all they accomplished with all their newly mobilized troops from last summer/fall. They don't have the manpower or equipment to launch a similar push after the mud season.

There were no changes in the agreements. It is completely normal that a country can block the re-export of weaponry to third countries, the swiss simply passed a law which makes them automatically unable to grant any export permits into conflict zones. They are very well able and allowed to deny such exports regardless of having such a law.

The consequences of the law are coming into play in current and future exports as countries would be unable to get resupplies for ammunition once they're in a war. The exports to Ukraine are honestly just revealing the issue but not the real problem for any customer of swiss weaponry. Which by the way is not just germany, but pretty much every western country in some capacity. Ignoring the swiss veto would be more of a problem than not as that result in tons of other countries doing the same thing with weapons of german, US, UK, french or whatever origin whenever they want to.

Why is it not perfect? Because a perfect world Russia would not have invaded Ukraine causing untold death, in a perfect world Ukrainians would not be dying to have the right live in their land under their own democracy, in a perfect world Ukrainians would have already pushed Russia to their border, in a perfect world Ukrainians would not be dying to a bloody battle in the city of Bakhmut.

Ukraine is winning the war, and it is paying dearly for it. And only Ukraine can choose its own path and all we can do is help it along. But pretending there is no hardship and everything is rosy is a disservice to the literal hell they are going through.

So no, I'm not gonna pretend like a lot of you do that everything is going perfect, because that is not what war is. Sometimes you are winning and sometimes the other guy is winning especially when it's seemingly a stalemate.

I agree, they'll make it work, to an extent, but there's a point at which your soldiers can't get within miles of the front without walking, and in those conditions walking is going to take many times longer than it should. Good luck getting supplies to the front on time when it's a five mile walk through thick mud.

Edit: [Here is a lovely video posted further up the thread that perfectly illustrates the point I am making.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/11pat1x/mud_season_is_in_full_effect_at_the_front/) I cannot see a civilian bus being able to make it across such terrain, meaning that soldiers travelling by said bus would end up walking at least some distance to reach staging points near the front.
