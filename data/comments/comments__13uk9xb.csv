Day 458-460 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were definitely not the quietest. Well, other than usual strikes aimed at the towns in Kharkiv oblast, it was mostly quiet here in the city itself, but at the same time other cities have been getting attacked with drones and missiles much more much more than usual. There was even that massive Shahed attack in Kyiv yesterday, which was the biggest one in this war yet, thankfully almost no drones made it through.

I’m really not sure what they are trying to achieve by spending so many drones and missiles attacking Kyiv. So, they are trying to destroy our air defense to do what exactly? To be able to attack civilians with impunity yet again? They will never be able to suppress air defense enough to do bombing runs over our cities, this isn’t WW2, now planes can be easily shot down with MANPADS if they are close enough to drop bombs, so that’s not an option for the Russians.

The only strike of theirs that actually made sense is that one strike aimed at our airbase, but that’s what, a couple of missiles max out of 40-50 missiles total, plus about as many Shaheds? While it is good for us that most of Russian strikes are completely nonsensical, I still wonder why they choose the targets that they choose. I guess they still think that they can somehow make us fear them, but that’s never going to happen no matter how many times they try.

Despite of how frequent, and comparatively big, the strikes in the past couple of days have been, it’s just amazing to see how effective our air defense has become. Less than a year ago it was only about 50-60% effective, but now over 90% of all air targets get intercepted, which is just crazy. Even the ballistic Iskanders that they fired at Kyiv today were intercepted, something that we couldn’t do just a couple of months before. And just now a new air raid alert has started in Kyiv, so a new attack is most likely imminent. I guess Russians really can’t stop doing their stupid attacks for whatever reason.",False,1685402305.0,t3_13uk9xb,t3_13uk9xb,,0,108,0,108,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 29 May 2023.  


* On 24 May 2023, Russia conducted a security exercise around the Crimea Bridge, which links the Russian city of Kerch to the occupied peninsula. This included the creation of a smoke screen, partially masking the bridge.  

* The smoke screen was laid by TDA-3 truck-mounted smoke generators, likely of the 28th Brigade of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops.  

* Russian doctrine considers the use of smoke part of maskirovka (camouflage and deception) - upon which it places strong emphasis.  

* However, in practice, Russian maskirovka has generally been ineffectual in the Ukraine war, likely because of a lack of a strong central planning function and poor low-level battle discipline.

No casualties have been recorded so far in Monday’s attacks, according to early reports from city officials, in what was the 15th nightly air raid this month.  
>  
>**Key developments**  
>  
>- **Monday’s attacks come a day after Russia dispatched a record number of drones — 54 in total, according to Ukrainian authorities** — aimed mostly at the capital. “With these constant attacks, the enemy seeks to keep the civilian population in deep psychological tension,” Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said Monday. Fires broke out, and a number of buildings were damaged by falling debris.  
>  
>- **Ukraine’s air force intercepted 37 cruise missiles, 29 Iranian Shahed drones and one intelligence-seeking drone during the overnight raids**, which military officials said targeted military facilities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine. Up to 40 missiles and 35 drones were launched by Russian forces, they said. The Washington Post could not immediately verify the claims.  
>  
>- **New sanctions from Ukraine would apply commercial, financial and technological restrictions on Iranian citizens**, according to draft legislation shared Sunday by Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office. Iranian flights and the transit of resources through Ukraine would be terminated, and Iranian citizens would be prohibited from withdrawing money from Ukraine.  
>  
>- **U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken begins a five-day visit to Sweden, Norway and Finland on Monday to discuss support for Ukraine**, among other matters, the State Department said. He will also attend a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Oslo.  
>  
>**Battleground updates**  
>  
>- **The campaign of drone strikes launched by Russian forces Saturday night was the largest since the start of the war**, with most of the Iranian-made drones targeting Kyiv, according to analysts at the Institute for the Study of War. This strategy of striking the capital rather than military targets is limiting Russia’s ability “to meaningfully degrade Ukrainian offensive capabilities for the upcoming counteroffensive,” the Washington-based think tank said.  
>  
>- **Although there haven’t yet been shock maneuvers of the kind that reshaped the war** in the fall, Kyiv is signaling that its long-awaited spring counteroffensive may be underway.  
>  
>- **Fighting around the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut remains subdued amid an apparent shift in command** between departing Wagner Group mercenaries and regular Russian troops. That could provide an opening for Ukrainian forces to launch a new round of attacks around the city, ISW analysts said.

There is the increase in Ukrainian strength, from Molotov cocktails used by thrown together territorial defense units, to NATO trained and equipped battalions using leopard 2s. Whatever drones they could find on Ali express with crude explosives attached, to himars and storm shadow. Minimal air defense coverage to Patriot systems shooting down almost everything around kyiv. 

On the contrary, Russia has gone from an all out assault from land, sea and air, equipped with vast stocks of Soviet equipment, and significant numbers of modern equipment, to their fleet hiding in the Black Sea for fear of something exploding on top of it, the airforce cautiously holding back behind friendly lines and only firing from distances that won’t get them shot down in return, and the land forces getting mauled so badly that they’ve had to replace parts of them with prisoners and mercenaries, and their equipment with museum pieces. Their missiles mostly seem to collide with air defense nowadays, and their allies are slowly distancing themselves from the crumbling Russian empire.

>Soldiers are being withdrawn from the Luhansk region for the defense of Belgorod, an incident in Lysychansk, and other news on May 26th.

>Since the night of May 24-25, units of the Russian Armed Forces have started to be removed from the Luhansk region and sent to the territory of the Belgorod region. According to information from military sources, the most combat-ready units were being withdrawn from the Krasnyi Luch direction. Apparently, this concerns the units of the 76th Airborne Division and several motorized rifle brigades that gained significant combat experience during the invasion of Ukraine.

>""Moscow demands to ensure the security of the border. Border guards and mobilized troops stationed in the Belgorod region are not suitable for this task. Combat-experienced units are needed. Otherwise, it would be impossible to withstand Ukrainian attacks. Therefore, a decision was made to withdraw combat-ready units from the front line, replacing them with units from reserves,"" explains an officer of the Russian Armed Forces from the headquarters of the task force in Ukraine.

>According to reports from three sources in the task force headquarters and units located in the Luhansk region, the withdrawal to Russia currently applies only to units located on the territory of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). In total, it is planned to relocate between 12,000 and 15,000 personnel and equipment. The equipment will be withdrawn from reserves, not from the front line.

>This means that the Russian Armed Forces are definitively transitioning to a defensive posture even in areas where they had previously attempted to demonstrate activity (Krasnyi Luch, Belogorovka, and the Zherebets River).

>Sources in the task force headquarters also claim that work is being prepared to strengthen the border in the Belgorod region from Shebekino to Valuyki. This includes the installation of minefields, mining bridges and roads, and the creation of a ""clean"" zone ranging from 3 to 7 kilometers deep into Russian territory.

>Due to the withdrawal of units from the front line, confusion has arisen in the Luhansk task force, which was exploited by the fighters of the ""Storm-Z"" unit in Lysychansk on the evening of May 24. ""Storm"" is part of the Ministry of Defense formations and is composed of prisoners. 39 soldiers killed their officer (usually officers in such units are former members of the LPR and DPR armed forces) and, together with weapons, headed somewhere towards the Rostov region. This information has been confirmed to us by the headquarters in the Luhansk region and the task force headquarters. According to rumors, the deserters left not only with rifles but also with grenade launchers, machine guns, and, allegedly, an armored personnel carrier (BTR). We are not entirely convinced about the capture of the BTR because it is more difficult to take it than to leave it behind, but we admit that the soldiers could have taken rifles and handheld machine guns with them.

>Incidents of desertion have increased across the entire territory of the Luhansk region in the past 24 hours.

So Russia will keep on bombarding Kyiv and while Ukraine air defence have become pretty solid, I think it could be a matter of time until something manage to get through and destroy these big apartment buildings.

What is happening? I have no idea, the elites in Russia might be proping up Prickozin to challenge Putin in the upcoming presidential election. Yea, elections are not free and fair, but the elites might decide to just work the fraud in his favor or for once, allow free elections and sell Prigozin as the Putin alternative and to claim Russia is democratic.

Putin and really, almost no Russian leader can justify pulling out of the war. But Prigozin has been making a lot of ""soldier lives"" and ""war is hell"" videos. In a scenario where he defeats Putin in an election, if the elites just want to end the war, he might be able to end the war and blame it all on Shoigu or Putin. If it happens in a coup he has questionable legitimacy, but if the siloviki and oligarchs make him win in elections he has all the legitimacy he needs.

Why are russia security forces allowing Progozin rallies and not enforcing the bans? We dont know the inner working of the dictatorship. Does Putin still has power or has he been told by elites if he cant win before next election he will be gone? Is he a sitting duck in the kremlin while other unseen people take the choices like allowing Prigozin to hold rallies? Of course expect a Yeltsin type of no accountability deal so he leaves quietly if this is what is happening.

Also, Prigozin has reportedly been in contact with Ukranian intelligence. He has videos in Bakhmut, why hasnt he been hit with a missile? It would be the biggest PR hit for Ukraine. Maybe there are some dealings behind the scenes and there are talks with him to withdraw once he replace Putin. This would also put in perspective the proposals for an unpaid 6 work week with 2 extra work hours each day. If the move is to have Prigozin win an election against Putin, this would ensure even a rock wins against him in non rigged elections.",1685411753.0,1685410998.0,t3_13uk9xb,t3_13uk9xb,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

It's all well and fine to call out the Russian people for not standing up more for freedom and prosperity (not only for Ukraine, but even for themselves too). However, as it stands currently, Russians have basically only one option right now to fight for real change, and that's joining the Freedom Legion. And while they absolutely should, the Freedom Legion is still not well known at all in Russia (except what may be shown in Kremlin media as terrorists and extremists), and they lack both physical support as well as political / geopolitical support. 

What I hope to see in the future:
1. More efforts made to prepare and form an actual potential opposition government. Having the fighters to challenge rule is a start, but they need to have actual political figures and a political structure behind them, one that offers a credible ""transitional"" government or at least a plan for if / when Putin is overcome. Right now there is some will to resist and fight, but there currently isn't a clear idea or plan to fight for. More Russians will be interested in fighting if they know who they are backing, and have some idea of what victory actually looks like in real terms. There will be justifiable concerns that toppling Putin will just lead to instability at best, or a complete collapse and devastation of the country at worst. 

Ilya Ponamarev seems to be trying to organize this, but unfortunately he's not taken very seriously in Russia. Getting people like Schulmann and Katz on board would be a big step, although the former seems averse to actually participating in politics and Katz is turning out to be just as much a ""stooge"" oppositionist than what already exists in Moscow. 

2. Political support from other countries. This likely isn't feasible until the first condition is fulfilled, and even then unfortunately it's probably unlikely to happen. With a viable political structure and figureheads, the west and other countries could possibly declare Putin's regime as illegitimate and show support for the opposition-in-exile. They could justify that by pointing out that the only path to peace (and long-term security) is by dealing with the opposition government rather than Putin's administration. 

If that were to happen, it would give the wealthy Russian class a strong incentive to throw their weight behind the opposition as well, since it would be their best shot at returning to the international market.

This would be walking a fine line for the west though, and they'd certainly be reluctant to overtly support regime change like that.

The systems used to protect Kyiv would be very dangerous for Russia if they could be moved closer to the front.

A lot of reasons for this, foremost is their weapons are not as accurate as they said they were, and they don't have good ""by the second"" recon beyond very close to the front. So they have to go for stationary targets that they feel will impact the war in some way; and the Russian command has decided that hitting civilian targets especially in the Capital of Kyiv is their best option. The thinking being if they can make life shit enough, then the people will force Zelensky to come to terms and just give up. 

But part of this tactic requires the citizens under fire to feel like they have no defense, to just be huddled and scared as missiles hit them with impunity. So Russia needs to knock out the Air Defense in some way. So Russia started to try to swamp Kyiv and other cities with cheap Iranian drones; these are basically small planes with a lawnmower engine, and some explosive in the nose. They are slow, cheap, and the hope was that Ukraine would waste it's AA rockets that cost millions on them, opening up the city to Russian missiles. However Ukraine has largely developed a SOP of using Guns on the drones, and rockets on the missiles. And even set up MORE NATO AA systems like NASAMS and Patriot in Kyiv.

So Russia brought out it's ""Big Guns, it's ""Unstoppable"" hypersonic missiles; that were supposed to have no counter at all. The idea was this superweapon would scream past all defenses and take out the Patriot system Ukraine had, showing ""RUSSIA STRONK!!!!"" to the whole world...Patriot swatted the Kinzhal  from the sky. Russia was butthurt, said this was just a fluke of some kind, and launched 6 more from different directions along with other missiles...

In fact even the regular army is split up according to the regions they occupy and the Kremlin has been changing the command structure in a near constant fashion. Partially this is because of failures, but something else is going on at the same time. Anyway, what is interesting to observe here is that Putin is fighting two wars at the same time. One for Ukraine and one for his own survival. He knows that success in the Ukraine could be his downfall. Failure could be too, but not necessarily so. So it is like a cord dancing act, balancing different risks. What I find amusing, is that all this became a problem after his plan to have a quick war did not work out. Had it worked, he and only he would have been the architect of success. Now that it is a long affair, it can also be a general or this idiot from Wagner.

I blame social media: for amplifying the extremes, who in turn — from their corners — attack the middle from both sides, pushing it down.

Putin, on the other hand, and his Russian cohort, seem to believe that there is no external truth at all: nothing is true, everything is permitted. The truth is what you make true. If you can get enough people to believe something is true then it in fact becomes true, as who can say it isn't? 

Even if they say this with a gun to their head, so that remains a valid means to the end. 

This in turn comes full circle and sounds a lot like Trump, who also seems to believe in nothing and view people as tools to lie to and manipulate to get what he wants.

A few Russian terrorist attack in a day: Shaheds, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, guided bombs. Thanks to out AA, to our defenders and defenderesses(1), at least a hundred of lives have been saved today. Most of Shaheds and missiles were shot down, but every such attack turns us and the entire world to the conclusion that Russia decided to go the way of evil till the end. To its defeat, as the evil can have no other end than defeat. The world must see that the terror loses. When ""Patriots"" in Ukrainian hands ensure 100% destruction of any missiles, terror loses. When the world increases sanction pressure, when the terrorist becomes more isolated, when close relations with Moscow become a source of shame for its former partners, terror loses. And there's no bigger humiliation for the terrorist state than successes of our warriors. With our successes, with our pressure, with our ""Patriots"" will we respond to all Russian manifestations of evil. And we will destroy this evil, no one else in the world uses these weapons against the evil more efficient then Ukrainians. Today, I had a staff (2) meeting.

edit:  You say in another comment that GLSDB is going to be ready on June 3rd, without any citation.

They were built in Kiyv, Ukrainians have exact numbers of how many were manufactured, how many spare engines and airframes they sent to Russia when they sent them remaining Kh-55s, someone is tracking which missiles exactly were taking part in the attacks. Kh-55 is not used as a strike missile, but only as a decoy, due to really small (120kg) warhead. Even the one from S-300 is bigger,  so Russia is just putting a concrete weight instead if warhead. My calculations are placing the number of Kh-55s left at around 600 (tops) and Russia is recently using about 20 of them per attack. Kh-101s have a production dates of 5-6 months before launch date. You are using the oldest ones first. So they are keeping between 100 and 200 as a strategic reserve (they are able to manufacture between 20 and 35 of these per month). Nothing was suggesting they have them stored somewhere else - production dates of missiles used in strikes were almost right from the start of the production to the beginning of 2023. Kalibrs are unknown here as they have different versions for sub and surface launches, however they are limited by the carriers - they can launch 40 missiles of this type if all carriers will launch simultaneously. However they prefer to launch from forward position to minimize time of flight. That takes about 2-3 days. So they are limited to 1 launch per week tops. Recently they are reluctant to use Kalibrs as they are difficult to manufacture due to shortage of some western components.

You have the luxury of missing the days when the man going all out to prop up Jim Crow, because that didn't represent an all-out identity battle that you deplore in your comment that politics ""has become these days."" Because you must have had the comfort to let Jim Crow slide. That probably wasn't affecting you directly!

The fact of the matter is that Buckley's Review was the template for the Ivy League intellectualized racisms that gave us Dinesh D'Souza, founder of the Dartmouth Review, and Laura Ingraham, whose brother Curtis has publicly told us was raised a white supremacist by their white supremacist father. When Laura was EIC at the Dartmouth Review in the mid 80s, the right wing thugs who wrote for it came in the middle of the night with sledgehammers and smashed down shanties erected in protest of apartheid. They published a Hitler quote on Yom Kippur. Ingraham and D'Souza are part of what you deplore, but you are too completely uneducated/not directly affected by Jim Crow to understand Buckley who you long for birthed these birthers.

You cannot argue with Trump because the only thing Trump believes in is Trump, and he will simply lie and say he has beaten you before the first word has been said, and will never waiver from that position: that he has already won.

It's a cheap aiframe. That's it's entire reason for being created.

The more important thing is that the F-16 can use AMRAAM's. It can use Jdam's. It can use Paveway's.

And more importantly the US has a lot of them in storage. Meaning supplying Ukraine with all the JDAM's it wants isn't a problem.

Things like the Abram's,Leopord 2 and Challanger 2 are much bigger game changers than the F-16 is. Becuese as history has shown(Battle of 73 Eastings cough cough) when the Abrams and other NATO MBT's go up against old T-72's and T-64's it generally doesnt' go very well for said T-72's and T-64's.

And since Russia has lost most of it's modern MBT's chances are we are going to see another battle of 73 Eastings sooner rather than later.

Becuese as much as people like to joke about soviet Aircraft Ukraine already has an aircraft as good as the F-16 was. It's called the SU-27. And the F-16's the Netherlands does have are the older A/B models. Which are probably worse than the SU-27 is in terms of pure performance.

Keep in mind that Ukrainian SU-27's have also been somewhat modernized to work better with NATO hardware too.

It reduces to first principles ideas of political theory for which first principles are meaningless.

For political science there are two ideas that are foundational, but beyond that everything else is contingent.  

(1) A state is an organization that has achieved a monopoly on violence within a specific geographic territory; and (2) law is founded upon the government's ability to use violence.

The foundation of conservatism is the natural fear of change that exists to some degree in every human.  The reality that we are finite beings for whom the costs of disruptions may manifest immediately without the opportunity to benefit from the opportunities to create something new.

This fear is exploited by existing elites into protecting the current structure and hierarchy as it presently exists.  

Liberalism exists independently of conservatism.  The opposite of liberalism is authoritarianism.  

Liberalism is the idea that whenever possible the state's use of violence should be minimal, legitimate, and predictable.

So political liberalism is the concepts that argument and criticism of governments shouldn't be regulated, while the government itself should be derived from the will of the people.  That such a government should act transparently through republican and democratic forms.

Economic liberalism is the idea that the government should not use the violence inherent in law to regulate commerce.  That commerce is between private individuals and private behavior should be, as much as possible, beyond the reach of government.

Social liberalism is the idea that individual behavior which is neither political nor economic in nature should be beyond the reach of government regulation.

Wilhoit's argument is structured to make it seem as if radical deconstruction is the only valid form of critical politics by (1) defining conservativism as a form of authoritarianism, and (2) making the opposition to this straw man conservatism the only valid form of political engagement while making an ad hominem attack on all other forms of anti-authoritarian criticism.",False,1685406341.0,t3_13uk9xb,t1_jm4c96w,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

They had to get rid of USSR style military training so had to retrain even the instructors to NATO style combat. After all Ukraine has to learn from somewhere. Moreover, to rebuild a military in just 8 years from the ground up is impossible unless shortcuts are taken. One of these shortcuts is to train the trainers, then get them to train the recruits. This has been done and replicated a few times elsewhere and is not ground breaking. Even the Ukrainians recognised the value of NATO training and sent their trainers everywhere to learn, then train their own based on that. So the numbers of troops NATO directly trained pre-war is small, but the impact is huge because the scale up is massive. [Mark Hertling wrote a piece on Ukraine military training](https://www.thebulwark.com/i-commanded-u-s-army-europe-heres-what-i-saw-in-the-russian-and-ukrainian-armies/), in which he noted Ukraine military kept asking for more slots at US led training schools in Europe for the trainers.

Presently though, one of the reasons why NATO needs to help again with training this time is because Ukraine is loosing too many experienced soldiers than their current training pipeline is replacing. Also, the Ukrainian military enlarged about 3X compared to pre-war, from 200k to 700k troops, so they need far more trainers than what they have. Plus all the new equipment they have requires more training.
