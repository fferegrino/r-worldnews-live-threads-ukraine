Day 81 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There were no reports of shelling today either, but at one point during the day we heard something that sounded exactly like incoming shelling from MLRS, just a barrage of explosions somewhere nearby, still not sure if it was actually shelling or not. Otherwise it was pretty quiet.

It is quiet in the sense that there’s usually no shelling, but we still hear our own artillery all the time, it’s obviously not that scary, but if you don’t expect it, it can still startle you, especially if it fires somewhere close to you. 

We can actually clearly see how our forces use their howitzers by the sound they make. We usually hear it fire 2-3 times within 1-3 minutes and then it gets quiet, as they are most likely relocating right after. Then after some time passes, we hear it firing again, but from a different location, and it repeats like this every day, every time.

Our forces continue to liberate more territory every day and today we even got a [video confirmation of them finally reaching the border with Russia](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uqfoaf/translation_video_of_ukrainian_soldiers_of_227th/), most likely around Ternova. Still no news about Lyptsi or Kozacha Lopan, but considering that we hear our artillery (which is in range of both of those settlements) firing at something every single day the fights for them are most likely ongoing.

It’s funny how Russians on their state TV channels are now just straight up taking the footage where our forces are destroying Russian equipment and then claiming that it was actually Ukrainian, without even altering it in any way. 

Like just leaving the Bayraktar interface in that Snake Island video where our jets were bombing Russians stationed on the island, and then also posting photos of dead “Ukrainians” with Russian Navy belt buckles, which they almost immediately deleted when they realized their fuckup. And now they are also claiming that their losses at Siverskyi Donets are actually Ukrainian, it's so absurd.",False,1652663919.0,t3_upyzwf,t3_upyzwf,,0,194,0,194,1,0,

Text follows:

Russia’s Donbas offensive has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule. Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition.

Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February.

**These delays will almost certainly be exacerbated by the loss of critical enablers such as bridging equipment** and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones.

**Russian bridging equipment has been in short supply throughout the conflict, slowing and restricting offensive manoeuvre.** Russian UAVs are vital for tactical awareness and directing artillery, but have been vulnerable to Ukrainian anti-air capabilities.

**Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness.** Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine.

Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.

Huge upside in inflicting demoralizing loss and eliminating an entire axis of attack

Creation of opportunity to strike hard and directly at Mariupol from the North

Surprise effect, even if RU has a little time to adjust

Observed flat-footedness on RU part stemming from loss of command structure, including losses in recent river crossing disasters

Battlefield experience showing that new artillery and drones are massive game-changers

Knowledge that new units are on their way soon enough to lend critical support if victory doesn’t come quickly

All total speculation, of course. I hope they’re not getting over-eager, and these are reasons I can imagine why their decision might make good sense.

From CNN’s Martin Goillandeau in London

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Sunday that he'd met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Germany and that “more weapons and other aid (are) on the way to Ukraine.”

Kuleba and Blinken met in the German capital, Berlin, where NATO foreign ministers are holding an informal meeting over the weekend. Finland is expected to make a decision Sunday on whether it will make a formal application to join the bloc. It's widely anticipated that Sweden will follow the move.

The ruins of Popasna fell to Russian forces earlier this month but they appear to have taken little ground in the area since.

The Russians have also been trying to push south from Izium for several weeks, and the general staff said Sunday that they were trying unsuccessfully to conduct offensive and assault operations towards two villages south of the town

The military also said that Russian forces north and east of the city of Kharkiv were trying to defend their positions to ""prevent the advance of our troops to the State Border of Ukraine,"" while continuing to shell towns and villages recently recaptured by Ukraine.

> The Ukrainian destruction of significant elements of a Russian motorized rifle brigade that tried to cross a pontoon bridge over the Siverskyi Donets River on May 11 has shocked prominent Russian milbloggers. Those bloggers have begun commenting on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers. The attempted river crossing showed a stunning lack of tactical sense as satellite images show (destroyed) Russian vehicles tightly bunched up at both ends of the (destroyed) bridge, clearly allowing Ukrainian artillerymen to kill hundreds and destroy scores of vehicles with concentrated strikes. The milbloggers who have hitherto been cheering on the Russian military criticized Russian armed forces leadership for failing to learn from experience in the war. They also expressed the concern that the constant pushing of Russia’s propaganda lines was making it hard for them to understand what was actually going on.

Also, some people in the west assume sanctions are supposed to hurt regular Russians so they remove support for their government (projection). But they’re not designed for that, instead they’re designed to remove Russian state ability to wage war. This is also good, because if Russia cannot win this war fast the faster Russian people will remove their support because no one wants to die for their country (they’re ok if others die) and the higher the risk they have to be the ones going to war.

I figured while not much seems to be dropping I would quickly touch on a few reasons.


***1. It's in Ukraine's interest to be truthful.***

At it's core, this war is about Ukraine's future. Ukraine wants to become part of EU, part of NATO and modernise and develop. It imagines with fixing corruption and modernising like this that it can leverage agricultural and resource strengths and make quicker progress.

Because she wants to be European and modern and have integrity, she will more likely try and over-achieve what she sees as values palatable to the EU. Being honest, open and lacking in corruption are all top of the lists. Being factual about enemy casualties and losses, treating POWs in accordance with international law and maintaining a perceived defensive war.

Thus its in their interests not to overplay casualties and numbers for when the dust settles Ukraine can confidently say 'we did our best to act in a civilised and factual manner in accordance with international law and as a modern society should'


***2. Logical estimates based on known numbers for vehicles***

We are living in an amazing time for Intel analysis and information. Open source intelligence is amazing.

Based on confirmed (visually, via images or video and checked) open source information, we have a whole range of vehicle and tank KIA numbers.

From those numbers, fairly decent 'conservative' estimates can be extrapolated.

From there, providing for an adjustment based on the intensity of the war, you can end up with figures very close to Ukraine's claims for tanks and IFVs.

The intensity of a conflict (how often fighting resulting in significant loss of people, power or ground occurs and at what scale) influences how much you estimate casualties to be. The Ukrainian conflict has simply been one of the highest intensity conflicts in modern history, even at baseline casualty rates.

Now, to round the vehicle factor out (vehicles are much easier to track) with soldiers/combatants.


***3. KIA, leaks and calcs***

Many of the numbers doing the rounds early on I was sceptical of. It's really hard to get right.

A vehicle can hold 10 people, it's easy to assume 10 KIA.

The best sources are Allied intel. But even they stated their estimates are conservative.

So why do I trust Ukrainian numbers more than some?

Because of 2 things. 1. Their vehicle estimates are most likely very close and 2. Because of a few leaks coming out of Russia that at 2 distinct times were almost exactly what Ukraine was claiming, within 1000 KIA.


***Wrapped Up***

So, what this all means put together is that a reasonable estimate for vehicle casualties is very close to Ukrainian numbers, KIA is probably very close but there's more inaccuracy in that calculation and that it's in Ukraine's interests to be honest, not exaggerated.

And a final fun fact, Allied (UK, US) calculations involve a complicated, weighted formula that takes both sides claims of the dead and then adjusts them. The reason they say 'conservative estimates' for their numbers is because Russia was saying 1500 when Ukraine was saying 10000.

Russia is telling porkies.

Garbage in, garbage out.

I hope this has been enjoyable to read. If you want to check out casualties, google Oryx (imagery confirmed) or Ukrainian numbers.

> “I’ve been keeping quiet for a long time,” Yuri Podolyaka, a war blogger with 2.1 million followers on Telegram, said in a video posted on Friday, saying that he had avoided criticizing the Russian military until now.

> “The last straw that overwhelmed my patience was the events around Bilohorivka, where due to stupidity — I emphasize, because of the stupidity of the Russian command — at least one battalion tactical group was burned, possibly two.”

> “Yes, I understand that it’s impossible for there to be no problems in war,” he said. “But when the same problems go on for three months, and nothing seems to be changing, then I personally and in fact millions of citizens of the Russian Federation start to have questions for these leaders of the military operation.”

> Another popular blogger, who goes by Starshe Eddy on Telegram, wrote that the fact that commanders left so much of their force exposed amounted to “not idiocy, but direct sabotage.”

> And a third, Vladlen Tatarski, posted that Russia’s eastern offensive was moving slowly not just because of a lack of surveillance drones but also “these generals” and their tactics.

Baerbock said it was important not to have an in-between ""gray zone,"" but that if these two countries decide to join the US-led military alliance, ""they can join very quickly.”

Germany’s top diplomat added that if Sweden’s and Finland’s parliaments and societies decided to join NATO, their integration into the alliance would “make us even stronger, defense-wise but also with our values as democratic partners.”

“NATO was always an alliance for defense. It will stay always an alliance for defense, but before February 24, it was for some countries, not the most important thing to join,"" Baerbock told reporters.

“This has changed especially for our friends in Nordic Europe or Sweden and Finland. People didn't want to join NATO but now they are being pushed into NATO,” she added. 

Some context: The Finnish government is planning to issue a second white paper on Sunday proposing that the country joins NATO, Finland’s Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters on Thursday. The proposal would then be put to a parliamentary vote with a plenary scheduled for Monday morning.

Russia has warned of retaliatory countermeasures, with Russian President Vladimir Putin telling his Finnish counterpart that ending decades of Finland's military neutrality would be a ""mistake.

Ukraine is preparing for a new Russian push in the eastern Donbas region, President Volodymyr Zelensky says.  
  
Since failing to take Kyiv at the beginning of the invasion in late February, control of Donbas has become one of Moscow's main objectives.  
  
""We are preparing for new attempts by Russia to attack in Donbas, to somehow intensify its movement in the south of Ukraine,"" President Zelensky said in his nightly address.  
  
""The occupiers still do not want to admit that they are in a dead-end and their so-called 'special operation' has already gone bankrupt,"" he added.  
  
He once again called on the West to impose an oil embargo on Russia.  
  
""We are also working to strengthen sanctions on Russia. Partners need to make decisions that limit Russia's ties to the world every week,"" he said.  
  
""The occupiers must feel the rising cost of war for them, feel it constantly.""

On Monday, Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson is due to go to parliament to secure support for an application, and will also chair a special cabinet meeting on the issue.  
  
The move follows her Social Democratic party dropping its decades-long opposition to joining the alliance.  
  
Andersson said on Sunday military non-alignment had served Sweden well in the past, but was unlikely to do so in the future.

""I told them it is going to happen anyway. It is inevitable that Ukraine will receive a candidate status sooner or later. The German elites have a choice to lead this process and inscribe their names in the history of Europe or it will still happen but without their leadership,” he added.

The minister also discussed the Russian oil embargo, currently debated by EU member states, and the issue of a Russian gas embargo also came up during his visit.

After his meeting with German officials, Kuleba also engaged in talks with G7 foreign ministers and said that they “welcomed the idea that it is necessary to freeze Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine to help rebuild our country. We are talking about hundreds of billions of euros here. Also, (the) G7 said they are ready to take part in rebuilding Ukraine, in the reconstruction of its cities and infrastructure. You know President of Ukraine has an idea of the countries to take charge of certain regions or cities that`s been affected by the war and our partners welcome this idea.”

Kuleba also called for “a solution to remove Russian blockade on the export of Ukrainian agro-industrial products to the world.

Here in Slovenia (where there are sadly lots of russiophiles), I am seeing slow and subtle but steady shift from “Russia attacked Ukraine“ to todays subtle criticism of West which read (this is state media outlet!) “Who is sending arms to Ukraine, how much and most importanlty why”. I won\`\`\`t go into details, but this article on front page is talking about all the money western defense industry is making, that US is trying out new weapons for essentialy free etc.

Sadly I think the shift in reporting is going to  go even further. it is odd that our new left government is kind of pro Russian and has a stance that this is not Slovenian conflict, that we should not help Ukraine militarly etc. In our country the left political pole is pro Russian and the right is pro West.

But my main point is this: please be vigilant in reading reports from this war. I believe that media will slowly change its reporting in countries that have significant russiophilic ~~russuophobic~~ population. I believe next step is talking about peace (where Ukraine loses teritory of course) and when Ukraine pushes Russians to the Donbass line and when Ukraine will want to take it back, there will be a lot of talk that peace is needed and that Ukraine is now aggressor and gready.

They are just sad now

REFLECTIONS ABOUT SPORTS

Not so long ago, as part of another discussion of my ""ungrateful behavior"" on the Internet, I came across a rather amusing claim (close to the text):

""... for many years you have called for the direct intervention of Russian troops in hostilities, for the recognition of the republics of Donbass and their armed defense, for a war against Ukraine, for strikes against Ukrainian rear areas with missiles and aircraft. All this has been done and even beyond your wildest expectations (Written back when our troops were standing near Kyiv.) Why are you itching again? Why are you - instead of gratitude - again criticizing!?""

I considered the claim extremely stupid and reacted accordingly - I sent the propagandist to the bathhouse. But gradually I became convinced that (it turns out) a similar opinion is shared by many other people ... and not only network trolls.
Therefore, after scratching what many compatriots not only refer to in common speech, but are almost similar in function - i.e. ""turnip"" - I decided to answer this question anyway, choosing a metaphor that is understandable even to our senior government officials, despite their advanced age, who is still passionate about physical sports ...

So, imagine that someone, deeply offended and stung by the constant humiliation of our athletes at various world competitions in connection with the performances of these athletes under RAGs of incomprehensible colors and the ban on any other national-state self-identification - insistently demanded that our athletes ( if they are OURS, of course, and not some Ovechkin, etc.) went to the Olympics under the national flag and to the sounds of the national anthem. And suddenly - when I was already tired of hoping - it suddenly happened!

All the fans howled in delight: ""Well, finally!"" - and burst into shouts of welcome (including yelling - to the extent of a modest voice - and I, the name of the rivers). And how not to scream? - For many years I (a fan) was told that ""our athletes are the most athletes in the world"", and our tank ... that is, just biathlon is the standard of achievement in the military ... sports field. Not to mention the gray reinforced concrete iconic monster... that is, a magnificent sports facility built for crazy money in Patriot Park. And the Chief Coach (Right Hand of the Legend of Sports) is the best of all possible and who has ""raised"" our sport so much that now KA-A-AK we will give heat to all competitors !!!

And then ... And then our relay runners begin to lag behind from the very first steps, and they run in some kind of antediluvian Soviet sneakers instead of modern shoes ... And when the sneakers fall apart on the go, the assistants give them felt boots with galoshes to replace them.
Our hockey players entered the field half without sticks, and the goalkeeper is missing one of the pads on his feet. Football players are forced to play with a reduced squad, because for some reason the team turned out to be understaffed, and on the bench - flies are basking in the sun. Weightlifters cannot lift weight, boxers fall from the first blow of the enemy, and the kayak sinks as soon as it goes down into the water (according to the official version, either as a result of a fire from a half-smoked cigarette thrown by the helmsman, or from excitement on the track). And against the background of all this, the Head Coach (not to mention the Legend of Sports) does not give any comments, except: ""all tasks are successfully completed by our athletes, wait for the next stage of the competition and, in general, the main thing is not the result, but participation.""

And when - as a reaction to all this disgrace, I dared to whistle indignantly and yell: ""Coach to the soap!"" - They explain to me that I am acting extremely unpatriotic, ugly and unsportsmanlike. That our athletes, confidently going to the last place in the individual and team standings, should only be praised, and the accusations of the Head Coach (I basically don’t touch the Legend of Sports during the Olympics - and not at all because of fear of His Authority) are generally crimes , for which I can not only be taken out of the stadium, but also seriously fined, and before that they can set the ""fans"" armed with bats ...
OK. Let's say I shut up ... Even watching how the famous ""professionals"" in the arena cannot throw a spear further than I (who did not shine with any talents in sports even in my younger years) threw at school in physical education classes ... But yelling ""Glory CPSU!"" ... oh, sorry, - ""glory to the Russian sport and the Head Coach!"" - I can not ""from the word at all."" And okay, if only I ... so the whole country is looking at this SHAME. While not fully understanding - what, in fact, is happening and hoping that ""just about, after the warm-up, our real best athletes will come out and beat all the enemies ... rivals"" like a turtle God.

Attention! Russia is probably preparing a special operation in Mariupol  
  
On May 14 and 15, through insider channels from 4 different sources (including financially motivated Russian servicemen who periodically pass on the data), InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community received a number of worrying messages. When assessed collectively, the data suggest that on May 16-17 or later Russia is planning an extensive operation in Mariupol involving the Russian Army, as well as captured Ukrainian servicemen and civilians abducted by Russians. It is planned to involve a total of up to 2,000 people in the psychological component of the operation. We do not understand yet the whole plan of the Russian command, but let us consider the key findings of what the Russians have planned for May 16-17:  
  
🔥 bring to Mariupol up to 2,000 POWs.  
  
🔥 send servicemen of a reconnaissance company to Mariupol, with strict orders to have gas masks, a full set of hazmat protective gear and additional small backpacks, the contents of which are unknown.  
:fire: send to Mariupol 6 tank trucks, the contents of which are unknown. The trucks must be accompanied by guards in armored vehicles.  
  
Based on the data obtained, analysts of InformNapalm have grounds to believe that the Russian command could use the POWs to create a picture for the Russian propaganda media confirming that the defenders of Azovstal have allegedly surrendered and then try to use the contents of the tanks (possibly chemicals) to stamp out the real defenders from their positions. Also, the POWs could be used as human shields for the assault operation. There may be other scenarios.  
  
Recall that on February 23, 2022, eight hours before the full-scale Russian invasion, InformNapalm volunteers received the data about unusual orders from our insiders in the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. The militants were ordered to completely switch off all mobile phones on the contact line. We believe that yet another piece of insider information could be an important part in the puzzle indicating an impending special operation. By making it public we hope, if not completely disrupting it, then at least warning the public of the aggressor's plan to hold a large-scale bloody PSYOP in Mariupol.",False,1652682259.0,t3_upyzwf,t3_upyzwf,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

Should Russia break up?

Sadly, I see there are no safe options with Russia remaining as a whole country moving forward.

As it stands now, Russia has not progressed culturally beyond the 19th century feudal mentality. Corruption and hierarchy rule.

There is no reward for innovation or hard work. In fact competent people in Russia are usually stamped out because they are seen as a threat by the establishment.

Whether it’s governmental system is Monarchy, Communism, or the current soulless pursuit of capitalism, Russia has totally failed to address it’s cultural issues over the past 200 years.

Ukraine has managed to address these issues recently precisely because it was seperate from Russia. In fact, the Donbas Russians being removed from Ukraine further enabled the maturation of the country.

It is quite obvious now that Russia as a whole country is simply incapable of moving forward culturally, even as the world moves forward around it.

To prevent this cycle of imperialistic invasions of its neighbours happening again, Russia needs to break up.

It’s the only way things can change for Russians.",1652657037.0,1652656852.0,t3_upyzwf,t3_upyzwf,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

The ruZZians have broken their military, their economy is in shambles and will be for decades, their industrial capacity is shattered, their ability to rebuild their military is crippled, their population is in a really bad place demographically and this will probably make it worse.

The ruZZian Federation may be on the verge of splintering into a bunch of smaller states.

They are isolated globally with their only ally of significance redoing the geopolitical calculus and finding them lacking.

Ive read and read since the start of this. The points that stand out to me were these ones: Since Putin basically did the same thing in Chechnya and Syria; he somehow thought the west wouldn't want to get involved, just like with them. If that were true, Russia would have won, still not as easily as they thought.

Also, being surrounded by ""yes man"" almost like our corporate structures led him to honestly believe that Ukraine wanted to be ""liberated"" from those dirty westerners.

He has thrown almost everything at this and is still getting destroyed. Russia has just went from being a regional superpower to Cuba (no disrespect to Cuba) on the world stage. Just a fucking disaster.

Coincidentally, I have the February, 1976 National Geographic sitting on the bookshelf right next to my computer, which included a ""Double Supplement Map: The Soviet Union and its Peoples"".  I just found it one of those rare occurrences when my weird collection of old National Geographics became somewhat relevant, so I had to comment.

It's a specific map of the Soviet Union, so it doesn't exactly line up with the exact scenario you're talking about.  The main side is colored based on the demography of the USSR, but the reverse side of it colors all the constituent republics of the USSR differently (including the Baltics, the Belarussian, Ukrainian, and Moldovan SSRs, the Caucasus SSRs, and the Central Asian SSRs).  Here's a [picture](https://www.natgeomaps.com/hm-1976-peoples-of-the-soviet-union) of the map.  The other side has a political / road / rail map of the Soviet Union, circa 1976.

I also have a bunch of Nat Geos from the 70s and 80s.  I've read through some of them, but don't really recall ever seeing the Baltics looking independent.

**Edit**:  Wording about the coloring of the map.

Also, I remember reading the May, 1989 issue which had an article about the Baltic Sea years ago.  It would probably have an excellent map of the Baltic states to see how they labelled it.

e5fb9305fe1d1e620de2a1ffc3e226b5,upyzwf,i8sgvkh,"Attention! Russia is probably preparing a special operation in Mariupol  
  
On May 14 and 15, through insider channels from 4 different sources (including financially motivated Russian servicemen who periodically pass on the data), InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community received a number of worrying messages. When assessed collectively, the data suggest that on May 16-17 or later Russia is planning an extensive operation in Mariupol involving the Russian Army, as well as captured Ukrainian servicemen and civilians abducted by Russians. It is planned to involve a total of up to 2,000 people in the psychological component of the operation. We do not understand yet the whole plan of the Russian command, but let us consider the key findings of what the Russians have planned for May 16-17:  
  
🔥 bring to Mariupol up to 2,000 POWs.  
  
🔥 send servicemen of a reconnaissance company to Mariupol, with strict orders to have gas masks, a full set of hazmat protective gear and additional small backpacks, the contents of which are unknown.  
:fire: send to Mariupol 6 tank trucks, the contents of which are unknown. The trucks must be accompanied by guards in armored vehicles.  
  
Based on the data obtained, analysts of InformNapalm have grounds to believe that the Russian command could use the POWs to create a picture for the Russian propaganda media confirming that the defenders of Azovstal have allegedly surrendered and then try to use the contents of the tanks (possibly chemicals) to stamp out the real defenders from their positions. Also, the POWs could be used as human shields for the assault operation. There may be other scenarios.  
  
Recall that on February 23, 2022, eight hours before the full-scale Russian invasion, InformNapalm volunteers received the data about unusual orders from our insiders in the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. The militants were ordered to completely switch off all mobile phones on the contact line. We believe that yet another piece of insider information could be an important part in the puzzle indicating an impending special operation. By making it public we hope, if not completely disrupting it, then at least warning the public of the aggressor's plan to hold a large-scale bloody PSYOP in Mariupol.",False,1652682179.0,t3_upyzwf,t1_i8okrgz,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

>Renault is in talks to sell its majority stake in Lada carmaker Avtovaz to a Russian state research institute for the symbolic price of one rouble, in one of the starkest examples yet of the dwindling exit options for foreign companies trying to leave Russia.

>The French carmaker had already signalled it was ready to offload the 68 per cent holding in Avtovaz following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Negotiations are now moving towards a deal with a state institution that would involve a buyback option, one person familiar with the matter said.

>In comments reported by news agency Interfax, Russian trade minister Denis Manturov said the Avtovaz stake would “most likely” go to state-backed auto industry research body NAMI.",1652681297.0,1652680918.0,t3_upyzwf,t1_i8seuje,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

>Is the world forever stuck with a bad neighbor?

I am currently very depressed about prospects - but these are human beings, and when they do get a taste of personal freedom and self-determination, and an opportunity to succeed in taking their own stake in their existence:  human beings will fight to protect it. (example: Ukraine).  

As far as ""No George Washington"" is concerned - their horrible example is Lenin. The man who turned ""communism"" from a good idea, to an authoritarian system of enslavement and genocide. (sorry, tankies). 

I think what is necessary, for Russia to move forward, is for the elites who call themselves ""Checkists"", the Checka organization they belong to, their control over the levers of power, their broken nihilist ideology, they must all be destroyed.  

The USA actually went through a political movement in the 1700's; to root out and eradicate a dangerous lawless secret organization, (the Masons were pretty deeply embedded in many government offices, including the judiciary - and after some abuses were made public, this triggered a nationwide 3rd party movement called the Anti Mason Party - which only survived for about two election cycles, but managed to destroy their hold on America - the Freemasons that exist today bear no relation to that historical Masonic conspiracy, though it's likely there exists a similar organization of elites today, probably under the shadow of The Federalist Society). 

I believe that it's this kind of ""burn the elites"" movement and ongoing spirit that is the critical element, to developing and maintaining a free and open society.   And in order for this to succeed, in the modern world, I think that the elites' control over mass media and propaganda narratives must be broken, and in Russia, that's their government, and the Checka (which was the NKVD, but is now largely the FSB along with several oligarchs and major organized crime figures like Semion Mogelivich).  This also requires a massive overhaul of the weaponized Justice system.  It has to aim for true justice, and answer to the people; it can't be a one-sided tool of oppression and revenge as it currently stands. 

These two elements are also critical factors in many western nations, and we are definitely on the brink of losing control of these as well. So the west shouldn't be so smug.

When entitled rich people finally go to jail for the obvious crimes they seem to continually get away with, with impunity - then we'll know we're getting back on the right track.",False,1652630389.0,t3_upyzwf,t1_i8pesm8,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Nobody can come up with a single problem this would solve.  Not corruption in government - that's rampant at the local level, especially in the provinces.  Not economic difficulty - they are certainly stronger together to say nothing of having to pay tariffs to get goods through Russia since these new republics wouldn't have access to the sea and most wouldn't share a border with any other country.  What do you people think this is solving?  

The entire argument for even bringing it up seems to center around comparing modern Russia to the breakup of the USSR.  Why would anyone do that?  Why would *anyone* do that?  The USSR was already made up of those republics.  They had histories and statehood and were largely ethnocentric; they even had individual votes in multiple resolutions that led to the dissolution of the USSR.  Not to mention viable natural resources for independent economies.  These are not unimportant differences.  

Nobody wants Yakutsk or Komi or Buryat independence.  Nobody's even going to suggest the idea of having a bunch of disenfranchised enclave states where the majority population is still Russian speaking.  It's ridiculous.

4. USA has paid billions and billions of dollars to Russia too

The best I have been able to find though is that there isn't a 216th brigade based in Crimea, there was a 216th rifle Brigade it was disbanded in the 50s. There is a 216th electronic warfare division assigned to the pacific squadron in Vladivostok, a 216th Spetsnaz assigned to Moscow, a 216th Reserve Base in Petrozavodsk, and a 216th Independent UAV Regiment at Severomorsk.

Russian brigades and forces are a total mess to follow, some having been renamed and restationed a dozen times. We used to think this was to hide force strengths and positions from Western spies, now it is suspected to be part of the fund laundering scheme, easier for corrupt generals to obscure how many imaginary troops they are taking money for when the brigades and divisions are constantly resizing and reforming...


So there are a few possibles, and there's always a chance that the Russians have yet again decided to rename a Brigade and shove it somewhere new, maybe reforming the Brigade from the 50s.

I took one year of Russian in high school and it is amazing how I can only remember a few unique words, but I can still read Cyrillic relatively fast and the huge number of cognates means any basic signage in Cyrillic is bow readable on a subconscious level. I first noticed it in Half Life 2 when I would see a sign and see the word “market” with even consciously registering it’s actually written in Cyrillic. Knowing Cyrillic is a damn useful skill for how easy it is to know the core tenants.

The letters that are weird as fuck are only ever used to adjust things like gender, so you can just ignore them and still get the definition. That brings up the point though that Cyrillic is really a family of related languages, and Ukrainian actually uses a unique version. It’s a little cross eyed inducing to explain the differences when I only know one side of the equation, but just perusing the wikipedia I saw them using an alternate form of the geh sound, and then an annotation confirmed it had been banned by the Soviet Union until 1990 cause Russification.",False,1652675230.0,t3_upyzwf,t1_i8rx1ms,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

That everyone knew Russia was no longer a global super power but a regional (super) power is obvious. You can see it in the military composition of the armies accross the sides.
Nato countries have, in general, an offensive army.
 - Strong airforce
   - Building around stealth to beat air defenses
   - Lot's of SEAD capabilities
   - airial refueling
   - awacs
   - ...
 - Mobile army
   - Avoids lots of heavy equipment (and therefore reduces load on logistics) in standard division template
   - Shoulder fired weapons to deal with armored and or arial threats keeping the units light and low on logistical demand
 - heavy focuss on combined arms
 - Lower emphasis on long range anti air equipment (meaning you don't really expect the enemy to have arial supriority
 - heavy focuss on strong logistics that can travel far from friendly territory.

They rely on each batalion to have a lot of fire power. Lot's of artillery, tanks, bmp and btr's etc... all requiring lot's of logistics. Russia has built a massive rail network to supply these units within their borders, but cannot rely on their trains in enemy territory (as we can clearly see within Ukraine). Heavy reliance on ground to air defense (meaning you know that in case of all out war you'd likely be on the defensive when looking at air power)

However, everyone thought that even with their army composition, that Russia would be strong in a conflict close to it's border, where logistics should be relatively easy especially against an opponent who is not only weaker but against whom Russia would have airial supriority.

The big shock is how incompetent the Russian army is.
1) the Russian army had an offensive plan, which borrowed heavily from the tactics of first gulf war, but their generals seemingly forgot what made that offensive so successfull.
   - logistics
   - strong coordination between all units and especially between air force and ground units
   - well trained army that knew how to deal with threats
2) Their army equipment isn't up to the standard that they were supposed to be in
   - an example: Russian units were supposed to have much more modern bmp's, that fixed a lot of the early model issues, but records have shown that a lot of bmp 1's are currently fighting. Russia was supposed to have switched to at least bmp 2's accross the board and with some having even more modern versions. But clearly this isn't the case.
3) Terrible command structure that bassically comes down to. Go forward, don't stop, follow my orders without any form of your own critical thinking. Forgoe tactics on unit or brigade level, just go straight... Don't take any decision without having the implicit approval of the general.
4) Badly trained soldiers, as in, they seemingly were just given ak's and told, don't worry, tank will shoot, we will win, no need for you to be properly trained to deal with infantry combat. With 0 plans on what to do if their tanks cannot take lead (when enemy has heavy anti tank capabilities)
5) Incredibly low moral amongst their units.
6) Seemingly unable to take advantage of airial supriority as their ground units and air force don't have an effective way of communicating and guiding their air strikes.
   - Russian pilots get coordinates prior to take off, strike the targets and then return, they don't loiter around and/or communicate with ground units to effectivly coordinate strikes against enemy positions.
...

We all knew that the Russian army was hampered by heavy corruption. If you want a loyal army as a dictator then you need to compensate those in power. Even the u.s. has to deal with corruption (f.e. supply contracts) but where the u.s. gets all of the equipment, and in the expected quality, they just overpay a lot because of lobbyist.
We now know that within Russia, whenever money is invested into the army, that almost all of the money goes to the pockets of certain individuals with the army being left with almost no funding to modernise it's equipment.

Due to it's incompetence, and current heavy losses, the word 'super' can even be dropped from the 'regional super power' title that the west already knew Russia was.

What baffels me is that apprantly even Putin was seemingly unaware of how bad the state of his army was.
1 thing is for sure, a lot of heads will roll when this is all over.
I think that that explains why their units seemingly go on even bigger suicide missions as of late. Probably hoping that being the general/commander that gets some success might save you from the purge that's about the occur.",1652602175.0,1652601003.0,t3_upyzwf,t1_i8o2qya,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

 But let us just remember Greece and the billion-dollar aid of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it was on the verge of bankruptcy.  The IMF's help was, in fact, a cash loan that Athens had to repay (which they did early these days).  
 What do the US have to do with this generous gesture, or will Ukraine have to repay its debt?

Generally, areas like Moscow and PTB take resources from eastern and southern areas (including in the past Ukraine) and make lots of money out of it.

Firstly, Independence would clearly benefit people of eastern and southern Russia. They could build better infrastructure.

There are clear reasons why Kazakstan and pretty much all of the former USSR nations do not want to be back with Russia.

Secondly, areas like Moscow and SPB would then have to become independent countries that will have to TRADE with their neighbours to survive.

As opposed to just invading and suppressing their neighbours as they’ve done for centuries.

The changes were done by the anonymous contributor at the 2.134 IP

Do you notice that you can click Newer/Previous Revision at the top?  
  
And then WestRail642Fan reverted the whole stack of changes at once into the original page again by adding just one more commit  
  
All of these edits exist side-by-side because they're change-controlled. If wiki wanted to, they could trivially rewind the commits to before the defacement, but instead they choose to revert the changes by creating a new commit that undoes them, because it preserves the edit history  
  
There's really no IRL equivalent to this. It's not like burning books or even graffitiing a wall. It's more like a movie of a wall that you can scroll through and just happens to display in its latest state by default, except it's even better because you're storing the changes not the wall as a whole and so you can reconstitute the wall by cherry-picking changes from various edits, you're not stuck displaying the wall in its entirety as it was. If that IP had added useful information as well as errors, it would be trivial to bring the useful changes forward and revert only the errors, too.
  
What's more, we can see every edit that IP has made at once, they went on a defacing spree

 >Naval Air Station Keflavik (NASKEF) was a U.S. Navy station at Keflavík International Airport, Iceland, located on the Reykjanes peninsula on the south-west portion of the island. NASKEF was closed on 8 September 2006, and its facilities were taken over by the Icelandic Defence Agency as their primary base until 1 January 2011, when the Agency was abolished and the base handed over to the Icelandic Coast Guard, which has since then operated the base. The base was built during World War II by the United States Army as part of its mission to maintain the defense of Iceland and secure northern Atlantic air routes.

And in most case revolution and change was the key to get freedom.

They have a completely (I'd almost say down to individual gun crews) dispersed their artillery forces so well, given them such complete targeting authority, and a fully end-to-end artillery logistics, targeting and prioritisation software system that lets them spot (honestly, Starlink is being a MAJOR strategic advantage here for Ukraine, as the software is mostly a combo of off-the-shelf ideas), report, issue fire orders and accurately hit targets almost as soon as they are detected (I'm talking minutes - it's majestic if you froth system design). They in essence, can put bombs on anything within like 40km of the frontline with precision, in short order, at a pace Russian training cannot react to.

I do not doubt that they might even win this thing if it degrades to stalemate. As long as their kit is moving, and not getting counter-batteried across the river, they can pick off Russian kit so long as the factories go brr in the West, with a tempo that will only accelerate once Ukraine hits nearly 1m personnel before the end of the year. They don't even have to fight a pitched battle, they can even try shaping operations to maintain a stalemate for an artillery duel where Ukraine has the range and precision advantage.

But seriously, Ukraine is demonstrating a systemic optimisation and refinement mindset that enables them to optimise the crap out of every piece of kit they have. I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing light infantry assaults using enabling assets to make up for any shortfalls in direct-fire infantry-support platforms (like more recon with laser guidance units for arty, or hunter-killer jav teams on motorcycles).

Its design emphasizes low visibility radar cross-section and infrared signature, and the class has received widespread international attention because of its capabilities as a stealth ship. The first ship in the class is named after Visby, the main city on the island of Gotland.

With the under count factor of 3.3 that would be 400 per day in Russia numbers.

The Russia got >400 more or less since November 2020 until Mar 2022.

So the ""peak"" of daily deaths of 3000 lasted over a year in the Russia.

To even try to compare Covid deaths in US is completely garbage.

The Covid response in the Russia is completely and utterly shit & zero compared to the US response. The Russia didn't even get their so called vaccine approved by neither EU nor WHO. The vaccination rate in the Russia is a joke.

But the phase we are currently in still has Ukraine dealing with Russian offensive operations. It looks really good for Ukraine and all the “expert” timelines that pop up here and there are pretty much specifically talking about how much longer Russia can sustain offensive operations. 

Once that’s over we enter a new phase, at which point Ukraine no longer has to deal with offensives and can start planning to take back areas in Donbas, Luhansk, Kherson, areas that were taken by Russia very early on and with little to no resistance. It’s important to really take the time to think about what this means. 

I highly doubt Ukraine is going to relentlessly shell their own towns/villages/cities and citizens. “Guided munitions” does not magically mean zero collateral damage. You can’t just massively shell these areas, or rather I doubt Ukraine would want to given the massive amount of collateral damage it would cause to their own infrastructure and populace that still live there. Never mind what we’ve seen from Russia up to this point, I have zero doubts that they will use that fact to their advantage, meaning if Ukraine wants to use artillery to take out important defenses in any of these strongholds, the Russians will almost certainly make sure civilian casualties are a guarantee. Unless people here are thinking the Russians are going to start “playing nice” all of sudden. 

In that world, where they aren’t planning to relentlessly shell their own people/land, you now have to plan and carry out more “surgical” operations with a superior numerical advantage in each and every city/village you plan on taking back. This is going to take time, there’s no way around it. 

Now I’m not saying this is going to take “years”, that could mean anything. There is certainly a world where Ukraine, like they said, will have this done by the end of the year.

 >Operation Ocean Shield was NATO's contribution to Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA), an anti-piracy initiative in the Indian Ocean, Guardafui Channel, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea. It follows the earlier Operation Allied Protector. Naval operations began on 17 August 2009 after being approved by the North Atlantic Council, the program was terminated on 15 December 2016 by NATO. Operation Ocean Shield focused on protecting the ships of Operation Allied Provider, which transported relief supplies as part of the World Food Programme's mission in the region.

NATO countries didn't just say ""we're going to do this"" 

The combined forces of the organisation were asked to carry out missions on behalf of the UN.  The UN is an organisation that Russia and China have veto over.  If NATO are involved on behalf of the UN they have tacit agreement from Russia and China to be involved, If Russia or China did not want NATO troops involved they could veto the proposal. NATO could decide separately to intervene but to date have never done that as they are a defensive partnership. 

This is a massive difference from say the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan or 2003 invasion of Iraq which were both American led (not NATO) and not agreed to by the UN. France for example said they would veto any UN support for the Iraq war (although Russia surprisingly were not outwardly against this invasion, probably seeing a later opportunity for them to play a similar game)

The figure of attrition that results in combat ineffectiveness is usually 25-30% (not 10%), depending on what units are lost in a BTG.

You are right, 7 tanks are still effective. But if they don’t have fuel or ammo they aren’t.

If there’s not soldiers who can command, shoot or drive tanks, they won’t work.

If the unit’s command structure is gone, it won’t be able to work as a unit.

The good news is that the struggle is more visible because it used to be two sides of authoritarian old white guys, both getting their share and smug about it. Now there's a huge scatter of groups gaining power.

The support of racism, misogyny and homophobia is tied directly to a particular form of American Christianity that equates prayer with begging for things and God with Santa. It has nothing to do with spirituality in many cases, it's about social entitlement. 

Christian groups of all sorts gain their forms of superiority by marginalizing women and LGBTQ groups.

Racism is part of the brain, it's hard to educate yourself out of and too many people fail, particularly when it's encouraged as a social strategy. In order to bypass the part of the brain that signals 'us vs them' (the brain interprets familiarity in terms of attraction and affinity) you have to engage the frontal cortex.

 >Wandel durch Handel (English: change through trade) is a term referring to a notion in German foreign policy of increasing trade with authoritarian regimes in an effort to induce political change. Although most strongly associated with Germany, similar policies have been followed by both several Western countries. After being a central tenet in German (and EU) politics since the 1970s, the policy came under intense scrutiny following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

We Pay for the economic development of all of europe we even though we did not want it introduced eurobonds so everyone in europe can lend money cheaply at our cost. Our hole society is based in pacifism we are not a military superpower nor are we even close to rivaling the french. Shifts in Society takes time even the quick ones. 3 Months in we are sending heavy Equipment and train UA soldiers on German soil. Also we are not the Leaders of Europe nor do we seek to be, the concept of Union is based in egalitarianism or equality everyone counts the same. with 80 mil people we are meerly the biggest entity. 

Also nobody likes deutsche Bank its a corrupt financial institute, but surely your country dosent have those right?

What’s the problem with the refugees ? We took them in because otherwise they would have frozen and starved in Hungary also closing borders would have broken international agreements and EU law . They are here now and found a place to call home and 90% are law abiding residents that work and pay their taxes. What is wrong with them?

Yes we are reliant on Russian Fossil fuels but don’t act like others are not , we realized the urgency and are now moving in unprecedented speed to change that. 

So while you keep on shitting on us we will continue to pay for everything because it is the right thing to do !
