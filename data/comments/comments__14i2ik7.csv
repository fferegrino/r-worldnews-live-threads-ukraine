1. Wagner was mandated to be dissolved and absorbed into the Russian MoD with a deadline coming up soon. That meant Prigozhin would have no base of power anymore, because he was on the outs with the MoD.
2. Without that base of power, he was very likely to be imprisoned or killed due to his public spats with so many high ranking officials.
3. With this deadline looming, and tensions at an all time high between him and the MoD, he made a play for power. His hope was that the Russian military rank and file would join the cause as they marched north. Generally they are warm to Wagner because they've fought alongside each other and Wagner actually has a competent fighting force. Prigozhin was betting that enough parts of the military and oligarchy were fed up with the lack of success in Ukraine to flip.
4. When that didn't happen, it became clear the march north was a suicide mission. Even with a highly trained force, estimates are he only had 5k heading to Moscow. He has no air force and would have been torn apart trying to enter Moscow if the army didn't flip sides and just step aside.
5. Without the momentum of the military flipping sides, he was in a position to work out a deal or have his men and himself all be killed.
6. I guess for Putin the calculus was that it was better to strike this deal, and preserve the experienced soldiers in Wagner who are critical to the fight in Ukraine, than to lose that force (the entire 25k would likely be alienated even if only the 5k near Moscow were killed). He'll deal with Prigozhin down the line when the temperature is cooled and Wagner is absorbed into the military apparatus.",False,1687643428.0,t3_14i2ik7,t3_14i2ik7,,0,188,0,188,1,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-24-23/index.html

""In a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov provided details about what he described as an agreement struck with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the boss of the Wagner private military company, to halt a march of his forces toward Moscow.

""An agreement was reached on the return of PMC Wagner to their locations. Part of those who will wish to do so, will sign contracts with the Ministry of Defense — this concerns those who did not take part in the march, indeed, there were such formations which, from the very beginning, changed their minds and returned. They even requested to be escorted by the traffic police and other assistance in order to return to their permanent locations,"" he said.

Wagner fighters will not face legal action for taking part in the march, Peskov added, saying that the Kremlin has ""always respected their heroic deeds"" on the front lines in Ukraine.

Prighozhin has provided scant details about his agreement to about-face. Peskov said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was able to draw on a personal relationship with Prigozhin to broker the deal.

""The fact is that Alexander Grigoryevich [Lukashenko] has known Prigozhin personally for a long time, for about 20 years,"" Peskov said. ""And it was his personal proposal, which was agreed with Putin. We are grateful to the President of Belarus for these efforts.""

Earlier this month, Prigozhin had refused to sign contracts with Russia’s Defense Ministry, rejecting an attempt to bring his force in line.

Zaporizhzhia is the site of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, that was captured by the Russians last May after fierce fighting.

Ukraine's counter-offensive is currently under way in the Zaporizhzhia region.

He can't lash out against MoD soldiers as he will be branded a traitor. He can't up and leave for Africa as he will be seen as a deserter.

2d922fc13f931d435623a4bc1ef92e43,14i2ik7,jpe9ovj,"Based on the following analysis a simple explanation for why Prigozhin backed down is that he simply didn't get the support he was betting on. He claimed he had 25k troops yet all evidence to now indicates he had nowhere near that many. Having too few troops and heavy equipment and failing to attract enough defecting internal security meant he had to call it quits.

> [...]Yet most experts believe Wagner’s real strength is far below what Mr. Prigozhin claims, and that he is hoping more Russian soldiers and security agents disgusted by the corruption and mistreatment they see will respond to his populist critique of the leadership and join his ranks.

>The U.S. government estimated in December that Wagner had 10,000 professional soldiers. That number most likely fell in recent months as Wagner was forced to throw its most experienced units into battle to finalize the capture of Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials.

>Mr. Prigozhin himself said this year that after the capture of Bakhmut, his force would “downsize” as it prepared for new missions.

>Notably, Mr. Prigozhin had managed to run a force numbering tens of thousands of fighters largely on cash. Veterans and their relatives had received salaries, as well as death and injury compensations, through an elaborate network of nameless intermediaries spread across the nation.

>The mutiny is likely to have erased that logistical support. And most experts believe that no personal wealth can maintain a large military force capable of challenging a regular army for long, especially without access to the state-controlled financial system.

>Earlier on Saturday, videos circulating on social media showed purported Wagner convoys moving through Russia toward Moscow with mounted tanks, air defenses and self-propelled rocket launchers. Most of the rebels’ convoys, however, appeared to be made up of unprotected trucks carrying soldiers.

>Mark Galeotti, a Russia military expert, said the limited amount of heavy weaponry would make it difficult for Wagner to operate independently of the Russian military.

>“Without artillery you can’t really fight straight-up warfare,” he said.

Anton Gerashchenko’s thoughts:

“By my estimates, Putin's rating in Russia fell below 30% in the 24 hours of Prigozhin's ""coup d'etat"". The bloody murderer turned into a limping duck, his ""macho"" image shattered both in Russia and abroad

It's really like Russia had two presidents today - the real one, a determined, capable murderer, and the old one - cowering with fear deep down in his bunker, sending his bloody accomplice Lukashenko to negotiate.

Why did Lukashenko become the mediator in negotiations with criminal Prigozhin? I think the answer is simple. Wagner convoys were only a few hours away from Moscow. If they had captured the capital, they would take control over government buildings, including the Kremlin. That would lead to the collapse of Putin's regime, and that, in turn, would have caused the collapse of Lukashenko's regime. That's why one rushed to save the other. 

What will happen next?
1. No one really knows the exact agreements that were reached in negotiations with Prigozhin. The fact is - a convoy of Wagner PMC stopped and walked away 200 km from Moscow, and that Prigozhin's forces left the headquarters of Southern Military Region in Rostov.
2. A lot will depend on whether Putin will honor his side of the deal, including the resignation of Shoigu and Gerasimov (assuming that was included in the agreement).

-The essence of the conflict between Prigozhin & the Russian Defense Ministry was that Shoigu wanted Prigozhin’s budget.

-Prigozhin planned to appeal to Putin, but he was not given that opportunity, so Lukashenko became the middleman.

-Prigozhin will be arrested and convicted. Putin doesn't forgive anyone for such behavior.

-Wagner will be disbanded after Prigozhin’s trial. Wagner fighters will be offered to go to other PMCs, but some of them will be jailed.

-Officials & military personnel who supported Prigozhin, will either resign or be removed from their positions. Some of them will be retaliated against in a show of force.

-Secondary members of the  russian General Staff will be dismissed. The resignation of Gerasimov and Shoigu is unlikely.

-Prigozhin betrayed all of his “allies” and destroyed any chance of a future rebellion from within the Russian military rank

My personal take on the whole situation is.

Shoigu and MoD has not been coordinating with Prigozhin and Wagner well. They're both strongmen with their own beliefs about how things should be done.  Rather than support one another they are at odds.  They fight over limited resources and decisions.  It's a ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" situation.  There's no clear chain of command between Shoigu and Prigozhin.

This has led to fighting between the armies and Shoigu attempting to take control of Wagner.

Prigozhin is pissed and has been making public statements against Putin and MoD.  It's not making any difference.  Prigozhin knows his power lies in holding a personal army so rather than lose the army, his power, and likely his life afterwards, he decided to fight.

He marched on to Moscow with little resistance.  Russian's don't want  to fight Russians.

Sounds like Putin shat himself when he realised how exposed he was and how much the Russian Public would just let it happen and proposed a deal of ""MoD will only absorb your mercenaries that didn't march on Moscow (which from US intelligence would be 25,000), withdraw all charges against Wagner and Prigozhin under the condition Prigozhin moves to Belarus.

This appears to have appeased both Putin and Prigozhin enough where they both feel their lives are safe enough again. Where Shoigu and MoD sit in all of this, I don't know.

tl;dr Putin and Shoigu hate each other . Shoigu made a play against Prigozhin and Putin was letting it happen.  Prigozhin squared up for the fight dragging Putin fully in to it.  Putin got scared, assured Prigozhin safety if Prigozhin backed down which he did.

His actions have confused us these last 48 hours (and beyond) because we see him as the leader of a large mercenary body, fighting for pay (or freedom from jail) instead of what soldiers fight to defend (the state).

After some research, I'm now concluding he fits the definition of a modern day warlord, with these attributes:

Here are the characteristics of a warlord: · an individual with limited military skills, who is accountable to no one, who has no true ideology...

...who rules through patronage, who flourishes only when the central government is weak, and who further fragments the politics, the unified military action, and the economics of a central government.

There is no contribution to a nation's power, only the individual's.

If this definition fits Prigozhin, it also suggests that Russia is therefore a failed - although semi-functioning - quasi modern state.

We know Putin is a kleptocratic authoritarian, so this seems to fit.

Would be interested in what others think of this conclusion.

Interesting, the Reporting From Ukraine summary frames it more like Wagner actually 'won' the conflict and that the Russian Federation gave into their demands because they knew they were outmatched. He also firmly believes the Russian Federation is lying about details on the concessions (as in, trying to save face).

While he's just another youtuber, this guy's assessment has frequently been on point and he's actively been covering the tension between all of these figures for upwards of a year now.

What could have happened?

Maybe Wagner was on the verge of ousting Prigozhin. Maybe he got paid an enormous amount of money to retire. Maybe Putin had a hit on Prigozhin that was credible and likely. We don't know right now but nothing points to anything like ""Putin did this as an out for the war"" or some other mastermind shit. Russia has a lot of powerful groups at odds with each other, someone else said mafia state and that's really it, Putin is just very powerful and did something to back Prigozhin down while not apparently meeting any of his demands. Honestly, that's what really scares me, what did Putin do? Or Lukashenko, since he was the one that talked everyone dodwn? We have no information yet other than it seems like Prigozhin got nothing he wanted aside from staying alive.

2. Criminal charges against Prigozhin will be dropped and he will be sent to neighboring Belarus, according to the Kremlin.

3. Progozhin said he was turning his forces around from a march toward Moscow shortly after the Belarusian government claimed President Alexander Lukashenko had reached a deal with Prigozhin to halt the advance.

4. Only hours earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had vowed to punish those behind the “armed uprising” after Wagner claimed control of military facilities in two Russian cities. Prigozhin had accused Russia's military leadership of striking a Wagner camp on Friday.

1. Putin (kind of) won somehow. Maybe he had something on Prigozhin, maybe Prigozhin was a coward, maybe something I don’t understand happened. Whatever it was Prigozhin was forced into exile and Putin got him and his army off the playing board. He’s still been made to look like a weak fool and his position is immensely weakened. The people and army obviously have no faith in him. But he succeeded against the current threat.

2. Prigozhin wanted out and got what he wanted. He saw the writing in the wall about what was coming and wanted to ditch with his most loyal now before they ended up dead or in a courtroom. He twisted Vlad’s arm to keep his African empire and his veteran core while escaping the doomed war. Bonus for him Lukashenko hates Vlad so he’s likely to see Wagner as a huge boon in his quest to remain independent since they have a common enemy.

Prigozhin could have decided to bide his time. He halted before “Russian blood” was spilt. Maybe he is trying to leverage himself as a man of the people. A fighter for justice who wants to fix the country but doesn’t want to harm innocent men who are just doing their duty. This could cause a lot of MoD soldiers to support him if he attempts this again. Because they know he “cares” about them. He “cares” about every Russian life. Maybe trying to align himself with both sides of the spectrum and drum up as much support as possible. Maybe even wait for the Russian elections and announce himself as a candidate. And when Russia bans him from running, or rigs it against him, he makes the move for power. It’s not like they can arrest him. Or maybe they do arrest him and another insurrection by those who support him topples the gov. Who knows. It doesn’t make sense to me though because this was the most leverage he was going to have on the Kremlin. This was the most element of surprise he would ever have. Maybe attacking Moskow would have led to a drawn out siege and bad PR lots of dead Russians tends to build resentment  if it’s russia you want to lead. He may have also known that a large scale battle with Russian troops would be worse for his public image too. It would allow the Kremlin to paint him as an evil power hungry man who wanted to oust Putin no matter who got in his way and take the country for him and his blood thirsty mercenaries. Maybe he thinks he can bide his time and wait for a popular uprising. 

Another option is They have something personal on him. Like family. They had to have threatened his family or something akin to that. And as a result halted all his moves. Seems simple but Occams Razor may apply here. Maybe threatened to use missiles against his location or something as well something where they knew no matter where he was, they could kill him.
Another option is that he realized losing the war would be worse for his public image if he does intend to be the next leader of Russia. By pulling his men out he left holes in the Russian lines which will be exploited by Ukraine. And if it was his fault thousands of Russians died, or were humiliated by terrible losses in the war, generally that would not be the best look for the potential next leader. So maybe he’s trying to angle for Shoigus job instead of Putin’s.
Maybe all this was just a power play to get more supplies and stuff for his men, I doubt it now though. It’s weird all around and no one explanation works all angles correctly",False,1687647172.0,t3_14i2ik7,t3_14i2ik7,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

The leader of the Wagner Group started marching toward Moscow. 

They do some serious damage and Russia (as well as other world powers) prepare for a battle. 

Suddenly, the leader of the Wagner Group stops his assault and they’re given amnesty? (this is where I’m getting lost because I don’t understand why Belarus is involved)

I wouldn't be surprised if Putin let's Prig live because Russians really respect machismo. Prig had the balls to march on Moscow. Putin is embarrassed but he may look even worse if he goes back on his word (why would anyone ever trust a thing he says again).

Likely he will gain a bit of face back by exacing revenge against Shoigu and Gerasimov for their failures in Ukraine, and for letting this Wagner mess get out of hand.

Thus the army did not oppose him he didn't have the right amount of people to oust Soighu and Gersimov and even his column was losing steam by the hour. People was not opposing but neither supporting him (typical Russian fatalism to accept everything that comes). So he new he was skrewd and accepted a deal truh Lukashenka (give this man his colonel title!) and accepted the dismantle of his Wagner and to be esiliated in Belarus. Being esiliated there means that Russians have full control over him and as soon as the war ends he is dead regardless.
The Russian leadership has been humiliated in an irreparabile way and the Russian military won't trust them anymore. Not that they did until today but at least wagner had a nomea of being competent but now they are gone.

The Charge of the Not-So-Bright Brigade

Half a league, half a league,  
Half a league onward,  
All in the valley of Death  
Drove the Ural-4320's.  
“Forward, the Wagner Brigade!  
Charge for the guns!” Pregozhin said.  
Into the valley of Death  
Drove the Ural-4320's.

“Forward, the Wagner Brigade!”  
Was there a man dismayed?  
Not though the soldier knew  
Someone had blundered.  
Theirs not to make reply,  
Theirs not to reason why,  
Theirs but to do and then eventually go back, accomplishing nothing.  
Into the valley of Death  
Drove the Ural-4320's.

Russian M.O.D to right of them,  
Russian M.O.D. to left of them,  
Russian M.O.D. in front of them,  
Threatened and thundered;  
Stormed at them by tweet and cell,  
Boldly they drove and well,  
Into the jaws of Death,  
Into the mouth of hell,  
Drove the Ural-4320's.

Laying all their demands bare,  
Praying as the world turned to stare,  
Charging the gunners there,  
Charging an army, while  
All the world wondered.  
Plunged in marijuana-smoke  
Right at the defense line they broke;  
Cossack and Russian  
Wondered if Pregozhin had a stroke  
Shattered and sundered.

Putin and his puppet Lukashenko aren't reliable. You, me and Prigozhin know that. So someone else helped Putin and guaranteed the safety of Prigozhin.

Putin is a scum, but he is a known friendly and useful scum for China. Also, the idea of ousting a dictator with a coup is dangerous for Erdogan. He already survived a coup, so he wants to extinguish the spark of revolutions in Asia. In the case of NATO, they hate Putin but he must be replaced with a sane person in an orderly transition.

I think that's what this was about, and why it has come to an abrupt end. Prigozhin is not stupid enough to mount a coup, say he will remove Putin, shoot down a bunch of Russian aircraft, and then just to return to base Luhansk (which he claims was hit yesterday), because Putin agrees to fire two guys. That doesn't make sense.  
  
I think an explanation of what we saw today is that Wagner overran a few bases, sent this diversion up towards Moscow, and while the military was stuck between disorganization and disbelief, they seized tactical nuclear weapons that they would be capable of using. Shells, tochka missiles etc.

Shoigu and company realize that when Wagner takes over Moscow, they are likely to end up as stars of a sledgehammer video, and decide to depose Putin. They do this quietly while they consolidate power. They enlist Lukashenko for help, promising him concessions and security for help with the ruse. 

Lukashenko then reaches out to Prigozhin and promises him whatever it takes to get him to call off the coup, “with putins blessing”.

Prigozhin buys it and calls it off, while the MoD and Shoigu consolidate power and their positions. 

Eventually the MoD will make a statement about deposing Putin for collaborating with a false insurrection, and that he was killed “resisting arrest”. They will then walk back all of the promises saying that they are nullified based on Putin’s treason and arrest Prigozhin and most of Wagner. 

What impact that would have on the war, I can’t say. Probably a pull back to the 2022 border, but holding Crimea. It would be hard for Ukraine and the West to insist on Crimea being returned in the face of a full retreat and a dead putin, but it’s possible.

Not sure we have evidence of that. Being physically close is not the same as having a good chance of success. Russia has been shown to be internally weak in a vital way; that doesn't mean Prigozhin wasn't going to be turned into strawberry jam or worse if he continued further.

There are a few theories here about how the MoD was about to reabsorb Wagner, leaving him powerless and likely soon dead. In light of that, not surprising he would take a shot, but also pull back and run if the chances don't look rosy enough anymore - doesn't mean he ends up better off than before, but maybe not much worse, and he's at least still alive for the moment.

There's a reasonable chance that Luka and Prigozhin together could help steer Russia through a rudderless period, ie Putin may be on his way out. there may be a political coup in the works. Luka is not the idiot he pretends to be and Prigozhin is def not stupid either. 

if the behind the scenes powers that be in Russia and Belarus agree that Putin is on his way out then one of their most immediate concerns would be to have major populists like Prigozhin and an ever present monolith of the Russian world like lukashenko in their pockets to help guide the ship. 

This would explain the lack of any adequate explanations from Prigozhin. if this is the case then Wagner will be more than restored after the fact and Prigozhin will be hailed a Wagner hero. It would also suit Luka who has never liked Putin and who very much wanted to lead Russia himself for quite a long time. in this scenario it would suit Prigozhin to try and remain popular. He would def not want to be responsible for chaos on the streets of Moscow or for Ukraine gaining the initiative due directly to his having held Rostov or of encircling the mod in Moscow. 

if it's the case that he's been offered a back room deal to play a leadership role in a post Putin Russia then chilling in Belarus so Russia's faltering war effort cannot be associated with him would be a smart move.

He was going there with the ambition to make Russia succeed and prevent unneeded casualties of ""Russians"". 

In other words, if he was going to fight in Moscow. They would be killing each others and helping Ukraine in restoring their territory by weakening Russia itself. At worse, that would end up in Wagner doing Ukraine's job at getting rid of Russian soldiers while also getting rid of Wagner soldiers.

At the end of the day, the casualties would be massive and would bring basically nothing. They could win the fight but at what cost? Same goes for Russian army.

Wagner is a limited force. It has no air force, no artillery and only a very limited supply train. They've been harassed by the Russian air force all day already, and spent the whole day on the march. So they were already in poor shape for an immediate fight, relying mostly on their speed and the fact nobody opposed them. If Pringles was informed that the units defending Moscow would actually stand and fight, he simply doesn't have the firepower to displace them.

Running away to Belarus is a convenient solution for both parties. Putin stabilizes the situation, allows his loyalists to regroup and can concentrate on the Ukrainian offensive again.

My 2 cents are that Prigozhin is somehow, somehow telling the truth. The Russian MoD was reluctant of ordering any ostilities toward Wagner and this has allowed them to advance so quickly unopposed. On the other hand, they communicated with Prigozhin and made him understand that Moscow is a redline and if they would really want to enter the capital, then they wouldn't have been allowed.

Let's not be delusional here. The Russians are currently holding the line against at least 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers. Do you, in your wildest dream, think they do not pose the capability of smashing to the ground a column of 5,000 men marching towards Kremlin?

The US mainland never experienced war, the closest being Pearl Harbor and 9/11.

The Russians had an old school feudal empire that collapsed in 1917 and was replaced by full blown communism under the USSR, which also collapsed and was replaced by a pseudo democracy operating as a kleptocracy in 1991. Russia was ravaged in WW2 and they've had tons of conflict on and within their borders with Chechnia and Georgia and Ukraine, etc.

This was a clusterfuck of enormous proportions. Putin absolutely lost from it and we don't know how much Putin ended up paying for purchasing Wagner group from Prigozhin.

1. This created an enormous scare in Russia. Remember Putin's main proposal to Russians is so called ""stability"". Instead of it, Russians witnessed burning helicopters, diggers destroying roads to prevent Prig's tanks from coming to Moscow. Moscovites saw BTRs, armed people, bags of sands plastered all around entrances to Moscow. The stupid war came home.

2. Russians watch propagandists. Did you see the propagandists' faces? Here is normally ""brave"" and ""combative"" Maria Zakharova who is looking unusually meek, scared and coming from a prayer: https://twitter.com/RezoBear/status/1672635483510243332  Look at Krasovsky's prayers. Watch devastated Soloviev. 

3. People here seem to ignore one likely possibility: Prigozhin was simply paid off. Wagner group was probably purchased from him for an acceptable price rather than taken from him for free as Shoigu intended. The nature of their fight seems to be the acquisition cost of Wagner group, not any moral convictions or concerns about the glory of Russia etc.

My best guess - Shoigu wanted all mercenary groups under their command. This was known [few weeks ago](https://kyivindependent.com/wagner-group-boss-rejects-russias-defense-ministry-order-to-convert-mercenaries-into-regular-army/). Prigozhin smelled that they are planning to remove him from power and possibly from existence.

So he decided to launch an offensive against Moscow. I think it was a real deal. His potential goal wasn't so much to seize direct control over the country (25k troops is enough to start a coup but Russia could potentially take it back by recalling troops from other regions and Ukraine) but to get concessions. And he most likely did - we know that Russian officials fled Moscow and that probably even included Putin, shit was real. Then he suddenly had a change of heart - to me this suggests that he got what he wanted.

What could that be? My guess - first, Wagner stays as it's own group. Second - I expect Shoigu to be either dead by now or getting replaced very soon. I can't imagine anything short of this to stop this sort of operation. Third - he probably demonstrated how laughably weak Russian main military is if he could get within 1h distance from it **in a day** (with actual military not even attempting to stop him) and could probably take it over if negotiations failed.

This is assuming Prigozhin has ""won"".

There is also another possibility - that he counted on support from other major groups and realized they are not coming. He still held a massive loaded gun that might suffice to demolish Kremlin but his forces would lose and he would definitely die within a week. So he chose to live trading his troops and Moscow's safety for his life, even if it means leaving to Belarus. How long will that last before he is offed?

- Russian forces are probably more disorganized and demoralized than usual.

More lasting impacts:

- Russian forces available in theater shrunk by probably at least a few thousand, and experienced ones at that - a good chunk of Wagner isn't going to sign with MoD or is actively not going to be allowed (those that participated in this operation). Maybe they stay Wagner and get sent to go cause more problems in Africa or whatever, but that's still fewer Russian troops *here* to work with.

- Russia's been hollowing out their forces at home to keep the meat grinder going at the front lines, that's why there was no one to stop this and why even in the capital it looked like they couldn't raise all that many troops quickly - the forces historically left to guard those places....aren't there or are way weaker than they're supposed to be.

 -  For example, it was widely reported before now that one of the main units historically tasked with defending Moscow and the government (and who stopped the '91 coup attempt) was pretty much shattered in Ukraine: [1st Guards Tank Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Guards_Tank_Army#Reactivation)

Firstly, Lukashenko is far, far, far more intelligent than Putin, he has proven he can 4D Chess and win against a more powerful adversary.

Belarus promised integration into Russia in the early 90s, then the mid 90s, then the early 2000s...recently we hear Belarus is to become part of Russia in 2030 (This is because Lukashenko will most likley be dead by this point of natural causes).

Because the only way Putin can ever get Belarus is with Lukashenko dead.

Think about it, Belarus is a country of 6 million, that's less than some regions in Russia. It gets ""Country Status"" and Luka has essentially extorted (quite literally) Putin to make himself and Belarus far better off than many Russian regions.

He once kidnapped Putins personal freind and Oligarch Baumgertner and managed to extort 300 million from Putin for his release and the stalling of integration between Belarus and Russia as a nation state. Luka then sent Belarussian KGB to Moscow to stalk/spy on Putins ministers, the FSB made the following statment:

""They don't really hide and act as if they feel their impunity. When we approach them and ask them to introduce themselves, they just show their \[Belarus\] KGB IDs""

Anyone remember Luka and the Map in the early days of the war?
Anyone remember Luka and the claim that the Bucha was done by the English?

The above is him sabotaging Putin, his narrative is a combination of normal Russian propaganda with cartoonishly exaggerated claims. And the latter invalidate the former. That's a sabotage 

Lukashenko is never giving Putin/Prigozhin Belarus, because the second he does this, he loses all leverage over Putin - then he is finished and Belarus becomes a region of Russia.

Putin is even forced to Defend Lukashenko because the oppostion government in exile is backed by the West, then it's not a case of waiting for Luka to die, it's another land war against a western backed Belarus.

They call this ""Tail wagging the Dog"", because even for his limited power (the tail), he controls the larger power (the dog) by constantly promising then removing the idea of Belarus becoming part of Russia - this has been going on since the early 90s.

The lesson the west needs to take from this is that Putin does respect defiance, while western leaders were tip toeing around Putin, Luka was kidnapping his freinds and extoring him, yet he's still alive, still leader of Belaurs etc, etc.",1687650173.0,1687649252.0,t3_14i2ik7,t1_jpej0a4,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

My understanding is that Wagner is a mercenary group that was founded by a man who used to be tied to Putin. Normally mercenaries aren’t loyal to a specific government, but it seems like this group is more of an off-shoot of the Russian military rather than a completely independent organization. Is that right?

I was struggling to understand how a mercenary group can be forced to disband/integrate into a specific army because they’re supposed to be free agents. 

So the leader was about to lose his mini-military to Putin, and he chose to suddenly turn on Russia to try to keep his power over Wagner?

1. Wagner was mandated to be dissolved and absorbed into the Russian MoD with a deadline coming up soon. That meant Prigozhin would have no base of power anymore, because he was on the outs with the MoD.
2. Without that base of power, he was very likely to be imprisoned or killed due to his public spats with so many high ranking officials.
3. With this deadline looming, and tensions at an all time high between him and the MoD, he made a play for power. His hope was that the Russian military rank and file would join the cause as they marched north. Generally  they are warm to Wagner because they've fought alongside each other and Wagner actually has a competent fighting force. Prigozhin was betting that enough parts of the military and oligarchy were fed up with the lack of success in Ukraine to flip.
4. When that didn't happen, it became clear the march north was a suicide mission. Even with a highly trained force, estimates are he only had 5k heading to Moscow. He has no air force and would have been torn apart trying to enter Moscow if the army didn't flip sides and just step aside.
5. Without the momentum of the military flipping sides, he was in a position to work out a deal or have his men and himself all be killed.
6. I guess for Putin the calculus was that it was better to strike this deal, and preserve the experienced soldiers in Wagner who are critical to the fight in Ukraine, than to lose that force (the entire 25k would likely be alienated even if only the 5k near Moscow were killed). He'll deal with Prigozhin down the line when the temperature is cooled and Wagner is absorbed into the military apparatus.",False,1687643347.0,t3_14i2ik7,t1_jpe7fau,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

 For being “far far more intelligent than Putin” he sure did a shit job at governing his country, seeing as diplomatic ties and international reputation is down to “puppet state of russia” and the economy is also shit. 

He could be at the same point as the Baltics now if he played his cards better in regards to distancing himself from Russia. Eternally being bound to Putin and playing the “will we become part of Russia or won’t we” game is not exactly a 4D Chess move, its desperation.

Longer version:

In a democracy, every politician who get's elected is a representative of the people who voted them. Politicians are only obliged to follow the doctrine they based their election campaign on and the party doctrine [to retain favour in the party].

In an authoritarian system, the politicians serve an individual first and the people second. The individual in charge wields much influence and power. To retain that influence, he places pawns into the position of politicians who are subservient to them and them alone. Favourably people who wouldn't have a chance to gain that position without the rulers aid. The ruler, let's say a 'President', then also may cause a bit of mistrust between the politicians so that his position is in absolutely no danger to get usurped. He then also quells any oppositions and units the army, possibly through a loyal pawn, below him, as an insurance. So he wields absolut power.


So, to get back to the current position.

Putin reshaped the state of Russia around him. Oligarchs run the economy and the Russian ministers are loyal to him. Shoigu is the defence minister and a non-ethnic Russian, which would've made his position untanable without Putin.

The current invasion of Ukraine is not running as smoothly as Russian officials have hoped, to put it mildly, and the situation is unfavourable for Russia. Showing clear shortcomings of the army and creating discontent due to the high casualties.

Prigozhin started to blame Shoigu and Gerasimov early  on for the failiures of his group and the war in general. That created sympathizers and likeminded people agreed. After Bakhmut, he basically became somewhat of a hero.

So yesterday, he fabricated a casus belli against the Russian MoD and declared a war. A war against the Russian _state_. Russia was utterly unprepared and had few real responses, like we saw.

And now, the unthinkable happened. The Russia state actually yielded. That is basically an admittance of their inability to stop Wagner. Wagner was so much of a threat that the entire state, which Putin built around himself, caved in.

So now Putin, the authoritarian overlord of Russia, was forced to discard two of his pawns by Wagner. The most influential person of all of Russia had to yield to Wagner and their demands.

I currently don't know if Prigozhin will have a say in Gerasimovs and Shoigus replacements, but it is likely. He forced them out, basically, so any new ministers after their image could yield Wagner revolt 2.0. But this time for good. And if Prigozhin get's a say in the matter, then he can place _his_ pawns as the acting MoD and subsequent highest commander of all of Russia's armed forces.

This would make him even more influential and he is the strongest person in Russia already. Being able to blackmail the government and force his demands to be enacted upon.

And to return to the explanation of authoritarian systems: The army is the insurance of a dictator. Without the army as a backup, they hold far less power. And without their pawns as willing, subserviant servants, they don't have assurance that their ideas, plans and wishes will be enacted upon. A democracy is slow because many opinions, within a party and between the people, will result in long halts of the laws due to debated. Authoritarian systems only follow the authority. And the Russian system wont have that luxury anymore, now that Prigozhin may changes two very massive gears in the political machiene.

So Putin's days of sole Authority of Russia ended today. The coup placed Prigozhin in a position of power, significantly reducing Putin's power as a result.",False,1687653633.0,t3_14i2ik7,t1_jpepd1s,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

You aren't going to accomplish a coup and military takeover in a city that large without significant help from existing political power figures who can open doors for you and back you up though. He didn't have the numbers and political support to pull it off. 

Look at Jan 6 in the US - they stormed the capitol looking for politicians and found 0, and the security service had even less time to prepare than Moscow. They'd probably never find the real people in power because they'd be in undisclosed hardened positions. Even if they did find some and execute/imprison them, the rest of the powerful figures would have to fear your influence (i.e. the reach of your power - can you actually touch them?) enough to capitulate even without a soldier kicking down your door, because they'd be in hiding too.

You need multiple things going your way for a coup in a country of that size:

1. Support from the military, or so much potential for physical violence that you overrule the military. (He didn't have that)
2. Support from some portion of the existing power structure that's willing to change sides. Some of the oligarchs, politicians, military officials, etc. (He didn't have that)
3. Support from a large percentage of the wider public that are willing to take to the streets and create a show of force that intimidates or invalidates the existing leader's rule. (He didn't have that either)

Political fence-sitting in moments like this is the norm, because the ramifications of choosing the losing side can be fatal.

What I meant by 'falling in line' is more that the upper leadership didn't openly endorse his move. Often in a coup attempt like this there's coordination behind the scenes first so that when the politician/aspiring leader announces a takeover other branches of the government say they support it under some pretense. Because that didn't happen, his movement was dead in the water as he approached Moscow.

In Putin's regime that's absolutely how it works. He creates a culture of fear around stepping out of line or straying too far from his interests. All of the former officials who have fallen out of windows did so because they crossed him or became more problem than they were worth. It sends a message. Prigozhin had already stepped out of line a number of times in his public comments.

In addition, Putin isn't the only one tossing people out of windows in Russia. Prigozhin made plenty of enemies over the last year that would rather not see him around. If his status diminished significantly it makes him a safer target to eliminate because the blowback with Putin isn't as severe because Prigozhin isn't as valuable to him just focused on Africa.

This has already been stated to be a component of his agreement with the Kremlin. He is to turn over his private army to the Kremlin, unconditionally. Again, that's according to the Kremlin.
