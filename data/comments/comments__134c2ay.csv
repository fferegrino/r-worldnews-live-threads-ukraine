Russia resumed regular massive rocket attacks on Ukraine before the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

For the second time in a week, Russia launched a massive missile attack on Ukrainian regions far from the front. Regular shelling resumed ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Details. On Monday night, 18 X-101/X-555 cruise missiles were fired across Ukraine, 15 of them were shot down, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Kyiv administration reported that air defense forces shot down all Russian missiles and drones over the capital of Ukraine at night.

▪️The Odessa regional administration reported that Russian missiles were sent to eight Ukrainian regions: Dnepropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, Kiev, Sumy, Poltava, Zaporozhye and Cherkasy regions.

On Sunday evening, explosions occurred in Pavlograd in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The head of the regional administration, Sergei Lysak, said that 25 people, including three children, were injured as a result of the strike. He added that an industrial enterprise was damaged, as well as high-rise buildings and private houses.

▪️Pro-Russian channels, including the Komsomolskaya Pravda military commander Alexander Kots and Readovka, claim that an explosion occurred at the railway junction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Pavlograd. The Rybar channel writes that Geran-2 drones were launched in the city - this is how the Iranian Shahed 136 drones are called in the Russian army, as well as tactical aviation missiles. On Russian TV channels, they said that in Pavlograd ""the Armed Forces of Ukraine were methodically pulling together air defense systems for a counteroffensive.""

Context. Prior to the shelling of Ukrainian cities on April 28, there had been no massive cruise missile strikes since the beginning of March.

▪️In recent days, Ukrainian officials have been regularly talking about the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a counteroffensive. Last week, Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said that the troops were waiting for the decision of the command to launch an offensive: “We received very modern weapons <…> As soon as God’s will, the weather and the decision of the commanders, we will do it.” Christopher Cavoli, Commander-in-Chief of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe, said on Thursday that the allies had transferred more than 98% of the promised combat vehicles to Ukraine.

▪️The Armed Forces of Ukraine also began to attack Russian targets in preparation for the offensive. It was the preparation for the future operation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine that explained the drone strike on the oil depot in Sevastopol.",False,1682937823.0,t3_134c2ay,t3_134c2ay,,0,81,0,81,1,0,

Update on the Russian attack on Pavlohrad above from a reliable OSINT twitter account.

Fortunately, from new video angles, it seems like the chemical plant storing old/decommissioned SS-24 boosters was hit and not the railway station.

Therefore, the initial Russian claims that multiple S-300 launchers and ammunition (being transported for the counter-offensive) were destroyed near the railway station look to be false.

Ukraine still needs to be super careful when transporting and storing missiles though. In my opinion, it is far better to be logistically slower and transport ammunition and launchers separately and slowly to different locations rather than transport quickly and to one place. Especially when neither side has air supremacy.",1682943587.0,1682943152.0,t3_134c2ay,t3_134c2ay,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

The massive explosion in Pavlograd was in the Pavlograd Chemical plant and was not a train loaded with S-300's like so many claimed... And it's also very bad news.

Conclusion:

A massive explosion occurred on the site of the Pavlograd Chemical Plant. Not a train loaded with Ukrainian S-300's.

""To date, more than 1.8 thousand tons of expired solid rocket fuel are stored on the site. It has been 20 years since its expiration date.""

It's know for decades that this site is used for storage. 

In 2020 they warned about the possible ecological disaster if this site ever would explode, which will affect both Dnipropetrovsk region and four neighboring regions.

If this location is struck a full investigation is needed: 
Did Russia intentionally targeted this site knowing it can result in an ecological disaster?
Is this another WarCrime?

But why is Russia trying so hard to capture Bakhmut? What is the strategic significance of this location? All the buildings seem to be obliterated and nearly every citizen appears to be evacuated. So why does Russia try so hard?

The only logical reason I've heard is that Russia has been building this fight up to its people as a major foothold in this war, and victory here would show people back home that they are winning. However I originally heard that was the plan for the anniversary of the start of the war, and that winning by that date was the goal. Obviously that didn't happen and now it's perhaps been moved to their victory day? But even so it seems like that's just what they say to compensate for making little to no progress in that area. 

Obviously Ukraine has been fighting there too, but unlike Russia they seem to be using it as a distraction or a way to stall the Russian military as they make progress in other areas. It may also serve a purpose in their counter offensive. And it's not like the Ukrainians are going anywhere, this is their home that they are defending, they can take their time if it means they can push the enemy away. It's much harder for the invaders to maintain a drawn out conflict when they have to ship their men and munitions out to the frontlines, which is why currently the situation concerning Crimea access is becoming a major issue for them. 

But I just can't fathom why Russia would sit in this city for so long when it's costing them so much and there's much better moves they could have attempted from a strategic perspective.",False,1682925117.0,t3_134c2ay,t3_134c2ay,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

That also ties in with Putin trying to indirectly wear down nations which are friendly to Ukraine and supplying them with resources and money. Putin is hoping that the citizens and various politicians and influential groups will grow weary of helping Ukraine and support will dry up.  

From what I've read and heard that seems to be the long game Putin is now playing.

Secondly, its one of the few places they had actually made any real kinds of gains due to Wagner. So they increase the value of the city in their propaganda. This is also partly why the Russian army keeps trying to sideline Wagner as progress is made because they want to take the credit.

Third reason is because Ukraine has matched the escalation in Bakhmut. The concentration of Ukrainian forces and equipment means that if Russian forces managed to breakthrough and encircle Ukrainian forces it would be extremely damaging to Ukraine's war effort and would be a much bigger victory than taking the city itself. If you've been following the fight for Bakhmut there has also been massive efforts by Russia to do just that. Even when there isn't anything so decisive as Russia encircling or overrunning Ukrainian lines, Ukraine is still taking significant casualties in Bakhmut and even though Russia is taking more Russia might feel like this level of attrition is more beneficial to them long term.

If Ukraine can spot incoming trains and rain conventional artillery on them, there won't be any supplies for the frontlines.

If Ukraine can repeat the Kerch bridge attack, that will also dramatically change things.

This will make the whole frontline considerably weaker and allow Ukraine to exploit any weaknesses created by these shortages. Ukraine just needs to find where the frontline has been made weaker and push there. Both in the south and the north.

This will also mean that Russia will be forced to use the last two rail connections between Russia and Ukraine. The one entering in Luhansk and the one entering from Rostov. This will restrict Russia largely. If Ukraine has access to GLSDB or some other longer range weapons, they can also light up whatever new railway hubs Russia will be forced to improvise.

Fiat money has no value of its own. Russia is also not suffering from a shortage of money. On the contrary, it is suffering from an abundance of money with no way to spend it. That's what the most biting of the Western sanctions are accomplishing. 

The sanctions on oil and gas are in my opinion less about hurting Russia and more about avoiding the accusation that the West is directly financing Russia's war. Of course we are still indirectly financing it as long as we are outbidding others for non-Russian oil and gas which unavoidably leads to those other countries switching to Russian oil and gas.

Here's a relevant part of the interview:

> Russia will not receive chips, microprocessors, and other technological equipment from European countries and the United States. That is why Russia will have counterparts from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. Of course, such counterparts will not be of the same quality, and the weapons will not be as accurate.

Actually, the one I would read about most was Redut, which I think was quite sizable.

The other PMC aren’t run by someone with the same ambitions (redemption, power) and practices (media, public mode of recruitment) as Prigozhin.

But I did already have notes (to myself), stemming back a year, and about 10 PMCs I’ve counted.  But there were mentions that I forgot to record.  For example, I recall something about Odessa or Odessa Oblast and PMCs...but now I can’t recall at all. 

Also, in the first two months or so, Wagner wasn’t involved in the invasion, bc some disagreement with MOD, and Prigozhin wasn’t on good terms w Putin back then.

But long features, like from *Ukrainska Pravda* or *Fakty* or *Glavkom* months later, the UA guys who were in the north (Chernihiv all the way to Kharkiv) would talk about the PMCs...also Belarusians were with them or was Belarusian PMC, the UA guys would be unsure.  But they were experienced, age 30-40s, and act like they run the operation, and that units which were from the East, like Bashkir guys—they’d be proper military but young and there’d be all this friendly fire because they’d get angry at one another. (Seems like PMCs were also sent to bolster the LPR militia, but I might be wrong on that.)
One incredible story of a recon commander and his team who were taken captive, and before the end of the day, were escaping bc the Russians were knowingly firing on the Russians, his captures were concussed, seems like it was the PMCs that targeted his caravan? I might be wrong...lemme track that old article down....

Really, really simple explanation of transmissions, but basically the answer is that from an engineering point of view, it is only a little difficult to have a single reverse gear, usually low speed higher torque, because that is most useful.

If you want a single reverse gear ratio that is high speed low torque, that is similarly easy, but usually not desired because you will always start from a stop, and having low torque at low speeds makes it hard to get up to speed where your higher speed gearing is useful.

Therefore to realistically get high speeds in reverse requires multiple gearing ratios, which means you need a second transmission for all practical purposes. Which is a much more complicated engineering challenge.",False,1682974566.0,t3_134c2ay,t1_jih5p7a,,3,10,0,10,0,0,

Eventually though it is the latter that gets the job done. We have alternatives for drones (not better, but people were able to find targets before drones became a big thing). But you really do not want to run out of primitive stuff that makes a big boom. That is the paradox in the current conflict too. Everyone is focusing on modern stuff, while at the same time we send old tanks to the front and while the biggest problem on both sides seem to be shortage of shells, rockets and missiles. Actually, it is somewhat shocking that the entirety of NATO is worrying about the supply of old fashioned stuff like that. Of course with info from drones or AI you could save some as you can target better. But the bottom line is that you still need to be able to make booms. At the moment even without AI Ukraine can find more targets than they destroy. That is a good take home message for future armies.

There undoubtedly be some smooth wheels along the top altho I can't see thru steel armor plates.    

So the rear toothed wheel is pulling the track along under the ground wheels, which pulls the ground back, ie. pulls the tank forward. I believe the track is kept tensioned by the ground wheels' suspension. The most slack is ahead of the driving rear wheel, along the top. The drive wheel is partly pushing the flexible track there.    

To steer, the tracks do not curve. I'm gonna guess it's like a caterpillar tractor, you disengage the clutch on one side so it slows a little while the other side churns ahead. You can also apply braking to one side. I believe that radical turning creates some severe forces on the track, it has to be a super design or it will come off at speed, and it gets worse over rough ground.    

If a track comes off, the tank has no power on that side. It will turn, I'm not sure how much because the tracks do not curve. I don't know, the driver might be able to make it move on some desired course in general, but I'm guessing there'd be a lot of turning and reversing and cussing. American tank crews train extensively to be able to get a track back on.    

In reverse, that same toothed rear wheel has to pull the track over the upper wheels, around the front smooth wheel and then along under all the ground wheels.
