Day 212 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet again, there was no shelling, but they did fire some missiles at least couple of times, the last time was at 2:39am. Though those missiles landed somewhere pretty deep in Kharkiv oblast, because we couldn’t hear the explosions from the city. Some towns like Chuhuiv and Pechenihy reported shelling, and missiles hitting them. They were probably aiming at that dam in Pechenihy again.

They have been using those Iranian drones a lot today, and to hit things that they would usually use their missiles for. Are they conserving their missiles yet again? And why would they even hit a gas station? It had no military vehicles nearby, and all they managed to do by destroying it, was kill 1 civilian. It’s still so funny to me that the “mighty Russian army with the best weapons in the world” is using Iranian drones to wage their war.

Now with mobilization we will finally see the best that Russia has to offer, like 60+ years old grandpas that will have a stroke before even getting to Ukraine. And just about a week or two ago Putin was saying something like “the soldiers fighting right now are professionals, we aren’t even using our conscripts yet”, as if that is supposed to be intimidating. 

Yesterday some Russian girl said that people from recruitment office came to take her brother with them, but there’s one *small problem* with that, nothing serious, just that *he has been dead for 2 years.* But that’s completely fine, after all they are the Z army, as in their soldiers are zombies, so recruiting corpses is normal. It’s also only a *partial mobilization,* so conscripting just a skeleton is fine too, you don’t need to have meat on your bones to fight for Mother Russia. And after that they are accusing us of raising the dead in Odesa and using black magic, they were just projecting all along.",False,1663980757.0,t3_xlmw8b,t3_xlmw8b,,0,156,0,156,2,0,

- In the last three days, Ukrainian forces have secured bridgeheads on the east bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast. Russia has attempted to integrate the Oskil into a consolidated defensive line following its forces' withdrawals earlier in the month.

- To the south, in Donetsk Oblast, fighting is ongoing as Ukrainian forces assault the town of Lyman, east of the Siverskyy Donets River, which Russia captured in May.

- The battlefield situation remains complex, but Ukraine is now putting pressure on territory Russia considers essential to its war aims.

That's about 200 Billions roubles/month. To put this in perspective that's 3.5B USD / month.

Currently ukraine is killing about 7800 Russian soldiers per month on average. This number is likely going to increase. That cost russia 7M roubles a month per person. So something close to 54B roubles a month or in USD close to 1B USD / month.

So on first month it will cost Russia

3.5B (pay) + 1B (KIA) = 4.5B

Ironically, it cost less to pay people contract than it cost them to pay when they're KIA. 

If Russia can refill each month the 7800 deaths. Then It will cost them around 4.5B USD a month.

Now imagine we're talking about minimum numbers for income and death rate is likely to increase above this average very quickly.

This of course is utterly asine to even a casual observer of the interconnected USA/EU economies, where a collapse of Germany would trigger an immediate recession in the EU and US respectively, as US manufacturing would collapse without machine parts, optics and software from Germany.

But before I dive into the wider piece; this mobilisation by Russia may prolong or shorten the conflict but either way it will likely mean far more people will die. That is tragic and needs to be repeated from time to time.

So why should we be positive?

The war in Ukraine has much wider reaching implications for the world and particularly Asia than most people think. I'm not talking about economics or alignment but balance of power.

The USA has had a military policy of being able to fight two peer adversaries at the same time in different areas of the globe and winning both. With the incredible rise of CCP, this has begun to be questionable in Asia.

With Russia's illegal and genocidal war in Ukraine, NATO and the EU have woken up. It is likely that in the not to(o?) distant future, European nations will easily be able to handle Russia on their own, if they couldn't already. And they are more united than ever.

The USA can support them while now being able to focus on Asia.

CCP potential aggression just got a LOT harder.

In the event of something sparking up in Asia, the USA can now devote her full might at the issue, while providing some support in Europe.

Russia has effectively screwed the CCP more than we can possibly fathom.

Support for Ukraine has shown that a Taiwan expedition is more costly than expected and now the USA can focus on any such issue (or incursions into SEA).

Long-term, Russia has done more to maintain the world order it sought to overthrow, than threaten it.

And there are so many other elements to this that empower semi-non-aligned nations in SEA. They now know that they will be supported against CCP (btw, Australia would support them anyways, they are our lifeblood and we have many people-level connections to them).

Now there is no question.

TLDR; USA is in the medium-term, freed up to focus more on Asia and SEA countries are more empowered to advocate for their own interests against any possible CCP coercion or aggression.

Well done Russia, you played yourself and strengthened and united your so-called 'enemies'.

But, we need to get Ukraine everything she needs and more to win this thing, it isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do, for all of us. I know for a fact Australia and the Dutch will not stop or back down, MH17 has not been forgotten.

Its the next logical step to arming Ukraine and will put massive pressure on Russian lines, a potential breakthrough force could amass anywhere at any time.

(Yes the Abrams can run on Diesel, it's a myth that it only uses JP8) 

I think that US DoD has decided on sort of 3 step plan for arming Ukraine and I think an analogy is best. It's sort of like arming a knight.

A Knight has a sword, a shield and a horse. These are 3 essential components of the Knight

In the first days of the war the US (and other western allies) sent the **shield.** Javelins, NLAW etc. served a massive role in helping to slow down and pick off Russian columns one by one, they were a great defensive tool and without them the battle lines likely would look very different than they do today. 

Following that stage of the war, Ukraine proved their capability and willingness to defend their land and the next stage of shipments came in. M777 howitzers, then HIMARS, and a variety of other artillery pieces both towed and sell propelled. the US also sent HARMS, artillery ammunition and a variety of drones. This was the **sword**, the range and firepower needed to strike Russian targets, whether they be infantry, anti-air facilities or large ammo storage facilities far behind enemy lines

Finally we find ourselves with Knight without a steed, if Ukraine is to mount continued counteroffensives, they need more vehicles. They need their **horse.** This isn't just tanks either, its logistical equipment, transport, lightly armored vehicles, armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles etc. and all the technical support to maintain it. This is the hardest to arm Ukraine with but also the most beneficial, if the west can successfully equip Ukraine with enough of these vehicles, Ukraine can win the war with (relatively) little bloodshed. I still believe Ukraine will win  the war regardless, but if they get that stuff now, that's the difference between 10 more months of war, and 10 years.",False,1663915922.0,t3_xlmw8b,t3_xlmw8b,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

He had made a comment that in Russia, any sort of backing down is seen as a sign of weakness to a point where it’s not societally acceptable. 

I recently became good friends with a Russian-American (he despises Putin and the overall existence of Russia FWIW), and he made a similar comment. He said for starters, Russians have had this idea hammered into their head for generations that they’re superior in every context to the rest of the world to a level that they feel the world should be honored by their presence. He said that males in particular are taught to be ‘alpha’ and anything less gets you cast out. Bullying and treating people deemed ‘weaker’ as such is encouraged. Now tie that in with the fact that they think every non-Russian is inherently ‘weak’, and you can understand a Russians mentality a bit better.

I'm not sure if these are serious questions, but to answer them:

>1 Person can't stop a country

>Organizing people requires serious talent. People hate on leaders of companies, but the reality is that its really hard to get everyone in the same direction. Especially if they arent getting paid. John C Maxwell said something like: ""If you want to get good at leadership,  lead volunteers.""

>There is no mass communication that isnt compromised. Any communication to overthrow the government would need to be word of mouth. Even that can be compromised with spies. 

>People don't listen to people without a track-record of success. If your buddy who constantly loses their job asks you to join his startup, you are going to say no. If someone made a multi million dollar start up offered you, you'd consider it. The number of people that can make the request to overthrow the government and get enough people to participate is low. Likely in the few hundreds at most.

If we are using cold-war Era realpolitik to analyze this situation, we should conclude that Russia will not use nuclear weapons and we should not base policy on the assumption that they will.

Part of the MAD doctrine was that Russia needs to believe we are as ruthless as they are in order to maintain either an edge over Russia or at least equal footing.

That's why Nixon utilized the [madman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) to achieve goals such as ending the Vietnam War when the US was taking a beating...

>I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Sounds familiar right?

>I call it the Madman Theory, Ivan. I want the Ukrainians and the West to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Putin is obsessed about border security. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Zelenskyy himself will be in Prague in two days begging for peace.

In my opinion, you can judge what most international actors are willing to due by assuming they are pragmatic actors with no morals or ego, only the goal of advancing their position.

There are no outcomes to using a nuclear weapon that advance Russia's position. If they use a big nuke and start a nuclear war with the West.... we all die and Russia gains nothing. If Russia uses a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine they will lose their only benefactors - India and China - who both see that as a huge red line. Again, Russia would end up in a worse position.

The only thing Russia actually benefits from is threatening to use nuclear weapons... and that's what they're best at.

[Great article posted by another user](https://www.vox.com/world/2022/9/22/23366499/putin-russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-threat-expert) of an interview with a nuclear weapons expert...

There are now reports Putin is aiming for 1.2 million new troops. 

300k have already been sent. So that will mean a total commitment of 1.5 million.

Now factor in Russias hideous demographics. 144 million people. Average age 40.3.

Amazingly, out of that there are only about 41 million men in Russia between 18 and 65. So only 1 in 3 are males aged 18-65.

So 41 million potential soldiers.

But like all things in Russia, it gets worse. Over half (21 million) of them are over 45. And in that demographic the majority have significant health issues. The available statistics aren’t great, but about 2 in 3 disabled is a reasonable guess. Only 7 million of the 21 million men in Russia aged from 45 to 65 are able bodied.

Add the 20 million aged 18-45 and in total out of its total population of 144 million, Russia has only 27 million men physically able to fight.

The current goal of mobilisation will put a total of 1.5 million Russian soldiers in Ukraine.

That means 5.5% of all the able-bodied men in Russia are now going to Ukraine.

Sending over 1 in 20 of all physically fit people has significant effects on the ability of a country to run.

I’d be interested to see how this compares historically, but I consider this to be a full mobilisation.

If you’re from the west you really have to stop using common sense when trying to understand what is going on and what will happen in russia.

This is ex-ussr mentality, a country (and region) ruled by people who were thugs in the 90s.

I too live in an ex-ussr country and am very familiar with this mentality.

1. There will be no massive protests. People here will accept any shit the government throws at them. It’s the mentality that “it will not happen to me or my family “, if you have any doubts- look at dashcam videos from russia.
Even if 90% of population would want to protest, they would wait for other people to do it, because hey, there’s always a sucker that will do my job.

2. Yes, troops will be demoralised, but once they will get to the front they will not think twice, they will grab the gun and start shooting, because that’s what everyone is doing and you must not appear weak or afraid.
Sure, a lot of them will die, but they will also make a lot of damage.
3. Putin will not back down. Here it’s not acceptable for a male, and putin considers himself to be an alpha, to accept that you were wrong or to apologise.
4. There will not be a palace coup. You underestimate the power of corruption and money here. People are making millions just by pretending to be loyal, and realistically their only option is to keep pretending, otherwise there are couple hundred thousands other pretended loyalists that would rat you out for a bonus. I’m talking about propagandists and everyone with some power.


I’m not sure about nukes, but let me be clear - if there will be an order to use nukes, they will be used. Because everyone wants to be a “hero” and to get a sweet bonus. And propagandists- they will say nothing about it, because you can still be a propagandist even in North Korea and still enjoy caviar at lunch.

I know there were some officers in USSR who ignored nuke order, but back then it wasn’t about money, today it’s completely different.

If you're going to call me citing [current and intensified requests for Western tanks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/16/ukraine-russia-tanks/) as ""speculation"", on the same level as ""maybe there are secret plans we don't know about!"", yeah - this isn't going to go anywhere.

> When various nations have given them literally hundreds of heavy weapons...how is Ukraine being ""infantilized"" by being told they couldn't handle using new tanks? Seems like they are being rated as highly capable of using and maintaining new weapon systems.

I don't see how your argument supports your point. The provision and successful use of those weapon systems **exactly proves that Ukraine is able to acclimate to and operate Western technology**. What does that make claims of ""they can't operate Western tanks because they can't get used to the tech quickly enough"", other than an infantilizing rationalization?

> they already have enough tanks because of the hundreds of T-72's they've been given in the last few months

You realize total Russian tank storage is on the order of 10,000? Of course not all of them are ready for use or even possible to restore, but even several thousand dwarfs the number lost or received by Ukraine by an order of magnitude. That's an entire digit, not just some rounding error.

Ukraine has been fighting this entire war at a massive equipment disadvantage from the very beginning, and they've been pushing to overcome it through sheer grit, blood, and sweat. Yes, they have at times been able to leverage Western technology to gain advantages beyond numerical superiority, like increased range and accuracy in Western artillery systems. But that's because of the technological advantages present in those Western systems - **that's not the case with tanks, especially the old tanks Ukraine is receiving or scavenging from Russia in varying degrees of function**.

Beyond that, I'm not sure what ""enough"" is supposed to mean. It's not like Ukraine has some maximum number of tank operators, and more equipment leads to faster and more effective offensives on their part, fewer losses, and quicker salvation for their people. What amount of that is ""enough"", where they don't need more?",1663906859.0,1663906381.0,t3_xlmw8b,t3_xlmw8b,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

I was wondering if it could be explained by the massive amount of people leaving the country exchanging their rouble for foreign currency. In my mind, this should cause the value to fall if everybody is ""selling"" their roubles.

Instead anyone leaving Russia gets more foreign value for their roubles.

On the other hand, It could be a last attempt to get as much value as possible by the government when they're selling their natural resources in Roubles.

Ukraine needs to get close enough to Starobilsk to have fire control over the rail way (or capture the town outright). that would deny any Russian supplies from the north.

However, even if they are successful in fielding these tanks, one has to wonder how effective they will be. The Russians have gone through most of their troops that are capable of complex offensive operations (and even those performed quite poorly). Tanks of course also require ammo, fuel and maintenance and Russia's logistics have not exactly been stellar in this conflict.

This mobilization is an admission that Russia no longer has enough soldiers in Ukraine to win, so they are scrambling for any warm bodies. The fraudulent referenda are a last ditch attempt to hold on to any of the territory Russia currently controls as its about to lose it. Ukraine is on the move again and Russia’s defensive line in Luhansk and Donetsk might have already been breached. 

Russia spent months attempting to hold referenda that could pass for legitimate if you squinted at them hard enough, like the Crimean referendum. They kept having to cancel them because Ukraine kept getting victories, including the partisans making it dangerous to be involved with the referenda at all. Now Russia needs to add captured Ukrainian territory to Russia proper ASAP or they will probably lose it. If it is “Russian” territory, they can quickly beef up the dwindling manpower by sending in conscripts and cadets, who might be marginally better than the cannon-fodder getting grabbed off the street at the moment. So Russia is holding those “referenda” now, but they are so clearly fraudulent that not even China could buy it as a legitimate vote. 

All of this is an admission of one simple fact: Russia is losing the war and will lose it unless a miracle happens. Sending in waves of cannon fodder and adding the portions of Ukraine under Russian control directly to Russia is a last-ditch attempt to improve a very bad situation.

Even though the risk of nuclear war is probably very low (none of us know what's going on in Putin's head), the expert interviewed in that article also said he's concerned about the nuclear implications of the upcoming annexation:


Jen Kirby:

Putin has attached the question of territorial integrity to the nuclear conversation in a way that he hasn’t before. Then you have these sham referenda in these four territories. The big question really is: What happens if Ukraine, with Western weapons, attacks or continues its counteroffensive, in these areas?

Andrey Baklitskiy:

That would be my biggest concern in all of this.

We’ve seen shelling of territories, which Russia controls, or considers part of its territory, or has always been parts of its territory, in Kursk, in Belgorod, in Crimea. Ukraine has been launching attacks on Russian territory. But before that, there was no way to connect this to any use of nuclear weapons because there was clearly no threat to the existence of the state from some village in Belgorod being shelled.

Now, if you say the territorial integrity of Russia, [is threatened], if Russia doesn’t respond, what does that mean for other Russian statements? Frankly, I’m not sure why you would want to go there and put yourself in that position",False,1663947781.0,t3_xlmw8b,t1_iplv5jh,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In the cold War all parties were sensible enough to not start a direct conflict. Even when it got really close (Cuba crisis) things were resolved with some very creative diplomacy.

It was a lot of sabre rattling and things got tense a couple of times but everyone involved knew an active war would escalate with consequences no one wanted to be responsible for. Everyone wanted a status-quo

Putin has crossed that line, for all intents and purposes, this is an active war between west and east. Putin escalated again now and he will escalate further if need be.

He is not going to give up, if he loses he's done, he knows that. He won't. But he can't win a conventional war either, thats painfully clear too.

Right now, in my opinion, the future looks pretty bleak. The only hope is resistance from within Russia. But even if he's disposed of, the world has to deal with a very unstable and corrupt to the bone country possessing thousands of nuclear weapons.

None of it means they are running out of tanks. Plus Mykhailo Podolyak is just one advisor to Zelensky and not even related directly to military matters and there isn't even a quote of him ""pleading"" for tanks, that language seems inserted by the author. He also has no military experience, he never served. Talking about getting new tanks is understandable, it doesn't mean they don't still have a decent number in service. Him talking about wanting them is not evidence of desperate need either. He's doing his job, pressing for more equipment, that doesn't mean the Ukrainian military is running out of tanks, all indications are they aren't.

> You realize total Russian tank storage is on the order of 10,000?

And they're already shipping T-62's to the front that a T-72 is superior too in every single way, armor, mobility and gun. So those reserves look like they're already scraping the bottom of the barrel. Part of fulfilling the most desperate of Ukraine's many needs is to consider the threat from the other side. Ukraine's T-72's are equal to or better than what the Russians are fielding. And I will say once again over 200 of those T-72's were recently upgraded by Poland and were in current service with their army, they are most likely better than *anything* Russia can field short of the odd T-90.

And yes the Ukrainian army does have a finite capacity to absorb new weapon systems. You need to train men, form units, work out backend logistics and so on. It's a huge effort that Ukraine has already had to do with so many other systems. So if they can supply Ukraine with enough T-72's for now and those are better than or equal too the vast majority of what the Soviets can field why do they need to be given yet another weapon system to get up to speed on? What's more just like all the other weapon systems that were endlessly debated like it was never going to happen until they were suddenly in Ukraine how do you know the same thing isn't happening with tanks?

The US and it's allies have with every new weapon system ""boiled the frog"" by playing out in public a big debate as to *if* they should give Ukraine something while preparing to give it to them behind the scenes. Armored personal carriers, howitzers, HIMARS, counter battery radars and even those hundreds of T-72 tanks they pretend like it might not happen and then all the sudden they're in Ukraine.

Simply put you are ignoring every other issue around it and just beating the ""more tanks! why not more tanks now!"" drum and claiming Ukraine is being infantilized even though there is zero sign of that given all the other weapon systems they have gotten.

By that point in WWII, it was very clear that Japan was losing the war, but the very real fear was that Japan wouldn’t surrender unconditionally unless allied forces were knocking on the doors of the imperial palace. To get those boots there would likely be an absolutely bloody fight, with casualties on both sides worse than all those from both the nuclear bombs and the conventional firebombing of major cities like Tokyo. So the US used its two nuclear strikes to drive home that unless Japan surrendered right away, a lot of people were going to die, way more than in the nuclear strikes. It worked.

Javelins take 10 seconds to hit a target 3000 meters away.

A tank takes 2 seconds.

---------------

There's a big difference between support that takes 10-seconds to hit its target, and support that takes 2-seconds to hit the target.

There's also the tidbit where the tank-shot is like $2000, while the Javelin shot is $80,000. There's also the tidbit that tank shots are horrifyingly destructive in ways that make a Javelin rocket look like a pea-shooter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEAYNX_UCjw

Oh right, and missiles are larger, slower, and take longer to reload. The M2 Bradley can carry like 8 missiles. A M1 Abrams tank can carry like 50 shots, and a good gunner can load / fire the gun every couple of seconds.

33c07c93f51d3b1a5d11d7b5ee521c16,xlmw8b,ipno6pu,"I agree with you to some extent but there are a couple of issues here.

First, there is a gigantic difference between knowing how to aim and fire a weapon and being proficient at it. Two weeks of training before being sent into a war zone is not even close to enough to be proficient. I do agree with you that 300K soldiers with guns is nothing to sneeze at, but you have to understand that 300K guys with guns and two weeks of training is a far cry from being a formidable force. Keep in mind the 2 weeks of training they will receive will be sub-par as most if not all of the actual Russian trainers have already been sent to war and killed in Ukraine. In the heat of combat, many will be sitting ducks against a trained army as two weeks of training are quickly forgotten as shells explode and bullets fly, they will revert to gut instincts and either flee or shoot wildly.

Second, the morale of the soldiers who signed up for duty and had a good amount of training before being sent into Ukraine is currently in the toilets. Fresh draftees will indeed inject a little bit of morale back into the war, but the people snatched off the streets to fight will be much quicker to sour from their experience. I don't believe the morale boost will be long lived.

Lastly, the Winter will most likely slow the war down as you said. The reality, as far as we can see it now, is that the slowdown will not be an advantage for the Russians. The Ukrainians will be better supplied, better equipped, fighting on their home ground, and better motivated. A slowdown will give Ukraine time to get more and better training on western weapons systems and vehicles/aircraft and the West has already allocated so much money to the war that even apathy will not stop the flow of funding for quite some time.

In the meantime, Russia continues to be crippled by sanctions and supply problems. Putin's only hope is that the West is seriously hurt by gas shortages or grows tired of supporting this war. I think its more likely that the Russian population stops allowing it before the West grows tired of it as it's not our boys and girls dying out there.

No, not everyone knows how to fire a gun properly. Or load one for that matter. This has already come up in russia's previous mobilization attempts and it won't change here since they are recruiting people with no military experience. Keep in mind in the early days after Feb 24 UA wasn't taking people without military experience in to the foreign legion since the burden they cause on the experienced troops outweighs the benefit.

While undoubtedly there will be some amount of healthy soldiers, they are disproportionately recruiting people from the poorest parts of russia in the 18-65 age range. There's a lot of videos highlighting problems with alcoholism in the new mobilized troops, but even putting that aside it is extremely difficult to live in poverty in any country and keep healthy. 

See the above point for morale, now consider that protesters and prisoners and others are being forced to mobilize. You can say morale is ""neutral"" *maybe*, and sure there are a few with high morale I guess, but in general if you've been following this war at all, every major intelligence source worth a damn has highlighted the poor russian morale. This is sure to bring the morale down further.

As for ""trully modern weapons"" this is a poor way to look at it. Lots of the technologies being used are spins on older stuff (see HIMARS) but the age doesn't matter at all as long as they're sending the right stuff for the situation.

First of all, such wristbands would be a security risk. I know you said they only transmit once the pulse stops, but that means there can be zero failure rate. If a device transmits erroneously, it will potentially give away the position of troops. Especially with wearable tech, that risk is quite great - because there will be user error. People who loosen their wrist bands, or in this case in rough environments the wristband may get torn, dislocated or something gets wedged in between the sensor, the sensor gets wet and corrodes and malfunctions etc etc. 

It's also an expensive solution, because you need relatively advanced tech, including sensor, cpu/mainboard, a SIM card, mobile service subscription and GSM chip. Even done on the cheap, you're looking probably at tens of US dollars. You can do a lot of other stuff with that money during a war.

Lastly, battlefield reporting while not 100% accurate, is ""accurate enough"". Yes there is uncertainty in the current system, but there will also be uncertainty in such a wrist band. Think of it this way: if you had a family member whose wristband would have signalled ""loss of pulse"", would you just accept they were dead, or would you think: ""Maybe the band malfunctioned?

A US unable or unwilling to support NATO, SK, Japan, SEA, Australia, Taiwan will lead to many new conflicts in the region. 

Just see how Russias decline has resulted in conflicts in the CSTO. Then multiply that globally.

Until this happens, WW3 remains highly unlikely and growing increasingly less so as China will not engage Taiwan with so many countries on high alert due to Ukraine. 

Secondary possibility is what’s happening in Iran - topping the regime is an interesting “what if” that remains highly unlikely. Another unstable power vacuum without a stable transition of power could lead to some interesting scenarios… would the Taliban be interested in some territory on the west (despite a barely tangible hold in Afghanistan)? Or would ISIS see another resurgence pushing in from the east? Or MBS eyeing irans oil reserves in the east as well? 

Lighting a match in that region could lead to further conflicts in the region, and with greater resource and economic instability, other regions may be forced to compete for local resources with violence. 

To your point - Russia has lost literally all of it's geopolitical influence. It can only wave nukes, but that's not WW3, that's MAD. They can barely push into Ukraine now, let alone Finland/Sweden.

 >The Tunguska event (occasionally also called the Tunguska incident) was a ~12 megaton explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate (now Krasnoyarsk Krai), Russia, on the morning of June 30, 1908. The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened an estimated 80 million trees over an area of 2,150 km2 (830 sq mi) of forest, and eyewitness reports suggest that at least three people may have died in the event. The explosion is generally attributed to a meteor air burst: the atmospheric explosion of a stony asteroid about 50–60 metres (160–200 feet) in size. : p.

So I actually think that because the army is so archaic (apparently in order for them to not rebel) I don't really think they would have the same trouble as retired NATO troops would have in order to function in the field today because nothing has changed in the Russian army since they retired except it has gotten worse because Russia lost most of it wealthiest colonies with the collapse of the soviet union.",False,1663975670.0,t3_xlmw8b,t1_ipnk7ul,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

However, not all of these submarines are fully operational, and the warhead loading on some of the missiles may have been reduced as part of New START implementation; the total number of warheads carried is possibly around 608.

This is a hugely key factor that is usually lumped-in and overshadowed with the simplistic ""they're corrupt!"" statement.

It affects everything and it doesn't happen in just dictatorships but anywhere there is unaccountable authority.

For example, I have a shitty job. The managers and directors didn't obtain their positions through merit but connections. Back in February we told them we wouldn't be able to keep up production with current staffing levels (which had been bad for years and went unaddressed). 

We were told, ""don't stress, we understand, focus on solutions, this won't fall on you, and remain positive!"" (cya corporate speak of course)

I was just written up for ""insubordination and failure to project a positive image"" after I told a director that our schedule is more than 2 months out due to unaddressed staffing shortages.

Whats my incentive for making my workplace better?

Same thing with this war. There wasn't a single commander in the Russian forces who would be willing to stand up and say ""this army is woefully unprepared to fight and lacks the most basic training,  equipment, supplies, and morale. No one understands their mission and your objectives are unobtainable under current conditions.""

Anyone who cared that much about their soldiers or nation and was competent and responsible enough to give such an honest assessment would never rise to the rank of General in the Russian services. Anyone calling out those at the top would take a short trip off a tall building.

So when it was go-time for Russia, Putin (who clearly never actually *looked* at the state of his military prior to the invasion) was told 

""Yes sir, you were clearly right and we didn't need a dedicated air campaign! Also, all the vehicles and their cheap Chinese tires are in tip-top shape, we totally aren't using unsecured off-the-shelf cheap-ass Chinese radios, we have no fuel supply issues which could cause 40km backed up invasion convoys to be sitting ducks, we've got tons and tons of guided weapons which won't land on us, our tanks are the most modern T-72s running, 2014 was a very good year for MREs and troops love getting 1 of those a day! We're ready to die for you Mr. Putin, sir!""

And hes foolishly so used to hearing only what he wants to hear, didn't question it and instead said, ""Go.""

So heavy you also need extra-specialized equipment just to haul them around and get them unstuck or fixed when they break down.

You also need mechanics with specialized training in turbine engines.  Otherwise, they'll break down.  That training takes six months or so.  

There's even more to it than that, but that gives you an idea of how much goes into giving Ukraine Abrams.  It's not that easy.

 >Blue force tracking is a United States military term for a GPS-enabled capability that provides military commanders and forces with location information about friendly (and despite its name, also hostile) military forces. In NATO military symbology, blue typically denotes friendly forces. The capability provides a common picture of the location of friendly forces and therefore is referred to as the blue force tracker. When all capitalized, the term refers to a specific defense contractors' system, but the capability is found in many military and civilian mobile apps.

This. China holds all the cards to take advantage of the Russia's decline. First, it is estimated that Russia has yuan based debt around $140 billion.

Also, as valuations of Russian companies decrease and they need liquidity to pay their operationg costs, energy sector included, it opens up possibilites for Chinese companies to purchase them cheaply. There really is a possibility that Russia is gradually drifting towards being an ""economic colony"" of China especially in the far east as China manages to get hold of big part of Russia's natural resources, related infrastructure and industry.

 >New Sweden (Swedish: Nya Sverige; Finnish: Uusi Ruotsi; Latin: Nova Svecia) was a Swedish colony along the lower reaches of the Delaware River in the United States from 1638 to 1655, established during the Thirty Years' War when Sweden was a great military power. New Sweden formed part of the Swedish efforts to colonize the Americas. Settlements were established on both sides of the Delaware Valley in the region of Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, often in places where Swedish traders had been visiting since about 1610. Fort Christina in Wilmington, Delaware, was the first settlement, named after the reigning Swedish monarch.

 >Euromaidan (; Ukrainian: Євромайда́н, romanized: Yevromaidán, lit. 'Euro Square', IPA: [jeu̯romɐjˈdɑn] ), or the Maidan Uprising, was a wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine, which began on 21 November 2013 with large protests in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv. The protests were sparked by the Ukrainian government's sudden decision not to sign the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Ukraine's parliament had overwhelmingly approved of finalizing the Agreement with the EU, while Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.

Whatabout Arabs murdering Israelis, which isn't related at all to the topic at hand but is still really super terrible and successfully changes the subject from whatever it was that we were originally talking about, I forget what was that now? 

An army *known specifically and feared for* using rape as a weapon is not the same as solders committing crimes against civilians in their power because they have the guns and the civilians don't.

War is shitty in far too many levels to define in a forum post. Being known worldwide for your brutality takes extra-special effort. Let's keep focus and persepective here.

But overall, a rifle from 1980 is about as good as anything coming out today.  


I would argue that the NATO 5.56 cartridge is better for long-range engagements like the ones we're seeing in footage from a lot of the fighting in Ukraine.  Obviously, NATO countries providing weapons are largely doing so in 5.56, with some surplus AKs mixed in.  As long as the Ukrainians know how to clean and maintain the new rifles they're getting, they should get a marginal advantage from that.  


But the Russians are rumored to be equipping some of the new conscripts with Mosin-Nagants, which is a rifle designed in 1891.  They should totally work, because they're very sturdy and good rifles.  But they are 5-shot bolt-action rifles.  Modern battles come down largely to fire-superiority, and it would be impossible for a unit armed with Mosin-Nagants to compete with the sheer volume of semi-automatic rifles with 30-round magazines.  In close quarters, the Mosin-Nagants get absolutely hammered.

So for the front line the two are not that far apart. But when you compare what Ukraine has vs something like the Mosin there is massive differences. the Mosin has an internet magazine so after 5 rounds are fired the soldier has to put more bullets into the gun by hand instead of replacing a magazine.

Russia would gain nothing from it and would be just committing suicide as a country. Even if it did destroy Ukraine, Russia would also be destroyed. That’s why most of the conditions under which both the US and Russia as well as other nuclear countries have set out under which they would use nukes are basically existential threats. They get used only if it’s a chance to take out your opponent with you. If there’s a chance you could survive without using them, you don’t. 

Even if Ukraine pushed Russia back to its 1991 borders, Russia could survive. If Ukraine was at the gates of Moscow, Russia might be justified in using nukes. That’s why they are a next to useless weapon, really only useful as a threat than in actual combat. The truth is Ukraine and its allies can ignore the nuclear threats because they don’t change anything about this war. Russia’s goal this whole time has been to destroy Ukraine. They try to sugar-coat it or obfuscate with other reasons, but that has been the obvious goal from the moment Russia put boots down at Hostomel airfield. So Ukraine’s win condition is ultimately to survive at all, with it being a sign of how well they are doing that taking back the 1991 borders looks like a reasonable end. They don’t worry about the nukes because Russia wants to do that anyway, either through nukes or by conventional means. To have the hope of surviving at all, Ukraine has to fight.",1663948823.0,1663948305.0,t3_xlmw8b,t1_ipluvj1,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

It's very weird, especially when you consider fuel requirements and stuff... does a jet like that always have that much fuel on board, that they can reverse and make basically the entire trip back home? Every pound of weight costs money in a plane and I'd expect they just don't 'fill it up' every time, they put enough fuel in to make it to the destination, plus a reasonable reserve to divert to nearby areas or taxi around in the air for a while due to traffic jams or waiting for weather conditions to change and whatnot.

And it's often the commercial flights, not the military ones that they allow you to see. 

About a day ago there was a commercial flight that took off from Moscow, which was supposed to be an 8-hour flight across the country. Instead it circled for 2.5 hours and its status ended up being marked as 'diverted' back to the Moscow airport and it landed. The best explanation for it circling for so long is that it's an airplane that doesn't have the ability to dump fuel, so it has to burn it off. You can read about why a fuel dump might be necessary here: https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/why-do-airplanes-dump-fuel/#:~:text=The%20reason%20to%20dump%20fuel,Maximum%20Takeoff%20Weight%20(MTOW).

Here's the flight history for the plane I'm talking about: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ra-73729

The most recent flight marked as 'diverted' is the one I'm talking about.

The reason why this could be important/relevant is because of the reported degradation of Russia's flight industry. They're running out of parts to maintain their aircraft. This particular flight looks like a possible mechanical failure, which forced them to return after takeoff, and they had to burn off fuel before landing safely. It could be a sign of similar stuff to come. Otherwise, someone ordered that plane to be turned around, and it had to do that burnoff before landing, and that's interesting too. 

I'm annoyed as anyone by the FlightRadar stuff being posted here that Reddit Detectives think is military intelligence and isn't, but IMO is does have informative uses. As Russia's commercial air capability degrades due to sanctions, I expect we'll see more stuff like this happening, and the first way we'll know about it will be through flight tracking.

 >In Marxist terminology, a revolutionary situation is a political situation indicative of a possibility of a revolution. The concept was introduced by Vladimir Lenin in 1913, in his article ""Маёвка революционного пролетариата"" (Mayovka of the Revolutionary Proletariat). In the article two conditions for a revolutionary situation were described, which were later succinctly phrased as ""the bottoms don't want and the tops cannot live in the old way"". In later works Lenin postulated a third condition: high political activity of the working masses, their readiness to revolutionary actions.

What kind of scientific analysis says ""our studies have shown that *plenty* of Russians of Germany support Putin"". The answer is a non-scientific one, and we're back to my statement about anecdotal evidence. So a pro-Putin demonstration accounts for every Russian in Germany? Come off it mate, I know you're not that daft. 

According to wikipedia there are 2.2 million ethnic Russians in Germany, about 230,000 are Russian citizens. From cursory google searches, I see that these pro-Putin demonstrations range from a couple of hundred to the low thousands. The largest I could find was 2000 in Cologne. 900 in Berlin (which has about 300,000 Russians, including German Russians). Let's be generous to you and estimate that there were 15,000 Russians involved in pro-Putin demonstrations. That's 0.68% of the Russian population in Germany. 0.3% of the russian population in Berlin demonstrated for Putin. Granted, according to Cologne data, 2000 demonstrators in Cologne is 13% of the russian population there, although these conclusions do not take into account the fact that Russians may well have travelled to Cologne from other areas to participate, and even so, 13% is still a far cry from ""plenty"", let alone most. 

So what to do? Deport immediately any Russian who participates in a demonstration for Putin or against Ukraine, if they do not have a German citizenship. Is that terribly hard? Or if you are oh so concerned that intelligence agents will operate covertly against Europe - do you think ending humanitarian visas will seriously stop a determined intelligence agent? Their best intelligence guys already have citizenships all across Europe. They don't even need to be Russian. You are arguing for solving a bruised leg by amputating it. 

I trust the European and German intelligence guys to know what they're doing. I also trust my belief that, of that 99.3% of Russians who did not demonstrate in Germany, at least 95% of that are very happy to call Germany home, to call it a safe place for them to live without fear of going missing in the night, or in fear that their son will be taken away never to be heard of again.",False,1663959419.0,t3_xlmw8b,t1_ipmfqil,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

I do feel like I need a ""intro to ancient Rome 101"" book first; the author assumes the reader has a certain level of knowledge.  Although I've long had a non-academic interest in ancient Rome, I still need a dictionary or Wikipedia on hand, to be honest.   Caesar's life is presented chronologically, but it doesn't flow easily as a narrative.  I stopped after reading about 25% of it. Not because it was boring per se, but just because I personally can only read so much intensive nonfiction at a time.  I've read other history books that flowed a little easier, but usually because the author traded some depth for audience accessibility.  I do intend to come back to read the rest at some point.  

You're right about Caesar demonstrating some clout with his marriage though.  As a teenager he married Cornelia, daughter of the most powerful man in Rome.  Reading between the lines, I'd guess that *she* had her eyes on *him*.  He allegedly stood out among his peers as a youth.  A match with him didn't bring any particular wealth or political sway, and at the time he was earmarked for a prestigious but dead-end ceremonial position.  Given he met the requisite social class status, he was the kind of guy a rich girl could marry without her folks objecting.  For his later marriages, he was more established in society by merit.

As for what you write here, I guess it comes down to the fact that I believe a small group of guys managing to get asylum in Germany will have a negligible effect on the outcome. I absolutely agree with you that change can only come from within. All that said, I do take what you've said to heart, and in many ways I guess you're right. 

Since you shared your story with me, I'll share mine. I'm married to a Russian woman, and I've lived in Petersburg, Russia for nearly 10 years (I'm from New Zealand). I'll admit that until February 24th, I did what the Romans do and tried to stay apolitical. Since February though, I've been doing what I can (as a foreigner) to spread awareness and support opposition. As a teacher of teens I have the unique chance to (carefully) ensure that they have all the critical thinking tools to know how to evaluate truth and nurture principles of empathy, and hope and determination to be active in shaping the country they want to live in, rather than passive bystanders. Not that I have to do much in that regard - my teens are unanimously distraught by the war and what's happening in Ukraine, and at the bleak future of their country, which they feel has been robbed from them. I understand that these are not your ordinary teens, being middle class, educated, etc. But it's something at least. To be clear I don't say this to ask for sympathy or pity at all. What I wanted to say is that I feel outraged every day I go to work and see people drinking and partying in the streets, living life like nothing is happening. Saint Petersburg is a home to me now, so I feel equally as responsible as Russians, although I am not a citizen, and I do what I can to tell people, even my friends, that they need to shake themselves out of this drunken stupor and realise that this stops the very moment they want it to stop. 

It's a weird world to live in. If we forget that the war exists, these people are generally warm and kind, and there's a good reason why Petersburg came to mean so much to me - the culture, my circle of friends, the nightlife, the history, etc. But the war exists, Putin exists, and the atrocities committed against innocent Ukrainians exists, and somehow I have to grapple with the fact that my warm, kind, and wonderful circle of friends are also the ones who look at all this and say ""well, it can't be helped, there's no way to change it"".

For my part in that apathy and ignorance, I am sorry to you, your mum and dad, and your countrymen. I understand words don't mean anything, though. So, I'll continue supporting the protestors, shaming my friends who still think there's no way to stop this, and spreading knowledge and awareness through my teaching, and hope that eventually these morons will finally figure their shit out.
