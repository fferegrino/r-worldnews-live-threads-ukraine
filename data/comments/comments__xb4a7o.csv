Day 200 of my updates from Kharkiv

Something weird is happening right now, around 20 minutes ago the entire Kharkiv and its oblast lost power. There's no electricity anymore, so the city is completely dark.

Right after the blackout we heard some very loud explosions, there's reports of an enormous fire in Kharkiv oblast, probably has something to do with electricity being cut.

There are reports of electricity being cut in other regions as well. There's no power in some parts of Poltava, Sumy Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya.

There's now info about a thermal power plant being hit in Kharkiv oblast, which is what caused the blackout.

If the electricity problems are not fixed soon, I probably won't be able to post anymore updates in the near future.

Vladimir Putin, who has changed command twice since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, no longer wants to see his generals.

The President postponed meetings in Sochi with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense after the army in Kharkiv region suffered the largest defeat since the beginning of the war.

During the week, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to reconquer 3 thousand square kilometers, Valery Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said on Sunday. After the breakthrough of the front, the Russian army left the territory in a matter of days, which with thousands of victims captured for about three months.

Following Balakleya, Kupyansk and Izyum were left, where the occupation administration of the Kharkiv region and the headquarters of the group advancing on Donbass from the North were located. The Russian Ministry of Defense on Saturday called what was happening ""distractions"" and planned withdrawals of troops.

But this hardly suits President Vladimir Putin. He postponed meetings with the leadership of the defense department and representatives of the military-industrial complex - these meetings are ""shifting to the right"" in the schedule of the head of state, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

""As a special military operation develops, some experience is gained to be discussed,"" he said, adding that meetings are necessary. Peskov did not name the new term (quotes from RIA Novosti).


The retreat of the Russian army from Izyum and Kupyansk is a ""complete collapse,"" says Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at St. Andrews University in Scotland. 

""For the battle for Donbass, more troops were probably deployed there than anywhere else, and now they seem to be unable to keep anything there,"" O'Brien explains.

Due to the army's fiasco, referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine have been postponed indefinitely, Medusa reports, citing sources close to the presidential administration.

Initially scheduled for May, then postponed to September, then postponed to November, referendums are put ""on the stop,"" said one of the interlocutors of the publication.

According to another, political technologists sent to Kharkiv and Zaporozhye regions to prepare the voting received an ""order to go home,"" says a Medusa source. In the Kherson region, Russian political strategists who were preparing a referendum remain.

After a successful counterattack, Ukrainians will now have ""their own problems with logistics: they will need to supply all the units now scattered throughout the territory"" occupied during the offensive in the Kharkiv region, says O'Brien. ""But the Russians will have problems stabilizing the front line,"" he continues. ""So for some time the situation will be chaotic until a new front line begins to emerge.""",False,1662915611.0,t3_xb4a7o,t3_xb4a7o,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 11 September 2022


- Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region. Russia has likely withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the strategically important cities of Kupiansk and Izium.

- On 07 September 2022, President Putin said that only 60,000 tonnes of the grain exported from Ukraine since August had been sent to developing Countries, and that the majority had been delivered to EU states.

- Putin's claim is not true. According to UN figures, around 30% has been supplied to low and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

- Russia is pursuing a deliberate misinformation strategy as it seeks to deflect blame for food insecurity issues, discredit Ukraine and minimise opposition to its invasion.",False,1662881075.0,t3_xb4a7o,t3_xb4a7o,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

ZALIZNYCHNE, Ukraine — In the end, the Russians fled any way they could on Friday, on stolen bicycles, disguised as locals, abandoned by their units. Hours after Ukrainian soldiers poured into the area, hundreds of Russian soldiers encamped in this village were gone, leaving behind stunned residents to face the ruins of 28 weeks of occupation.

“They just dropped rifles on the ground,” Olena Matvienko said Sunday as she stood, still disoriented, in a village littered with ammo crates and torched vehicles, including a Russian tank loaded on a flatbed. The first investigators from Kharkiv had just pulled in to collect the bodies of civilians shot by Russians, some that have been lying exposed for months.

…

“They were not monsters, they were kids,” said Matvienko, who once asked Russian troops to move the tank they parked in front of her house. “I asked what they wanted from us and they said, ‘We can either be here or we can be in jail.’ ”
Others told the villagers they weren’t there to fight Ukraine, but to “protect us from America.”

The Russians’ biggest rule for residents was to get inside by 6 p.m. and stay there, quiet and in the dark, several said. Violating that order could be fatal, as two men on the street learned early on. The friends were drinking and had a light on, said Maria Grygorova, who lives in the attached house next door. The next morning she found them on the floor.

“Konstiantyn had two bullet holes in his head,” she said.

She and two friends buried them in the side yard. The same two friends dug them up Sunday, with Ukrainian war crimes investigators looking on.

The team from Kharkiv collected two other bodies during their visit, including a security guard whose remains have been rotting on the floor of a gravel elevator at an asphalt plant for months, even as the Russians used it as a sniper tower.

Ukraine’s Reznikov warns on Russian counter-attack

Defence minister says Kyiv needs to secure territory after lightning offensive went ‘better than expected’

Reznikov said Ukrainian troops were tired after the six-day attack but morale was high because “it’s a sign that Russia can be defeated”.

He cautioned that Russian reinforcements could launch a counter-attack on his country’s stretched supply lines. Ukrainian forces could also be encircled by fresh Russian troops if they advance too far.
….

Officials and military analysts cautioned the offensive’s success did not mean that Ukrainian troops were about to roll back Russian forces to the border.

Reznikov said the nearly simultaneous counter-offensive around Kherson was making slower progress because it was an agricultural region “with irrigation channels” the Russians could use as defensive trenches.",False,1662948927.0,t3_xb4a7o,t3_xb4a7o,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

In less than SEVEN days we've seen Ukraine COMPLETELY TAKE BACK the Kharkiv Oblast. It's not an exaggeration to say Ukraine has launched one of the greatest counteroffensives since World War II.

For those that have with us these last few days watching history unfold live, it's good to have you. For those of you just joining us, I'll reiterate previous statement:

**When this war is over and Ukraine has recaptured ALL of its territory,** ***nobody*** **will ever wonder or question where** r/WorldNews **stood.**

People may criticize the sub, sometimes validly, but never doubt our commitment to this community. To all of you. To doing what's right, even when that isn't clear due to how fast a story may be developing. To ensuring quality in the face of mis/disinformation. (Folks forget we're just volunteers doing this because we love this little corner of the internet and want to give back!)

That's due to your mod team and close friends of the sub providing down to the minute updated for the last 7 months now. This herculean effort is of course only possible due to a combined team effort (we have 34 contributors), but I wanted to give a special shoutout to u/2spooky4me.

We see this Live Thread as our small contribution to the larger war effort. While we can't be on the frontline, our goal is to ensure continued and sustained international awareness. We've been doing that by providing the latest breaking news hours before the mainstream, with more details and images than any one outlet could ever provide.

Slava Ukraini!

If Russia doesn't change tack, its saying to its collapsed front line infantry that they have to go back out there, and capture 'again' what took months to take and days to lose, with an enemy with high morale and devastating weapons at their disposal and you're likely to have even less equipment to try and achieve this than last time (given the amount of equipment left behind or already destroyed).

The Eastern offensive could snowball if there is another offensive Army/Brigade in the wings, able to roll through while refit/rest is conducted.

The biggest question for me remains Melitopol. That axis contains the current NPP under threat by Russia (when do they not find one to put at risk?) but also, Melitopol is key to the entire southern theatre.

If boiling all of your drinking water is not practical, say if you only had an electric stove and your electricity is out, using bleach is a very easy method to disinfect water.(there are certain pathogens that are resistant to bleach like giardia, but it kills most water borne diseases.)

give it 30minutes to a couple hours to kill the pathogens before drinking (the colder the water the more time is needed for the bleach to work)

an especially useful aspect of using bleach to disinfect water is that it's very easy to disinfect very large containers, entire poly drums or large tanks of water can be disinfected at a time by adding the appropriate amount of bleach, mixing it a little, and waiting a couple hours.

basically 2 drops per liter of water, concentrated bleach (5-8%), double for water that is not perfectly clear.

Amazon will ship them to the fundraiser's house and she ships them to Kyiv.  
  
\- We've collected 236 items total so far! That's over $7800 in supplies! We still hope people will continue to contribute if they have spare cash! Check out our [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRbCobUuLC3gUJVvn9kZZyBV1x96g33CXapozBoDLHs/edit#gid=0) tracking contributions and shipments.

\- Our first three shipments are in transit, and we're [preparing a fourth](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1568402013142290432). This one will be bigger, because we needed a bigger box for the Burn Shields, so we'll ship it when the box fills up, hopefully by the end of the coming week. We're aiming to do bigger shipments at a frequeny of weekly or less since they are really expensive to ship individually. You can track the packages in the spreadsheet linked above. We're hoping the first will arrive in Ukraine this week.

The short version is that you should never wrestle with a pig in the mud: the pig has fun, and you get dirty.

In this case, Russia (the pig) is reacting emotionally - using valuable and scarce military resources to strike civilian critical infrastructure...  

This does nothing to degrade Ukraine's military capacity in other than temporary ways.  And just makes Ukraine more angry,  more justified in their anger,  and more determined to crush Russia like a  bug. And it makes us angry as well. 

Ukraine would of course be at least morally justified in striking back.  The world would not condemn them too loudly if they respond to violations of dignity with those of their own.  However, even if they contain strikes to valuable military targets that also inconvenience civilians, there is risk.  

Because for sure, having your army bushwhacked so badly they scamper back in shame for the second time in 200 days (of a 3-day mission that so far has failed)... that's *very* humiliating for Russians.  However, it's not the kind of humiliation that turns to rage.  It's not what causes Russian wives and daughters to insist their sons and husbands sign up to drive tanks that were 30 years old, 20 years ago.  Nor is it the kind of humiliation that causes Russian wives and daughters to rush out and learn how to weld.  It's just the kind of humiliation that causes them to cluck their tongues and demand scape-goats from Russia's military command.   

Which is exactly what Ukraine needs right now.   

Ideally, anyone in the Russian military with knowledge and perspective on how Ukraine just whupped 'em should be removed from the battlefield before they can apply this expensive tuition to a shift in strategy and tactics.   And by this, we'll get the third whupping, somewhere down the road.  Lather, Rinse, repeat.   

But if Ukraine retaliates, then humiliation may turn to anger, which may climb in tanks, start welding, and generally being painful.  Because there are a lot of them, and quantity has a quality all of its own.

Indeed, what Ukraine needs is to keep its wits.  Keep Russians humiliated, but not angered.  It is a fine balance.  One errant missile into a school could be all it takes.   For that reason, Ukraine should continue to do what Ukraine has been brilliantly doing:  force Russia to fight emotionally, without brains, and without the brawn it thinks it has.  While obliterating their capacity to actually fight.  Keep the fight within the ring, and keep on winning there.  Where it counts.

And we should continue to help them, with whatever they need.",False,1662925801.0,t3_xb4a7o,t3_xb4a7o,,0,107,0,107,3,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Having a picture of something somewhere is one thing, knowing exactly what you’re looking at and getting that information to the people who need it as fast as humanly possible is a whole different story.

That same technology development that we did to train computers how to recognize a traffic-light can be used to train a Global Hawk to recognize a tank.

We should appreciate how much this war hinges on his ability to keep the lie going. Yes, Ukraine has made great gains on the battlefield the last few days. But the damage they've done to his narrative may prove to be the more decisive blow. 

This war never should have happened. But after decades of lies he spun together a story where this war made sense. But now there is a man who has removed all dissent in his inner circle, and made all of his talking heads very.... Aware of what to talk around. They have their matching orders. They have their little freedoms. But now.... They have panic. 

One can only ignore fear and anxiety for so long, but no one can hide from panic. 

Will Putin keep the lie going for another week? His troops could probably lower their goals and make a mad dash to Crimea and hold it for the winter. But that would break Putin's story. And I don't think his story will make it through the fall. And I don't think his troops will make it through the winter. 

I want to taste these fucking lunatics finally panic in front of the world. The persecution complex's worst nightmare is now under their fucking bed. 

And I want to see how Putin handles it. It must have been stressful, all these years, keeping it up, greasing the way up the hill he is King of. Backstabbing and defenestrating and blackbagging and bribing and letting his underlings jockey for power amongst themselves under his thumb.

Take with a massive dump of salt, but this channel has been pretty trustworthy (they’re from Kherson and have the first hand information from there), so:




Information appeared online that the Russian Armed Forces' command in the Kherson region, starting from the evening of September 9, began to negotiate with the Southern command of the AFU about the surrender and abandonment of the occupied territories.

According to Russian military officers, as early as September 10, there was a verbal order to unit commanders to stop shelling and remain in the occupied positions. This information is confirmed by sources on both sides. The AFU confirmed that there was no serious combat or artillery fire by the Russians on the 10th.

According to preliminary information, the Russians may be allowed to pass from the left bank of the Dnieper to the right bank, as a result of which they can withdraw to Crimea, if they leave the matches, equipment, weapons and ammunition.

❗️The Russian military who are in the area and want to surrender have opened a corridor to Kiselevka, where they can come with a white flag (a rag, any noticeable piece of white cloth) and without weapons, with their hands raised.

The information is still unofficial, but very optimistic.

Electricity is out in five regions after a Russian attack on Ukrainian transmission lines. There is also no running water in many localities. In Kharkiv, the subway system has come to a standstill.Details of the Russian attack are not yet known, but all indications are that there was a massive attack using Kalibr-type cruise missiles, fired from Russian ships stationed in the Caspian Sea and submarines in the Black Sea. Their target was Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Some of the calibers were intercepted by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses, but the damage inflicted by the Russians was nonetheless severe.

The Kalibr hit a thermal power plant in Kharkiv, the second largest in the country. The city of 1.5 million residents and surrounding areas were left without electricity. The Kharkiv metro came to a standstill. Such a situation occurred for the first time in 40 years. Trains were running in Kharkiv when the Russians tried to capture the city in the spring.

Kyiv, which has lost its perception of reality, the official representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, suddenly started talking about “complete surrender and demilitarization of the Russian Federation”

Secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, breaking away from reality, suddenly announced the coming aggression against Russia within the generally recognized borders of our country - yes, in Moscow too. According to him, Ukraine will not be satisfied with the ""surrender of Crimea by Russia"" and ""huge reparations"" - however, where officials in general have such thoughts remains a mystery. But something else is more interesting: absolutely seriously, Danilov began to list the points that Kyiv is going to achieve, hinting at the “complete surrender and demilitarization of the Russian Federation” with the help of its Western allies.

“Our task is to make Russia such that she does not even have the desire to think that she can attack her neighbors, especially in the way she did in relation to our country,” Danilov is quoted as saying by RIA Novyi Den.

Ukrainian officials have new theses, and their confidence is clearly due to the support of the West. The neutralization of these thoughts is simply necessary - neither about the Crimea, nor about reparations, let alone any movements on the territory of our country, there can be no question.

Unlike the other responses, I will point out that the UK monarch does have explicit powers regarding foreign policy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative_in_the_United_Kingdom#Foreign_affairs

However, I don't see why Charles would change anything.

He is known for being more vocal on stuff than Elizabeth was when it came to governance. In fact, I just learned of his (in)famous 'Black Spider Memos' a few hours ago in the news: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_spider_memos

>The ""black spider"" memos are letters and memorandums written by Charles, Prince of Wales, to British government ministers and politicians over the years. As the modern British monarch remains politically neutral by tradition, the letters were controversial because of the Charles’ then-position as eldest child of the British monarch Queen Elizabeth II and heir apparent to the British throne.

>The letters were sent by Charles in a private capacity, but concerns have been raised that they may represent the exercise of undue influence over British government ministers. Issues about which Charles has expressed public views include farming, genetic modification, global warming, social deprivation, planning and architecture. This led the press to label Charles as a ""meddling prince"".[1][2] The content of the ""black spider"" letters, named after Charles' distinctive handwriting, was known only anecdotally and from memoirs and leaks, until 13 May 2015 when the Information Tribunal ordered the release of most of the correspondence.[3]

They're nicknamed 'black spider memos' because apparently he has some wonky handwriting that inspired the nickname. There's a chance he may continue this 'black spider memo' tradition, but there's no reason to believe they're be taken with much more seriousness than they are already. And again, I don't see any reason to believe he'd be motivated to push for some big policy shift.

Lazerpig's new video - What sunk the Moskva?

Spoiler alert - it's Russian hubris and corruption, Mosva's air defenses were not working, as per leaked Feb 10 Russian document

Now what has not been covered in the video is the mystery of what actually happened. Taras Chmut, who has a ton of insider knowledge of the Ukrainian army due to his position, has suggested multiple times that the real story is different from the official Ukrainian position that it was hit by Neptune. Chmut has for many years been a critic of Neptune, as the missiles performed very poorly during testing. He also promised to eventually, after many years, reveal what really happened.

Now, my personal theories:

1. It was Neptune, but there were a lot of attempts and many missiles have failed

2. It was Harpoon that arrived long before the official announcement, as it often happens with Western weapons

3. It was TB2 (there were rumours that it was providing targeting for Neptune)

If boiling all of your drinking water is not practical, say if you only had an electric stove and your electricity is out, using bleach is a very easy method to disinfect water.(there are certain pathogens that are resistant to bleach like giardia, but it kills most water borne diseases.)

give it 30minutes to a couple hours to kill the pathogens before drinking (the colder the water the more time is needed for the bleach to work)

an especially useful aspect of using bleach to disinfect water is that it's very easy to disinfect very large containers, entire poly drums or large tanks of water can be disinfected at a time by adding the appropriate amount of bleach, mixing it a little, and waiting a couple hours.

Putin thought he could conquer, supress and take Ukraine as though it and its people belonged to his country, he thought he could kill its leaders that would not bow to him, he thought he could dominate.

He was wrong.

He gambled he could resurrect the Soviet Union, that he could make Russia be feared and respected. That he could somehow think that his corrupt state eviscerated by 30 years of Kleptocracy and delusional gaslighting could somehow be a formidable power again.

He was wrong.

Zelenskyy will be remembered decades from now as the leader who held the line when facing the threat of conquest in the same vein as the likes of Churchill. Who refused to flee in the face of adversity and who ultimately will have led Ukraine to Victory against all odds rallying other freedom loving nations to their cause over a foe who should have been the stronger opponent but who was judged and found wanting by the Bravery and Honourable sacrifices of Ukraine and its soldiers and in the process exposed Russia, a once feared formidable power as a paper tiger, eviscerated and broken by its own corrupt institutions.

The price of Putin's Vainglorious Delusions for his actions will be eternal ignominy and failure. He will be remembered as a failure of a leader in the same vein as Hitler, a man whose delusions, corruption and lies ultimately ruined the potential of Russia and may possibly ensure its final collapse. For that is the price of the wages of deceit and folly. For those who ultimately rule through tyranny and fear the final end will always be the same: Failure, Irrelevancy and Defeat.

For all those who gave their lives for freedom may Ukraine prevail and all those who paid the highest of prices be remembered for their sacrifice for all time and as for Putin and his corrupt enablers may their final ends come swiftly and their legacy of corruption damn them to the obilivion of their own making and as history's greatest failures.",1662928377.0,1662927868.0,t3_xb4a7o,t1_io176a1,,1,44,0,44,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

> Until Ukraine liberated Kupiansk russian logistics moved from Valuyki to Kupiansk, Svatove and Rubizhne (cities in purple squares). Once Ukraine HIMARSes the two bridges at Troitske over a sidearm of the Urazova River and at Starobilsk over the Aidar River (cities in red squares; Aidar bridge in the photo), then the massive amounts of ammo, supplies and vehicles russia has amassed near Belgorod have to make a wide detour to Rostov-on-Don before they arrive in Luhansk.  Luckily both bridges are in M142 HIMARS range (Yellow circles) and will be gone in a few days.

\**rubs hands in anticipation*\*

> If Ukraine chooses to liberate Northern Luhansk now, then speedy advances from Kupiansk over the Oskil or North from Lyman (Blue 4s) will crush russian hopes of establishing a new frontline on the Oskil.

Isn't this exactly what they're rumored to have done?  Crossed the Oskil, contest Lyman?

> If Ukraine crosses the Oskil, then the next geographic feature suited for a new russian frontline is the Aidar River (Grey 5), but that is so close to the russian border, that russia would likely give up all of Northern Luhansk and retreat South of the Siverskyi Donets... which is where russia was before 24 February. In short russia would lose every bit of Luhansk occupied at massive cost since the start of the full invasion this year.

Greece was far better prepared than Italy expected - given previous tensions, they had seen it coming - but still, Italy's numerical superiority suggested that Greece had few chances of victory (Greece itself feared that to be the case, and tried its utmost to prevent the war).

The problem with getting Russians politically energized is that the main thing that the Putin regime has tried to instill in the population is apathy.

While they might try and instill a sense of pride in Russia and demonize the west the Putin regime instead of trying to instill fervent nationalistic tendencies in the population instead tries to mostly instill apathy. The government mainly seeks to make Russians feel that their votes don't matter, their opinions don't matter and if you don't like it just sit at home and shut up. That way there are fewer people involved in the political sphere and it makes people less likely to engage in protests or be dissatisfied when the government promises something that never happens. When you have zero expectations you're less likely to be angry when the government fails to deliver yet again. If you create a bunch of politically energized citizens who feel like they have influence by supporting you they can also turn on you if you do something they don't like. Apathetic people that have had the will to air opinions in public figuratively or literally beaten out of them are much less likely to take to the streets no matter the reason.

Disturbing the average Russian's apathy is why Putin fears fully mobilizing for war in Ukraine. If he starts drafting middle class Russians and sending them to fight in Ukraine it might just get people off the couch and into the streets and no matter how big your internal security forces are there is always a tipping point.

So the problem with Putin trying to whip up some nationalistic fervor is that he's spent 20 years trying to make sure that the last things Russian's want to do is engage in the political realm. Other than the segment of the population that are hardcore Putin supporters most Russians got the message to stay home and be quiet.

In Kherson yes Russia has strained supply lines over rivers but the front line has mostly held, it has been bent, not broken. There is no fear of a large Ukrainian force floating around behind you that might attack at any moment leaving you cut off and unable to retreat.

To start, Ukraine does not publicly possess precision munitions that can reach that far today, but its always possible NATO has given them weapons that can. They would also need a lot of them, as we saw how many different nights the Kherson bridges were bombarded before they were completely unusable.

I think the real answer though, is that at this point, the Kerch bridge being up or down is not really a giant strategic benefit or detriment to either side. As long as the Russians have the land bridge through Melitopol and Mariupol, they can move whatever they need through these areas to the South. Once Ukraine takes these regions back and have their sights set on Crimea, it will be a different story.

But I think that countries like Russia should not be allowed to host world championships and such. And ideally they shouldn't be welcome at such events elsewhere, but *if* they're allowed to participate they should only be allowed to do so under extremely strict scrutiny since countries like Russia and China will cheat at whatever opportunity they have and have repeatedly been caught doping their athletes as well as (at least in the case of Russia) infiltrate labs to hide signs of said doping clandestinely.

Secondly, Ukraine has its entire border *and* back field to defend, hundreds of kilometres long. Russia only has to use those numbers to depend a relatively small area, for the same reason as point one and because they also have the reassurance that Ukraine can’t realistically cross their borders.

In reality, the number of soldiers available to Ukraine for offensives is much smaller than their total count. The 95k you mention would probably represent a large proportion of their total available manpower.

So effectively, whatever forces they had massed in strategically important cities like Kupiansk and Izium were made useless, because there was no way to get them combat-ready before the cities were surrounded, especially in Izium.

the following. There is no panic! The troops  
were withdrawn from the Kharkov region

positions along the state border of the Russian  
Federation and ukroreikh. There is no need  
to run somewhere in a panic right now! No

to demoralize the population of the region and  
sow panic. Everyone needs to stay

Transplant Ukranians civilians to russia, bring in russian civilians to these Ukranian cities.  

Have engineers come in and rebuild/fortify those back cities (since they would be russian now after their ""voting scams"", they could probably get more russian government civil support.

The real question is how does crimea flip.  It's been in russian hands for 8 years now... pro-ukranians have been moved or killed, russians have moved in, russian children are 7 or 8 years old now, knowing only crimea as their home, being born there!   

It will be a PR disaster for ukraine because any voting will be pro-russia.  Any civil actions will be pro-russia.  Any support will be pro-russia.   Trying to ""force"" civilians to pack up and leave will be difficult.. 

Can you imagine small families with children being deported... The news will go wild around the world.  There are already groups pushing the ""russia is defending itself"" narratives...  that didn't change many opinions.. but forcibly kick children out...

No. The Ukrainian General Staff are winning this war exactly because they focus all resources strictly on winning, not making symbolic attacks. 
  
HIMARS missiles are a very limited resource, so every HIMARS strike should be part of an overall battle plan with a laser focus on winning the war.  
 
Just look at the Russian army; they have squandered away the majority of their limited stock of cruise missiles on non-military targets, or low value military targets.

Troops have been withdrawn from the Kharkiv region for military reasons. They have taken up positions along the state border of the Russian Federation and Ukraine. There is no need to panic and run somewhere right now! There is no evacuation in your region, all the rumours about our troops fleeing, about the evacuation of residents of border towns are fakes by the Western secret services and their Ukrainian vassals. The purpose of these hoaxes is to demoralize the region's population and sow panic. Everyone should remain calm and observe information hygiene.

After a big push like this, it is very helpful to regroup, rebuild strength / organization, and then and only then attack.

1. The Russians are getting weaker, not stronger. So there's not much point rushing into things.

2. The Ukrainians are weaker, not because they lost units, but because units ran around and are doing their own thing (capturing towns that probably weren't in the battle plans, etc. etc.). Regrouping and refocusing is very important. 

3. This also gives time for the new logistical / supply routes to be planned, so that the next offensive will go smoothly.

A few days to regroups, celebrate, think, and plan will hugely restore Ukrainian strength.

His Ukrainian business partner is Andriy Artemenko, who made headlines in 2017 by offering the Trump Administration a “peace plan” for the war in Ukraine that envisioned ways for the U.S. to lift sanctions against Russia. Another Prince ally in Kyiv was Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian legislator whom the U.S. has accused of being an “active Russian agent.” Both Artemenko and Derkach worked to advance Prince’s business ventures in Ukraine last year.""

Seems unlikely. More likely is that Ukraine will simply arm itself thoroughly with conventional means, especially after having proven they can take on the Russian army that way. Also depends if they are allowed entry into NATO or some other type of credible security arrangement could be made. A security guarantee that would include stationing of foreign soldiers in Ukraine would be an example of that.

I think Russia is actually sort of telling the truth about the withdrawl, that it was planned at least slightly. Not in a ""on this day, we withrdraw it's a tactical decision"" but a contigency plan, emergency like ""if they actually do breakthrough anywhere, we withdraw to this line here"" but not likely a possibility the commanders took with any serious belief it could happen.

Then Ukraine did breakthrough and they had to rapidly throw into plan a withdrawl that meant they left way more equipment than they planned to leave behind. This is still definitely a rout, but many of those troops live to terrorize Ukraine another day.

Kherson probably, with news that Russian units there are getting 1/3rd of their needed tonnage of resupply its apparent the Russian units there are draining their supplies fast.

A lot of the people who make those comments seem to not understand that if Russia was invaded and they looked likely to lose the chance of them using nuclear weapons goes through the roof and that's why countries get them, it's the ultimate don't fuck with me too much ace in hole card.

They also often don't understand the military and political calculus of the war in Ukraine. They don't seem to get that the majority of Ukraine's military equipment is being supplied by countries with the understanding that they do not invade Russia. Then they seem to ignore that the history of toppling dictators and trying to make countries into democracies doesn't seem to go very well and can make things worse than they already were. I would assume they are young or haven't really deeply thought about Iraq and Afghanistan and the consequences that arose from invading them. And they don't get even if you ignored the threat of nuclear weapons obviously Russia would fully mobilize and then as poor as Russia's military performance has been Ukraine would now be the ones fighting people defending their homeland, we've seen how that's gone for Russia.

This was never going to happen.  Russian leaders and their people have never conceived of themselves as a Western nation (outside of small pockets of educated middle class types in Moscow and St Petersburg who get way more attention then their numbers deserve in Western media).

At the same time, NATO was expanded and anti-missile defence systems were placed in Eastern Europe.  All of this led the current KGB clique in power to feel both humiliated as a defeated power and under threat (however overblown this perception may be) from an expansionist West.

Two things I believe about the future of Russia: firstly it will never be a liberal democracy.  Secondly, it will always be a threat to Europe.  Extending a hand to Russia will result in further feelings of humiliation on whoever comes to power after Putin and the age old conception of itself as an imperial power will continue to rear its ugly head.

The only thing the Russians have historically respected is force (or the display of it).

 >The Kastuś Kalinoŭski Regiment (also known as simply Połk Kalinoŭskaha or the Kalinoŭski Regiment, formerly the Kastuś Kalinoŭski Battalion) is a group of Belarusian volunteers, which was formed to defend Ukraine against the 2022 Russian invasion. As of March 2022, it was reported that more than a thousand Belarusians have applied to join the unit. According to its own statements, the battalion is not incorporated into the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine in order to preserve greater autonomy. The unit is named after Konstanty Kalinowski, who led an uprising in 1863 against the Russian Empire in Belarus.

War crimes:

* In February 2015, Ukrainian SSU started an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed in January 2015 by the Battalion and its leader Arsen Pavlov, with charges including murder, bullying, torture and forcing people into slave labor.
* In April 2015 Russian deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia Amnesty International, Denis Krivosheev, blamed Pavlov for killing and torturing Ukrainian POWs captured at Donetsk airport. According to Krivosheev, Pavlov said in an interview to the Kyiv Post that he killed Ukrainian Branovitsky Igor \[ru\] who was prisoner of war at the time of his detention and who suffered several facial wounds and wasn't able to walk. In an controversial tape which was published on YouTube in April 2015 which features voices of both of the Kyiv Post's journalist and a voice allegedly belonging to Pavlov, with the latter claiming to have killed 15 prisoners when the journalist asked him about Branovitsky, saying “I’ve shot 15 prisoners. I don’t give a shit. No comment. I kill whoever I want."" Amnesty called for thorough investigation of the crime. A surviving Ukrainian POW interviewed by the BBC said he had seen Pavlov shooting Branovitsky. In June it was reported by a Ukraine official that Interpol refused to put Pavlov on their wanted list on the grounds of the ""political nature of the Motorola case"".
* In 2016, a Vice News journalist described being told by Sparta members about Ukrainian corpses still at Donetsk airport, which Sparta members had forced Ukrainian POWs to bury in 2014.

Ukraine doesn't want that to happen. If the Russians did keep striking from within Russia itself Ukraine would probably use long range weapons like HIMARS to try and take out the source of the strike. Besides I think if Russia is chased all the way back, hopefully when not if of course, even Putin will stop any violent action like shelling to try and get some sanction relief.

Ukraine also does not want them to feel cornered by invading Russia itself as it could produce enough panic that they might resort to nuclear weapons, probably not if the incursions were small but there is no way they'll risk it. Doing so would also risk losing support from their partners that are currently supplying the vast majority of their military equipment and supplies as well as financially supporting the Ukrainian government. They've promised they wouldn't and it would be foolhardy of them to break that promise and the Ukrainian leadership doesn't seem foolish.

So other than small special forces raids near the border, which seem likely to have already taken place, there will be no regular masses of Ukrainian troops pushing onto actual Russian soil, it's not going to happen.

It's important to remember Ukraine is already at the Russian border further to the northwest and has been for months now.

Primarily operating advanced AA systems and flying combat aircraft(though the pilots wore PLAAF attire).

They also supplied most of the air forces aircraft, many tanks, artillery, small arms, and ammo. They also had their militaries logistics units directly involved in the theaters.

They mostly got away with it because intelligence was mostly ""we're pretty sure they're there, but not 100% sure where"" and the fact that they hadn't sent enough of their own military units for that to be worth expanding the war effort. I believe documentation after the Soviet collapse showed that about 3000 Soviet troops were directly involved in the Vietnam war and I don't know how many were in Korea, but in Korea, the USSR pilots were a little more obvious because they were flying brand new migs, clearly had training, and were white men in PLA air force attire and it was known that the USSR had air force trainers in China.

Russia has also had boots on the ground in the middle east for a while too, for a variety of conflicts. Though those have only exceptionally rarely directly faced the US military or its allies.

Edit to add that supplying military aid to allies and the enemy of your enemy has been a time honored tradition for all of documented history.

It's the opposite. People that keep bringing this up are overplaying the risk.

Everyone fear-mongering about russian nukes assumes that somehow they are not bound by the same Catch-22 that they impose on the rest of the world. This is irrational.

putin doesn't have nukes in his pocket. He doesn't magically fly with them and drop them. Everyone in the chain needed for that is aware of the consequences. 

There have no useful role in this conflict, except to ensure the total destruction of russia as we know it.

Taking a risk of being branded a ""cOnCeRn TrOlL"" - seriously guys, not everyone asking is a Russian operative - I do agree to an extent.

It would be a catastrophically bad decision. It would turn the world against Russia. Even if it were just one, covertly delivered tacnuke (to reduce risk of MAD auto-retaliation), it would still trigger NATO intervention literally within the day. India and China would turn against Putin, and Russia might even convulse internally if one too many key figures think it was a step too far. It would be *the end of Russia* as we know it.

However, this is us who live in objective reality saying this. Putin has shown beyond reasonable doubt that he lives in a separate reality, and so do his propagandists. There's no telling what he might find worth the risk because he isn't running on the same political calculus as the rest of us. 

Which is why I can never give it a 0% risk, no matter how many people scream ""it would never happen"". Of course, this doesn't not mean help to Ukraine should be reduced.

Zelenskyy was refusing to leave Kyiv while his countrymen were dying in droves and commandos were trying to kill him and his family, and has since then spent the last several months reassuring his people, demanding help, and flinging mud at the Russian invaders, often all at the same time.

So while they are still facing a manpower shortage, we must also recognize that they have been somewhat successful in adding troops to the theater.

 >The Russian Age of Enlightenment was a period in the 18th century in which the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences, which had a profound impact on Russian culture. During this time, the first Russian university was founded, a library, a theatre, a public museum, as well as relatively independent press. Like other enlightened despots, Catherine the Great played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences, and education.

One thing is that by and large, Tatar people don’t live in the cities where there’s the military bases, they live predominantly in smaller towns.

No, not evacuated. But it is true some never returned. 

And yes, could say very similar to Kherson.  That have a quietly resistant people, but are blocked in, and the Russians are going to scatter amongst them.

Another landmine is the port.  That contract was signed in exchange for a gas rate—approved by entire Rada. The current administration wants it nullified bc it russia lost claim to it in 2014, and second, because they’ve retrospectively deemed it ‘treasonous,’ bc it doesn’t duly benefit Ukraine.  Despite the fact that like half the people who voted for it are still in the Rada, or government—like Klitchko. (So if it’s treasonous, they they all need to be charged.) 

Russia has said that they’ll use nuclear weapons to keep Crimea.  Even if that’s just big talk—it’s inconceivable that they’d give up the port they’ve leased for ages.  And it’s inconceivable Ukraine will let them stay, leasing that naval port!  So nuclear war over it? No.  Negotiating table.  That’s what everyone wants regarding Crimea   (Turkey, Israel, USA).

Then there’s the issue of private properties—60% were ethnic Russian prior to 2014.  But now, it’s Russian citizens who’ve owned and developed land.  Ukrainian citizens—some stayed, especially the ethnic Russians—many left and folks from Russia moved in. 
Russia has “nationalized” land—built more bases. If Ukraine goes to blow those up, then in peace negotiations, under international law, Russia could effing seek reparations from Ukraine, which is insane.  Ok, so anyways, Crimea has to be negotiated—which is one reason we’re making sanctions hurt—they are going to need to be hurting, so that they willingly hand it back.",1662887557.0,1662887271.0,t3_xb4a7o,t1_inyr8eo,,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,

The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in Palestine (then part of the Ottoman Empire) with the French promoting the rights of Roman Catholics, and Russia promoting those of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

It's not because of that. It's because agreeing to it would create a precedent that would basically open a Pandora's box. Next, other countries will start claiming they need to develop nuclear weapons as well. And the West would not be able to disagree without looking like it claims to have the right to arbitrarily decide who can and who cannot develop nuclear weapons.

> The only reason Ukraine wasn't nuked is because the fallout would endanger NATO countries and which is why Russia will not use nukes.

Which is why nukes are not the appropriate security solution for Ukraine. Ukraine is on a path to becoming a military power that could easily challenge Russia in a conventional war in the near future. That alone would be enough of a deterrent against future Russian expansionist adventures.

Because transitioning takes away from operational readiness and combat capability. It takes time and effort to master new equipment. There will essentially be a period of adjustment where crews will operate at a lower level of effectiveness while they are learning to use the equipment optimally. Also, having multiple platforms increases complexity in the logistical chain. Engineers have to be able to repair multiple types of vehicles, you need multiple types of ammo delivered, your crews stop being interchangeable (ie, the gunner for tank type X cannot work with tank type Y), your equipment stops being interchangeable (can't use parts of tank X to repair tank Y) etc.

Transitioning too fast too soon can have a real impact on your ability to fight effectively. A poorly handled transition could therefore have real impact on the progress of the conflict.

It would be much better to go for the low hanging fruit and in the meantime prepare for a transition so that it can happen more orderly and smoothly. Essentially, you need a full fledged plan to transition to NATO equipment, the goal of which would be to minimize the operational impact and capability on the Ukrainian army. You need to map out all interdependencies, you need to think about which types of gear to replace first and to which units they would go, how that relates to any planned or anticipated hostilities and validate that the logistical chains can handle that.

Expecting a different response to those questions after being given several already during this whole war inherently *assumes* that you have a different opinion, before refuting the arguments already provided.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and won't accuse you of *concern trolling*, but please understand that your *question* is as valid as ""*what if a meteorite hits the Kremlin at 14:00 on a Tuesday""*. Yes it's a possibility, yes the resulting effects could be varied. It's still pointless to debate both if it happens and if it happens instead at 12:00 on a Monday.

>Says who? It's not about what you or I believe, it's about the thought proces of key players within the Kremlin. There is no way for us to know what they see as an existential threat for example.

However stupid and copium fed the higher-ups in the Kremlin might be, they didn't get there by being suicidal (in the most direct sense) and not being able to put 2+2 together. 

Implying they have no agency and they are somehow *forced* to act in a certain manner must first justify why that course of action is preferable and could plausibly provide a positive outcome. The very uncertainty, compared to the posible downsides is an argument in itself for not pursuing that course of action.

> They severely miscalculated before. 

Not in a manner that would bring the entire world against them on that scale. The nuclear taboo is not a toy. It's a very real and scary thing for *everyone* on the planet.


>Yet they are still in Ukraine. What does that say about their 'rational' beliefs? Maybe their definition of unacceptable losses is quite different.

No matter the losses for now, they are nothing to those sustained in *ANY* scenarios involving WMD. 

Even if by some miracle (and nothing short of a miracle would lead to this) using a nuke makes Ukraine fold (they already stated they wouldn't) AND radiation is contained AND (somehow) NATO ignores this AND China ignores this, AND every other nuclear power ignores this AND every other country on earth ignores this, those losses don't come back to life.

That is just a crude oversimplification of the equation in question. There are a lot of factors that would have to work EXACTLY like that (all those AND's) only to *MAYBE* get a net positive result. 

>Really? Do you genuinely believe that the world will suddenly come together to wipe Russia of the face of the earth because they blew up, for example, an airfield or two somewhere with 10kt tactical nukes. And in doing so will unleash nuclear war on the world? Really? Because of a treaty? You mean like the Minsk agreements, right?

It's so much wrong in that take.

*Do you genuinely believe that russia will suddenly blow an airfield somewhere with a 10kt nuke? And in doing so will unleash nuclear war on them? Really? Beacuse of an ego?*

See? This take is just as valid as yours.

Since russia is the one supposed to perform an action. It's on them to pass through this catch-22 before other countries, is it not?

>You mean like the Minsk agreements, right?

Those are are a proof of nothing but russias unreliability.

Western nations have already proven their adherence to various treaties, so i fail to see how it's relevant in this context.

>I'm doing literally the opposite and I would advise against translating what we in the West find rational to Kremlin decision making. They do not have to play by the same strategic rules as we do. That's all I'm saying.

You refuse to understand that it's not up to them. Yes they *could physically perform an action*. It means nothing.

For an event to have consequences it must first happen. That is an assumption. Debating if said consequences are X or Y or any at all is trying to predict them. Based on the previous *assumptions* that the event actually hapens. 

I'm trying to argue that the mere posibilty of this event happening is so low that is not worthy of consideration precisely because the *predicted* consequences (those that are supported by the various declared stances) make it so less likely to happen.

Simple example: would you purposely hit your own hand with a hammer, knowing the consequences are both pain and your neighbour coming over to punch you (cause he promised to)? No. Why? Because of the threat of pain and being punched. 

You keep saying russia *might* just because you *assume* them to be an *irrational actor* and your only argument for that is that they fucked up the invasion. Even if this would be a sufficient argument (it's not) it can also be explained through a myriad of other caused, not just being *irrational*.

As I said, it's your privilege to consider them airtight or not. But to convince anyone else of this you must make a compelling argument. 

Just saying that *you believe* countries won't respect treaties does not simply make it so. I honestly have no ideea how to get this through to you. 

The whole western support for Ukraine is a good example of countries respecting treaties AND countries going beyond them to ensure their own security. 

If you want to support the ideea that those concepts become useless when talking about other threats, the burden of proof is on you.

>Perfect example of a straw man. Where have I said anything like this? I don't argue Russia is not acting rationally.

It's hardly a strawman to point out that you simply deny the arguments provided on the basis that the future is uncertain. 

So you are arguing that russia *IS* acting rationally? In that case what is the threat? That they might suddenly become irrational? Decide.

>he most dangerous assumption being that Russia MUST act in a rational (from a Western point of view) way, which I believe is not true. 

russia is acting rationally. Stupid? Yes. Inept? Yes. There is no real reason provided to assume the opposite. Countries commit blunders. That's not being irrational, it's politics. And for us it's hindsight now.

The point you are arguing is simply not substantiated and  arguing in favor of it does nothing more than spread unfounded fear, not awareness.

4. russia would use nukes in Ukraine.

I'm going to address these last four points in particular for a moment because otherwise we'll keep arguing about the same thing and not get anywhere. 

Proof that any or all of these points are true does not exist. Therefore, you cannot provide me with that evidence. How can you prove something that has yet to happen?

You can, however, determine the probability of each scenario. How do you do that? Among other things, by wargaming and, yes, by making assumptions. Neither of us have the resources to do that in a professional manner, but let me try it anyway to explain why I stand by my position. Namely, that Russia may think in a different way than we do and in that way may even choose to use nuclear weapons.

Imagine you are Biden, or a NATO general, or a member of the NSC. You basically have only three options for responding to a (tactical) nuclear attack by Russia in Ukraine.

1. Strike back with a similar yield nuclear weapon 
2. A conventional attack. For example, bombing the base from which the nuclear attack was launched, or even destroying the Russian attack force in Ukraine
3. Refraining from military intervention. You limit yourself, for example, to extreme sanctions.

I personally think that option 2 is the most likely and that option 1 is virtually out of the question. Nevertheless, option 3 remains a realistic scenario in my view. Why? 

Option 1 and option 2 mean war with Russia. That may start conventionally, but chances are it will end in an exchange of nuclear attacks either way. (That's what wargames about this very subject have shown in the past). Russian doctrine clearly shows it is willing to 'escalate to de-escalate'. So, is that attractive to the West? No, of course not. Above all, we want to avoid nuclear war.

Sure, the fact that Russia has exceeded the nuclear threshold is terrible and cannot go unanswered, but you can ask yourself whether a nuclear attack in Ukraine is enough reason for NATO to start a war with Russia. After all, that is the first step on the staircase to nuclear war. 

Is Ukraine, or the crossing of the magic threshold for that matter, important enough to risk the end of the world? That is the question that Western leaders will have to answer. I don't have that answer. I am fortunately not a general and do not give advice to POTUS or Macron. Nor am I Putin, who will have to answer these questions as well.

Now comes my point. What if, while wargaming, Russia comes to the conclusion that option 3 is by far the most probable? What if they believe that Ukraine is in fact not important enough to NATO to risk nuclear war, REGARDLESS of what NATO has decided to do in the case of a nuclear strike. Then they might just choose to use nuclear weapons to prevent themselves from going hopelessly down in ukraine.... It is an unlikely scenario, but it is naive to think that this is impossible. NATO takes this scenario seriously, so why am I crazy if I do the same?

We don't know how Russia approaches the situation. What seems rational to us may not be to the Kremlin and vice versa.

It's very difficult to consider valid that russia, by following a rational process (wargaming it), based on not fully known information (the western reaction) would ignore the known informations and finally draw an irrational conclusion.

I completely agree with those 3 options you mention, and also, with the fact that 1 is out, 2 is the most probable and 3 is ""plausible"".

But we must also consider some bounds, otherwise this entire discussion is nonsensical, and namely that:

\-A. If the nuclear taboo is broken, some ""serious consequence"" MUST exist. Otherwise irelevant of what happens now, humanity is done for quite rapidly.

\- B. at the MINIMUM, the current NATO stance will hold. (I'll just ignore the rest of the world for the sake of simplicity, though it reinforces this point)

\- C. NATO (again, ignore the rest of the world) has the conventional military capability to stomp russia. I really hope we don't have a disagreement here.

Now, the situation hinges on the big ideea that russia somehow decides that \*for them\* the best decision is to use low yield nukes, in small numbers (like 1 or 2) as to not cross B, and is aware of A.

What are those benefits? We know that Ukraine won't fold, not from 1-2 low yield nukes, and the higher they push it, the stronger A gets, and the more probable B becomes.

You're insisting they will ignore this. Fine, and so what? At that point it no longer depends on them. The *western logic* is what dictates western actions. 

Any of your 3 options, by *our logic* will cause more damage to russia than anything they would achieve in Ukraine with 1-2 nukes. Correct? So why not enact any of them?

Nobody said is impossible. I argued that the probability is so low that talking about it makes it more believable than it really is. Just like our parents did not spend every day glooming about nuclear war, despite the much higher possibility of it back them.

NATO takes this into account because it's kind of their job to prepare for *every* situation.

I agree that there should indeed be a serious consequence. However, does this consequence have to be something by which you exponentially accelerate the probability of the end of humanity? e.g. starting a war with Russia? 

Again, I do not claim to know what the answer to this question is. I just believe that the answer is not so easy to give and that Western leaders will absolutely not be eager to declare war on Russia, which is already cornered at that point. Since the probability of a nuclear holocaust in this scenario is >0, this may not be a risk we are willing to, even should, take. 

> C. NATO (again, ignore the rest of the world) has the conventional military capability to pound russia. I really hope we don't disagree here.

Absolutely, it would be a turkey shoot. No doubt about it.

Exactly.

Not ignore it. They are very much aware of it, but might conclude that NATO resolve is not strong enough to respond militarily. 

>Any of your 3 options, by our logic will cause more damage to russia than anything they would achieve in Ukraine with 1-2 nukes. Correct? So why not enact any of them?

Not if you only believe my third option is realistic, which is also, in my view, the only scenario in which Russia would use nukes. Russia might prefer devastating sanctions over losing Crimea (They consider Crimea to be Russian territory to further fuel the flames) and nuclear weapons could absolutely stop a Ukrainian advance into Crimea for example.

> But they have already proven willing to use nukes. So what? At this point it's the west backed into a corner where the only rational option is either a conventional show of force, or ""fuck it, First Strike it is"". I personally ignore the tit-for-tat small nuke exchange. The entire ""escalate-to-deesaclate"" assumes both parties are rational actors, by the same measure of rationality. the moment one is not, this, along with MAD go out the window.

MAD is not out the window in the case of a Russian tactical nuclear strike on Ukraine. MAD is untouched even. Why? Because Ukraine is not  a nuclear power and has no ability to assure the destruction of Russia. Furthermore, tactical strikes on a non-NATO country would not be at all be enough for NATO to launch all-out retaliatory strikes. (It wouldn't even be retalitory, but first strikes). Ukraine does not fall under the 'Nuclear Umbrella' of NATO. MAD will only start to become relevant once NATO gets involved militarily, which again is why I suggest NATO leaders *might* not be so willing to get involved militarily.

> Nobody said is impossible. I argued that the probability is so low that talking about it makes it more believable than it really is. Just like our parents did not spend every day glooming about nuclear war, despite the much higher possibility of it back them.

Some scholars argue that the use of nuclear weapons is more likely today than it ever was during the cold war since the Cuban missile crisis. It's also not about glooming, it's about recognizing scenario's that might not have a happy ending and how to avoid such scenario's at all costs. (Not that this is my responsibility)

In the end, we kind of agree with each other I think. The most probable scenario in my view is that BOTH NATO and Russia conclude that a nuclear attack in Ukraine will be met with a severe conventional military response.
