>First, jealousy of Ukraine and its possible successes is an innate feature of post-Soviet power in Russia; it was also characteristic of the first Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. But since the beginning of Putin's rule, and especially after the Orange Revolution that began in 2004, hatred of Ukraine's European choice, and the desire to turn it into a failed state, have become a lasting obsession not only for Putin but also for all politicians of his generation.

>Control over Ukraine is the most important article of faith for all Russians with imperial views, from officials to ordinary people. In their opinion, Russia combined with a subordinate Ukraine amounts to a ""reborn U.S.S.R. and empire."" Without Ukraine, in this view, Russia is just a country with no chance of world domination. Everything that Ukraine acquires is something taken away from Russia.

this is like, incredibly honest for a russian politician.

They actually did fire some missiles at a weird time, at 2:40pm, which is extremely early, but it was aimed at something in Kharkiv oblast again. Though after that there were no more missile strikes, they definitely use less missiles now.

Seeing Russian lines crumble even more is just great, and now not only in the north-east. Russians are crying about losing to the east from Kupiansk, fighting already reaching Kreminna, and now also losing badly in northern Kherson. And that’s after them saying that “Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson has failed” just yesterday. I guess they thought that declaring those territories as Russian would for some reason stop us.

And then them requesting air support in Kherson through public telegram channels is just hilarious. I’m pretty sure they even got a response, but it was something like “the weather is bad, air support will not be coming”. There was something similar about a month ago, right after the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Russians noticed our forces were preparing to attack in the direction of Donetsk, and they made posts asking to relay that info to the people on the front that was supposed to be attacked. They had open comments under their posts, so expectedly Ukrainians who were also reading their channels started asking them “wait, your army communicates through public telegram channels?”",False,1664760380.0,t3_xtewg0,t3_xtewg0,,0,170,0,170,1,0,

a26240b15d28764ef4fb411f6d73dd51,xtewg0,iqsprwo,"Just been listening to a discussion (in Russian) between Mark Feygin and Mikhail Krutikhin (Russian economic analyst, specialist in the oil and gas market). They were talking about the pipeline explosions. Main takeaways:

* Since April last year Gasprom started to lower its delivery of gas to the EU
* EU shifted toward getting gas from the Pacific Ocean region.
* Gasprom started closing off gas delivery at the start of the Ukrainian war when it demanded ruble payments. Finland was first to tell Gasprom to fuck off.
* Russia's main goal was to have EU come crawn on their knees to beg for gas during the winter.
* Gasprom started to delay or say turbines for compressors werent correct and they couldnt open up delivery. A legal threat to sue (billions of dollars) due to non delivery of gas was a threat to Gasprom.
* After this Nord Stream 2 pipes exploded
* First reason the pipe could have exploded: when sanctions hit, the EU workers maintaining the pipe couldnt continue working, so were replaced by Russians that were ill equiped to deal with the pipes. The ships sent to maintain the pipes from Russia were not made for Nord Stream 2 pipes (made to service much smaller pipes)
* It was then discovered that several pipes exploded
* Now the question was who was this best for? The only logical answer is Gasprom. To show their buyers of Russian gas that it isnt Gasproms fault the gas isnt delivered, that it was ""Someone"" who blew it up, so Gasprom doesnt have to pay billions in fines

---------

* So now how was the sabotage done?
* Option 1 : PIG (pipeline inspection gauge) send it through the pipeline with an explosive attached to it (can be sent from Russian side easily
* Option 2 : could be a group of people that went down there and exploded it - very hard to do. The pipe is heavily reinforced and protected - reinforced steel, concreate, buried underground. You would need to be very very qualified to deal with this and the cold water + pressure.
* Option 3 : the explosives were planted there during the building of the pipelines (Norwegian analyst said this). Russians build the part of pipeline that exploded. Sweden and Denmark complain they didnt understand what they were putting in that pipeline during the building process.

------

* When the inspection of the pipelines started to see why they exploded Russia complained why they werent invited to help. Why would you invite the main suspect to help?
* One of the remaining pipeline that goes to EU directly was through Ukraine. Gasprom closed it saying that due to the sanctions they cant pay the transit. 
* The two remaining pipelines that go to EU are through Turkey.  One goes through Bulgaria to other European countries. Bulgaria doesnt need this gas as Greece is supplying it with gas from Azerbaijan. Turns out one of the pipelines going to Turkey from Russia under the black sea lost its license for safety (netherlands supplies it) due to sanctions.
* Basically there is two pipelines left, one through ukraine that is unknown when it will flow and one to Turkey that Turkey uses for its own needs.
* It is possible to fix the pipelines but the machines needed for this are very rare and prob not going to happen due to sanctions. No one is going to pay for the repair or is even interested in rrepairing it.",False,1664742537.0,t3_xtewg0,t3_xtewg0,,0,58,0,58,0,0,

We all talked about Russian corruption and how military funds were often stolen, but these are usually armchair comments and credible data was scarce. From the link, Russia said as much as 40% of the damn defense budget was being stolen. That's insanity and I'm shocked it's public knowledge.

The main takeaway I got from everything I read is that anyone who has paid attention long enough could have seen what is currently happening in Ukraine. I was really struck by parts about Georgia in the MIT link (which is corroborated by other sites, e.g. [this one](https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/russian-performance-in-the-russo-georgian-war-revisited/)) about how the Russian army performed like an antiquated military.

Honestly, the same applies to a lot of other wars Russia has been involved in. A lot of the same thing I read could have easily been copy-pasted from the USSR's invasion of Finland in 1939.

It seems as if the Kremlin, including Putin, had been well aware of the problems in the Russian military. They all knew about it and tried to fix it but couldn't do so. Yet they still kept going on military adventures with each one showing that the Russian army is the paper tiger they already knew it to be.

It's baffling to me. It means that with each invasion and/or intervention they did, Russia was risking a complete military disaster.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 October 2022


- On 1 October 2022 the Russian force in the Donetsk Oblast town of Lyman withdrew in the face of Ukrainian advances. Lyman was likely being defended by undermanned elements of Russia's Western and Central Military Districts, as well as contingents of voluntarily mobilised reservists. The force probably experienced heavy casualties as it withdrew along the only road out of the town still in Russian hands.

- Operationally, Lyman is important because it commands a key road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences. Russia's withdrawal from Lyman also represents a significant political setback given that it is located within Donetsk Oblast, a region Russia supposedly aimed to 'liberate' and has attempted to illegally annex.

- The withdrawal has led to a further wave of public criticism of Russia's military leadership by senior officials. Further losses of territory in illegally occupied territories will almost certainly lead to an intensification of this public criticism and increase the pressure on senior commanders.",False,1664703800.0,t3_xtewg0,t3_xtewg0,,0,54,0,54,0,0,

""The borders of the territory of the Donetsk People'sRepublic shall be defined as the borders of the territory of the DonetskPeople's Republic that existed on the day of its formation and the dayof its admission to the Russian Federation and formation as a newsubject \[constituent entity\] within the Russian Federation.""

As I suspected, this is why it is important to pay attention to the bureaucracy. ""the day of its admission to the Russian Federation"" is not when Putin signed those treaties, it is when the Duma and the upper chamber create a law for the annexion and Putin signs it, which presumably will be sometime next week, October 5 is a tentative date. So it gives Putin a leeway so that, for example the loss of Lyman is not yet considered as ""losing a russian city"" even if at the end it is considered to be under ""occupation"" by Ukraine having an occupied territory and actively losing territory that is legally considered, for the internal Russian law, as Russian hold different weight.

It isn't much, but the fact that the annexion was worded in this way means Putin is trying to avoid the heat of losing ""Russian"" territory even if it will be for a few days. If we start seeing ""delays"" in Putin signing the annexion laws or that suddenly ""objections"" are considered by the Russian Constitutional Court it will indicate that Putin really fears the political backlash of losing ""Russian"" territory and might keep the annexions in an indefinite legal limbo that allows him to do stuff like send conscripts to those areas but also have a way of saying ""I have never lost Russian territory"", if this happens it is is lowkey admission from Putin that he is uncertain about winning the war.

I wonder if the Russians are caught in a vicious cycle of declining competence where they have been taught to fire all of their ammunition at once at a preselected target.  At Lyman I speculated that the Russians a couple of nights ago fired all of their equivalents of MLRS into the forest blindly at night trying to stop the Ukrainian advance and then simply had no ammunition left, nor any resupplied since they were cut off.

There are pipelines not owned by them in Baltic sea, and between places like Norway and denmark going into Germany.

The message would be clear.

Moreover, you might think you can survive without us and we need you but we don't. One final chance, last pipelines still there, and it clearly wasn't us that did it.

It isn't that simple.

It isn't that easy.

People are dying, and their homes and families are destroyed by Putin's completely *assinine* war.

Most of you of course know and understand this, but some forget for a moment.

This may be a long war, a very long war. Fought in stages over the next decade. Costing so much more in blood than we hoped in these early days.

There will be times when we rejoice with victory, or are somber at the cost. But do not be discouraged.

On one side stand those who fight for democracy, and their family, friends, neighbors, towns, country, language, culture, and right to exist and determine their own destiny.

On the other side are those who deny other human beings their humanity.

Always fight for and support those who recognize the humanity in all of us.

So here's an idea: as Putinist rhetoric ramps up and grows ever more desperate, let's talk about the reasons **why Russia WON'T go nuclear.** Just for a change. (And I say this as someone who has admittedly indulged in plenty of anxiety myself since February, but hear me out.) 

Obviously, things like civilian casualties and fallout patterns won't influence the calculus of hardliners and never have. So let me just ask this:

**What exactly would Russia be without Moscow?**

Because you *know* that's the bare minimum of what they'd lose in a nuclear exchange. (And don't start with how deep the metro goes and such. Everyone knows about that. You seriously think the NATO states haven't compensated for those factors by now? Please.)

So let's just visualize that scenario for a moment: the so-called Third Rome, reduced to nothing more than a deep, dark, lifeless hole in the ground. Remembered forevermore by what's left of humanity as a **mistake** and a **failure.** And this isn't like Soviet times. There's no greater ideology like communism that might survive somewhere. Just ashes and the pretensions of dead men.

Tell me... is that the kind of world Putin wants to create? To sign his name on?

Nah. I don't think he has it in him. Now, maybe some idiot zealot around him does, sure. But they should remember this -- they could kill and hurt lots of people and it would deeply, horribly suck. I won't deny that.

But try it *and we'll murder their dreams.* And at this point, what else do they really have left?

But hey, I could be wrong. They say that spite and wounded pride are their own rewards, though I can't say I entirely see the rationale there myself. So... why don't we just wait here a little while? See what happens.

* Europe will be fine, it will be hard during the winter, but they will overcome this problem
* If Russia doesnt show any enthusiasm to fix the pipes, it seems suspicious. 
* The business that owns the pipelines is in Switzerland. About 50% owned by Gasprom half by international firms
* Gasprom has a financial contract with international firms that financed the project that they receive money for the pumping of gas not from the physical pumping of gas but the max ability of the pipes to pump gas. If the pipes arent flowing they still get paid.
* If Gasprom stops the flow of gas through Ukrainian pipes, the pipes still have enough to supply Ukraine with gas and some left over
* Inspectors will probably get chunks from the explosion and find out exactly what kind of explosive was used
* No one is going to fix the pipes - EU doesnt need gas, Russia isnt going to pump gas
* Gasprom is going to be the sacrifice financially speaking. Gasprom could have supplied gas to Europe for years to come. It was a conscious decision from Russia to stop.
Could Ukraine cut of the pipeline that goes through it? No, it wouldnt want to. Firstly it needs money to maintain the whole system. Secondly the pipes are also supplying Ukrainian demand. The same Ukrainian gas system is receiving gas from Europe, so the system needs to work and needs money to function.
* In regards to Ukraine causing the explosion - funny, absolutely pointless and Ukraine doesn't have the ability to do that
* Topic of having a max price for Russian gas and oil - USA could in theory do this by receiving info from oil refineries and traders, then impose sanctions on countries that dont follow the max price for Russian oil and gas. 
* Russia is already giving a large discount, they also have to contend with Iraq and Iran who also give discounts.
* If there is a max price for Russian gas and oil, no one would go against USA. The insurance agents, transport companies, countries would fear being sanctioned by the USA.
* The oil embargo that will start in December will cause the Russian oil extraction to drop by 50%. This will cause a cascade in closure of refineries and anything to do with Russian oil.
* Russian budget issues in relation to loss of Russian gas and oil. Expected to be around 1 trillion usd, but expect it to be a lot worse. The estimated numbers were written to appease bosses. The numbers will be a lot worse. Impossible to calculate losses
* Mobilization for army - workers in Oil and Gas aren'ts immune, could get the drivers, the refiners, who ever.",1664751661.0,1664745798.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqsprwo,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Joining WW2 immediately exposed the weaknesses of his regime, it quickly became evident that he was by far a junior partner to Hitler. His fleet was hammered by the British, his army humiliated in North Africa, as well as by the Greeks. Hitler constantly had to rescue and prop him up. 

Part of the reason for his fall was the same as Putin: his armed forces were optimized for putting on a good show, not for the nasty grinding business of war. Putting them to the test of war brutally exposed all their weaknesses. Also, his naked greed and opportunism (attacking France with a stab in the back when France was already on the ropes; attacking Greece and getting his ass handed to him, etc.) alienated many of those who may have previously admired him - a “strongman” is only admired (by those prone to that sort of thing) if he is, in fact, strong.

The number of missiles is what matters.  

You could load both HIMARS and transport trucks on to amphibious assault ships. Then the Marine Corps would have to supply and support the truck drivers.  Same with the US Army airlifting units.  Ukraine has at least hundreds of flatbed trucks and rail rolling stock.  More tractors that can pull trailers would be useful.  Tractors can haul missile pods toward tbe eastern front and then pick up something like grain or hay and haul it back to Poland.  

Relevant numbers include 5 to 10 minutes to reload a pod.  6 missiles per pod (would be 1 if ATACMS).  They come from 1 plant in Arkansas.  They made 9,000 missiles in 2021.  That year they celebrated reaching a total of 50,000. Many of the 50,000 were launched in Afghanistan but probably not a majority.  This information comes from Lockheed and they have good reasons to disinform.  I am not aware of any announcement about ramping up.  

Assuming 9000 per year is accurate we can crunch numbers.  1500 pods per year.  The full stream is less than 6 pods per day.  It is not just 1 HIMARS capable of firing all of them. A single crew can sleep in, have a leisurely breakfast, fire all 5 pods, waste some time texting on reddit, then stop someplace and have a long lunch with a farmer.  A single crew can fire the whole lot without making much effort.  

It is highly unlikely that the US Army and Marine Coros would give away *all* of their missiles.  Even if Biden wanted to the politics of not having any would be intense.  

I am not minimizing the damage that M31 missiles can do.  9,000 precision hits can be extremely disruptive.  More were not being produced because there was no need for more.  Fully adequate carnage.",False,1664761113.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqtsr50,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Really egregiously illogical arguments that shouldn't persuade anybody one way or the other.  

>So far the Russians have tried, at least somewhat, to mostly hit military targets. Nuking cities would put them clearly, horrifyingly in the wrong while at the same time doing relatively little damage to Ukraine’s ability to wage war.  

This is correct only if you count every single mortar shell fired, but anyone attempting to make a legitimate comparison would be looking instead at missile launches, and a majority of those have hit civilian targets.  Several dozen every day (sometimes many more), at city centers.  Many fall wildly off-course, but their aim is civilians in Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, and many other cities as far as L'viv.  Why not compare civilian-to-military bullet strikes while you're at it?  What would that gain you?  And it's not like 'majority rules' and the argument is over.  Russia's missile strikes to date demonstrate an overwhelming willingness and record of attacking civilians; that's all you need to disprove this.  

>The President’s Cheget-authenticated orders pass to the Russian General Staff, the high command of the Russian armed forces, who then direct action by nuclear weapon units. Putin needs agreement from the General Staff to carry out any nuclear strike...It would be interesting to know what Gerasimov privately thinks about the reports out of Bucha and elsewhere.  

Yes, we know what briefcases do.  There are in fact many levels of control between the president and the sub or facility housing the missiles.  Not enough for comfort, but there are.  But here the article devotes an entire argument to the hypothesis that the reason this is okay is General Gerasimov is somehow nobler than the average Russian commander.  The same Gerasimov who escaped a command post in Izyum shortly before it was destroyed by a Ukrainian missile strike.  All based on janky evidence during the Chechen war which overlooks his role as butcher there.  The whole 'he's military not FSB so he might *disobey orders*??? question mark question mark' is one of the dumbest ideas ever shared in this thread.  This is supposed to be predictive material?  Gerasimov is one step away from being dismissed, by the way.  What would the article say if the rapist colonel they mention replaces him, or anybody else in this chain?  Easily defeated point.  

>A nuclear bomb is just a very powerful bomb, in many respects...The bombs which hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki were only of 15 and 20-kiloton force – they would certainly be seen as tactical rather than strategic weapons today...It’s a kiloton war already  

Omg.  Horse*-shit*.  The kilotonnage of a conventional bombing run (something quite rarely done in this war since early March) does not leave radioactive material behind.  It is irrelevant how heavy non-nuclear ordinance is in comparison to nuclear ordinance.  

In most contexts in this war, there isn't a difference between tactics and strategy when it comes to ordinance.  Ukraine uses whatever they can get and Russia uses whatever is operational and replaceable.  The idea that tactics = *smol* and strategy = *yuge* is too pat for Saturday morning cartoons.  Is that really the point?  

The article, like the rest of us, have no idea how many bombs of which size Russia has available, but here's the thing:  it does not *matter*.  Some are sub-20kt and some are plus-20Mt.  That's the thing about nuclear escalation.  It doesn't just mean you escalate to a plateau where nukes are acceptable, *it keeps going*, with increasingly large-scale yields until desperation and not generals choose the targets.  And as informed people have mentioned many times before, you don't want any bombs produced since the 1990s going off in the atmosphere.  A dozen of them will cripple efforts to reverse climate change and any more than that will simply wipe out the biosphere.  We all know this, I hope?  I fucking hope.  Even someone at the Telegraph must know this.  

This is the logical [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition), or the part-from-the-whole fallacy.  Just because some bombs are less destructive than others doesn't mean those will be the only ones used.  

>The US government has estimated that Russia may have from 1,000 to 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads. Considering other Russian military equipment, it’s likely that a lot of these are unserviceable. So this would not be the sort of operation that could be kept up forever: especially given reported shortages of suitable delivery systems to carry the warheads.  

Might I also remind fallout is cumulative?  'Not kept up forever'?  This statement is *dripping* with stupidity.  15 bombs produced from 1995 or later are worth ~120-140 bombs produced from 1975-1995 in destructive potential.  But here we're entertaining a scenario where *thousands* of Hiroshimas are somehow a write-off that a) the west would tolerate after the very first one, and b) wouldn't produce the same result as ten Tsar Bombas over the Ozone hole above Antarctica, because it totally would.    

I hate talking about this.  I really do.  It just makes everyone anxious and it has no bearing on the Ukraine war because these things will never be used.  But I keep getting drawn into it because the misinformation surrounding their use or their effects keeps getting praised in this thread.  Ask your science teachers.

First of all, there is a *huge* difference in international law.  While Russia have shown scant regard for the UN Charter, so far Ukraine has been trying to stay within it—an approach that is very much encouraged (nay, required) by their allies, who are seeking to uphold the rules-based international order rather than (as Putin would very much like) to see it undermined.

Second of all, this false suggestion that Ukraine will (or lawfully could) attack Rostov or Moscow was one of the fundamental justifications that Russia gave for the ""SMO"" in the first place and it continues to be frequently cited in their ongoing propaganda campaigns.

globalisation, despite being the boogey man on the right and left has evidently made a lot of people richer, or atleast is now so ingrained exiting it is making people poorer. Global supply chain shocks have been continuous since covid and it is slowing growth.

There will be a decoupling when it comes to strategic resources and energy. However I suspect globalisation will continue when it comes to general commodities. Toys, domestic items, leisure clothes etc. 


Points I'm looking at are 

The  situation for Europe with energy. With so few fossil fuels Europe may actually begin a significant decline now as they become uncompetitive due to high energy costs. The way out is nuclear and even faster roll out of renewables, but with current time frames its not going to be enough. Or it may be a manhatten project like thing for them and turn them into a renewable juggernaut. Where as Russian NG was easing the transition before, now its urgent. 

Central Asia is going to fall under the influence of China or Europe. If they are smart will play both sides. Poor nations rich in both old world (iron, coal etc) and new world resources (lithium etc) mean they stand to make a buck selling to both blocs. They became the new neutral space/buffer space. 

India will have to diversify its defensive contracts. But will probably stay close to Russia. Especially since Russia will be weaker, Russia and India stand to gain more by counterweighting China, although Russia and China will still probably be on good terms. 

Russia will lose its ability to play Europe and China off each other for demand. Hence China gets to set a low price now. This is really good for China considering it is a huge energy importer. And it will reduce china's dependency on the south China Sea for the import of energy. This is its most significant strategic weakness against the USA. If it is importing fuel from so close to home it becomes a lot more self reliant. 

The USA is a big winner. It has gone from a net energy importer to exporter with fracking and now will be able to export a lot more of it on the market. Its hegemony in Europe is probably preserved for a long time. And I imagine Europe will now tend to take its own security more seriously.  However if Europe gets poor enough it could lead to detente with Russia in the future for energy again.",False,1664744086.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqsp6j5,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

This year it is already October and we haven't yet turned on the heat.

We are more conservative with leaving the doors and windows open during the day (we live in a house, not an apartment, with a large garden, so we go out and back in multiple times during the day).

We wear long sleeve shirts and pants. Last year I was wearing shorts and tshrts when I was inside.

Wearing long sleeves doesn't bother me at all and I am as comfortable as ever, as is my family.

We do have an extra blanket, but our usual bed cover is relatively thin anyway, so it's not because we were freezing during the night.

All in all, judging by the weather prognosis, it will be late October before we might start turning on the heat, and if we do it's likely going to be only during the night.

The most important lesson here is that our comfort hasn't suffered at all.

There are plenty of avenues open to Ukraine at this point.  Not knowing their dispositions or even their casualties, some of these hypotheticals may never have a chance of occurring.  

The immediate future suggests continued pressure at the Luhansk border.  It's where they have people, it's where Russia is weakest, and it's frankly what they can get most easily at the moment.  But strategically, economically, this is the least important region for Ukraine to regain.  It's mainly farmland at a point in the season where crops can't be planted, with limited industry along the Siversky Donets river that has been completely 100% destroyed in the attrition-oriented withdrawal a month ago.  Regaining Luhansk would actually increase the border Ukraine has to defend and spread them more thinly, and open themselves up to future pocketing manuevers.  I see no point in it, once they get to terrain they feel they can minimally defend.  

A sub option here is to jointly focus in southwestern Luhansk and in Donetsk at the Zaporizhzhia border south of Donetsk city.  Both heading east toward possible Donetsk city encirclement.  Because that's the only way Ukraine is getting control of it.  Prior to mobilization it was speculated this might be an eventual goal, but even with it being a clown show it makes this plan hard mode right now.  It takes many more moving parts and a larger line of fire than other potential plans.  

Kherson really can't be accelerated by an infusion of troops at this point.  It's just a mosaic of trenches and hundreds of wet fields with little cover, and the entire thing is mined.  Trapping Russian forces there so they can't be of help in other regions is the point of the Kherson offensive, I believe, and don't expect liberation any time soon.  Ukraine can't create an encirclement of the city any other way than pushing down.  They lack the ability to create a beachhead in a naval offensive, and it would be a logistical nightmare just to get troops to that side of the country with their artillery intact.  

Defenses could hold in Luhansk as is and a new offensive could begin on Zaporizhzhia.  Even here there are different objectives.  South toward Mariupol is the most direct route to cutting Russian forces in half, but there isn't anything left in Mariupol of value.  Southwest toward Melitopol makes sense to me; it would free a large contingent of civilians before mobilized occupation can wreak havoc there.  Even lousy soldiers can be a brutal occupation force.   I am 'concerned' (yes I said it) about Melitopol.  I hope that's in the cards.  It's also a major nexus of highways used for cross-country supply, and it might single-handedly force an early Kherson withdrawal without an assault there.  

The ZPP could be or become an objective, especially if more plants are threatened.  

It'll depend on Russia's actions and continued support from the West, especially the US and UK.",False,1664689592.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqps421,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

Not enough to block roads or overland transportation. There will be some spots at some times where drifts are a problem, but overall no. 

It gets cold in Ukraine, but not enough to be a problem except on rare occasions and for that you can just do engine block heaters. 

Cold is more of a problem for people, if they don't have adequate winter gear they die, or have to stand around heaters and don't do their jobs. If they have barely adequate gear, they do their jobs but are grumpy, sleep deprived, get sick and injured more and generally have a constant debuff. With adequate gear, things are slower and less convenient that during summer, but it's not a big deal most of the time.

I would actually posit that we’re already in the endgame (the portion of a game of chess that has the potential to go the longest). Opening: invasion, mobilization (UA), establishing diplomatic support, stabilizing defense, breaking the Kiev offensive. Middlegame: follows the retreat from Kiev. Gradual war of attrition, artillery barrage, wearing down Russian capabilities, strengthening forces through western training and new, advanced equipment, targeting RF logistics and command, “battlefield shaping”. 

The endgame: series of pauses and sudden advances by AFU against a weakened and ineffective opponent. Starts with either the Kharkiv counteroffensive or “partial” mobilization. AFU gradually takes more and more land back, RF fails to mount effective defensive lines as their capabilities have been too focused on offense and the remaining forces (ie mobilized) aren’t plentiful enough for defense in depth, resulting in more routs. AFU’s routs may each get longer if supported with more western equipment, or shorter should Russia learn any lessons from its failures so far. Unlikely. 

Eventually, as Russia keeps getting weaker and Ukraine stronger, *something* will happen and the kremlin cuts its losses, retreating to February lines, or is pushed back to the border in the Donbas. 

Ukraine will do everything it can to get Crimea back without “invading” but eventually is forced to mount a major offensive operation, takes back a major chunk of territory (with heavy losses), then mounts the siege of Sevastopol, a protracted battle they eventually win, though the city is in ruins at the end.

> Why don’t whales get cancer more often? [..] If a whale is a thousand times bigger than a person, it should have a thousand times more cells and therefore get cancer a thousand times more often. [..] But most whales live a long time and don’t die of cancer. Why not? [..] I don’t know which of the various proposed solutions to this puzzle is true but the most hilarious is no doubt Nagy, Victor and Cropper (2007). Whales are very big, so in order to threaten a whale, a cancer must also grow very big. In order to grow very big, a cancer must evolve a complicated internal structure determining which cells expand where and who’s going to secrete the factors necessary for blood vessels to grow and so on. Cancers can do that: even in humans, tumors develop impressive amounts of structure and cooperation among the cancerous cells inside of them. But as tumors grow bigger and more intricate, and cells have to spend more and more time altruistically working for the good of the tumor rather than just reproducing, some cells will inevitably defect from the plan and just divide uncontrollably. This ends up in an unhappy equilibrium. Whenever the balance swings too far toward defectors, the tumor can’t support itself and most of the cells die. Whenever the balance swings too far toward cooperators, the defectors have a big advantage again and start expanding. As a result, the tumor either remains at a fixed size or dies off completely. It might get a chance to metastasize, but the same will happen to its metastatic descendents. In other words, the theory is that whales survive because they are so big that their cancers get cancer and die.",False,1664706795.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqqfi40,,2,54,0,54,0,0,

 >The Battle of Poltava (8 July 1709) was the decisive and largest battle of the Great Northern War and a catastrophe for Sweden. A Russian army under the command of Tsar Peter I defeated a Swedish army, under the command of Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld. The battle put an end to the status of the Swedish Empire as a European great power, as well as its eastbound expansion, and marked the beginning of Russian hegemony in Northern Europe.
 
**[Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition)** 
 
 >The Sicilian Expedition was an Athenian military expedition to Sicily, which took place from 415–413 BC during the Peloponnesian War between Athens on one side and Sparta, Syracuse and Corinth on the other. The expedition ended in a devastating defeat for the Athenian forces, severely impacting Athens. The expedition was hampered from the outset by uncertainty in its purpose and command structure—political maneuvering in Athens swelled a lightweight force of twenty ships into a massive armada, and the expedition's primary proponent, Alcibiades, was recalled from command to stand trial before the fleet even reached Sicily.

Putin can kick the can down further to avoid this, but it would require him ""delaying"" signing those laws into effect, that the ""debate"" in the Russian Parliament gets dragged out or that suddenly the Russian Constitutional Court (I suspect this will be what he will use) will start to accept legal challenges to these annexions in whatever way it suits Putin and takes political weight from him.

Hitler hoped that the units assigned to Steiner would be able to stage an effective counterattack against the northern pincer of the Soviet assault on Berlin, but Steiner refused to attack upon realizing the units were inadequate, being made up of some soldiers, Hitler Youth teens, emergency Air Force ground personnel, and Navy dockworkers.

Historically, bicycles lessened the need for horses, fuel and vehicle maintenance. Though their use has waned over the years in many armies, they continue to be used in unconventional armies such as militias.

If people, especially the media, fear monger it plays directly to Putin's hand. We should not normalize the talk of Putin using nukes. We have to take every threat seriously but we also can't let him use it as blackmail. How the west is handling it is fine, keep an eye out, but don't budge solely on the threat. Also those same governments have said there has so far been no signs Putin is readying to use nukes.

Also Pavil Podvig has been giving great insight into this whole thing, his whole career is this topic. This post in particular nails it, it's a threat but we shouldn't be dwelling on it or entertaining it. Which is what the media has been doing.

 >Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets have an extended range and add GPS-aided guidance to their Inertial Navigation System. Flight control is accomplished by four forward-mounted canards driven by electromechanical actuators. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and can be fired from the M270A1 and M270A2, the European M270A1 variants (British Army M270B1, German Army MARS II, French Army Lance Roquette Unitaire (LRU), Italian Army MLRS Improved (MLRS-I), Finnish Army M270D1), and the lighter M142. M30 and M31 rockets are, except for their warheads, identical.

As a politician he won more than 17 elections - far more than the few he lost.

As a leader he motivated the British public to resist the Fascist dictators and their assault on the rest of Europe.

As a statesman he promoted the Grand Alliance between Britain the US and Russia.

As an original thinker in the First World War he came out with many ideas to try and get around the carnage of the Western trenches. The forcing of the Dardanelles was one of his plans - brilliant strategy unfortunately botched by poor execution by others - especially Kitchener. It was Churchill who forced through the development of the tank. After the army rejected the idea Churchill funded development through the navy of what were originally called “land ships”.

In the second world war he instructed the army in the dark days of 1940 when Britain stood alone and under imminent threat of invasion to develop landing craft for tanks in anticipation of the eventual return to Europe. It was Churchill too who was the driving force behind other innovations that made invasion possible - like the Mulberry Harbours, the Pipeline under the Ocean (Pluto) and the amphibious tanks.

As a motivator he prodded reluctant generals. Prior to the invasion of Sicily Eisenhower wanted to call the operation off because of the unexpected arrival of two German divisions on the Island. Churchill insisted he go ahead, and remarked that when it came time to invade France, there would be far more than 2 German divisions.

As a social reformer, it was Churchill who introduced aged pensions to Britian and many other social innovations. It was Churchill who commissioned his long time friend Beveridge to write the report which foreshadowed the post war welfare state.

As an author he wrote many books and supported himself by writing. Most of his books are still in print. In 1953 he won the Nobel prize for literature.

As an artist he won several prizes and a painting of his recently sold for $1.6 million.

As a family man he enjoyed a loving marriage for 57 years and fathered 5 children.

Anyone who thinks Churchill incompetent must be truly ignorant of his accomplishments in so many different fields.",False,1664765822.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqu5owu,,3,19,0,19,0,0,

The best options for Ukraine right now would be a mix of very fast and heavy firepower tanks. They need a version of stryker tanks with heavy armed cannons. As much as possible. And on the other side some ""light"" heavy tanks like challanger or leopard. Theyre advancing good but need also to construct strong supply lines. I think wheeled armor would be the best at this point because the professional russian army is beaten and they try to refill with a very low morale and amateur soldiers. Crushing them with fast mobility will make them instand surrender. After strong pushes the heavy tanks need to claim the positions and hold it and you go back and construct supply lines.

How things *should* work under the UN is that the Security Council *should* authorise the use of force to reestablish peace and security.  Such resolution could theoretically include an authority for forcible removal of the Russian regime, though there's no precedent for that: even in Afghanistan and Iraq, the authority was more direct and limited (though to achieve the goals, regime change ended up being a necessary step).

Of course, with Russia having a veto this isn't possible—and is why the current situation is such a direct threat to the rules-based international order.  Instead, Ukraine is relying on its inherent right to self-defence as detailed in Article 51 of the UN Charter:

> Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.

Would invading the attacking country in order to achieve forcible regime change fall within the realms of ""self-defence"" under this article?  I doubt it, and I doubt that's a precedent anyone would like to have set.  Indeed it would probably ""*affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council...*"".

So, in your scenario, where Russia is pushed back to its own borders but continues to attack with artillery or missiles, what would happen?  First of all, I actually reject the premise of the question: I think that scenario *extremely unlikely*, for being pushed back to its borders would be so completely humiliating that the war would surely end with internal political upheaval within Russia anyway.  Nevertheless, what would be Ukraine's rights in international law?  It's murky, but I think the only reasonable answer is that they may do the *absolute minimum* that is *necessary* to maintain the security of their land/people.  Certainly not a massive ground invasion with the goal of regime change.",1664753162.0,1664752422.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqtc6ba,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Not really.

No one wins in a nuclear war. The Russian know this.

Their reasoning is that the cowardly West would just yield when Russia threatens with nukes or use tactical ones. But if the West doesn't give in and  in case of use of tactical nukes in Ukraine strikes back (conventionally), than the bluff fails. Then Russia has two options. Lose the war and survive or lose and be completely destroyed together with most of the human civilization in a full blow nuclear WW3.

Even the most nationalist fanatic must prefer the survival of his country and people and the chance to rebuild it, even after a humiliating defeat. And Ukraine and the West would be willig to agree to moderate peace terms. All Russia has to do is retreat from all occupied territories in Ukraine and pay reparations, surrender war criminals etc. A relatively small price for a lost war of aggression. Their own territory would remain intact. No one wants to invade and conquer Russia itself.

But that's all theory because the nuclear bluff has already failed. Russia is currently losing one of the freshly annexed ""Russian"" cities after the other, their frontlines are breaking in the east and the south, and there are no (tactical) nukes falling in retaliation. It was an empty threat all along. Ukraine can and will continue to push the Russian forces out of their country and Russian can't do anything about that. A direct intervention by NATO isn't even necessary.

To sum up what I think: It's just a video of Russians hitting a fertilizer storage, and claiming they hit a Ukrainian ammo dump. The explosion doesn't look like any other ammo dump explosion we've seen, it looks like the typical orangy smoke from a nitrogen explosion.

 >Bicycle infantry are infantry soldiers who maneuver on (or, more often, between) battlefields using military bicycles. The term dates from the late 19th century, when the ""safety bicycle"" became popular in Europe, the United States, and Australia. Historically, bicycles lessened the need for horses, fuel and vehicle maintenance. Though their use has waned over the years in many armies, they continue to be used in unconventional armies such as militias.

Almost nobody was aware of how bad the russian army actually was. 

Right before the invasion every military expert projected this war evolving into a long and bloody guerrilla conflict having Kyiv the main city involved. 

NATO was preparing Ukraine troops to handle a long urban warfare to prvent Kyiv to get under Russian control, taking for granted that Russian troops would've had conquered the city within days.

That legit projection fell into oblivion as soon as we saw the first reports of how badly russian troops were operating, the level of anarchy among them and the actually outdated vehicles involved in the invasion. 

After that, every prediction about the longevity of the conflict had to be adjusted a lot. Because the main concern was how to stop the mighty Russian army.

As soon as it was clear that Ukraine was dealing with a unprepared army, filled with corruption and barely trained troops, unable to resupply and handle logistics, whatever we thought before the invasion needs to be kinda ignored.

A bad army lead to a failure invasion.

A failure invasion lead to a way stronger support from NATO.

Nobody predicted to see such strong and ready support from NATO and europe against Putin and sanctions will take time to do the trick but will be devastating in the long-medium run.

And just think at all Russian allies on its border that surprisigly didn't helped as everybody expected. Everybody except belarus.

1. Where does Russia get manpower to keep supplying this war for the long term?
2. What tools does Russia have to stave off the continued advances in military technology and growing roster of NATO trained soldiers?
3. What tools does Russia have to keep its economy afloat given the immense pressure it is currently facing?
4. How long can Putin feasibly put down the in-fighting currently taking place between those who want to significantly escalate and those who don't?

I certainly don't claim to be any more educated or informed than Arestovich but what knowledge i do have of the situation leads me to be quite sure that it will not last anywhere near a decade, and likely not even a year.

Movilisation will have a negligible effect on supporting the front lines that Russia is now desperately hanging on to. They literally have nothing to solve their egregious manpower problems now, and what's left of their forces in Ukraine are getting worn down and battered. Putin could go and drag every man off the streets across Russia and it won't solve their logistical problems or defensive disadvantages, and further mobilization will only make an already tenuous social situation at home more dangerous for him. 

Russia has no technological tools left to answer the ever increasing capabilities that the west is providing Ukraine with, except nukes, and that is likely not going to happen. We've all seen the state of the rifles these new mobilized men are getting. 

Russia has lost the majority of its trade income from Europe and has already had to make large budget cuts to account for it. Nabiullina, the main reason why their economy has managed to chug along despite everything working against it, has tried to quit for the third time and Putin continues to refuse. The writing is on the wall. Companies and skilled workers have fled en masse. Within a year the Russian economy will be a shell of its former self. 

Putins ability to put down infighting is significant but not omnipotent. The pro-war crowd is growing ever more restless over the failures in Ukraine and it's becoming harder and harder to hide these failures from the population at large.

2.) How sure are you with this conclusion? Because I feel more inclined believing officials who are paid millions & billions of dollars to stalk a renegade country and its lunatic leader than some Redditor in the wild.

3.) In any event that what you're saying is true, what do you think should we do? Because I'm not going to use my ""remaining time"" crying and preparing for something that I cannot control and avoid.

For one, US weapons technology tends to move in multi-decade cycles, and it looks like in a lot of those line up to somewhere around 2030. NGAD, what ever HAWC turns into, Laser/Microwave point defense systems, bunch of stuff is going to mature around then. If you are planning on crossing swords with US interests, you might want to secure your gains before we get a new round of toys. For refrence; the F-22 is still probably the best air superiority fighter in the world and it is 25+ years old. IDK what 25+ years better than the F-22 looks like, but I wouldn't want to be on the business end of it, that's for damn sure...

For the other, China has managed to cram like 200 years of industrialization into like 50 years (and hats of to them for that!) but, the housing crisis combined with manufacturing moving to other places due to both geopolitics and the fact that China is no longer the ""cheaper option"" for a lot of things, means that they have to transition their economy to new sources of revenue in the next 5-10 years in order to avoid a recession. Recessions aren't uncommon around the time a country finishes industrializing, so there's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but if you are going to start a war, *before the recession hits* is a good time to do it...

So, the next 5-10 years are kind of a ""shit or get off the pot"" moment for China WRT military expansionism. Which I find worrisome; But if the gods are willing and the creek don't rise the fact that China is *deeply* tied to the west economically, and the fact that the international community takes an increasingly dim view of naked imperialism may allow us to avoid that fight.

Immigration wise I think most of Europe is going to be okay. They'll get the most educated as well as a worker influx. Especially from places where food scarcity becomes an issue. All within their realm and typically from India and North Africa. One thing I do see is that travel and immigration will become harder. Hundreds of folks in a single boat trying to come across the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic are not going to happen much anymore. I believe one effect of de-globalization will be tighter border controls. And I mean this overall. North America, Europe and especially Southeast Asia points like Japan and South Korea. I also think birth rates are going to continue to come down everywhere. Much like the effects from the Black death in medieval Europe and the Middle East, population decimation will cause a new ""dark ages"". Insular communities, lowered world trade and a population dump that will be horrific for those who live through it. If there's a bright side to this it's that usually, these cultures rebounds after a few generations and because infrastructure can be maintained the wealth of all goes up.

If the US and NATO had said, publically in january  this year, 'if you invade we will supply Ukraine with advanced AA systems, apcs, battle tanks, convert their army to NATO grade artillery, provide them with long range precision missile systems, train 10k ukrainian troop a month and fund them to the tune of billions of dollars week in week out until they have liberated their country...would russia have gone ahead? Sure putin might have wanted to, but at least knowing that would be what they would be faced with would have given russian government officials skeptical about the war credible arguments as to why the risk was too great.

Even after the invasion, if the US had just said, for arguments sake on March 1- you have 7 days to withdraw/sign a peace treaty satisfactory to Ukraine or from that point forward there will be no limit on the type of convention military aid we will provide Ukraine, again it could have been a powerful incentive to make russia negotiate in good faith.

Gradually ramping up support of Ukraine isn't avoiding escalation, it's actually encouraging it, because russia interprets conciliatory statements and any sort of half measure as evidence of western weakness.

Already before the First World War, Churchill took first steps in the direction of social reform. However, he may not have been the primary instigator, since other politicians were leading figures at that time. As a member of the Asquith government, he was party to the introduction of state pensions in 1908. Churchill also introduced ""Trade Boards"" in 1909 as the President of the Board of Trade, which established the first minimum wages in Britain in staple industries. He also prepared the sickness and unemployment bill, which became the 1911 National Insurance Act, although it would be Lloyd George who would present it to parliament later. This act constitutes the first contributory system of insurance for unemployment and sickness in Britain. Moreover, Churchill showed his deeprooted beliefs in social reform with his passionate speech about the 1908 Coal Mines Regulation Act. In addition, Churchill strengthened mining safety regulations as Home Secretary, helped to introduce collective bargaining, and attempted to introduce a Shops Bill to regulate shop workers' hours. As a member of Lloyd George's government, Churchill carried part of the responsibility of the reduction of working hours in 1919, which factually introduced the eighthour day in Britain. All these measures demonstrate the small steps in the direction of the welfare state that Churchill undertook during his early years in government, although we have to keep in mind that he was mainly a protege
of Asquith and Lloyd George at this time. Being appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 in the Baldwin government, Churchill continues his policy of social reform. From now on, he plays a leading role in this field, since many of the liberal politicians who pioneered the welfare state left politics after the breakup of the last liberal government in 1922. Neville Chamberlain as the Health Secretary initially planned to introduce the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Pensions Act. Churchill considered this piece of legislation as so important and was so motivated to push this through that he announces it himself in the Budget for

1925. Churchill thus took credit for this legislation, tolerated by Chamberlain, which did much to foster the development of the welfare state. In order to finance this Act, he constrains military expenditure and directs funds to domestic social policies, which created tensions with the navy as the biggest spender in the military.",False,1664767384.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqu84vl,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

The biggest risks to see countries giving up supporting zelensky happened during march-april, when the idea of a surrender or just to reach a sort of peace treaty was still possible and the confidence about Ukraine army was still low:

Russian army's reputation was basically the result of an huge and incredible false advertising campaign. And everyone fell for it, for like, decades.

I also think that when it was clear that Putin was bluffing about the consequences of NATO help, that increased the level of support and at this point, considering the amount of money invested in military support I don't think we'll see anyone giving up.

NATO and Europe didn't give up helping when Ukraine situation was desperate and for sure they will not give up now, in the middle of a counteroffensive and with Russian army forced to a mobilization that went worse than the worse prediction possible.

It will end soon if Putin is deposed, because as much as people say that the new leader will act like Putin, russian people will not sacrifice for someone else other than the guy they saw leading the country since 2000.

If putin is deposed it will be like after the fall of yeltsin. Internal chaos and many figures taking power for little time. And at that point whoever take Russian lead will have different issues to handle. The war will be the last of their problems.

Putin played all in and doesn't matter if he was aware or not about how bad his army was. He played all in because he was sure to see a similar reaction as it happened after crimea annexation.

Because, if that strategy of aggression (supported by a fabricated reputation of owning a mighty army) worked so well for almost 20 years, why stopping using it?

But it’s worse than that for Russia. Countries all over the world are lining up to be associated with Ukraine, and sanction Russia.

Even China has zero interest in helping you.

This war is actually setting some extremely large precedents regarding geopolitics.

Kazakhstan has openly moved away.

Various governments that have been propped up by Russia are now looking unstable. Iran. Syria, Armenia, to name a few.

I don’t think countries will be looking to Russia for security in the near future.

What Ukraine is doing is …amazing.

I’m looking at the facts on the ground. As opposed to referring to historical figures and clinging on to unfounded beliefs.

The fact is the Russian military is incompetent. It’s lost something like 150-200k casualties. It’s has lost over 2000 of its best tanks and twice as many IFVs. Plus, most of its best troops are already dead.

It’s airforce is …appalling. The ineffectiveness of the Russian airforce has to be the biggest news of this war. Russia is now also running out of decent missiles.

Then I look at the tends. Over the last 7 months Russia has gone from taking ground, to stalling, to now losing ground at a decent rate.

Then I look at what’s likely going to effect the trends.

Ukraine is probably going to get modern fighter jets and tanks in the next 6 months.

Russia is getting relatively unwilling mobilised soldiers that will not have access to weapons anywhere near as good as what Russians had available in February.

In the same sense you could also make a tank much longer to make it go over bridges. (Both cases assume that the widening and lengthening don't add significant weight). So in this sense pressure matters. But when ice is thick enough to almost drive across it does a pretty good job of distributing the weight from say wheels or tracks itself so adding tracks to a car probably won't do much. If the pressure from the individual wheels was too high you'd see one wheel go through the ice first and I think you only see this on ice that is way too thin to drive over. What happens when you're on the limit is that a large sheet of ice breaks because of the total weight.

Ukraine need to be able to deliver 13,000-18,000 gallons of fuel just to keep a single battalion of Abrams tanks operational for five hours.  How many Abrams tank battalions do you think Ukraine needs to win this war?  At the start of this war, Ukraine had roughly 900 tanks.  So, just to supply Ukraine at the levels they had pre-invasion (Given the Ukrainian mobilization, their army is larger than it was pre-invasion) they need over a quarter million gallons of fuel every five hours just to keep those tanks turned on.

They need the fuel trucks.  They need the men to drive the fuel trucks.  They need the supply of fuel.  They need mechanics skilled in turbine engines to be able to maintain the tanks, and fix them if they break down.  They need supplies of replacement parts.  

You can't just plop down a bunch of Abrams and tell the Ukrainians to have at it.  You have to make sure they have the ability to deliver on each of those components (And others I haven't mentioned.  Trust me, that's just the tip of the iceberg), otherwise the Abrams isn't going to be successful for them, and is going to hinder more than help Ukraine.  Trust is earned.  When Ukraine shows to the US that it is capable of handling the Abrams, then we trust them with it.  Not before.

Bradley's, being regular Diesel engines and not turbine engines, are more similar to what the Ukrainians have already been maintaining.  Bradley's, if commanded well, are enough to beat Russian tanks.  Russian tanks, supported by Bradleys, are more than enough to beat Russian tanks.  Take those two vehicles, and further support them with M203s, and now you're cooking.  If Ukraine likes HIMARS, they'll love M203s.  Ukraine already has M203's in small numbers and have done well with them.

Your whole point hinges on the argument that the Ukrainians are in the best position to ""know"" the KIA due to their presence on the battlefield, but that quite frankly is just an untested assumption on your part based on simplistic logic. In the modern battlefield a large part of the kills happen outside of direct view and cannot be validated. Therefore, a certain amount of assumption must be taken: ie you shoot a tank in a certain way, you may count the tank crew as KIA. Whether that's actually true, or the tank had a full compliment - is unknown. What certainly will be the case is that the Ukrainian methods will have a logic and structure to them, so that over time the same events produce the same type of numbers. So in that sense, they are not fabricating numbers out of thin air certainly, it's just that it's likely that their base assumptions are in some cases on the optimistic side.

Fact is that other methods, such as assessing troops strengths from satellite images, signal intelligence, intelligence assets and other indirect means may for painting the whole picture be simply superior. If you take the Russian military and the Ukrainian theater as a closed system with specific inputs and outputs you can likely model the casualties quite effectively using such secondary sources. 

To simply dismiss Western intelligence by saying ""Yeah but they aren't there"" is simplistic and reductionist thinking that shows a deep lack of understanding on your side on how such numbers are constructed. Clearly that doesn't make Western intelligence holy, and such numbers will have a degree of uncertainty to it, but we see multiple intelligence services independently from one another each produce significantly lower numbers than the Ukrainians do. To dismiss that without cause is just wishful thinking.

As for the factor of information warfare, we see that this has happened on the absolute highest level of the Ukrainian government, with the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" being the best example of that. The Ukrainians have shown time and time again that they are willing to engage into information warfare, and in fact have shown to be masters at it. Even to the point that you now, haplessly and angrily, end up defending their inflated numbers six comments deep in a reddit thread. 


So to sum up, your entire premise hinges on a single untested assumption while ignoring both relevant context and baselessly dismissing alternate data points from knowledgeable sources. You are in other words, arguing from a conclusion rather than arguing from the facts, which means that the only ""mess"" we're dealing with here is the incoherent remnant of your childlike ""But they are the ones who are there"" argument.",1664714223.0,1664713185.0,t3_xtewg0,t1_iqqm4dj,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I dislike koolaid drinking propaganda spouting loud mouthed people. That is not all Americans, but certainly a sizeable portion of them, and currently you appear to be part of that group. I've probably spend about 5 months total in the US, divided over several trips and I keep a pretty close eye on US foreign and domestic politics. In addition to that, I've studied international relations and modern western history (meaning last 500 years) as part of my political science education. I know the country very well, have many American friends and acquaintances, and every single one of them would think the attitude you are displaying now is misplaced and toxic.

> Who do you think would own the EU right now if it wasn't for the US? Hate on us all you want but our existence is a is a net positive for the world.

Post WWII the US was happy to act as a security guarantor for Europe, and Europe was happy to let them, as it allowed for demilitarization and spending money on social programs. Germany of course, has taken a very hesitant role in building up their military since then. Had the US not been willing to step into that role, the Europen nations would have simply had to do it themselves. It's not that Western Europe could never *afford* an army that could keep the USSR out, it's just that they really didn't want or need to. 

To then say ""But without the US there would be no Europe"" is simplistic reasoning. Clearly in the absence of the US as a security guarantor there would have been an adaptation in European politics. Pax Americana certainly is a thing, but without it there would have been adaptations, and we additionally must conclude that the US has misused it's hegemonic position quite abundantly. 

That doesn't mean it's all bad. As I said, I'm very happy with the role the US is taking in this conflict. And there are a lot of other examples of good US foreign policy. But we must always remember that the US did not do those things out of principle or because they were the right thing to do, they did it because it was in their interest. Had doing the bad thing been in their interest, they would have done that instead - as evidence by so *so* many terrible things in US foreign policy.

So no, spare us the ""sea to shining sea"" bullshit. Nobody here believes it. The US lawmakers don't even believe it. Only hapless rubes on the internet like yourself believe it.

We have countries like Germany right now that is more interested in their economy than helping a neighbor that is being invaded and being threatened with an attempted genocide. If this war ends now, would I be in the right to tell a German who insults the US to go fuck themselves? Yes, I would be completely in my right. There should be anger behind it, there should be fucking rage behind it. I don't know why the rest of EU is ok with this. The US is having to put pressure on the EU to help more. Why should there be a need for pressure in something like this? The US has supplied 2.5x more military aid than all of EU combined. The US has supplied 3x more humanitarian aid than all of EU combined.

Actually, you seem to be backpedaling from your initial nationalistic rhetoric. If you truly mean what you say now, then your initial phrasing was very far removed from what you meant to say. 

> We have countries like Germany right now that is more interested in their economy than helping a neighbor that is being invaded and being threatened with an attempted genocide.

Oh please. First of all, proportionally speaking - Germany has given more of their military than the US. Fact is Germany has mostly demilitarized post WWII and they have much less to give. The US has warehouses full. So really - depending on your point of view, Germany has done more.

Additionally, you say ""the economy"" as if it doesn't matter, but all over Europe people are having enormous problems paying their bills right now. Low and mid income families are struggling due to the sanctions we put on Russia. European governments collectively will put $500 billion euro towards compensation measures for low income families so they don't literally have to be cold this winter. 

So just because the US has given more in direct aid, doesn't mean that Europe isn't supporting Ukraine. The brunt of the economic fallout of this, falls on European citizens. And unlike the people in the US, everyone here is actually feeling the impact of this war in their daily lives and **still** we overwhelmingly support Ukraine. 

And where the fuck do you think those millions of Ukrainians refugees are, if not all over Europe? You think housing them, feeding them, supporting them costs nothing? My own country (the Netherlands) and Germany are currently facing a refugee and housing crisis, we are being overwhelmed with people that we have to take care of. And **still** we are overwhelmingly in support of Ukraine. 

When all is said and done, the EU will have invested a multitude of whatever the US will end up giving to Ukraine. Just because it's not ""direct aid"", doesn't mean it's not done in support of Ukraine.

Not a moral change in the position of the US. A moral change in other countries. If you are from the US and know what your country has done in the past then you just accept the criticisms and go about your day. When other countries are choosing their economy over preventing an attempted genocide then their morals have changed. I'm be more than willing to point it out as well.

The US is ranked 5th in the world for spending per student. There are only 5 districts in the US that has lower funding per student than Finland. This is at the OECD average for spending in the world. I dunno what you know about the US but school districts are small.

That isn't true, there isn't a single state in the US that bans evolution. 47 of the states require it by law and the other 3 allow for it to be ""questioned"" but it still has to be taught.

As I said in a different post. European support for Ukraine will end up being a multitude of US support. By applying strict sanctions and switching off from Russian fossil fuels, Europe is essentially paying hundreds of billions in support of Ukraine. People all over Europe will have real problems paying their heating bills. That would not have been the case had we kept buying Russia fossil fuels. Same with the refugees that we are taking care of. Europe is providing enormous amounts of support to Ukraine that you are not counting because it's not ""direct support"".

The public school system in the US is much worse than in most other developed nations. The spending is made up by private schools. You cannot ignore the class divide that exists when it comes to education when looking at the US. Teachers having to buy their class supplies has become the norm. You are willfully ignoring this: https://tcf.org/content/about-tcf/tcf-study-finds-u-s-schools-underfunded-nearly-150-billion-annually/

It was just an example of how politicized the US system is. Here's a more in depth article that looks at this systemic issue with US schooling: https://www.americanprogress.org/article/book-banning-curriculum-restrictions-and-the-politicization-of-u-s-schools/

> The US ranks 2nd for international travel. The US also is a mix of people from all over the world. Not counting the amount of tourism from other countries that come here. Experiencing other cultures is constant here.

That is the wrong data point to look at. Americans are rich and there are a lot of them, so of course in money it will score high. But fact is, [half of Americans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2019/05/02/percentage-of-americans-who-never-traveled-beyond-the-state-where-they-were-born-a-surprise/?sh=2f93ee792898) don't even own a passport. And by the by, going to an all inclusive in Mexico to sit with other Americans isn't really experiencing other cultures. 

> I think you really misunderstand the US.

I think that you are upset that I do not share your naive and idealistic vision of the US. The US is a broken country. Fourty percent of people [live in poverty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/20/joe-bidens-claim-that-almost-half-americans-live-poverty/) in the US, it leads the world in incarcerations [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries), it leads the developed world in [violent gun deaths](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/03/24/980838151/gun-violence-deaths-how-the-u-s-compares-to-the-rest-of-the-world) and it is no longer even considered a [full democracy](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/us-is-no-longer-a-full-democracy-eiu-warns.html).

I understand the US just fine. It's a broken country. An oligarchy that roleplays as a democracy whose only goal is to extract wealth from the public and put it into the pockets of the elite. Everything the US does can be seen in that light, including its foreign policy. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars were nothing but huge money transfers from the American public to the American private sector. First you paid to bomb these countries, then you paid to occupy them (using private contractors on top of your own army) and then you paid to rebuild it. It cost the American public trillions of tax dollars for absolutely no good reason.
