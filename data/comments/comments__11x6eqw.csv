>(1/5) In the coming weeks, thousands of Russian convicts who have fought for Wagner Group are likely to be pardoned and released. Wagner prisoner recruitment peaked in autumn 2022, with inmates being offered commutation of their sentences after six months of service.
  
>(2/5) Although approximately half of the prisoners recruited have likely been killed or wounded, evidence from Russia suggests the group is following through on its promise to free survivors.
  
>(3/5) The certificates issued to freed Wagner veterans claim to have been endorsed by the decree of President Putin.
  
>(4/5) With Wagner now likely banned from recruiting more prisoners, this exodus will worsen its personnel problems.

In the fight against the Russian occupiers, defending #Ukraine, a citizen of #NewZealand, former serviceman of the Armed Forces of the country Kane Te Tai with the call sign ""Turtle"" died.

He was in Ukraine for almost a year and died bravely, in combat.

On March 13, Kane Te Tai said that he and his fellow soldiers managed to capture Russian positions on the battlefield. Checking the captured positions, he heard a shout: ""I am Ukrainian."" The New Zealander stopped the other soldiers from throwing a grenade. According to Kane Te Tai, the Ukrainian recognized him and shouted: ""New Zealand! New Zealand!""

""I recognised him, it was my friend who I thought was killed by the Russians when they invaded his house. Heavily starved for two months and forced to drink anti freeze for entertainment, he barely looked like the man I knew a couple of months ago. But it was the best thing to happen to me in this God forsaken war. To be able to save your friends is something that almost never happens but I'm thankful and feel blessed that it was us that could pull him from that Hell hole,"" Kane Te Tai wrote and posted a video of what happened.

Kane Te Tai is the third citizen of New Zealand killed in the war in Ukraine. Dominic Abelen died last August - his body has still not been found. Volunteer Andrew Bagshaw was killed by artillery fire in January while trying to rescue an elderly woman from her home.

Rest in peace brave defenders! Glory to the Heroes!

The last 2 days were somewhat quiet, Kharkiv wasn’t targeted directly, but as usual many of the towns that are closer to the frontline, like Kupiansk, were shelled. Today there were also some recon drones active in our region during the day, around 1pm, but a bit later it was reported that they were intercepted.

They also fired at least 3 missiles at Odesa in the evening, 2 of them were intercepted and the last one hit a residential building, injuring at least 3 civilians.

Today’s Russian attacks are almost certainly happening because they are really mad about us hitting their logistics hub in Crimea yesterday.

There was the assumption that he would carry out some sort of false-flag event that he would blame on Ukraine to use as an excuse to invade, but it never materialized. Instead, he just went on TV as the invasion was kicking off and basically said point-blank… “I am going to invade because Ukraine doesn’t deserve to exist. I will invade, conquer, and then I will genocide all of the Ukrainians and give their land to Russians.” 



China wants nothing to do with that level of boldness. Even most of Russias oldest and closest friends want nothing to do with that level of boldness. Cuba. Venezuela. Serbia. Kazakhstan. All are just sort of in varying degrees of shock, mostly just wanting to be left out of it all. He got the coalition of the pariahs, he got North Korea, Syria, Iran and Eritrea. Even his puppet Belarus is pretty much half-assing their support. 



I’m sure that Xi would love to salvage something useful for himself out of this whole clusterfuck, but I very much doubt that he would want to actually help Putin achieve his stated goals. Genocides are supposed to happen gradually, over decades, and with at least a little plausible deniability in there somewhere. Despots don’t really need the moral high-ground, but they do need to be at least on a moral mole-hill. They need something. Openly aligning with Putin’s horde of murderers and rapists is a bridge too far even for China. 



You really should have done the false-flag, Poots, and you should have made it a really good one. Did President Biden warning everybody that you were going to do that cause you to bail? Did you have something in the works that got foiled? It doesn’t really matter. It’s too late now. It’s just you, Assad, Kim, Khamenei and Afwerki.

Russia offers China natural resources in exchange for support, which the #Kremlin considers critical to the continuation of the war in #Ukraine, a source close to the Kremlin told the Financial Times. 

Last year, #Russia increased its oil exports to #China by nearly 10%, coal by 21% and gas by 1.5 times, becoming its largest supplier for the first time. China in return sent $4.8 billion worth of electronics and technology to Russia, replacing Western companies that left.

Russia, #Putin said during the meeting with #Xi, intends to provide ""uninterrupted oil supplies"" to China, as well as sharply increase gas exports. ""The total volume of gas supplies by 2030 will be at least 98 billion cubic meters, plus 100 million tons of LNG,"" Putin said. 

The volume Putin announced is all the gas that Russia, according to the plan, should produce by 2030, Interfax notes.

""The logic of events dictates that we are fully becoming a resource colony of China. Our servers will be from Huawei. <...> China will receive gas via the ""Power of Siberia"". By the end of 2023, the yuan will be our main currency of trade,"" says the FT source.

The sanctions have further highlighted the asymmetrical nature of Russian-Chinese relations, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies: ""It's hard to hide the fact that Russia is now a junior partner.""

From wikipedia


>Armor protection was improved by implementing a new special armor incorporating depleted uranium and other undisclosed materials and layouts. This was introduced into the M1A1 production starting October 1988. This new armor increased effective armor particularly against kinetic energy rounds but at the expense of adding considerable weight to the tank, as depleted uranium is 1.7 times denser than lead.

>The first M1A1 tanks to receive this upgrade were tanks stationed in Germany. US-based tank battalions participating in Operation Desert Storm received an emergency program to upgrade their tanks with depleted uranium armor immediately before the onset of the campaign. M1A2 tanks uniformly incorporate depleted uranium armor, and **all M1A1 tanks in active service have been upgraded to this standard as well.

Both the two successors of the soviet union, with strong familiar ties between the population from soviet times. Sounds like Putin-propaganda? Yeah, that is the part that has some truth to it, but the conculsions are opposite. 

The thing is, after the orange revolution, Ukraine chose slowly chose to go into opposite direction of Putins Russia. A civil society began to develop, institutions strengthened, the influence of oligarchs reduced (ssssloooowly. Still a long way to go) and the population turned west. Russia was losing its influence over Ukraine and as they cannot compete with Europe in soft power (aka offering opportunities), they tried with bribery, strong-arming and blackmailing (or maybe because that is the only way of power that Putin understands). Of course that had exactly the opposite effect.

Now, a european Ukraine, that goes through the same development as, lets say Poland or the Baltics since joining the union is a huge threat to Putin. Because if it succeds it shows Russians that another way is possible. One without the Tsar robbing every ounce off the population. Even for a former Soviet republic.

And because the (former) close ties between Russians and Ukrainians, Putin can't fully control the information sphere. Private comunication would have happened and slowly erroded the narrative on which Putins power is based. 

His solution was to sever the ties between Russia and Ukraine by open enemity and trying to force Ukraine back under his information control. Through conquest. As a side effect he thought he would also be able to show himself as the strong reuniter of greater Russia (including a ""reunification"" with Belarus), which would be his ""great legacy"".

Russia itself isn’t strong but if it can dominate the other post Soviet states then it could legit be a power. Ukraine was the biggest of the other states and it was quickly becoming a western liberal democracy and making big strides against corruption.

To understand Russia, I believe more people need to understand this is nothing new. Russia has been the dark backwards backwater of Europe, since basically forever. They can never quite integrate with the modern world. They can never quite seem to modernize with the times, regardless of what times they find themselves in.

The reason is tragedy: A legacy of brutal rulers, where resources were scarce, and human life was dirt cheap. Russian leaders stealing and exploiting their people, stripping the flesh from the bone, is nothing new. And when Russians writhe in their suffering, they look out and see a modern world. Their leaders could use this as an opportunity to do better. But, like I said, all their leaders were basically assholes. 

So instead, for hundreds and hundreds of years, what you got was the nurturing of a deep seated jealousy, resentment, and eventually hatred for Western Europe. Deep down they KNOW all their shit is third-rate broken down garbage and they emulate just a fraction of the success of better countries who enjoy better economies and much higher standards of living.

Since I'm not an economist, it would be hard to exactly pin down what the Chinese are going to take advantage of it, but the current growth of China has developed in a way that suggests something like the growth of the Roman Empire in its latter stages.

The Romans reached a point that the only way it could sustain itself was through constant, never-ending expansionism.   To guarantee that their populace and economy could run at a sustainable level of pricing and resource availability, they always had to bring in a constant influx of people that could be relied on to keep the labor availability high and labor costs down in the form of slaves that later became citizens, even as the middle and upper classes thrived, and keep the material costs as low as possible to allow the expansion and growth to continue at a rate that meets their needs.  When the Roman Empire couldn't expand more, that's when the fractures began to occur, and led to the downfall of the Imperium.

China is beginning to hit a similar breakpoint.  Their population is aging, and incomes of those of working age are rising to the point where production and industry are getting prohibitively expensive to sustain a desired level of growth to fuel internal expansion.  And despite the best efforts of China to increase the production of raw materials, they've had to increasingly rely on imports to satisfy the needs for trade and internal consumption, which has become pricy in a competitive global market.   They tried to reduce the latter with their Belt and Road Projects across under-developed nations across the globe to secure better deals for natural resources, but that hasn't been enough, as the financial costs and liabilities of supporting these efforts are swamping the gains.

As far as what the Chinese would do to Russia, they're going to look to do as much as they can to fill those needs for cheap labor and resources through 'cooperating' with the Russians.   They're going position their people and set up organizations and companies to take advantage of Russia's severely compromised state to get as much as they can out of the deals they make.   But given the current trajectory of Russia's economy, as well as the damaging influence having such an agreement with a pariah nation-state might have in global relations, it's a huge gamble the Chinese are making by typing themselves to this.",1679438452.0,1679427385.0,t3_11x6eqw,t1_jd4bqlm,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

""Russian"" is an indication of ethnicity.  Americans and therefore most of English speaking discussions, base your nationality on birthplace.  USA recognizes both place of birth and parental nationality.  But regardless of who your mom and pop are, if you came out of your mother inside US territory then you are entitled to all privileges of being a US citizen.  Russians do not see it that way.  They tend to believe that if your mother was a Russian citizen then you are also a Russian regardless of where the birth occured.  They also think people who run away (emigrate) and become citizens in another country are still their people.  Authoritarian governments believe they have authority over their citizens.  Using the term ""Muscovite"" could make a distinction from ""all people of Russian descent"".  

There is a significant cultural difference between people in major capital cities and rural villagers.  You can see that with Manhattan and small town Tennessee.  Or someone from Bern and dairy farmers up in the high Alps.  How residents inside Moscow view politics and the war in Ukraine will be significantly different from both rural Russia and more remote elements of the Russian Federation.

You're not understanding my point. When enemy tanks are so spread out, there is very little point in a convoy purposed to kill tanks. If they only encounter a handful of BMPs and 1-2 T-72s on the line, they are saddling themselves with a ton of extra weight, supplies, and repair vehicles and personnel for nothing.

Russia doesn't mass its tanks in a defensive formation to defeat Ukraine's tank units. They bunch their tanks up when they are doing an assault.

The extra armor is nice, but it won't significantly reduce the number of tank losses against mines, arty or wire-guided ATGMs that hit from the top down.

Without BONUS rounds (I don't think Ukraine had M777s yet), I don't think that traditional artillery does very well against armored vehicles.

I've read more theories that the Siversky Donets River Crossing was clearly a tank-ambush. Yes, artillery supported (blowing up the bridge for example), but after the pontoon bridge blew up, there was some kind of battle.

Moving vehicles are exceptionally hard to strike with artillery that takes 1+ minutes to travel.

I mean, that's the joke about tanks? Their #1 use is killing enemy tanks.

In almost all other uses, the M2 Bradley is a superior vehicle. Less fuel use, more ammo (25mm gun is smaller, meaning you fit 900+ rounds of ammunition instead of only ~50 tank guns). Etc. etc.

The only reason to have such an absurdly huge gun is to kill enemy vehicles with the highest level of reliability. M2 Bradley 25mm can be deflected by modern armor, and M2 Bradley's missiles are too slow in practice (though better than nothing, just 2 shots per reload is pretty bad if you miss a shot or come up against more than 2 enemies at once).

But that big tank gun requires lots of fuel to move around. It has few shots (only ~50ish), and has no room for infantry to ride in.",False,1679418069.0,t3_11x6eqw,t1_jd3r0g6,,8,0,0,0,0,0,

A Javelin tube is just a simple metal tube.  A NLAW tube also contains a sight, targeting computer, and firing mechanism.  Surely you see the difference where one platform discards the simple metal tube while retaining the sight/targeting/firing mechanism while the other discards everything ...

This is the hard reality about this war: Neither side has air supremacy, so neither side can executive a tank offensive without serious tank losses. It does not matter what kinds of tanks you put into the formation. Western tanks will die in large numbers to Russian massed artillery, so long as Russia can spot them in time. And Russia will spot them at least some of the time because Ukraine cannot quickly traverse Russian mine fields.

American and NATO tank forces don't have to worry about this problem because they have air power than can instantly suppress Russian artillery while they take their sweet time moving through mine fields.
