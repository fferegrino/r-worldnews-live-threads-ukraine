He had a few family members die during WW2. Siblings both died. Grew up in relative poverty. Parents had him in their 40s and treated him like a miracle gift from God because of it. Studied language and law. Joined the KGB where he was subpar agent and because of this promoted to mid level admin. Yeltsin picked him to be his successor pretty much out of nowhere even though at the time he had little political experience. Yeltsins popularity was gone by the end of his presidency (approval rating of 2 percent) so no way the Russian people would agree to someone he picked as his successor. They needed a plan around this. A way to get around this was to covertly bomb their own civilian apartment buildings to have a pretext to start the Chechen war. This catapulted him to president as putin united the people and took on the war effort against the “Chechen terrorists.” Of course his first act of presidency was to give yeltsin immunity for basically ruining the Russian economy and giving the oligarchs 40% of the countries wealth. The second was to surround himself with most of his former KGB friends into the political arena. He is a nationalist and the foundation of geopolitics is his playbook, and wants to reunite the USSR at all costs and make Russia a world power again.

This is all mixed with his baseline dark personality and exorbitant amount of money. Few emotional expressions. A brilliant liar.

Here is an excerpt from the National Security Council fact sheet announcing the sanctions, with more context behind the additional penalties:

Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine...

These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The Department of Treasury will share financial intelligence and other evidence where appropriate with the Department of Justice to support criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets.

Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s cronies and their family members. One of the elites is Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest
individuals and a close ally of Putin. His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by U.S. persons – including his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our
ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft.

The United States will also sanction Dmitry Peskov, who as Putin’s spokesman is a top purveyor of Putin’s
propaganda. The United States will also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.

As President Biden said, we, we will continue to work with our Allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who
are profiting from this violent regime.

The United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury
apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains.

- starts speaking about foreigners in Ukraine and how they are poorly treated compared to Ukrainians escaping

- says Russia is providing humanitarian corridors to let people leave besieged cities, if you approach russian troops and you aren't ukrainian you will be helped to your embassy or whatever

- says neo nazis are mistreating their own population (refers to ukrainian leadership)

- says high rise buildings are being hit because ukrainians put snipers and cannons in high rise buildings, invites civilians to leave areas of war, says this is how nazis behaves during war, using weapons where civilians are to justify their actions

- says Russia is sustaining losses, and his priority is the lives of his servicemen

- says families of fallen soldiers will receive a payout (n.d.r. my comment: I find it disgusting that the first thing you mention about your soldiers dying is how you are sending money to the families)

- says all military servicemen involved in this operation (he doesn't call it war) will receive 5 million rubles (more or less 45 thousands euros at today's exchange), it's not clear how and when, sounds like a pension or bonus

- says about other insurance for injuries if you can't fight anymore for 2.9 million rubles (more or less 25k $).

- emphasizes that soldiers are fighting for security of russians in general, russians in donbas and to de-militarize and de nazify ukraine, doesn't want anybody putting threats on Russian borders, ""including anybody who's threatening us with nuclear weapons""

- stands up in the room and asks to honor all the (russians) fallen in Ukraine with a minute of silence (actually sits back again and starts talking after 10 seconds)

- says the special military operation is going according to the plan and schedule, all the goals are being achieved, passes the word to Shoigu (Russian defense minister)

- some confusion, I didn't hear the minister of defense

- talks about the bravery of some soldiers, especially those in luhansk and donbas. names some brigade that broke up ukrainian defense (he calls them nationalists btw often), and names a soldier that with his tank took out 5 ukrainian tanks, and another unit that alone destroyed 15 tanks and 6 bmps without losing a single person. says some soldier will receive the order of hero of russia postumously for some bravery, seems to be talking about the guy who took out the 5 tanks on his own.

**edit**: forgot, he also mentioned that foreigners fighting in Ukraine (he calls them mercenaries) will not be treated like prisoners of war, doesn't go into details or I didn't hear them.

Don't know the rest because Sky interrupted to speak about something else.

Another issue for Russia is that it just wasted a **lot** of hardware that it won’t easily replace, the new sanctions are going to make it hard to afford to maintain their current levels let alone replace lost inventory. That’s if they can even import the materials needed to make new planes, tanks etc.

Personally, I think it's conflating issues to say ""but Lithuania"" because not attacking over Ukraine and attacking over Lithuiania, both cases still hold true on NATO being a defence pact between countries. It's not that people only want to attack if Lithuania gets attacked, it's that countries are obligated by pact to do so. That is not true of Ukraine. It's also a moot point because Putin is actively bombing Ukraine, but he hasn't even positioned tanks on Lithuania's borders, nor is he going to have the capacity to take on NATO when he's struggling to keep tanks running in Ukraine, it's an absolute moot point to begin with, but even on a theoretical it is apples to oranges.

However, it is pretty disingenious to say that we are abandoning Ukraine, beacuse many NATO countries have sent support, and on top of that, thrusted an even larger spear into Russia than a NFZ, sanctions. Sanctions aren't exciting or make for good news but they are absolutely devistating Russia and putting heavy pressure on Putin to rethink things.

I get that Ukrainians are struggling, their existence itself is being threatened. I hate it. I've had a couple instances where I worried this would escalate to affect me but for the most part, even before DNR/LNR were declared independent, I've been glued to this whole thing in worry. But we also have to think rationally and not emotionally, it would feel good for NATO to just rush in but there's reason countries are hesitant to do so and it's not strictly out of selfishness, the best way of ending a fight is not to throw yourself in the middle but carefully and deliberately try to pull people back out of the fray and be diplomatic.

Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.

Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.

Another key objective for Russian forces in the south east appeared to be the Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, Europe’s biggest, where Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces.

At least 33 civilians have been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihiv on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say, with the death toll continuing to rise.

Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The Russian leader went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence.

Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance.

The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said.

A spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat told the Guardian:

Only the General Assembly, INTERPOL’s supreme governing body comprising representatives from each of its 195 member countries, can vote on issues relating to membership. The INTERPOL General Secretariat continues to monitor the situation concerning Ukraine closely.

The International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, is a supranational body providing investigational support to member states, primarily through its red notice system that flags suspects internationally.

Continuing to include Russia within Interpol grants security services access to the red notice database and potential broader support, despite accusations that Russia is a major abuser of the red notice system.

Rights groups point to the ability of authoritarian regimes to abuse Interpol’s red notice system in order to flag political dissidents or exiles. Critics also point to the opacity of Interpol’s internal affairs, including allowing Syria to rejoin the organisation last year after a decade-long suspension.

Ukraine’s minister for internal affairs Denis Monastyrsky wrote to Interpol earlier this week demanding Russia’s expulsion following their invasion of Ukraine.

Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,

The Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske reported.

Britain and Poland both backed Ukraine’s efforts, although they demanded that Interpol suspend Russia rather than exclude it. Home Secretary Priti Patel told parliament:

The Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect.

Poland’s police chief General Jaroslaw Szymczyk joined Britain’s public efforts, writing an impassioned personal letter to Interpol general secretary Jürgen Stock.

I strongly believe that the world needs a clear, consistent and unambiguous message that we, police officers from all over the world, do not accept the warfare actions taken by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

Dear Jürgen. We have known each other for many years. We have talked many times about our dream of a safer world, the need to protect victims and to definitely prosecute those who stand on the other side of the law and the good. This is a great responsibility. Today, dear friend, the world is telling us “I call.” It is time to turn words into actions,” he added.

I generally think people predicting the future with 100% certainty are very stupid. Nukes exist, therefore the possibility of use is **non-zero**. Every major decision by world leaders is being made around the fact nuclear weapons are obviously a very real possibility even if the probability is low.      
Also the use of these weapons is not a guarantee of total nuclear war. They absolutely could be used with no real military response, it depends on the use. It's a complicated scenario but nobody will commit global nuclear suicide because Vlad drops a tactical nuke on Ukraine to get them to cede. I'm not saying it's very likely, but it's a real possibility and to claim there is 0% chance is incredibly ignorant.

India cannot sabotage its relations with Russia because it provides a huge amount of weapons for India's military. India has its own somewhat unfriendly neighbors, one of which is run by a guy who a lot of us were pretty sure was going to make a grab for Taiwan in the near future. There has been a history of border skirmishes with China and India for quite some time, the 1961 Sino-Indian war being the best example. This conflict intensified in 2020 and is still ongoing. These more recent skirmishes have resulted in combat fatalities for both sides as well as India banning Chinese apps. Here is the link if you want to learn more.

There is a decades long trend of the Chinese trying to push into Indian territory in the Himalayan region. India has much less of a reason to play ball with Beijing than they do with Moscow.  They have also fought a number of wars against Pakistan, with the most recent one being the 1999 Kargil War.

d674b8adc41eaee5f515a09601b39218,t5xqnr,hz7ym88,"He wants to install a puppet regime which will create a buffer zone between him and nato backed countries. However if he succeeds Ukraine will probably split in two (at least) and Ukraine will never be united or at least be too busy trying to unite its self to ever pose a real threat to Russia (which it never really did to being with). He wants to create chaos in an other country so the focus is on infighting rather than him, an old Britsh empire tactic. India, Ireland and many other being prime examples.

What I don't understand is how Putin thinks he can successfully ride the aftermath of whatever the result in Ukraine is. Russia does have a huge amount of backed up resources and a potential trade alliance with China because China equally wants to see the wests influence diminished. However like all resources they do run out and the Chinese market is no where near as lucrative as the western markets. However Europe (not sure about the US and Canada) relies on about 40 to 45 percent of Russian gas an Oil (hence why sections stopped short) and cutting Europe out of that market could cause a financial disaster for Europe. There is also a reverse effect to that. Europe pays a premium price for oil and gas that China simply will not pay Russia should they turn to Chinese markets.

That being said Putin is no mug and this notion that he doesn't know what he is doing is (I'm sorry to say) western propaganda. I'm absolutely sure he has factored in every eventuality and will have a plan in place whatever the outcome. War is a gamble, but in Putins case its an exceptionally calculated gamble that could turn out in his favour. Whatever the outcome is Putin will have succeeded in creating chaos. This whole notion of Russia being isolated is nothing new for Russia. Sure it's now more extreme isolation but nothing it wasn't prepared for.

If Russia doesn't get its way in this war, they either kill who got in their way, or ruin you. How do I know this? Take a look at who ever opposed Russian internal or foreign policy and see what happened to them. Also a friend of my grandmother was responsible for disrupting a post world War two plan where Russia was going to stage or cause a prison breakout in Norway of NAZI POWs. The Russian army were going to move into Norway and put down this resistance and essentially occupy Norway ""just in case"" However this was foiled by British intelligence. What happened to this person? (my grandmother's friend) well basically loads of stories about him having multiple affairs came out in the British press and in 1950s Britain, that was a big enough deal for you to lose your job and for you never to reach a top position for the rest of your career. 

The worst kept secret in Russian foreign policy is that they've always wanted a fresh water port (a port where the water doesn't freeze over in the winter) in the east. Norway would've provided that and it's also why Russia have Kaliningrad today. Now think about Crimea and why Russia was so quick to annexe it.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CappgNyOplT/?utm_medium=copy_link

Please consider this as a means to donate directly to the people of Ukraine. Book an Airbnb and tell the owners that you will not be staying, Airbnb has waived ALL FEES so that it will be a donation to those in need.  You can chat with the owner first to make sure it is owned by a person/family vs a corporation. That way, those living in Ukraine will still have a means of income and a way to feed themselves and their families. Even one night booked could make the world of a difference. Those that are fortunate enough to not need these donations have been paying it forward to friends, families, and organizations dedication to helping those affected by the ongoing war.

\- Denazification

The worse of these terms are the last 2. Demilitarization means Ukraine would have no choice but to bow down to Russia and get effortlessly overrun if it refuse. And Denazification means that Putin would get to at least fire everyone he wants from the Ukranian government and military.

As far as I know we don't know yet about the Ukranian peace terms.

Democrats overreacted to everything he did, indirectly obfuscation and minimizing the aspects of his administration that were truly detrimental.

Republicans turned a blind eye because, well, the Democrats were complaining about everything.

Look no further than the fact that the US intelligence apparatus openly wondered if Trump was a risk to leak (at a minimum, unintentionally) classified intelligence to the Russians, and potentially compromise our intelligence assets.

As a simple example, I know for a fact that Trump tweeted classified information on several occasions. You might claim he’s able to do that as president, and you’d be right, but it’s completely irresponsible and detrimental to our intelligence abilities.

While there’s no public evidence to connect Putin to directly putting Trump in office, there is plenty of evidence that indicates that was his desired choice, and evidence he did influence the election in that direction.

Do we really believe that this will stop at Ukraine? What will happen after? Do we really think that once his puppet is installed in Kiev he'll be happy and stop there? There will be further demands, there will be other casus belli. And by allowing him to get away with this invasion, we'll only make him think he can get away with it. Until he can't... Until we're faced with the decision we're all hoping never comes...

Look I'm not advocating for nuclear war. But we're still buying his oil and gas for fuck sake... And countries like India or Pakistan are still on the fence or outright supporting. Can we really not pressure these countries into cutting ties? Can we really afford not to finance his war through oil and gas?

Putin is essentially following this text like a playbook by Dugin(published in 1997), an ultranationalist and one of his extreme supporters. It's essentially required reading for the Russian Elite. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations\_of\_Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)

*""Ukraineshould be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has nogeopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universalsignificance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, itscertain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all ofEurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in generalsenseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not beallowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.""*

Dugin has believes that anyone not 100% behind Putin and fanatically following these future plans for a Russian is mentally ill or insane.

An interesting part, and one that might also explain why Russia's military is failing so hard.

*""Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook advocates asophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, anddisinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. Theoperations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization ofRussia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure othercountries""*

It appears that they believe oil, gas and natural resource leverage/blackmail, and casting a very big shadow, are all that's really needed.

It also explains the West's reaction quite well. They're cutting off dependency to said Oil, gas, and natural resources, putting Russia into an economic stranglehold, and the exceptional bravery and heroism of Ukraine is revealing each day, that Russia's big shadow is nothing but smoke and mirrors.

That doesn't mean there isn't real danger though. People are dying by the thousands, their lives are being ripped apart, and their futures are in limbo, Nukes are the real big shadow that isn't shrinking but one that can only be used once because it would auto-guarantee MAD.",False,1646334522.0,t3_t5xqnr,t1_hz7sxz1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

In terms of Ukraine's productivity if Russia takes it?

Long term most definitely no. But depending on how the situation is afterwards is also a problem

Medium term-Ukraine is one of the biggest exporters of wheat in the world. BUT the war has forced buyers to look elsewhere. Those orders are being filled by other countries. Buyers want a degree of certainty too, this is food we are talking about. Labor force will be severely depleted either through the refugee situation or casualties. Same deal with the oil and gas deposits. They can mine all they want but currently Turkey is blocking access to the Black sea so until that ends they aren't getting any ships to transport those out. Meaning they have to find a land route and that's way more expensive than shipping

Short term is obviously a problem. A lot of infrastructure has been absolutely smashed to pieces. Can grow all the grain in the world but if you can't process it or transport it, it's not worth anything. Ports, roads and distribution centres are just wrecked.

How are the sanctions supposed to work.

Russia imports a lot of stuff from semi conductors to rubber tires which is paid for in USD. And because the ruble is essentially worthless everything gets more expensive. You remember the GFC in the late 2000's? Think of that on super steroids. A lot of things they are importing are also blocked. The semi conductor thing is important as Intel and AMD are not selling to them. They can't even pay for orders because they are banned from SWIFT. You're not going to be paying for $500mil bill with cash. The major shipping companies are also not delivering anymore.

The instability he has demonstrated over this last month is a factor that makes direct western involvement not worth risking in my opinion, but if we can get the Russian people to realize how he is prioritizing imperialist conquest over their well-being to the point it shakes his foundation of power there isn't as much that he can do in terms of a world-ending response. Luckily, many Russians see this for what it is despite the propaganda: an attempted slaughter of their neighboring countrymen, their ethnic siblings, and a major sacrifice of their own young soldiers solely for some kind of ""benefit"" for those with too much power already.

>Andriy Yevhenovych Biletsky (Ukrainian: Андрій Євгенович Білецький; born 5 August 1979[3]) is a Ukrainian white nationalist far-right politician and the leader of political party National Corps. He was the first commander of the volunteer militia Azov Battalion,[5][1][8][9] and a co-founder of the nationalist movement Social-National Assembly.[10][11][12][13][14][15] From 2014 until 2019 Biletsky was a Member of Ukrainian Parliament. 

>The goals of the ""Social-National Assembly"", that he co-founded, are ""the protection of the white race by creating an anti-democratic and anti-capitalist ""nationocracy"" system"" and the eradication of ""international Zionist speculative capital"".[33] In 2010, Biletsky said that it was the Ukrainian nation's mission to ""lead the white races of the world in a final crusade … against Semite-led Untermenschen"".[34]

>However, Biletsky declares that he is not racist or antisemitic.

https://ianbremmer.bulletin.com/west-at-war-with-russia

Anyone telling you sanctions are safe is off their rocker. However, sanctions are *safer* in one key aspect: you can't accidentally sanction someone you didn't mean to and kill them in the process. The point is, war and violence are far messier than economic measures. (Not that sanctions are, in any way, wholly predictable.) But war has an unfortunate tendency to not go as planned, and there's no easy way to define a limited military encounter in a situation like this. E.g., NATO can't say ""we'll enforce a no-fly zone over X area and that's it"" without a very significant risk of spillover. But you can say ""we're sanctioning VSB and Putin"" and have a pretty good idea of the (economic) result.

I think any credible observer expects escalation as a result of the sanctions. But the escalation will be - hopefully - more thoughtful on both sides, and less prone to spinning out of control in the way hot conflict does.",False,1646337012.0,t3_t5xqnr,t1_hz810b7,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Russian Orthodox tried a mini coup of sorts almost 10 years ago by separating from the Greek Orthodox, with it's patriarchal seat in since Byzantine times in Constantinople, even through today to Istanbul. The Russians have basically since forever been claiming themselves as ""the third rome"" since the Greeks up until their independence still referred to themselves as Romans.

They've (the Russian Orthodox church) since split into their own leadership (like how the Coptic Orthodox have their own pope) where as before they would take direction from Istanbul, all because the Greek Orthodox Church gave Ukrainian Orthodox churches the right to self govern themselves, but still take direction from Istanbul. Previously the Russians had the Ukrainians under the umbrella.

I'm guessing 3-15 years, but there are too many factors that go into how long something like that would go to really know. There could be not much of a resistance at all.   


In terms of what happens to Ukraine as a country, I see one possibility being that once Russia demilitarizes and removes Nazi elements like the Azov battalion, Ukraines borders are adjusted and a sort of east-west split occurs with the boundary being the Dnieper river. If you have paid attention to this country for the past few years you would know that typically eastern Ukrainians are more sympathetic to Russia and western Ukrainians are sympathetic to the west, and want to be a part of Europe. So you could have a situation where boundaries are drawn like that, but there are still some issues, like how can Russia ensure the new western territory does not remilitarize or join NATO among other things. Russia will only leave if they can ensure that the things they fought for in the invasion are secured.

Excerpt from Timothy Snyder's 2018 book The Road to Unfreedom 

>The Russian intervention in the Donbas was called the “Russian Spring.” It was certainly springtime for Russian fascism. On March 7, 2014, Alexander Dugin rejoiced in “the expansion of liberational (from Americans) ideology into Europe. It is the goal of full Eurasianism—Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok.” The fascist commonwealth was coming into view, boasted the fascist. A few days later, Dugin proclaimed that history had been undone: “Modernity was always essentially wrong, and we are now at the terminal point of modernity. For those who rendered modernity and their own destiny synonymous, or who let that occur unconsciously, this will mean the end.” The coming struggle would mean “real liberation from the open society and its beneficiaries.” According to Dugin, an American diplomat of Jewish origin was “a dirty pig,” and a Ukrainian politician of Jewish origin a “ghoul” and a “bastard.” Chaos in Ukraine was the work of “Mossad.” In the same spirit, Alexander Prokhanov, speaking with Evelina Zakamskaia on Russian television on March 24, blamed Ukrainian Jews for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—and for the Holocaust. 

>This was a new variety of fascism, which could be called schizofascism: actual fascists calling their opponents “fascists,” blaming the Holocaust on the Jews, treating the Second World War as an argument for more violence. It was a natural next step in a Russian politics of eternity, in which Russia was innocent and thus no Russian could ever be a fascist. 

>During the Second World War, Soviet propaganda identified the enemy as the “fascists.” According to Soviet ideology, fascism arose from capitalism. During the war against Nazi Germany, Russians could imagine that Soviet victory was part of a larger historical shift in which capitalism would disappear, and all men would become brothers. After the war, Stalin celebrated a national triumph, not so much of the Soviet Union as of Russia. This suggested that the “fascist” enemy was the outsider rather than the capitalist, and thus a more permanent conflict.

> In the 1970s, Stalin’s heir, Brezhnev, located the meaning of Soviet (and Russian) history in the victory of the Red Army in the Second World War. In so doing, Brezhnev definitively changed the sense of the word “fascism.” It no longer suggested a stage of capitalism that might be overcome, since history was no longer expected to bring change. “Fascism” meant the eternal threat from the West, of which the Second World War was an example. Thus Russians educated in the 1970s, including the leaders and war propagandists of the 2010s, were instructed that “fascist” meant “anti-Russian.” 

>In the Russian language it is practically a grammatical error to imagine that a Russian could be a fascist. In contemporary Russian discourse, it is easier for an actual Russian fascist to call a non-fascist a “fascist” than it is for a non-fascist to call a Russian fascist a “fascist.” Thus a fascist like Dugin could celebrate the victory of fascism in fascist language while condemning as “fascist” his opponents. Ukrainians defending their country were “junta mercenaries from the ranks of the Ukrainian swine-fascists.” 

>Similarly, a fascist like Prokhanov could describe fascism as a physical substance that spilled in from the West to threaten Russian virginity. In June, Prokhanov wrote of fascism as “black sperm” that threatened “the golden goddesses of Eurasia.” His lapidary expression of racial and sexual anxiety was a perfect fascist text. Glazyev also followed the schizofascist protocol. While endorsing Nazi geopolitics, he set a standard for calling Russia’s enemies “fascist.” Writing in September 2014 for the Izborsk Club, Glazyev called Ukraine “a fascist state, with all the signs of fascism known to science.”",False,1646332339.0,t3_t5xqnr,t1_hz7pk81,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

When it comes to price hikes due to davaluation of the currency in foreign exchange markets, the first thing you'll see increase in price will be foreign made imported good and good that rely on imported components.  So things like most technology, imported fruit, etc.

This is because Russian businesses/distributors generally need to buy those things from outside of Russia in a major world currency like US Dollars, Euros, or Japanese Yen.  Samsung, for example, is not going to accept Rubles.  So Russian businesses that need to stock these goods need to convert their Rubles to that foreign currency to make those payments.  With the Ruble worth increasingly little compared to those currencies, it because incredibly expensive for Russian shops to buy and stock those products and the cost gets passes to the consumer.

Then the cost of domestically produced goods will rise.  A good example being bread.  Since all of the components of bread are made in Russia from Russian labor and materials, it didn't get more expensive to produce, however due to imported good rising in price, it did just become more expensive for the local baker to live his life and buy the imported goods he needs and wants, so he will raise the price on his bread so he can make more rubles to continue to afford them.

On top of that then comes inflation which some economics are already projecting to be 20% or higher, which is absurdly massive. This will further devalue the Ruble internally driving up the cost of good as well across the board.

This is highly dependent on the Russian economy, ability to maintain logistics and resupply food and equipment to their troops, and ultimately the desire of the Russian people to improve their rapidly deteriorating material conditions (by overthrowing their government).

It's still way too early to be pessimistic and assume this conflict will drag out into years. Is it a possibility? Yes, but there are huge questions about the viability of Russia's economy and industrial capacity that will only be answered with time.

Does Russia have the *military* capacity to run a long campaign? Maybe. Logistics, industry, and economics are huge parts of this equation. You can't just look at troop numbers, or reported amount of equipment.

It is because EU had peace lasting since the end of ww2, it is becouse the eu countries are richer on average than middle east and Africa.

And it is for the very same reasons that pretty much all of the international organizations that uphold the world order are based in Europe, hag, Un, etc... All in Europe.

Europe is the only sub-continent that has after ww2 agreed that it is not worth going to war and that it should have peace, stability and prosperity.

It is for these reasons that Russia overstepped going into ukraine

The prisoners were starving for days and when an officer tossed a scrap of bread into the train, a fight broke out over it. A son ended up killing his mother over a small scrap of food.

* Nukes can be used to make a militarily bad situation neutral by employing them tactically (read blowing up troops). Russia is weak compared to NATO so Russia has a policy to use nukes tactically. The term that they use is 'escalate to de-escalate.'
* Such actions mean that the party that was in the superior position militarily with conventional forces is now at a disadvantage. You wipe out half my troops with a weapon I have but didn't use. Logically I should respond in kind to restore the previous tactical balance.
* This situation continues to escalate to the point where both parties may employ nukes on a theater wide level. Whole battalions are targeted as well as fleets. At this point the conventional military forces are just targets waiting to be picked off.
* The next logical thing to target is the production/industrial areas (read cities). This is what we no refer to as a counter-value strategy. From here the country that 'wins' is the one who can continue to fight after being nuked. Therefore, the only way to guarantee 'victory' is to obliterate your enemy.

The problem with deciding to stop at bullet point 3 is that you allow the opposing party to dictate terms after the conflict.

You don’t remember much about the collapse of the USSR because it really wasn’t covered the same way - no great optics to be shown. Mainly just uncertainty and really painfully dry political analysis that would’ve been lost to most of the public, let alone a grade-school kid.

Also, it’s interesting to contrast the founding event of CNN with the corresponding event that made Fox News, which was the invasion of Iraq. CNN largely covered it by broadcasting random talking heads, endlessly dispensing informative but dull headlines. But Fox News treated it like a Michael Bay film, with full-screen footage of tanks rolling through the desert and Geraldo Rivera in camo and shit. In retrospect, it’s really prophetic about the trajectory of both news outlets.

They gather 150k men as a show of force and only had supplies to deploy a small portion of them and not for a medium intensity war. They didn't provision for this. So they sent 80% of the men they gathered but can literally only provide provisions for a small portion. 

Then Russians initially didnt bother to secure their rear thinking Ukrainians would give up seeing a few tanks and a bunch of AFVs. They paid for it with majority of their supply convoys getting crushed. So now you have confused conscripts who were never told what their objective was and was only told of the invasion hours before they went in due of fears of their loyalty. By day 3 there was reports of teenage conscripts asking for food and fuel. 2 conscripts walked into a near by police station to ask for fuel thinking that they were in some peacekeeping mission and not at war with Ukraine, and got captured.

There's a video that surface from Russian conscripts that were abandoned for 3 days now told to sign a paper saying they were discharged from the Russian army several days ago so Russian army can say that's not their soldiers and not their problem. Here it is.

Yes, there is the threat of nukes. Does that mean we should sit back and watch millions of people be oppressed and slaughtered by Russian aggression?

No one wants WW3 and no one wants another genocide. We need to donate and support Ukraine as much as possible, but there has to be something more we can do.

Someone up in the thread suggested selling fighters to Ukraine for a really low sum (they said $1) and then just allowing pilots to become Ukrainian citizens. Then we can have NATO pilots and soldiers fighting in Ukraine without actually having NATO servicemembers fighting in Ukraine.

Will Putin buy that, no, but he's already saying that he's going to punish countries for providing arms to Ukraine and saying the west is threatening to use nuclear weapons. (Edit: pointing all this out to because Putin is obviously unhinged and dangerous, so he's making up enemies to continue escalating and rattling his saber.. I honesty wouldn't be surprised if he did use a nuclear weapon on a limited scale because he legitimately thinks he could get away with it, which is beyond disturbing.)

The term first arose during the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, a period from late February to March 2014, when such forces occupied and blockaded the Simferopol International Airport, most military bases in Crimea, and the parliament in Simferopol.

 >The Nigerian Civil War (6 July 1967 – 15 January 1970; also known as the Nigerian-Biafran War or the Biafran War) was a civil war fought between the government of Nigeria and the Republic of Biafra, a secessionist state which had declared its independence from Nigeria in 1967. Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, while Biafra was led by Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu. Biafra represented the nationalist aspirations of the Igbo ethnic group, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the federal government dominated by the interests of the Muslim Hausa-Fulanis of northern Nigeria.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

The Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine reported that Ukraine will not receive the scheduled $700 million IMF load before the end of 2020 because of the issue. IMF assessment teams had not visited Kyiv for eight months, which is necessary for further IMF loan tranches to be released.[111][112]

Finally I don't believe Putin to be in any way an admirer of Adolf Hitler? I think you see them both as autocrats and therefore to be equal in all ways. The world is not like this, and you show a complete lack of understanding of the motives of the Russian Federation by attempting to make the comparison.

Dugin is hugely influential but I don't believe the Russian Federation have swallowed his views whole. The [victory article from Russian state media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60562240) accidentally published early the other day gives a far more accurate window into Russian goals as per their actions. It's about destabilising what they call 'atlanticists' in order for Russia to retake what they see as its natural place as one of the poles of global power- along with India and China. Their idea is for these five (and maybe more in future, perhaps Brazil, Argentina or Mexico - or South Africa- can get their act together) to more evenly balance power worldwide than has been done by its centralisation in Washington and Brussels.",1646334178.0,1646331735.0,t3_t5xqnr,t1_hz7o5io,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

So in other words, US politicians would've had to create the domestic propaganda and indoctrination needed to justify to the Western public of the need to nuke their former ally's cities, after portraying the Soviet Union as a friend for most of World War 2. That's not something you can do in a short time.

Further, the Soviet Union already demonstrated resilience towards losing cities, as the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union showed. Nukes were not much better at destroying cities compared to carpet bombing. And more importantly, nukes were not missiles based in 1945 so you had to get bombers to those cities. The US had absolute air superiority over Japan. It did not over the Soviet Union, so large air losses were expected as the Soviet air force would've fought hard to prevent nuclear bombers from reaching their cities.

Secondly, who says it will be via missile? What if a bomb is dropped via bomber plane or other method? There are many ways to disguise nukes until it's too late.

He didn’t expect this level of resistance after the Russian Puppet Yushenko was “elected” in 2004, and Ukraine let him waltz in and take Crimea in 2014.  He probably felt Ukrainian resistance was softened.  Leaked plans were posted saying they expected this to last for 15 days.

Where did you get the idea that fallout lasts years?

Your just promoting kremlin talking points about how afraid we should all be.  I think you need to do some reading.

The idea that a nuclear exchange is completely unsurvivable only promotes unsafe activity in the event of an actual attack.  People should be encouraged to do actual things that can increase your survival such as, take cover in a sturdy room or basement in your house, avoid windows, stay indoors for ideally 2 weeks but at minimum 2 days after the blast to avoid fallout, only eat food that was indoors at the time of the blast.

Imagine if you are at the edge of the blast radius, now, if you take simple steps such as staying indoors, nothing would happen to you.

If you approach the same exact scenario with a pessimistic attitude that the world is going to end, so might as well watch the bombs drop, you are probably going to survive with some radiation burns and sickness.
