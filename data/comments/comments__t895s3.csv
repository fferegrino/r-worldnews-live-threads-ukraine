Day 11 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

The fighting today was especially intense. Aircrafts were flying around almost the whole day. All kinds of weapons were heard, there might have been a breach as we heard guns being fired, as well as tanks and airstrikes.

Starting from 11 pm extremely loud sounds of explosions were heard throughout the whole city, our building was shaking almost non-stop, it almost felt like windows were about to break from the shockwaves, thankfully they withstood them.

There’s still some distant sound of explosions and it has been 3 hours already since it started, now it’s mostly quiet, today was definitely the scariest day yet. As always we won’t know what actually happened until tomorrow, hopefully they won’t start again tonight so we can finally rest.

“President Vladimir Putin said again on Sunday the war will continue until Ukraine accepts his demands and halts resistance, dimming hopes for a negotiated settlement. Putin says Ukraine must “demilitarize” and he has made clear his goal is to remove the current government. 

In a call with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin also repeated his assertion that the “special military operation” he launched in Ukraine on Feb. 24 is going to plan, according to a Kremlin statement. 

A second failed attempt to create safe passage for some 200,000 civilians trapped in the besieged eastern port city of Mariupol only underscored the humanitarian disaster that’s unfolding in Ukraine. The United Nations said on Sunday that more than 1.5 million people have already fled the country since hostilities began. 

Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Putin in Moscow on Saturday, then flew onto Berlin to see German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Bennett spoke again with Putin on Sunday amid a flurry of phone calls by leaders to Putin and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the effort to de-escalate a conflict that promises to exact heavy costs for Europe and the global economy, as well as for Ukraine and Russia.

French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke with the Russian leader on Sunday to discuss the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants.

While Russia has committed almost all of the ground forces it assembled for the attack on Ukraine, it has been hobbled by poor planning and logistics. Still, it has yet to bring a fraction of its artillery, electronic warfare, drone and combat aircraft capabilities to bear.”",False,1646603209.0,t3_t895s3,t3_t895s3,,0,104,0,104,0,0,

People expected Putin to be the one going, ""well, what are you gonna do about it?"" as he invaded Ukraine and then possibly continued into Moldova and Georgia, safe in knowing that NATO wouldn't dare interfere fearful of nuclear war. Not entirely unlike how Hitler used the allied powers' fear of a repeat of the Great War to take whatever he wanted.



Instead, NATO has called his bluff and said, ""No, actually, we are going to interfere, quite heavily actually, what are you gonna do about it?""



Now Putin is the one stuck between a rock and a hard place. He threatened nuclear war so if he doesn't follow through on that threat he'll become the boy who cried nuke, but of course he can't actually follow through on his threat as it would mean his own death. 



Biden and the other western powers deserve high praise, they've stood up to Putin in a way the allied powers of the 1930s were too scared to do (and there wasn't even the fear of nukes back then), avoiding appeasement and focusing on deterrence may have very well saved us from WW3.

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechens! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender.

Thus far, US Intelligence have been basically spot on with their analysis of the war.

DOes that mean they've been basically all their missile/long range supply and only relegated to air strikes (when they dont have air superiority) and medium/close ground assaults?  


It seems like RUssia has one more massive push left and after that it's all emergency supply/reserves + mercenaries that they've called up that they werent planning to use.   


Russia is nearing the corner which no more ambition moves without taking on more drastic/scarier approaches to the war. What exactly is their approach now? Mandatory conscription on false flag pretenses via Martial Law? Pulling more troops out of defensive positions? Use of more lethal weapons?

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.


**In Ukraine**

👉🆕 Further air strikes against Kharkiv area with government buildings, a military law enforcement building and the city's TV tower among the reported targets. Regional authorities say that television and radio broadcasts in the city are currently knocked out

👉🆕 At least one more Russian aircraft has been shot down today, with an unidentified aircraft shot down over Kharkiv this evening by Ukrainian air defense units. Kharkiv's Mayor claims two aircraft were shot down over the city today. The pilot of one aircraft reportedly landed in the city's central district and military forces are searching for him

👉🆕 Borodyanka and Hostomel north of Kyiv have seen heavy shelling in the past few days, and Kyiv's regional military authorities ask for international aid as residents there and in other areas of Kyiv require supply of food and medical aid

👉🆕 Ukrainian former Defense Minister claims Ukraine has ""neutralized"" 46 000 Russian soldiers, either by killing them or seriously wounding them

👉🆕 Western and northwestern districts of Kyiv oblast continued to be attacked by heavy shelling during the day and afternoon. One of the shells hit a family in the midst of evacuating, in Irpin, killing two adults and two children. At least 8 people died in Irpin as a result of Russian artillery. Irpin's Mayor said evacuations will continue tomorrow

👉🆕 In an announcement, President Zelenskyy warned that Russia might be preparing to bomb the port city of Odessa, this based supposedly on maps and records obtained from captured prisoners

👉🆕 Further advancement of Russian forces towards Kyiv from the east are reported

👉🆕 While analysts disagree on exactly why the large Russian convoy north of Kyiv has been stalled, whether it's on purpose or due to logistical problems, all experts agree that the likelihood of a Kyiv encirclement in the coming days remains very high

👉🆕 Heavy artillery strikes continue to hit Chernihiv with all the city's districts being targets

👉🆕 Evacuations in Mariupol failed again with barely a few hundred managing to flee before Russian strikes resumed bombardment. The city has been without water and power for five days. A humanitarian convoy is supposedly on the way from Zaporizhzhia today according to Mariupol's Mayor

👉🆕 Kharkiv region has seen continued artillery attacks during the day with civilian losses up to almost 200 people since the conflict began

👉🆕 Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Mykolaiv oblast reportedly resulted in a lot of seized Russian military vehicles. The area contains a road to the country's biggest port Odessa which is of particular strategic concern for both Ukraine and Russia

](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t83ti0/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/hzmgvfi/)

>I doubt the ""Sergey Shoigu is planning a coup"" rumors are true (if so, why on Earth would Western sources leak it?), but I'm curious about one of the reasons I've seen debunking it.

>They say, because Shoigu is Tuvan (and not ethnically Russian), the people wouldn't accept him as a head of state. But Tuva spent the last century as a Soviet Socialist Republic, then a Soviet Autonomous Oblast, then a Russian federal republic, and in terms of language and upbringing he's certainly more Russian than Mongolian. Plus, the USSR had non-Russian heads of state (e.g. Stalin was Georgian, Krushchev was Ukrainian). I just can't see it being a dealbreaker for him-- am I wrong?

If there was a real election, being Tuvan [\(one of the Siberian steppe nomads\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvans) might be a problem for Shoigu. 

But the issue here isn't a fair election between Shoigu and an ethnic Russian candidate. 

If Shoigu stages a successful coup, by the time the Russian public learns about it, Shoigu has already:

1) Killed Putin. Really, Putin is too dangerous to keep alive under house arrest or in prison. 

2) Got the FSB (the new KGB) on his side. 

3) Got the military on his side, or at least staying neutral.

If I'm a Russian who likes not being in a work camp, and I find out that Shoigu's killed Putin (!!), PLUS has the FSB and military on his side, am I going to throw a fit because Shoigu was born on the steppes?  HELL NO! I'm scared to death of Shoigu and his faction now! 

I'm going to wait until official state media says Shoigu is in charge, and then I'm going to make a ""Long Live Sergey"" sign and make sure my neighborhood FSB informant sees me waving it around.",False,1646603469.0,t3_t895s3,t3_t895s3,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

Controlling the narrative and information that folks consume is a key part of war strategy. By war I mean a conflict between sides - could be an election, could be a policy, could be a literal shooting war like we are in today. 

By influencing the narrative you can help control the outcome. See Goebbels in WW2. 

Bots aren’t  some magical AI driven shit posting system. It’s folks paid to gain trust and spread a narrative. And a lot of the time they will agree with your thoughts and opinions, provide rational discussion, and facts. 

But every now and then they will sprinkle in propaganda. 

Why? You trust them. You talked before. You debated before. You know this random internet person. 

Really you don’t. 

Last year there was a piece on Twitter news accounts run by foreign governments publishing local news. Nothing untruthful - tweet the local news. All facts. Nothing malicious. 

When the time came to influence the discussion these Twitter accounts were primed to pump it out strategically. 

You know the account. It is trust worthy. It speaks the truth. It’s been around forever. 

Truth is the accounts existed to build up trust so they can be used when necessary.

“On Sunday, Ukraine’s defense ministry reported that eight cruise missiles hit Vinnytsia, about 250 km (155 miles) south west of the capital. Residents also fled Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, as it came under ground attack.

After a week in which Putin raised the alert status of his nuclear forces and his troops showed a willingness to risk radiation spillage by seizing nuclear power stations in live firefights, the stakes in the conflict only appear to be rising for both sides. 

Russia has increasingly brought indiscriminate weaponry to bear in its attempts to capture Kharkiv and Mariupol, in what some military analysts see as a likely warning to other cities not to resist. The widespread use of artillery and multiple launch rockets by an army that has the world’s most fearsome arsenal of such weapons would see civilian casualties soar. There has also been evidence of cluster bomb use, banned by most countries in civilian environments. Moscow says it is only targeting military assets.
 
Putin warned on the weekend that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine -– as Zelenskiy has asked of the U.S. and Europe -- would be seen as joining the conflict. He described Western sanctions as “akin to a declaration of war,” while adding “but thank God it has not come to that.”

NATO has repeatedly ruled out a no-fly zone despite the Ukrainian pleas, saying it risked bringing the alliance’s aircraft into direct confrontation with Russian planes, and thus setting off a broader war in Europe. 

Still, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said America was looking at whether Poland could supply Ukraine with more combat aircraft. 

A Polish official with direct knowledge of the matter said this could only potentially happen in the event the U.S. expedited replacement fighter jets to Warsaw, adding the government was also cautious of any action that could draw it into direct conflict with Moscow. Sending U.S.-made fighters to other countries is a process that can take years. It would require planes to be retrofitted for Poland and its pilots trained in flying them.

Blinken also said the U.S. was discussing with allies ways to impose an embargo on the purchase of Russian oil -- a major component of Russian budget revenues -- without disrupting global oil markets.

For Russia, its campaign faces growing risks should Ukrainian resistance continue. Logistical and operational “exhaustion” is likely to set in within three weeks, demanding a major resupply of Russian units, Michael Kofman, a specialist on the Russian armed forces at the Washington security think tank CNA, said in a Twitter thread. 

Speaking on a West Point Modern War Institute webinar, Kofman also said the initial Russian operation had been “shambolic.” Rather than follow doctrine and training, Russian commanders had broken up their forces into small detachments “to do thunder runs” into towns and cities that were expected to fall without a fight.

As a result they had little artillery, no air cover and overran the ability of logistics chains to resupply themselves. Putting all that back together to maximize Russian military power will take time, according to Kofman.  

Still, he cautioned against dismissing the Russian campaign as a failure. “It’s clear that this war will get a lot uglier and that the worst is yet to come,” Kofman said.”",False,1646603509.0,t3_t895s3,t3_t895s3,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

cb95236444aed69cdd034daae2a3ecdc,t895s3,hzmjv5z,"Putin has been saying for years that he wants another cold war. It’s the only way to get back leverage lost after the Cold War. He has specifically said so. The west should be given a heads up that there is a possibility Putin is going to provoke America and NATO into firing a shot so he is justified taking out the nukes and pointing them. Then he will have those Cold War tensions that he has been talking about. I think the west should be warned and even tell the Russian people that this is where we are heading. Appeal to the humanity of the Russian people. We shouldn’t go 40 years backwards in one week   


Look how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. “I want mutually assured destruction”. It’s the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they’re playing the long game. They figure in the long run it’s worth it. Which I disagree with. But it’s not about Ukraine

For Putin it’s a long game with his people’s livelihood. As it’s always been with communist leaders. 

If you watch from nine minutes on he explains that the only way to address this whole list of grievances he goes over in the first nine minutes is to re-shift the balance of power. And we do that through mutually assured destruction. His concept is that mutually assured destruction  is a balancing vehicle. So it would get Russia back some leverage it last and push America and the waist down.
He is upset that we put our missiles around his border. We claimed they were in the name of the fence. This is why he did the exact same thing and it was his main strategy going into Ukraine. Declaring independent like we did in Kosovo. Moving your forces in the name of peacekeeping. And he was just cheeky about it. The next step is to beat America into a war so he can have this bullshit crazy stand us. And keep his people blind and only sitting on his narrative

It doesn’t have to be a secret to work. It just needs a participant. It needs the west to fire a shot so they can look like the victim

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  

Next thing he will do is make more threats and escalate. Do things like look crazy like shoot out a nuclear power plant. Pretend to look crazy and not him self (KGB tactic). And then start to influence the right wing in America wanting to go to war to help. I’m sure whoever has influence has already done this did you notice Trump did a 180 and suddenly called it a holocaust? Then the next day Lindsey Graham said we should shoot Putin. Who gave them those ideas? Who put those in their heads?

We are trying to be manipulated into a war. It’s the only way Putin can do what he said he wanted to do. Without the nukes and somehow in his twisted mind getting back some leverage he thinks he lost

Thinking way, WAY ahead, the best case scenario here is for some form of continuation of the current nation of Russia. 

If Russia breaks apart you will be creating dozens of impoverished breakaway nations with nuclear armaments. Very different than the breakdown of the USSR - these nations will be poorer with less opportunity. Very dangerous. 

A negotiated disarming of Russia pre or post collapse is also a poor outcome. That leaves the West plus China as the remaining nuclear powers. That power is imbalanced. There is no MAD. It only takes one whack job president or prime minister to unilaterally lead to disaster. 

The best ending here is for Russia to NOT be broken up. That requires internal changes. Not war. Not external forces overthrowing the government. It requires a culture change or an internal coup.

«It has been six years since our troops entered Afghanistan; to confirm the slogan of ""glasnost"", it would be necessary to name the number of our losses (killed and wounded) and explain thanks to whose mistakes, incorrect forecasts, inaccurate information, short-sighted calculations we were involved in this adventure — paid for by young lives? After such an explanation, the continuation of this waste of people's blood would become impossible. At the congress of writers on this topic — not a word, not a sigh, not a hint. The boldest speeches against the project about the turn of the northern rivers, but in comparison with the Afghan problem, this is not courage, this is an absolutely risk-free occupation! What a shame!»

The 7th year of the war in Afghanistan

Romain Rolland
«For a year now, I have been sacrificing my peace, success and relationships with friends for the sake of fighting insanity and hatred. Absolutely all the articles I wrote brought me only insults in the countries where they were printed. On either side, I am faced with an equally monstrous misunderstanding. ... Everyone hears only their anger and endlessly insists on their rightness, not even trying to make it understandable to others. I tried to make everyone's rightness clearer, I tried to do the impossible»

Nikolai Turgenev
«The war! the war! At this name, a sensitive heart will shudder! The greatest evil of all earthly evils! Why are they fighting and shedding blood? They are chasing glory, empty glory. The most unprofitable peace is better than the most profitable, glorious war.""Oh, damn Bonapart! You alone were the cause of the shedding of rivers of human blood. How much the existence of one person can change on the globe!

Count Mikhail Vorontsov
«It is necessary, if only possible, to prevent a break with the Western powers, who, without risking anything, can do us terrible harm here, the pernicious consequences of which cannot be foreseen either the limits or the end. I also dare to think that the naval victory at Sinop and the brilliant deeds near Akhaltsikhe and beyond Arpachai can cover our honor and show Europe and the Turks themselves that it is not the fear of their weapons that forces you to agree to some unimportant concessions, but only the desire to end the war, so harmful to both sides and so dangerous for the whole of Europe»
January 30, 1854, letter to Emperor Nicholas I 4th month of the Crimean War

Franz Kafka
“At first I thought that sadness over Austria's defeats and fear of the future (a fear that basically seems ridiculous to me and at the same time vile) would prevent me from writing at all. This did not happen, I am only numb every now and then, and it must be constantly overcome. I have enough time for sadness besides writing. The train of thought associated with the war is painful, they tear me apart in all directions.”
September 13, 1914, diary of the 2nd month of the First World War

William Shearer
“I was standing on Wilhelmplatz when, around noon, the loudspeakers suddenly announced that England had declared war on Germany. About two hundred and fifty people stood quietly and listened attentively to the message. When it was over, I didn't hear a murmur from the crowd. People just froze in place. Like stunned. They were unable to realize that Hitler had plunged them into a new war. An official explanation had not yet been prepared for them, although by the end of the day such an explanation was simply ""the perfidy of Albion"", as it was in 1914.”

1812, diary of the 3rd month of the Patriotic War of 1812

Andrey Platonov
“Death. The cemetery of those killed in the war. And what should be, but has not been accomplished, comes to life: creativity, work, feats, love, the whole picture of life unfulfilled, and what would happen if it came true. It depicts what is, in fact, killed - not just bodies. A great picture of life and lost souls and possibilities. Peace is given, as it would have been under the activities of the dead - a better world than the real one: that's what perishes in war - the possibility of progress is killed there.”

&#x200B;

As a counterexample that illustrates just how important that is: US provided equipment, training, and weapons over the course of **20 years** to Afghanistan.   We provided more than sufficient resources for them to *crush* what was left of the Taliban on their own.

Putin has no way foward against the west. He can make threats if he wants but if he escalates too far he risks open Warfare with a Trained and Disiplined Military who can show them what a real Blitzkrieg is unlike their Blaytzkrieg they've been using in Ukraine.

However, it seems that Mariupol is in dire straits and cannot be held much longer, and then there is a fresh attack being planned on Kyiv in the coming days, and we have to see what will happen with the southern push still. 

It's still very possible that Kyiv might fall in the coming weeks and Zelenskyy himself will end up captured or killed.

People hide big fuckups if you come down on them too hard. This is a cultural problem ENDEMIC throughout the Russian armed forces. Combine this with the corruption and well, you see where this could go (see Komsomolets, Kursk and any other Russian nuclear disaster).

I point out the word 'heard' because as a Sonarman, he literally was listening to Russian fuckups happen in real time whilst stealthily tailing them. Back in the freaking 90's and 80's. Imagine how much worse they are now, nearly 30-40 years later? Same subs today as well.

I highly doubt the missiles are at the readiness level they actually need to be as well, and the strategic nuclear forces in Russia cannot possibly sustain this level of operational tempo. Fuck's sake, they have screwed up fueling ballistic missiles underway before, what's to say those skills haven't further atrophied under 30 years of corruption and negligence?

Disagree on some parts, agree on some. I don't think Putin is playing the long game for Russia at all. If he wanted Russia to become a superpower again he would need to stop looting it from inside. All he cares about is himself and his inner circle. He wants to keep Russia isolated and without western influence so he and his friends can continue looting and abusing ordinary Russians for their gain.

On that note though, I do agree that he does want to provoke a war with the west, that will help those goals and further his ability to keep a stronghold on Russia. They've already started wars twice in the recent decades to have an excuse to postpone elections and change the constitution to enable him to stay in power. Recent laws and blocking western media/internet is exactly what he needs to further cement his stranglehold.

This is a sharp contrast to Hitler for example, that actually did in his sick twisted mind have huge ambitions for Germany to become a superpower. In my opinion Putin doesn't give a shit, he's just in it for personal gain. China on the other hand, goes both ways. They legitimately want to become the next de facto superpower, usurping the US (not necessarily through conflict however). Their leaders are also looting the country for personal gain, but they are not allowed to do it on nearly the scale that Russia does. China will not allow corruption to get so bad that their military will become ineffective. It was getting close to that point but they have actually been cracking down on corruption in recent years because they know that it will weaken them and threaten their eventual goal as a nation. Russia has no goal as a nation other than to provide as much money for Putin's inner circle as possible, and to keep him in power. They have no idea what to do when Putin eventually dies. China will be able to eventually replace Xi without missing a step however.

Can you imagine Putin trying to crack down on corruption like Xi has done? The idea alone is laugable. He is the most corrupt person alive in this world today. By some estimates he's also quite likely the [richest person in the world](https://fortune.com/2017/07/29/vladimir-putin-russia-jeff-bezos-bill-gates-worlds-richest-man/).

Yes, it appears things are settling in a little with both sides (NATO and Russia) having come to an understanding. NATO will ship weapon systems and aid into Ukraine, but not actively participate. 

The longer this lasts, the more stable it gets. However, if Russia starts war criming even harder that will increase the pressure on NATO from their own citizen to interfere, led by a successful PR campaign from Zelenskyy.

Another destabilizing factor is if the Ukrainians hold and Russia fails to make any significant advancements. The more Putin loses face, the more he will feel the need to do something drastic, it seems highly unlikely that he would use non-conventional weapons based on just that, but I think it's going to be really tough for the world to look on and do nothing if Russia starts carpet bombing cities WWII style for instance.",False,1646611934.0,t3_t895s3,t1_hzn2kin,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Ultimately, you have no clue about geopolitics, and that WW3, while unlikely is entirely possible. All it takes is a miscalculation on either Russia or NATO.   


All it needs is Iran to move against Israel, or other competitors in the mid east. All it takes is India and China conflict taking a new form. All it takes is China moving in an even more threatening way on Taiwan. All it takes is Russia to use a tactical Nuke in Ukraine. All it takes is North Korea to decide to re-engage with the South.  


Any and all of the above are warm conflicts that can quickly and easily boil over. All it takes is Putin being pushed far enough against the wall that he decides to leverage his strategic deterrent weaponry.

Thanks for posting this.

I am interested in few aspects. 

First, the dissemination of propaganda on social media networks and the inherent trust users grant them. 

The feeling is that propaganda is ok as long as it puts the ""good guys"" in a positive light. When propaganda posts are shared on a subreddit that has a relatively high level of reputation then users will be more likely to not engage any critical thinking. It's immediately absorbed as truth. 

If we continue down to the live thread it takes that inherent reputation and causes users trust the information posted without much critical thinking as well except there's a new post or a new piece of information every minute or so.

Twitter allows completely unconfirmed information to come from ""reputable"" individuals but what is the next level up? Where do they get their information? Is it from Twitter too? Is it from the government?  No one knows. 

Without being political I believe this is the exact same manipulation technique used by trump and likely Russia during the 2016 election except it used Facebook as the platform for propaganda dissemination. The results shook the world. 

The responsibility of posting information to these flows is huge and yet we get hundreds(?) of posts a day to the thread? There's no way most of this information is confirmed before being posted and it spreads immediately across the world in 100ms from a source people have inherent trust in. Very spicy. 

Second, ""censorship"". I'm not talking about first amendment here. I'm talking about the ability for all humans to have a platform to say what they want. Period. Hard stop.

One of the best parts of the internet has always been the ability to get your news directly from multiple news sources so you can get multiple viewpoints and create your own perspective of what is true based on what you see/read/etc. This is called critical thinking.

I remember regularly going to al Jazeera to get that perspective during the second gulf War. It was very anti American and full of propaganda but it was useful. I used to be an RT viewer just like Euronews, and the BBC, etc. The same can be said about going to sources that may contain information and propaganda of the ""enemy"". 

By preventing people from getting the perspective of the ""enemy"" you create a huge gap of information that could be used to create a more complete ""truth"" of what's really going on.",False,1646610166.0,t3_t895s3,t1_hzmqyph,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Before the gas prices, I paid 13 gallons \* $3.00/gallon = $39 per tank of gas

&#x200B;

I simply consider paying $13 per week an acceptable cost for not having to store gasoline on my property, not even factoring in the cost of the barrels.

I'm seeing gasoline rated 55 gallon drums for $100 and you bought 4, which is roughly $400, but lets call it $300 in case you got a discount or something.

By buying the 220 gallons of gas at $3.00 beforehand, I'd be saving $13 per week, which means it'd take 23 weeks for that to pay off. ***EXCEPT*** that I go through 13 gallons of gas per week, which means I run out of the gas I bought in **17 weeks**, which means you spent more money than you needed to (in fact, in this particular instance, $78 or so).

If Russia spends $543K per head, then they've got about 112,000 troops (or less) that are US equivalent. So, no matter which way we cut it, at least half the troops in Ukraine are conscripts which are being paid roughly $30 USD per month (or were before the ruble crumbled, now it's more like $10 USD/month).

First, it would include economic assistance to Germany, and the Russians could not tolerate such aid to the enemy that had so recently devastated the Soviet Union. Second, Molotov was adamant in demanding that the Soviet Union have complete control and freedom of action over any Marshall Plan funds Germany might receive. Finally, the Foreign Minister wanted to know precisely how much money the United States would give to each nation. When it became clear that the French and British representatives did not share his objections, Molotov stormed out of the meeting on July 2. In the following weeks, the Soviet Union pressured its Eastern European allies to reject all Marshall Plan assistance. That pressure was successful and none of the Soviet satellites participated in the Marshall Plan. The Soviet press claimed that the American program was “a plan for interference in the domestic affairs of other countries.”

This isn't a case of Ukraine slowly being overrun as much as it is a costly battle of attrition with no clear ""victor"" in sight.  For all the Russian gains, they've lost a significant quantity of materiel and they can't replace it. Once they run out, they won't be overrunning anyone. Current loss rates favour Ukraine.

 The Russians are still advancing and have major combat groups near Kyiv who are relatively unscathed. That's their best chance at overrunning the Ukrainians and destroying enough of their forces to ensure a victory over their army. Ukraine likely doesn't have an equivalent force to counter them.   

The longer this goes on, the harder it will be for the Russians to continue advancing and it will give Ukraine more time to counter major Russian movements. Right now, Ukraine simply doesn't have the troops available to be everywhere at once. 

Eventually, Ukraine will start fixing and deploying their captured equipment, Russians will need to garrison captured cities, and Ukrainian forces will have finished mobilizing allowing them to relieve front line troops for counter attacks. Russia needs to finish this quickly.  Time really isn't on their side, but going fast is how they got into this predicament in the first place.  

Russia has sorted out SOME of their logistical challenges but not all. They have some long-term ones to solve as well.

 >Kievan Rus' or Kyivan Rus' (Old East Slavic: Роусь, romanized: Rusĭ, or роусьскаѧ землѧ, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę, ""Rus' land""), was a loose federation of East Slavic, Baltic, and Finnic peoples in Eastern and Northern Europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century, under the reign of the Rurik dynasty, founded by the Varangian prince Rurik. The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. The Rurik dynasty would continue to rule parts of Rus' until the 16th century with the establishment of the Tsardom of Russia.

In 2020 the US also grew natural gas production by 2%.

Oil production dropped under Trump and Biden because of Covid. Rigs had to close production and as the pandemic waned many didn't restart. Part of that was because the price of oil dropped, under Trump, so it wasn't financially beneficial to start back up production. With all that said, international prices went up last Summer, and rigs reopened and there was a production surge starting in November 2021.

While Russia has no money? Russia can't attack because NATO has the military might to prevent them from ever crossing the border. The no fly zone eventually announced will be Ukraine and any bordering NATO countries in their entirety. 


The full force of Russia's military would get steamrolled by NATO. With them currently bogged down in Ukraine, Russia has no chance. Putin does not want war with NATO. I'm not sure he attacks a NATO country but perhaps attempts to take down directly contributing no fly. 


So yes, while a nfz would seriously provoke Russia, I don't think they have the ability to make an offensive counterstrike against the world Supreme military power that thus far has been kicking their ass without sending in a single one of their troops. NATO's hand-me-down weapons are devastating Russia's army and nobody has even seen the kinds of futuristic weaponry the US has at its bleeding edge. 

WWIII and nukes almost seem like empty threats at this point. Russia has no military, economic, or political capital left. If anything a NATO enforced nfz might be Putin's out. If NATO is involved, Putin's government will end. He knows that.

 >Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov (Russian: Станисла́в Евгра́фович Петро́в; 7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who played a key role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident. On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm. .

Gas cars on the other hand are way less efficient than a power plant, because a car can't lug around 1 or 2 extra heat exchangers to increase efficiency.

> The United States, Russia, China, and Israel are not State Parties to the ICC. The powerful often escape accountability, while the powerless cannot. This has long been the perspective of many African countries, and underlies their challenges to the Court.

They have no way to actually go after war criminals in powerful countries.  If you have a UNSC veto vote, or are supported by a country with a UNSC vote, they can simply tell the ICC to go fuck itself and that's the end of that.  

The Geneva conventions are usually used as a tool by powerful countries to control weaker, non-ally countries.  Which is why Africa and the Middle East so often call the ICC racist.  

What do you think the ICC will actually do to Russia?  What have they done to Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians?  You think anything will ever come of that?  Syria isn't a member of the ICC, Russia has a veto vote and militarily backs Syria. The UN can't go in and any country that tries to topple Assad for justice invokes war with Russia.

""By all these gauges, intelligence on Afghanistan appears to have been catastrophically deficient, even though the US had a military and civilian presence on the ground in the country for the best part of 20 years. And, given the special intelligence relationship between the US and the UK this failure reflects badly on the UK as well – both on the quality of intelligence the UK itself may have gathered in Afghanistan, and on the extent of our dependence on the US for intelligence-gathering.

If this were the only intelligence failing of recent years, then maybe a little indulgence could be shown. Collecting intelligence in Afghanistan cannot be easy; the landscape, the regional and tribal divisions, and the still simmeriing armed conflict are all complicating factors. But the whole purpose of intelligence is to penetrate the dark recesses of a country; otherwise everyone in government could sit back, study news reports and other open sources of information, and save taxpayers quite a lot of money.""

I mean people can call each other or text each other. Is The next step to cut Office Depot from the west entirely? Does he think he can play Kim Jong-un? Does he think the wealthy and even oligarchs do not see what’s happening? Does he not fear the wife of his former mentor who he had murdered? Whatever she has hidden in a book stored away, as she suggest? The fact that he thinks any of this is a good idea shows he’s a little bit delusional. But I don’t think he’s mad and crazy and the logical. He’s being logical according to his history and his mindset. But there is no logical good outcome for this for anyone in the world if we want to go down this road


He is painting the narrative. The moment NATO takes a shot he says see? I told you NATO is all across our borders threatening us and now they’re attacking us. And then he escalates. He tries to paint himself the victim and justify to his people why he was willing to risk their lives and livelihood for decades to come.

In many ways it’s mad. And I think he’s overestimating how much fear and compassion can be manipulated in this day and age. It can be highly manipulated but not to the degree I think he was counting on. I don’t think he was counting on a lot of this reaction. I mean places like visa and MasterCard pulling out? Sure China can step in and use their networks. If anything this will make Russia more dependent on China. But he’s going to try to act born more crazy. He’s going to try harder and harder to make it so the west cannot help but get involved because it is such a humanitarian crisis or it’s so terrifying to stand by and watch.


The way I see it is this. Putin is beating me up in order to get America to join in the fight. But all America can do is stand in route and give me some medical supplies and some bombs. Putin can beat me up and kill my family and every time anyone wants to do anything he can without a gun and threaten everybody. But the moment the west shooter shot, he’s going to whip out the jihad vest with a nuclear bonus  - and he will try to terrorize the world into making these concessions. And he will justify it saying C Dash they attacked us just like I said they would all these years. I think he’s in over his head trying to paint this narrative the way he wants it to go. But I do believe if Trump was in office he would’ve more easily baited him into firing a shot. Into threatening his country. He would play on his macho Ness and get him involved much quicker. And I expect Trump we will begin more and more saying we should go to war and if he was in office he would have obliterated Russia. Which is ridiculous considering MAD


Couldn’t we at least get over Covid first? This sucks no matter which way he’s playing it and which way it goes. But I would be willing to bet my house that he is trying to get the west involved.


It doesn’t matter if you tell someone your plan so long as it works. And in fact it justifies his narrative “I told you so. I warned you and warned you that you were threatening my country‘s national security. We had no choice.

2. Most of Ukraine's southern defenses were clustered around two areas: the Donetsk/Luhansk frontline near Mariupol, and the Dneipr River running through the center of the country. This allowed Russia to make more early gains before reaching the robust defenses of Mariupol and Kherson.

-Punitive sanctions don't have a history of inciting revolt. We have levied harsh sanctions many times in history, against Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, the list goes on, and not a single time has that caused the populace to rise up. In fact, the anger over the sanctions can easily be channelled outwards.
