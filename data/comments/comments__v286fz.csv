“Our defenders show extreme bravery, despite the fact that Russia has a substantial advantage in force and weapons,” Zelensky said, “We want all of our people liberated but it needs to be done with caution.”

Zelensky also applauded the new sanctions package approved by the European Council, which would cut down on imports of Russian oil, as well as suspend Russia propaganda channels and remove Sberbank from SWIFT, the international bank messaging system.

“I am thankful for everyone to reach this agreement,” Zelensky said, “It will leave Russia at the outskirts of the world economy. Russia will not be able to adapt and this means it will be defeated.”",False,1654058828.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,113,0,113,0,0,
d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,v286fz,iaqz8g6,"Senior US administration officials confirmed to reporters on Tuesday that the United States will be sending Ukraine US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, as part of the country's 11th package of security assistance to Ukraine. 

The officials said the HIMARS will be equipped with munitions that will allow Ukraine to launch rockets about 80 kilometers (49 miles).

Some context: That is far less than the maximum range of the systems, which is around 300 kilometers (186 miles), but far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. The M777 Howitzers the US sent to Ukraine last month, for example, marked a significant increase in range and power over previous systems, but even those top out at around 25 kilometers (18 miles) in range.

Further weapons: The new security assistance package, to be announced officially on Wednesday, will also include air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank weapons, anti-armor weapons, artillery rounds, helicopters, tactical vehicles, and spare parts to help the Ukrainians continue maintenance of the equipment, the officials said.

CNN previously reported that US officials were debating for weeks whether to send Ukraine the advanced rocket systems, because they can strike so much further than any weapons they already have. The weapons’ long range, technically capable of striking into Russian territory, raised concerns that Russia might view the shipments as provocative. 

The officials said on Tuesday that the US is “not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders,” and is “not seeking to prolong the war.”

They also said they had received assurances from Ukraine that they would not use the systems to launch attacks inside Russia. But they emphasized that as the conflict evolves, the US will “continue to tailor” its assistance to Ukraine’s most urgent needs. 

The officials also said the new rocket systems will help put Ukraine “in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table” with Russia, and reiterated that the US will “not pressure the Ukrainian government in public or in private to make any territorial concessions.”",False,1654056978.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,99,0,99,0,0,

Interesting piece:

*Just over a week ago I published a translation of a very long account posted in the Russian internet space by a young-ish volunteer, Viktor Shayga, from Belgorod, Russia, who served in Ukraine on a contract in April this year. He was stationed near Izyum and took part in several attempts by Russian forces to capture Dolgen’koye settlement. In his account, he provided a lot of insights into the internal structure of the Russian volunteer corps currently fighting in Ukraine.*

*Viktor has become quite active on his livejournal page after the recap of his experience gained significant popularity, sharing a lot of… opinions, which are mostly not worthwhile spending any time on. However, I found this particular text quite interesting as he shares his view on when the second stage of the ‘Special Military Operation’ might end, so decided to spend a few hours making it available to my audience.*

*I’d consider taking some of the things he’s saying with a grain of salt – after all, he was just an infantry, and his discussions are likely to be less valuable than him directly summarising his personal experiences ‘in the field’ – but in the following text, he provides those too. Besides, he does have a bit of this ‘I know everything’ vibe which may not be so constructive, but nevertheless, the things he says appear to be quite close to what many experts with years of knowledge would presume.*

From CNN's Anna Chernova

The US is ""adding fuel to the fire"" by supplying weapons to Kyiv, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday in response to President Joe Biden’s decision to provide more advanced missile systems to Ukraine.

""We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire,"" Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call.

The Ukrainian authorities have long asked the United States to supply high-tech, medium-range rocket systems. Biden said Tuesday the US is providing Ukraine ""more advanced rocket systems and munitions"" as its war with Russia grinds on.

""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership’s willingness to resume peace negotiations,” Peskov said.

Peskov also added the Kremlin does not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's words that Kyiv would not use multiple launch rocket systems to attack the Russian territory if they receive them from the US.",False,1654086433.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

>Two key terms that we need to understand for this thread. Mass and economy of force. Mass: The purpose of mass is to concentrate the effects of combat power at the most advantageous place and time to produce decisive results (JP 3-0).

> Economy of force: is the judicious employment and distribution of forces so as to expend the minimum essential combat power on secondary efforts to allocate the maximum possible combat power on primary efforts (JP 3-0).

> What we have observed is that Russian General Staff (for all intents the command controlling this fight) is incapable of planning, staffing and executing operations across all of 🇺🇦 and can only handle a small front (~50km) with at most a half a dozen BTGs.

> As such the tactic Russia is relaying on is massive artillery strike and throwing huge amounts of troops to an objective with simple maneuvers in a small front. We have yet to observe concurrent theatre wide offensives in multiple fronts (Kherson and Iyzum for example).

> To achieve success, they simply outnumber 🇺🇦 on a 7:1 ratio to overwhelm the defenders. This is simply not sustainable in the long run. Furthermore, to achieve a 7:1 ratio, 🇷🇺 must pull forces from other fronts risking 🇺🇦 counteroffensive (as seen in Kharkiv and now Kherson).

> Now, is a 7:1 ratio proper use of economy of force? Absolutely not. You’ve probably heard of the typical 3:1 ratio for offense. This is a good ratio for planning purposes but to clarify, you can achieve 3:1 by having more modern equipment, fires etc. It isn’t only a number game.

> For example, if I have 1x T-55, I don’t need 3x M1A2s. 1x M1A2 will clearly destroy 3x T-55 ensuring you meet the 3:1 ratio. Also, the 3:1 ratio generally assumes you are conducting a deliberate attack against a deliberate defense. But Russia is likely conducting hasty attacks.

> A hasty operation is an operation in which a commander directs immediately available forces, using fragmentary orders, to perform tasks with minimal preparation, trading planning and preparation time for speed of execution (ADP 3-90).

> A deliberate operation is an operation in which the tactical situation allows the development and coordination of detailed plans, including multiple branches and sequels (ADP 3-90).

> Because 🇷🇺 is rushing its offensive we can consider it hasty and 🇺🇦 has had 8 years to prepare so it is deliberate. As such 🇷🇺 likely needs (in a normal scenario) around ~3.5:1. But 🇷🇺 and 🇺🇦 have similar equipment as such 🇷🇺 needs to commit more personnel to succeed.

> So why is 🇷🇺 committing up to 7:1 to achieve limited success? Simple: they have shown they cannot operate as a tactically proficient army. All they can do is commit such high numbers to win because they have nothing else to offer.

> So although 🇷🇺 is learning to achieve mass, they resoundingly fail in economy of force. Also, this model is simply unsustainable in the long run as attrition will continue to reduce their effectiveness forcing 🇷🇺 to send higher ratios to go on the offensive.

> Furthermore, as stated earlier, these offensives are very limited in scope and area of operation and after an initial success we generally see 🇺🇦 mounting effective defense and limited counterattacks as 🇷🇺 casualties mount lowering their favorable force ratio.

> In summary, the way 🇷🇺 is succeeding in the Donbas also shows it’s limitations. Unless 🇷🇺 does a mass mobilization or 🇺🇦 defense collapse (unlikely) we are likely seeing the first signs of a protracted fight with reduced 🇷🇺 offensives. This war looks like will go on for a while.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,v286fz,iasdqyf,"White House says new security assistance to Ukraine meets the country's needs
From CNN's Betsy Klein

The White House defended its decision to send Ukraine new rocket systems that fall short of the 200-mile range Ukrainians requested, saying the US assessed that the 49-mile-range systems were what the country needs at this time in a new phase of battle. 

""We have tried to get the Ukrainians exactly what we think they needed to be able to fend off this Russian assault on their country. That worked in the early days, the Ukrainians were able to win the battle for Kyiv and drive the Russians away from their capital, now the conflict has shifted to a different phase in the south and east of the country,"" deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN’s John Berman. 

The new weapons will add to Ukraine’s capability, Finer said, and it “will give them the ability to strike with precision Russian targets on the battlefield.”

As CNN has reported, the Biden administration will be sending Ukraine US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS. The HIMARS will be equipped with munitions that will allow Ukraine to launch rockets about 80 kilometers, or 49 miles. That is far less than the maximum range of the systems, which is around 300 kilometers, but far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date.We believe that this does meet their needs,” Finer said when pressed on Ukraine’s request for longer-range systems. 
The US, he added, has asked Ukraine “for assurances that they will not use these systems to strike inside Russia” and instead to defend Ukrainian territory. 

Finer also reacted to reaction from Russia Wednesday morning that the US action is “adding fuel to the fire.”  

The US, he said, does not negotiate its security systems packages to Ukraine. 

“Russia has brought this on itself by launching an invasion into a sovereign country from its territory. So we've been very clear and transparent about what we're going to be doing. It has been effective for the Ukrainians thus far and we will continue,” he said. 
He declined to comment on Russian gains in the eastern Donetsk region, calling this a “very difficult phase of fighting.” This phase, Finer predicted, will play out “over a period of weeks and months and perhaps even longer.” 

The Russians have made “incremental gains,” he said, but declined to “handicap the play-by-play.”",False,1654092560.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

May 31, 2022 - Press ISW  
  
Moscow’s concentration on seizing Severodonetsk and Donbas generally continues to create vulnerabilities for Russia in Ukraine’s vital Kherson Oblast, where Ukrainian counter-offensives continue. Kherson is critical terrain because it is the only area of Ukraine in which Russian forces hold ground on the west bank of the Dnipro River. If Russia is able to retain a strong lodgment in Kherson when fighting stops it will be in a very strong position from which to launch a future invasion. If Ukraine regains Kherson, on the other hand, Ukraine will be in a much stronger position to defend itself against future Russian attack. This strategic calculus should in principle lead Russia to allocate sufficient combat power to hold Kherson. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has chosen instead to concentrate all the forces and resources that can be scraped together in a desperate and bloody push to seize areas of eastern Ukraine that will give him largely symbolic gains. Continuing successful Ukrainian counter-offensives in Kherson indicate that Ukraine’s commanders recognize these realities and are taking advantage of the vulnerabilities that Putin’s decisions have created.",False,1654101979.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

But one of the things that caused Russia a lot of worry was Turkey selling the TB-2's to Ukraine was beginning to change the theatre in the Donbas, because launching things from Buks or S-300 systems from Russia into Ukraine was a non option at the time especially after MH-17 was shot down. So these drones allowed precision destruction of artillary and other assets. Also it was understood that the militias of the DPR and LPR had been effectively replaced by the Russian armed forces under the guise that they were militia. So Russian soldiers and equipment kept getting picked off by a weapon Minsk 2 technically allowed.


At the same time legislatively Ukraine's government was trying to force a peaceful end to the war by passing legislation that granted a extended separate legal status to the LPR, DNR regions. One thing that did though was it required Ukraine to administer the local elections. Puppet governments don't tend to do well with third parties running fair elections. So it was rejected by Ukranian nationalists as ceding defacto control to the separatists/Russia, and by the separatists and Russia for being a sham way for Ukraine to unilaterally break Minsk 2, and regain control over the regions. The law was abandoned in January to try to avoid war. But it didn't prevent it.


Ukraine had 8 years to gain a modernized military and fight corruption and finally had the upper hand and Russia wasn't just gonna let that slide.

From CNN’s Oren Liebermann and Arnaud Siad

The United Kingdom will send multiple-launch rocket systems to Ukraine to help defend itself against Russia, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.

Britain will send M270 launchers able to strike targets up to 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) away, offering “a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainian forces,” according to a statement from the British Foreign Office.

The move has been “coordinated closely” with the United States decision to provide Ukraine with its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) – a variant of the multiple-launch rocket systems that will be gifted by the UK, the statement added.  

“The UK stands with Ukraine and has taken a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country,” Wallace said.

“As Russian’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against Russia’s brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities,” he added.

The British government also said that Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, so the effectiveness of the launchers can be maximized.",False,1654137742.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Day 98 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled a couple times, mostly in the evening. They shelled us a bit around 8pm and then again at midnight, but it was somewhat weird. There were just two very loud explosions nearby and that’s it, so most likely it wasn’t MLRS, it might have been a cruise missile, or maybe a 2S7 Pion. After those explosions a fire started somewhere, no idea where, but we couldn’t see it from our windows.

They also continue shelling a lot of the settlements in Kharkiv oblast every day, and the closer it is to the front, the worse the shelling gets. They fired missiles at Merefa yet again, I don’t know why they do it almost every day, but they must really hate it for some reason.

The fact that HIMARS finally got approved is really great, and it looks like we will get some M270 too, they are much better than any MLRS we have right now. Having experienced soviet MLRS firsthand from Russians shelling us, I can definitely say that they are very inaccurate, and not very powerful compared to US MLRS. 

During the shelling that broke the roof of my apartment building and blew out my windows, the rockets from that one salvo were landing very randomly, hundreds of meters apart from each other. Those MLRS are very unreliable, so M142/M270 will help us greatly, especially with their far greater range and almost pinpoint accuracy.",False,1654132938.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,97,0,97,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Moscow’s focus on seizing the eastern city of Severodonetsk, and the Donbas region more generally, puts its vital position in the Kherson region at risk, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has said.

“If Russia is able to retain a strong lodgement in Kherson when fighting stops it will be in a very strong position from which to launch a future invasion,” the ISW said in its latest campaign assessment, adding that if Ukraine were to regain the region, it would be in a much stronger position to defend itself against a future attack.

The institute said that this strategic situation should lead Russia to concentrate its combat power on holding Kherson, but Russia’s president has instead chosen to “concentrate all the forces and resources that can be scraped together in a desperate and bloody push to seize areas of eastern Ukraine that will give him largely symbolic gains”.

“Continuing successful Ukrainian counter-offensives in Kherson indicate that Ukraine’s commanders recognise these realities and are taking advantage of the vulnerabilities that Putin’s decisions have created,” the ISW said adding. It added that Ukrainian forces were now withdrawing from Severodonetsk, allowing Russian forces to move in “relatively quickly

China has barred Russia’s airlines from flying foreign-owned jetliners into its airspace, the Russian news outlet RBK has reported. The move came after Putin threw the aircraft’s ownership into doubt by allowing them to be re-registered in Russia to avoid seizure under sanctions over Moscow’s attack on Ukraine.

The European Union, home to major aircraft leasing companies, banned the sale or lease of aircraft to Russian carriers in February. Putin responded by approving the re-registration measure in March, which prompted suggestions foreign owners may never recover planes worth billions of dollars.

China’s air regulator asked all foreign carriers last month to update ownership information and other details, RBK said, citing two unidentified sources. It said Russian airlines that could not provide documents showing their aircraft were “de-registered abroad” were barred from Chinese airspace

But the sale of the General Atomics-made drones could still be blocked by Congress, according to the report, and there is also a risk of a last-minute policy reversal that could scuttle the plan.

The Kremlin has accused the US of ""adding fuel to the fire deliberately"" after Washington said it would supply Ukraine with advanced missile systems.

""Such supplies"" do not encourage Kyiv to resume peace talks, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that Washington wanted to ""fight Russia to the last Ukrainian"".

The US agreed to provide the precision-guided missiles, which can reach targets as far as 70km (45 miles), after gaining assurances that the weapons would not be used to attack targets inside Russia.

Ukraine's President Zelensky has said his country has ""no intention"" of doing so.

Earlier, Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said the planned delivery of these new weapons to Ukraine increased the risk of drawing the US into direct conflict with Russia.

""Any arms supplies that continue... increase the risks of such a development,"" the state news agency RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.

***So why don't we think about what Ukraine's summer offensive may look like??***


*So what is the situation going to look like?*

Much like what it is now. Russia will be further degraded militarily (seriously I still can't get over the T-62s - lol). The terrain will be a little more dry, so slightly more chance of better manoeuvre warfare but still nothing amazing from Russia...

The state of their military is a joke. For an interesting look at this I suggest Perun's video on corruption and the Russian military - [https://youtu.be/i9i47sgi-V4](https://youtu.be/i9i47sgi-V4)


*What is Ukraine's goal?*

Pretty easy - get Russia the flip out of Ukraine. They'll likely want to break the Eastern theatre and the Southern theatre in some manner by the end of Summer. They'll hope to be in a good position to begin smaller scale mop-up efforts during Rasputitsa part 2 in Autumn.


*How will they go about it?*

Most likely at least 2 big combined arms (ground force heavy, air support light) pushes with a few branching ones to tie up enemy forces. The reason I think that 2 pushes are likely is that while concentration of force is an important thing on the battlefield, Russia is stretched from all appearances. So if you make 2 big efforts, while one may be blunted, the other has a higher chance of success.

It purely depends on how much equipment they have as to how big and branching each push is.

The areas where we are most likely to see such efforts are:

1. E-NE of Kharkiv

2. Melitopol

3. Kherson

4. Izyum

5. Sievierodonetsk

Despite what is happening around 5. I actually think 1. to 4. are far more likely. I've been saying this for a long time but I honestly think a push South to Melitopol is a bold move. I don't know all the conditions and things on the ground but from a logistics and strategy perspective such a move threatens Crimea, Kherson and SE areas such as Berdyansk and Mariupol areas.

Kherson and Izyum look like really tough places to retake from a terrain perspective thanks to Rivers and Urban areas.

Either way, when Ukraine does decide it's time to move, expect heavy fighting right across all theatres as they will want to try and confuse Russia as much as possible as to where their main effort is. And if nothing else Ukraine has been very transparent with how it sees the Summer going.

I'm heavily biased on Melitopol, it's been my dark horse advance for a long time as strategically it threatens the entire Southern Theatre and makes retaking Kherson much easier.

But I think we'll see Ukraine's main effort somewhere in the East, most likely East of Kharkiv as there are major Russian supply lines running North-South to the Izyum area. If you can break Izyum you basically ruin any hope of Russia taking Sievierodonetsk.

I don't think Sievierodonetsk will be a major push; too much of a chance to end in a stagnant fight and it's easy enough to continue to run Defence to hold Russian forces in place with a few more reserves.


**Wrap-up**

Does any of this have any evidence? Not really, no. This is Armchair Analysis at its finest. I'm not on the ground, I don't have information that's not freely available on open source, particularly on Ukrainian logistics and supplies in key areas so any planning or analysis is purely speculative. Often what you can grasp in a war is defined by how easily you can get eat, drink and bang.

The only evidence we've got to date is that Kharkiv has been bold in kicking Russia's arse and has consistently sallied forth, often out to the border since the beginning of the invasion. It's also dangerously close to important supply routes so expect something from them when the time comes.

I suppose my bottom line is something like - 2 big advances with small branches, 1 E-NE of Kharkiv and with one around Kherson, or my dark horse pick - South to Melitopol. (I know, I know, I'm fixated but strategically it's a gold mine).

Whatever happens, June-August is going to be really interesting to watch.

I'm hoping next time I go to do a write-up that Ukraine is in a place where I can theorycraft the crap out of a liberation of Crimea... But in all honesty I expect Russia will still be in a chunk of Ukraine come late August - but a guy can always dream.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-61597405

I say 'knotty' because, speaking as somone who's dabbled in lecturing, I've often played devil's advocate in classes I've taught. 

On the other hand, you need to strike an often tricky balance between provoking discussion and sounding like you're in favour of some of the positions you're articulating.

Let me give you an example - ""the Warren Cup **(do not look it up)** reflected the mores and attitudes of the time it was made. Holding it to our standards denies this broader context.""

Then I'd say, ""but what do you think? Is that a position you can agree with, or do you think morality dictates this is obscene? But doesn't morality change and evolve over time? Or are there things that are inherently wrong? If so, why?""

(Then I'd point out that, on a personal level, the Warren Cup icks me out on many levels. But the aim is to get the little gits talking, and keep them talking. Even the ones with a hangover.)

From the information in the article, it seems the lecturer went beyond this and was actively trying to spread old school tankie bullshit. His ""teach the controversy"" argument is also bad faith. 

This also highlights the dangers of the UK government's obsession with ""Spree Feach"" on campuses. It will simply open the floodgates of bullshit, propaganda and misinformation, though given who's in charge of the government, and who's funding them, this may not be an accident.",False,1654079665.0,t3_v286fz,t3_v286fz,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

People want to think of the UN as a sort of bigger meta-government but it really isn't. It only has whatever power the member states voluntarily give to it.

The reason why the league of nations proved useless is that they could vote all the things they wanted through, but any country that had the power to do whatever it wanted could leave and ignore their protests. The Nazis just left the forum and went ahead with world conquest.

Without the arms and the will to confront countries that don't go ahead with the institution, the institution's votes and decisions are worthless. This means that all the powerful countries in the UN become its army, which isn't something those countries are interested in being.

That's how you got the security council, the countries that were strong enough to matter got a seat at the table in order to guarantee that the UN will always be relevant because when the UN decides something it will be backed by the strong of the world. The flip side is that unless the strong are on the same side UN can't do much.

Now let's imagine that the USSR position was not inherited and Russia could not block anything in the UNSC. It would not be any smaller of a country or any weaker of a country and any decision that went against it could be bypassed by simply quitting the UN and telling the world to suck its nukes.

The fact of the matter is that the UN is a little more then a rubber stamp on agreements between a majority of the world and the Great Powers. It has the diplomatic aura of having followed the rule-based process for deciding how the world will function and how things will be resolved. But besides those airs, it is nothing, because it can't stop the US if the US wanted to go in and shoot the Russians out of Ukraine and it can't get the Russians out itself.

The UNSC didn't matter when Bush invaded Iraq, it doesn't matter now, Russia being there and saying ""nope"" is the alternative to Russia leaving and nothing happening besides China blocking things for them and stern letters being written if the Chinese were on our side.

The point of the UNSC and the UN is that the countries that can tell the world to go fuck itself due to nukes, economy and population get a seat on the UNSC to keep them talking and engaged diplomatically.",False,1654102211.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iasqd6g,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Clarification here.

When NASA had the Hubble mirror made the NRO went to the mirror manufacturer and ask them to make a number of extra mirrors but with a shorter focal length. They basically used the Hubble supply chain to create an unknown number of additional space telescopes of which parts of 2 were gifted to NASA.

In 2012 the NRO told NASA it basically had two Hubble sized mirrors (shorter focal length) and enough components to assemble one nearly complete space telescope located in a warehouse that was due to be demolished and that NASA was welcome to take them. The mirrors weren't specifically 'better' than the Hubble's, they're just different and didn't contain the initial flaw that required the addition of more optics.

NASA has received funding to create a space telescope based on this old NRO equipment which it's calling [the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Grace_Roman_Space_Telescope) This scope is planned for launch in 2027 and will reside at L2 near the JWST.

Given that the mirror is the same size as Hubble's but at a shorter focal length, one might think the pictures that will result would be lower resolution. Not so. The latest wide field imaging camera on the Hubble is about 16 megapixels while a comparable camera on the NGRST will be 300 megapixels. So we may see similar quality and detail as the photos from the Hubble but over a much wider area.

Plus we've got a couple of decades of experience with the HST so we might be able to address some of the equipment issues before launch. Important since we'll never be able to service it at L2.

The remaining unused mirror will likely be destroyed, or put in a museum, or someone may attempt to use it terrestrially.",False,1654083299.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iars6qs,,1,38,0,38,0,0,

 >The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a light multiple rocket launcher developed in the late 1990s for the United States Army, mounted on a standard Army M1140 truck frame. The HIMARS carries six rockets or one MGM-140 ATACMS missile on the U.S. Army's new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton truck and can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM). HIMARS ammunition is interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1; however, it is only able to carry one pod rather than the standard two for the M270 and A1 variants. The launcher is C-130 transportable.

>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO and NATO Allies are, of course, monitoring very closely what Russia does, including their nuclear exercises.

And then we also remind Russia on the fact that actually as late as in January, they agreed in the UN a statement where they stated clearly that a nuclear war cannot be won and should not be fought. So Russia knows that any use of nuclear weapons would totally change the nature of a conflict, and therefore, nuclear weapons should not be used.

>Ukraine is expected to receive a so-called Iris-T SLM fire unit: This configuration with three launchers, a radar vehicle and a command vehicle can shoot down enemy aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles up to an altitude of 20 kilometres and a range of up to 40 kilometres. This makes the system more powerful than the basic Iris-T SLS configuration, which is designed for a range of up to twelve kilometres. Such a fire unit could be used to protect a large city, as announced by the Chancellor.

>The delivery of this system to Ukraine should be possible comparatively quickly: Diehl has already delivered fire units to Egypt and is currently preparing another fire unit for the North African country. This system could probably be diverted; Egypt would receive a later delivery. Currently, the company's production capacities are designed for two such fire units per year; however, they could be increased to three to four fire units - depending on whether all components for the system can be procured.

It is unlikely to matter if those images come from Kherson, Donetsk, Sevastopol, Belgorod, or Rostov.  Very few Americans can place any of those places on a map.  

We, USA, always shoot at supply and staging areas.  3CI (command control communication intelligence) deep in enemy territory is usually the opening shot.  A tomahawk missile or B2 bomber strike is normally done before escalating to some sort if ground engagement.  

In the words of the late secretary Albright ""the United States does not tolerate the use of human shields"".  It would be prudent for Ukraine to hit lots of clear military targets before taking any risks.  Ukraine should train extra crew redundancy so that there is an easy option to discipline crews if there is a mistake.  

The difference between 1 km east or west of a border will not matter much at all.  It is possible that Russia will try to make an issue of it.  That may get a rise out of people already listening to Russian propaganda.  

I am one American. I am not in favor of killing anyone.  If blowing up supply and staging areas reduces the death of Russian conscripts then that is a good thing.  I do not like the idea of Ukrainian cities like Donetsk suffering siege or bombardment.  Donetsk is filled with people that i do not know personally same as Odessa or Lviv.  

If risky shots are taken it is better to do it with guided munitions than with 152mm or grad launchers.  It is the risky shot that risks consequence.

Severodonetsk has no strategic value, and there are two reasons they're still trying to hold it.

There is another town nearby, Lysychansk, which is on a small hill overlooking Severodonetsk and separated from it by the river Siversky Donets. There are three bridges across that river, two of which have been destroyed and one badly damaged. Ukrainian army is going to stall the Russians in Severodonetsk for as long as possible and then fall back to Lysychansk, and assaulting that town will be significantly more difficult for the Russians.

Lets try a 15 kiloton little boy (Dropped on Hiroshima) on Kharkiv.  We will do an Air burst to avoid fallout \~.  With that we can see that the city center is gone.  The inner suburbs took a big hit but people are probably ok, and that's it.  Now in Hiroshima 150,000 people died.  Kharkiv is much more dense, but a lot of people are out of town ATM, and the subway system / bomb shelter is actually designed for a small nuke.  What's the casualty rate?  No clue.

It's also easy to see the radius is about 5 kilometers for 3rd degree burns.  That's probably everyone not in a tank, and honestly tanks are popping their tops.  So you could blast a big hole with one or two of these.  Russia has about 2,000 tactical nukes, and they could range from 1 kiloton to 800 kiloton in size.  They could end the front line quickly by targeting troops outside of cities.  But to use them to take cities would defeat the purpose of invading Ukraine (to take stuff).

It is also about preserving the credibility of security assurances, which could contribute to preventing nuclear proliferation in the future.

One option would be, since it's got a valid non-Russian registration and isn't marked as stolen, to fly in Serbian mechanics, repair it, and fly it out. This would not be applicable to aircraft registered (or re-registered) in Russia. How feasible this is is unknown, and it could take months if not years of diplomatic discussions. The only positive is that Serbia still has good Russian relations.

The other option that saves the plane would be to fly an Airbus Beluga in and ship the aircraft out in sections, but Airbus may well be (understandably) apprehensive about a Beluga entering Russian airspace.

Alternatively, AirSerbia could simply sell the plane to Russia (at a substantial loss) or break it for parts.

It's this latter option I see happening, and therefore, I think this could be a major watershed moment for international air carriers regarding Russia. Nobody will want to fly aircraft into a country if even the most minor of mechanical faults means writing off the entire aircraft, because unlike with roadside repairs for a car, once an airframe has been worked on by uncertified contractors, it can *never* be returned to certified status again. That status depends on a complete, unbroken chain of work exclusively by certified entities. It means that even non-Russian carriers that traverse EU airspace are under extreme threat if they have mechanical problems. In fact, it affects any carrier that uses any ICAO airspace, which is effectively everyone and everywhere. 

In fact, it really is everyone on Russia's borders - the only carriers that routinely ignore ICAO certification are ones that operate only regional flights in developing areas, e.g. central South America or regions of Africa. Since their aircraft never leave domestic or non ICAO airspace, they don't care. An ICAO ban on an aircraft flying internationally is effectively reducing the aircraft to scrap value and use.

*Russian reactions to the events of 11 September and the aftermath are caught up in the web of domestic politics and traditional divisions regarding the geopolitical orientation of the country—as Western, Eurasian, uniquely Russian or a mix of these. President Putin has advocated a consistent pro-Western position and, while it appears that he is winning the public relations battle, other geopolitical discourses appear in the oppositional media. The outcome of this orientational battle— ’the risky westward turn’—will determine the future of Russia’s geopolitics and will have a major impact on its domestic politics and life.*",False,1654100161.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iasudz0,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Some are taught about the entire war, but it’s mostly glossed over as the “other” war happening at the same time as “the great patriotic war”, which is their name for the eastern front. In their old war films about the war they criticize their allies for not opening the western front early enough. They say this is because they (allies) didn’t want to get involved. 

They also think that the allies joined the war late for some reason (Britain was fighting two years before of them and the United States joined six months after them).

The difference is that the US had a very low presence, the ANA had zero motivation and rampant corruption, and the Taliban were far better equipped than the ANA expected.

The capitulation of Afghanistan, if it was going to be repeated in Ukraine, would have been precisely the 3-day war Russia was prepared for, with the ""concert in Kyiv at 6pm"" well on the cards.

I don't disagree that the war could be over pretty quickly, but it won't be with a Russian victory - whilst they are on the verge of taking the entire Donbas, they're not on the verge of having the troop numbers to hold it, they're making gains because they're pushing hard on the offensive with everything they've got, and Ukraine is playing the elastic defence routine masterfully. 

The moment Russia takes the foot off the gas, there's a high chance their frontline snaps back on them because there's nothing behind it to keep it there. Once that happens, especially if Ukraine gets between the Russian assault forces and the Russian border to create pockets, things could fall apart for Russia very quickly. 

Russia's only clear advantage in this war is the indiscriminate use of artillery *ahead* of their advancing troops. It's pretty hard to use indiscriminate artillery against targets that are *within* or *behind* your own lines without collateral damage, and whilst Russia probably doesn't care about dumping artillery on its own men (indeed has done so in historic conflicts), from a numbers point of view, it can't afford to do that this time around.",False,1654100357.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iast5yg,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

In that way drone warfare is less of a tactical weapon, and more of a strategic weapon to demoralize enemy troops.

The drone is able to ambush enemy troops at moments when they feel most secure or are resting.

Disrupting those long periods of rest between engagements really fucks with a soldier's head... and even if they aren't the ones who had a grenade dropped on them, hearing about it can dial up the cortisol and leave the soldier in a constant state of stress where they are physically unable to rest.

The reasons that the West is doing this are: a) avoiding escalation, which is only arguably valuable at this stage in the war, but it is what it is; b) not encouraging Ukraine to be an attacker, since it's much more justifiable to support a country for its defense, as opposed to any aggression it's leading, tying back to the first point about escalation. If the West keeps supplying aid to Ukraine after they start attacking Russia, it is inarguable that the West is helping Ukraine to attack Russia.

You can quibble about whether that's a justifiable reason for all of this (indeed, one could argue that the best way to ensure the defense of Ukraine, from the Ukrainian point of view, would be to attack), but in any case that has nothing to do with any question of ""narrative"".

Because see, that's the thing about a dictator that relies on disinformation to keep power, especially one that has pretty much weaponized fake news and alternative facts - everybody's aware that, if Putin wants to make up literal nonsense, he will (such as the idea that the US has experimental labs inside Ukraine, which he has).

So while European membership in NATO has nearly doubled since 1990, defense spending by Europeans has gone down by 28 percent since then. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Germany’s defense spending has fallen by 4.3 percent since 2008 alone. In the same period, the United Kingdom has reduced its defense spending by 9.1 percent and Italy by 21 percent. This has led to a sharp drop in military capabilities in bigger and more exposed NATO member states, and it has made the already-uneven burden sharing in the alliance even more lopsided. And in effect, the dependence of European NATO allies on the United States has further increased since the end of the Cold War, not decreased. As a percentage of GDP, defense spending by European allies fell from an average of 2 percent in 1995–1999 to 1.5 percent in 2014, while that of the United States went up from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent in the same period.

My argument is that neutrality and intervention are mutually incompatible. By prohibiting the transfer of weapons from NATO countries to a NATO partner, i.e. inhibiting the entire function of NATO's logistics system, Switzerland is no longer neutral. By changing the terms of the agreement so as to include ammunition components not just ammunition, impacting the UK and Sweden's ability to send NLAWs to Ukraine, Switzerland is no longer neutral. It's taking an active stance against NATO.

For Switzerland to be able to be neutral, it needs to make no comment on what its arms customers do with the ammunition, or at least be absolutely consistent. Why can it be transferred to country X but not country Y? Why can country Z not receive Swiss weapons even if it's a strategic signatory of an alliance with countries P and Q who buy Swiss?

In this case they're specifically blocking transfer to Ukraine and *only* to Ukraine despite having allowed other transfers that are materially equivalent in the past.

If you're Swiss, I encourage you to lobby your elected officials about why countries like the UK and Germany are having their ammunition transfers barred by Switzerland.

Nobody wants the Swiss to get involved militarily. Nobody is asking Swiss soldiers to fight in Ukraine. All everyone is asking is for Switzerland to not selectively impose restrictions without just cause.

After WW2, the Allies realised one of their biggest challenges was that supply and demand were asymmetric - early war, the US had huge supply capacity but almost zero demand, whereas the UK had the exact opposite, and so did the USSR. The problem was that neither could actively use components made by the US as they were incompatible, so the US was forced to supply complete guns, tanks, trucks, aircraft, you name it. That of course meant that soldiers were forced to retrain rather than simply rearm. Whilst some good things did come out of it (the Brits putting their very much superior Merlin engine in the P-51 Mustang, for example), it was far from ideal from a logistics perspective and probably lengthened the war by a not inconsequential amount.

The postwar solution was to standardise and make key parts interchangeable or at least easily convertible. STANAGs are meant so that NATO members can freely supply each other and NATO partners (which Ukraine *already is*) with arms and materiel in times of need, especially where that need does not encompass the whole of NATO, and without having to worry about incompatibility. For example, if France was pulled into stabilising somewhere in North Africa, and they needed additional artillery rounds or even air-to-air missiles, they could get them from the stockpile of another NATO country, unbox and use them with zero conversion required, and worry about replenishment later.

You could equally ask how the Western nations would react to Russia mining every single street crossing in Ukraine - why the hell would they do that, what is the military purpose here? 

The lowest yield of a Western B61 bomb is 300 tons of TNT, so not bloody much. Still a big bang, like if you blow an ammunition depot, but what exactly do you want to blow up on a battlefield with that what you couldn't do with normal ammunition? 

There needs to be a purpose there, an effect which can only be achieved with a nuke and *not* with conventional munitions, and that's something which needs lots of more bang to offset the consequences of using a weapon of mass destruction. 

That's either a strike on massed enemy formations, and for that you need at least several kilotons since armor and entrenched infantry are pretty resilient, or to take out strategic locations like towns. 

The first pretty much don't exist in this war, it's not *that* grand on a scale. The second does exist - for example instead of slowly chewing themselves 2+ months through Popasna, the Russians might have saved themselves lots of grief and blood if they'd just nuked the place and then occupied the rubble (identical outcome). 

But for that you need a way higher setting than the lowest yield, nuking the population you're claiming to liberate is just a tad hard to explain at home (even though you're otherwise shelling them into oblivion, but that you can always blame on those pesky Ukrainians), and of course the whole world including your friends China and India will complain.

Ukraine is also committing now more troops to that area with heavy equipment shown to have arrived in Bakhmut but likely it will not make the way to Lysychansk due to the death road and consolidate Bakhmut which is far more important than Lysychansk.

The situation with Lysychansk is a paradox in many way: yes it is a major city but it is located in a place which is extremely difficult to reach for Ukrainians and doesn't hold any strategic value, unlike Severodonetsk, as Russians can simply cross the river from Popasna or Svitlodarsk.

So a quick change in the sense of no long election campaign is possible.

However, it is not likely. As the majorities in parliament are and given who the most likely replacement not from the SPD is (i.e. the head of the head  CDU Merz), a shift of coalition is highly unlikely. 

Don't forget as well, that while Ukraine is an important topic in Germany, it is not the only topic of interest. Same as in the US domestic policy is very much central to the agenda and here the current coalition works reasonably well together. 

The two smaller parties in the coalition, Greens and Liberals, would probably be able to reach far fewer of their domestic goals with the CDU  after a vote of no confidence than the SPD. And elections are always around the corner and the electorate usually isn't too strongly influenced by foreign policy (compare the bad polling numbers of Biden despite his great handling of the crisis).

To push for re-elections the constructive motion of no confidence needs to fail several times (as in no alternative candidate finds any majority in parliament) and the president has to agree as well (he has done so the one time it came up so far, but theoretically he has a veto).

Any coalition party pushing for this (and right now given poll numbers only the greens would have an interest in this) are historically punished at the ballot box for it. Mainly since it is generally perceived as a betrayal to call for non confidence by the electorate (the Liberals caused a change in chancellor in the late 80s and as a result lost tons of votes in the next election).

Lastly, you need to consider that the position of the Scholz is by far not as negatively perceived in Germany as it so abroad. A strong majority supports Ukraine, but a significant part of the population remains reluctant/careful or even supports understanding for Russian positions. 

Though this latter group is rather small, don't underestimate, for example, how bad US politics of the last two decades was perceived in Germany. A lot of people see the US as nearly as big a strategic adversary as Russia or China. This means depending on how things go public opinion could shift quite quickly in Germany (again increasing the danger of re-elections or a strong shift in politics towards a stronger support for the war).",False,1654072957.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iarfrk3,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

1 take the bridge out between Russia and Crimea and they can hardly resupply at all.

2) that would leave the Russian troops in Crimea basically trapped and isolated. Sure they can reinforce with ships but it's not like moving along a highway. Ukraine with new mobilized and well equipped troops can push in.

Russians seem to be backing out of Kherson right now to reinforce Crimea. They see what's coming.

Sure they'd have a lot of Russian troops in Crimea but they would be under seige. How to feed them and resupply them with no bridge... Good luck. They're beaten to shit already and no fresh troops.

I think you'll be surprised.  This is being talked about more in the past couple days.

The key is that bridge of course. Wouldn't be easy but it's not impossible to hit it if you have the territory down to the Crimean border which seems to be how it'll be soon enough as Ukrain is pushing hard in the south.

Do you really think calling me an ""apologist"" is changing anything? Correcting misconceptions and wrong claims isnt being apologist. Theres enough to criticize about the german government, but that doesnt mean i'll let misinformation stand here uncorrected.

> I'm simply making an observation, that there is consistently a huge discrepancy between what Germany says and what Germany does. 

Dont base ""germany says x"" on some random twitter and reddit comments, then you'll get a very different picture - atleast regarding broken promises. Germany is one of the few countries you can take for its words in most cases.

> They promised to cut oil imports but haven't done so yet (other countries didn't make a promise, they just did it). 

Thats simply not true - germany never promised to cut oil imports instantly as that would have hurt germany more than russia. They reduced their imports from 35% to 12% until may and will now stop every import as the EU implements its oil embargo with german support. There is an exception for countries like hungary which keeps the pipelines open, but germany has already pledged that it wont use them.

> They promised to cut gas, but not yet. 

Same thing as above, that was never promised. The current timeframe from the german govenrment for completely getting rid of russian gas is 2024. Its just harder to substitute than russian oil. You can criticize that time table however you want, but saying germany promised to cut gas is simply not true - quite the opposite.

> They promised Marders but oops not possible. 

The german government *never* promised Marders. Never. The arms industry leaked that they have 100 rusting away in their depots, which they can refurbish over the course of a year, to the press as a sales pitch. The german government it self never, really never, promised them - again, you can criticize that decision, but its not a broken promise because it was never made in the first place.

> They promised modern leopards to Poland but haven't delivered them.

They did not do that either and any replacement in the ring swaps would be made in the future anyways as the idea is ""instant aid for ukraine and replacements for the donor later"". Poland is demanding a lot of the most modern version of the Leopard A27 which not even the german army really fields in larger numbers *right now* - without ever agreeing with germany on anything beforehand. The PiS just went ""germany said it will replace tanks send to ukraine, we send T72, now give us that stuff instantly"". They even refused german offers to send older versions which would be modernized to 2A7 in the next years together with Leopards from the german army - its just typical stupid PiS shit.

> Now they promise anti-air but, you guessed it, not yet

Yeah, because its literally in production at the manufacturer and noone except sweden owns the system yet. Its not like they've got a time machine

> They promised Gepards to Ukraine but haven't delivered them. 

They're still being refurbished, they stood around in a warehouse rusting for atleast 10 years. I mean yeah, its shitty that they take time, but its not like there were any ready for battle just standing around - the german army never got any replacements for that system after retiring it. Its a wonder there even is some non-swiss ammunition left that can be send with the system

This ""discrepancy"" you speak of is already found at pretty much every level of Russian society - there is a constant, and unrelenting, difference between what propaganda channels for the fascist state present, versus what actually goes on in reality. By your logic, Russian propaganda should have been ""greatly weakened"" by the twenty past years, where literally everyone could plainly see, with the Internet widely available, that pretty much everything they say is nonsense. Yet it hasn't happened.

> Major propaganda point of Kremlin has been imminent threat of ""the West"" attacking in Russia.

Here's the thing: this ""imminent threat"" has been there *for years*, according to Putin's propaganda.

The West, according to Putin and his minions, ""will"" not attack - it *has been* attacking for many years. The attacks have not happened, they have never happened, and yet Putin has kept lying that they have - ***he does not care, and those buying his propaganda do not either.***

And, in fact, we see that many Russians being affected by propaganda do not care about reality, at all, up to and including denying reports from their own families in Ukraine. Much like conspiracy theorists all over the world, these people do not remain in ignorance because they have no alternative - they remain there simply because it's a conscious choice, of a more comfortable, fascist, rhetoric, that enables them to complain that they're victims of the universe, as opposed to taking responsibility for their actions, or lack thereof.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Russians cannot, or will not, decide to take down their own government because of this war, or disbelieve their propaganda about the war, but I certainly think it has nothing to do with any decision of the West's to ""play into"" Putin's rhetoric, or not. If someone knows the truth about the war, then they're not going to be convinced otherwise if the West helps Ukraine more directly in acts of agression that are well-justified - and, similarly, someone that refuses to believe the truth will not be convinced otherwise if the West *doesn't* help Ukraine.

Again: people spreading, and believing, alternative facts, will do so regardless of any real facts - they will disregard the truth for these alternative facts, they will even change their perception of reality to keep the illusion going. It is much better, as I have often said, to treat Putin's rhetoric as the ramblings of a drunk, isolated uncle in the corner of the room.

Again, you assume that the mouthpieces and propagandists who write these ""opeds"", as well as those people that actually read them, would rely on facts and truth to bring weight to their arguments. I think that's nonsense, since much like Putin, pesky things like facts do not affect, in any way, the narrative they wish to push.  Once more: if someone wants to spout nonsense that's disconnected from truth, they will do so regardless of reality. If someone is willing to believe Kremlin propaganda over known fact, they will do so regardless of reality.

Your point about lawmakers being affected by public opinion is certainly true, however it has little to do with some ""narrative"" that would be dictated by the Kremlin - apart from the narrative that is being pushed in any case. In other words, it doesn't matter if Putin or his mouthpieces talk about it, because *they will do so anyway*, and those already listening to them would not be swayed either way by any additional facts (since they are *already* removed from fact). These mouthpieces sway public opinion against Ukraine either way, regardless of the truth. Your ""drip campaign"" happens regardless of the true facts. And your ""centrists"" do not exist when it comes to a binary problem like whether or not Kremlin propaganda is worthwhile. If someone isn't willing to aid Ukraine (defensively or offensively) because of Kremlin propaganda, then no amount of objective truth will bring any sort of balance to their reasoning.

In shorter terms, people can argue for or against providing support to potential Ukraine agression - but it has nothing to do with anything Putin would say.

With MIG-29's it was Ukraine wants them but we won't give them fighter jets, Poland wants to give them fighter jets, the US forbids flying them from their bases, other nations follow US lead but Poland is mad. The news then is allowed to fade for a couple weeks with no comment made then all the sudden Ukraine is given enough ""parts"" to get 20 MIG-29's back in the air. By the time the final news story comes about the final decision comes out there have been so many stories about the fighter jet issue already that people are tired of reading them and the news media has already covered the issue to death so the news of them actually being supplied with something is less newsworthy and therefore less impactful. That reduces Russia's ability to try and portray it as an escalation because it almost seems like old news by that point.

Remember none of these press releases by governments or defense agencies are an accident, it is all intentional, if they didn't want the issue aired in public they just wouldn't talk about it. Even the apparent infighting in the alliance, some of which might be real, is used to distract from the actual support of something new for Ukraine. Then the story isn't just about the weapon system, it's about the tensions that will bring down the alliance.

The same thing happened with giving them soviet era tanks from Eastern European countries, you saw the same will they/won't they back and forth, some countries saying it would be escalation and then all the talk about getting western tanks as replacement. Then it comes out a couple weeks ago Ukraine already had at least 200 T-72's that had been given by NATO allies. The news barely made a ripple.

And again it's the same type thing with the MLRS/HIMARS back and forth of the last few weeks, it's just tossing out comments and hemming and hawing about what they will do in public to soften the news of the actual decision to supply them to Ukraine. This strategy didn't work as well for these rocket launching systems but they were very effective for the tanks and fairly effective for the MIG-29's. Even the drone issue has had a little of the same back and forth softening the announcement of that was made today as well.

I think that media communication strategy, or the ""tension"" angle as u/Javelin-x put it, has really reduced the Russian's ability to stoke outrage over the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine. By the time the story about the final delivery drops a lot of casual readers/viewers have already tuned out and the story dies much quicker than ""OMG this big thing they NEVER talked about before happened!"" you get when there is no lead up to it.

And a lot of the supposed delays in the decision are often just cover to give them time to train and go over the systems they're giving them to make sure they work. A lot of this stuff was in storage, it needs to be thoroughly gone over first, that takes time and a lot of these announcements are about decisions that were made weeks or even months ago. They delay the announcement so it looks like aid isn't taking too long to get there, in the meantime they play their little back and forth game in the press some more.",False,1654129210.0,t3_v286fz,t1_iauni10,,5,7,0,7,0,0,

We have countries keen to cooperate, an economic justification, and a post-pandemic, major-European-war situation that encourages and strengthens European unity. I agree that it's right to be cynical and that Europe has refused to work together for a long time, but I also see more indications of a need for togetherness now than almost any time in recent history.

To make it palatable, it would perhaps be less ""federal"" than the US system, with each nation retaining its own culture, language, and so on, more simply just a formalisation of the EU into a more consolidated power to which all nation-level systems ultimately defer, with the bottom line being that pan-European decision override individual national preference, and that countries cannot act against the unified interests of the bloc. With the Schengen Area, and the Eurozone, and the way in which EU directives are achieved and implemented, we're already about 75% of the way there. We just need to fix a few issues first.

Specifically:

1. Induct Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, on a probationary basis, as per their March 2022 applications.

2. Accelerate the ascension of the Balkan states, specifically Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia i Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Serbia isn't ready yet.

3. Figure out Turkey, Iceland, the UK, and Norway's relationships with the new entity. Offer all of them a one-time joining offer, especially as the terms of the USE/EUE would be far less ""restrictive"" than the EU's terms, despite the entity having ostensibly greater power. The UK might even take up the offer as it's generally acknowledged that Brexit has had a negative overall impact, and were the UK to hold the referendum today I'd wager the outcome would be overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU, so this would allow UK politicians to save face and not be seen to renege on Brexit, whilst reclaiming the positives that the UK threw away.

4. Induct the European Microstates: Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino. There's no reason that any of them can't and shouldn't join, immediately. Arguably, the Vatican should remain a wholly independent state because of its special status and situation. It would be highly provocative for it to be absorbed.

5. Solve Switzerland. Right now it sits in the middle of the EU, has bilateral treaties, but needs to make this decision for real. It's in the Schengen area, the EEA, has freedom of movement, and a lot of other EU benefits without being a member. They take without giving, as it currently stands. They're given an ultimatum, all or nothing, and if it's nothing, so be it but we no longer consider them neutral and they lose all the perks of their supposed ""neutral"" status.

Soviet-era tanks will be more beneficial for UKR, so the current triangle deals, i.e. Greece receives German tanks, Greece sends their tanks to UKR is the best option unless you want to waste time training UKR troops to use German tech that breaks just as easily as their Soviet counter parts.

I'm just saying that this endless bashing of Germany leads nowhere and - most of all - is in no way reflective of the true situation. The true situation is that Germany has by now agreed to end all RU oil imports; exports such as military, financial and humanitarian aid are en par with other EU countries - actually higher than most others except for Poland, and Germany is looking to increase that, too.

We're taking in refugees and provide for them, we've pledged to increase our military spending and we're seeing gas prices nowhere near our European neighbors.

Germany IS doing its part, actively, right now.

We are so incredibly sorry that our 1bn€ p.a. military isn't capable of sending aid on a level with the largest nation on earth based on military spending. The US is sending a lot, yes. Necessary equipment, too. But even these ridiculous amounts of aid are nothing compared to what the US stockpiled FOR EXACTLY THIS SITUATION. The Cold War may have ended but the US never gave up amassing military tech in case they ever have to confront RU/CN again, directly or indirectly.

And again, this ""all the money goes to Russia everyday"" line is a ridiculously juvenile idea that doesn't take into consideration modern economics. If Europe enters a recession, it will stop ALL aid to Ukraine, period, you realise that, right? If Germany stopped paying for Russian gas, it will also stop supporting Ukraine, since it will no longer be able to do so, and a German recession means recession in the entire EU, so Poland, the Baltics... no one will be sending anything else to Ukraine. 

And if Europe stops supporting Ukraine, it will lose. Ukraine no longer has an economy, and it cannot win a war of attrition against Russia on its own. In the case of a fully isolated Russia and fully isolated Ukraine, Russia wins. 

Also, Germany may be paying for gas, but that doesn't translate to more weapons for Russia, since Russia is heavily sanctioned and can't produce/procure more weapons in any significant number.

the rest i can just shake my head, what the fuck are you talking about? the US myth that the US is protecting the world? poland is protecting me? are you aware of the fact that there are german troops in the NATO groups in the baltics too who would die to stop the russians? you are just recycling the russian propaganda trying to divide europe with this, germany enabled this? you mean by trading with another country? just like every other country has shady deals?

what you can criticize with a lot of facts to back it:
- nordstream 2 being started (under the gov. of merkel, who is no longer in power, and the state minister, who apologized but in my opinion should resign)
- the 5000 helmet fuckup, together with the entire handling of arms delivieries at the beginning. our defensive minister lambrecht is extremely incompetent and disliked. also one of our politicians was against weapon deliveries because he expected ukraine to fall within days (cringe moment)
- general closeness to russia after 2014: merkel was notorious for not doing anything that changes the status quo, but you could argue that the rest of the world didnt give much of a shit either after 2014.
- neglecting the army in the past 20 years which lead to the inability to react. also a result of the previous government, but can be blamed on the population because the army is very unpopular. ""could"" also be blamed onto the rest of the world because germany has obvious reasons to not have a strong military.


what you shouldnt criticize nearly as much, but is constantly mentioned:
- gas imports not being instantly dropped: the german industry relies on gas for chemicals and producing raw materials a lot, an instant stop would have unpredictably bad consequences. this isnt just ""but muh economy""
- not delivering 6 gorrilion giga heavy tank weapons on the first week: its either delayed because of needed training, because the weapons are simply not ready (bad state), or because we simply dont have it. there are a lot of different heavy weapons in talk and already promissed. the gepard is currently being trained. the artillery aswell. germany delivered heavy trucks and other vehicles already, and swapped out tanks to other partner nations who in turn delivered theirs to ukraine. (by the way, did you know that a lot of MiGs from poland were literally given to poland for free by germany? of course not, you just hear poland bragging and shitting on germany)


and yes i was 100% serious when i say nothing of this is owed. if anything the entire west is to blame because the security guarantees for ukraine have been broken in 2014 with no instant response. at least the constant whining has been going down a lot in the past weeks. so sorry, i hope you understand, i hope you stay safe and i hope everything will be alright. but the enemy is east of you. i can assure you that whatever reason there is why you arent getting the help that you need, its not because anyone in germany doesnt like ukraine, or is a russian spy, or is too scared or lazy. in the end hte most likely reason is just the slow mills of the german beurocracy machine and incompetence, lol",False,1654093323.0,t3_v286fz,t1_ias8cpd,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

Even here IN GERMANY, media make us think we're just not willing to help. In that case, just look at the numbers. We are helping as much as we can. Perhaps we could do more, of course there's still room to ramp it up, but then we'd have nothing left should the situation escalate.

Our society is still driven by profit - not just Germany but virtually any country. It's just not profitable to send in the most advanced tech when Russia can be defeated with the tech we're currently sending.

Russia would lose faster, Ukraine would lose fewer men, that is true. But from a purely capitalistic view, which I do not support, it makes sense to supply Ukraine the bare minimum it needs to defeat Russia. And THAT is still the world's goal. With the help Germany provides, we, too, want to see the Russian forces crumble, retreat and step on Ukrainian mines on their way back.

**Let me explain**

Oryx is a baseline, an open source aggregate of confirmed numbers. These numbers are what you would call 'independently verified'.  
  
That's where the real numbers begin. From there, assumptions can be made on ratios but essentially the real number is higher. This is due to removed wrecks, wrecks not photographed, all sorts of things.  
  
So if Oryx's numbers were higher than a country's - we would say that particular country is underplaying the numbers. Russia is severely underplaying her casualty rates. As we can extrapolate casualty numbers from vehicle numbers we can do the inverse.

**Numbers**

Russia claimed around 1300 Russians killed around the end of March. I can't find the figures quickly but Ukraine estimates would have been 16k ish and the Allies around 10k (8-15k from memory). Let's work with 10k (although I believe 16k to be closer due to the state of Russian forces - neither here nor there).

If a country's estimates are higher, they could be feasibly true but we don't know.

Russia's are stupidly low. As they run a highly mechanised and armour-heavy force, their number of tank/IFV KIA are higher proportionally. The rates are easy enough to Google.

Suffice to say, Oryx numbers of IFV and Tank KIA completely debunks Russian men KIA but cannot debunk Ukrainian claims...

**Can Allied intel be trusted, can Russia be trusted?**

Short-hand? Allied; yes, Russia; no.

Allied intel is designed to give the most accurate information at hand to the people on the ground. They don't change numbers when they announce things publicly, they just veil specific facts like how they know or certain numbers they're confident of but don't want to mention. When they say 'these are conservative' they really mean it. That means that they've picked a sure, high percentage confidence point in their numbers calculations, and/or their numbers are compromised by questionable data in a certain bias - not hard to tell which it is...

Russia works off a propaganda system, they want to minimise numbers of Russian losses to placate the public. They subsequently change numbers and obscure information in odd ways to suit a political gain. This is further amplified by a corrupt military system where bad news is punished and false good news is spread.

I wonder which set of numbers is more reliable?

**Bottom line**

Why even put weight on Russian numbers at all when it's been demonstrated they are a lie?

They're at least 80% wrong at the point of reference we have, Ukraine's are feasibly 80% correct, and at least 50% confirmably so across different equipment and manpower metrics.

I'm replying with this detail not for you, your mind is clearly made up, this is for any random doomscroller who runs into your comments and thinks 'yeah that sounds true' without spending any time to find out the actual facts.

I've never called you a doomer, but I do passionately disagree with your characterisation of my points and by your logic to reach your conclusions. There are no hard feelings here.

Russia IS propaganda.

Propaganda is government dictated media to achieve a political goal. Everything that Russian media does is to further the governments position.

Western media is completely inversed, it's crisis and panic driven. It's click-bait. It's driven by how much the audience wants to view or read something... It's populist.

Me saying Ukraine's figures are LIKELY 10-20% out, it's an opinion based on likely numbers and extrapolated facts.

MoD data definitely can be trusted, almost as a baseline. The fact you think this data is questionable shows a lack of understanding of how the allied intelligence community functions these days.

Basically for casualty figures they take both sides claims, throw in some Oryx and a whole bunch of their own intel and then spit out a spectrum. That spectrum has a % likelihood for each figure, the highest % confidence figure is then announced.

There are plenty of videos and articles out there about this.

And allied intel is second only to that on the ground.

Ukraine is on the ground, weight it for bias, adjust for allied conservatism and thus you get to common estimates.
