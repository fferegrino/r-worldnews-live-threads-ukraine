Day 34 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Sound of gunfights was almost constant today, and with quite a bit of shelling too. Couple of hours ago there were missile attacks but we don’t know where they landed. [Actually I recorded the sound of the gunfight around noon, it was pretty intense, might be the most intense one yet](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaberFlux/comments/tru8uy/sound_of_a_gunfight_somewhere_nearby_second_try/).  

Judging by the proximity of the sound it was not that far away, most likely on the outskirts of the city. Funnily enough the sounds of chirping from my budgies (certified bioweapons, the birds Russia is so afraid of) are even louder than the gunshots.

After today’s statement from Russia about retreat from Kyiv it was really funny reading how Russians react. Their cries about betrayal are just pure bliss. Fucking army of couch potatoes led by armchair generals saying to go kill “Nazis” in Kyiv and to stop retreating while they just watch like it’s some movie. Seeing them say “what did we do to deserve this” and panicking after their ammo depot in Belgorod blew up is just the best.

But instead of encircling the Ukrainian capital, the olive-green column soon came to a halt and scattered across the terrain, satellite images showed. Now it is revealed how the Ukrainian special forces Aerorozvidka stopped the invading army - with targeted night ambushes. 

> ""On the first night, this one small unit destroyed two or three vehicles at the head of the column and after that the whole platoon was stuck,"" Aerorozvidka commander Yaroslav Honchar tells The Guardian. ""Our people then stayed two more nights and destroyed many more vehicles.""

> Feb. 21: Russian President Vladimir Putin recognizes the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics in eastern Ukraine as independent states. The following day, the Russian parliament approves. Soldiers are to be sent to the separatist areas. 

> ""All this is only thanks to the deployment of 30 people"" 

> The 30 or so fighters were equipped only with night-vision goggles, sniper rifles, remotely detonated mines, and drones capable of dropping 1.5-kilogram bombs. Their targets were approached by the Aerorozvidkadas on quads. ""The first attackers were suddenly standing there, without heating, without oil, without bombs and without gasoline,"" Yaroslav Honchar reports. ""And it was all thanks to the efforts of only 30 people.""

> According to Honchar, his special unit was also involved in defending Hostomel airport northwest of Kiev on the first day of the war, helping to repel an attack by Russian paratroopers. Using their drones, the Aerorozvidkadas located and bombed about 200 Russian soldiers at the end of the tarmac, according to Honchar. ""This played a significant role in preventing the Russians from capturing the airfield and using it for their invasion,"" Honchar said. Military experts share this assessment.

> ""We are like a swarm of bees"".

> What is amazing is not only the military impact of the small unit, but also its genesis. Aerorozvidka formed after the 2014 Maidan revolution and is made up mostly of IT students, engineers and software developers. Commander Honchar used to be a soldier, then became an IT consultant for companies before returning to the army in 2014. But despite their ties to the army, the Aerorozvidka are largely on their own: They finance themselves primarily through donations and use personal contacts to obtain components for drones. 

> Indeed, the unit largely develops its own aircraft. In the meantime, it is also getting help from IT entrepreneur Elon Musk: He has allowed the Aerorozvidkadas to use his Starlink satellites. This allows the Ukrainians to quickly and reliably exchange information about the locations of Russian units. ""We are like a swarm of bees,"" Yaroslav Honchar says. ""One bee is nothing, but thousands can defeat even a big opponent.""

Apparently they raided offices in Germany. I can only assume this has something to do with investigations  about possible attempts to manipulate market prices.

Edit: more infos out now: 

> Russian gas company Gazprom's offices were raided by EU antitrust regulators, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the EU watchdog ramped up its investigation into the company's gas supplies to Europe.

> EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in January asked gas companies including Gazprom about tight supplies after accusations the Russian giant was withholding extra production that could be released to lower rising prices.

> Vestager was likely to intensify information gathering on Gazprom's European businesses, a person familiar with the regulator's thinking told Reuters last month.

> The European Commission declined to comment.
The person declined to provide details of the EU raids. Bloomberg was the first to report the raids in Gazprom's offices in Germany.
Gazprom and the Kremlin have repeatedly denied withholding gas supplies, saying that all firm and long-term obligations have been met.
Companies found breaching EU antitrust rules face fines up to 10% of their global turnover. Gazprom dodged a fine in 2018 after agreeing to reform its pricing arrangements and pave the way for rivals in eastern Europe following an investigation.

I don't necessarily think that's wholly inaccurate thesis, but I do think it's an oversimplification of the most dangerous power dynamic, which is much more related to peaks and troughs in relative power. 

The classic example is the Kaiserreich vs Great Britain. A popular conception is that Germany was rising, while Britain was declining. A more detailed analysis of power dynamics, though, reveals that while that was the longer term trend, what was really happening in that relative power dynamic was British shipbuilding strengths had put Britain on track to easily outpace German production no later than 1917, and Germany had no slack shipbuilding capacity to match. Combined with the fact that the Germans knew Russian military reforms would be complete by 1917, the German government decided it was ""now or never"" in 1914. 

I think something similar happened with the Putin regime: They realized that Ukrainian military reforms were either at, or about to pass the point of no return, and it was ""now or never.""

>“The 2017 blockade was a key inflection point for Qatar—it helped the country become more self aware, disciplined, self reliant, and aligned with the United States,” said Michael Greenwald, a former treasury attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Doha. “Moving forward, Qatar will play a crucial role for the U.S. as a new financial order emerges out of the Ukraine/Russia crisis.”

BERLIN — Germany began preparing for eventual shortages of natural gas on Wednesday, as the country’s economy minister pointed to growing concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless payments on existing contracts are made in rubles.

The government activated the first step of a national gas emergency plan that could, eventually, lead to rationing of natural gas. Wednesday’s action — the first step, or “early warning stage” — involves setting up a crisis team of representatives from the federal and state governments, regulators and private industry, said Robert Habeck, the economy minister and vice chancellor.

The move illustrates the risk facing European countries that rely on Russian oil and gas as the war in Ukraine drags on. On Monday, energy ministers from the Group of 7 nations rejected a demand by Russia that it be paid in rubles. Several European energy companies have said payment in rubles would require a renegotiation of long-term contracts.

Key Takeaways March 25-29

The Kremlin is falsely presenting its partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Kyiv and Chernihiv as a major Russian concession in service of peace talks with Ukraine. In reality, Russian forces are withdrawing to recuperate after suffering severe losses in their failed operations to seize those cities.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf.
The Kremlin is intensifying its internal censorship and crackdown on entities in Russia that do not cover the war in the Kremlin’s preferred terms. 
The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization that will coincide with Russia’s annual spring conscription on April 1. These new conscription drives are unlikely to generate effective Russian combat power for many months, at the earliest.
The Kremlin maintained its defamatory narratives about claimed US involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories and Russian nuclear capabilities to discredit and intimidate the West.

Edit 2:

Reading the wiki and some news articles it sounds like large mammals such as dears wolves, and boars live in the red forest so simply walking through may not be hazardous in the short term. 

As cleanup the forest was bulldozed and covered in a layer of sand and then trees planted atop it. I could see if you went digging that would be particularly dangerous. 

Levels of radiation measured in the area still sound high also although even within the forest sounds like they vary a fair bit and the dirt is the highest.

> LONDON — Western allies have presented a united front against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but they’ve hit a familiar stumbling block in deciding the best forum to coordinate sanctions — disagreement between Brussels and London.

> After doling out a series of measures meant to punish Moscow over the past month, the European Union, United States and the United Kingdom are now trying to work out the best way to formally synchronize these penalties going forward.

> While the EU seems comfortable with the ad hoc status quo, the U.K. has floated the notion of bulking up the G7 group of wealthy democracies to make that the main forum for such discussions, giving it a secretariat to make it more similar to other international organizations such as NATO.

> U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a new “sanctions dialogue” to streamline coordination on Tuesday after visiting both London and Brussels, but did not offer details on Washington’s preferred method for holding such talks. U.S. President Joe Biden first mentioned such a plan after a NATO summit in Brussels last week, saying allies had discussed creating an organization to ensure compliance with the sanctions, tackle any loopholes and look “at who has violated any of the sanctions, and where and when and how they violated them.”

Ukraine will win. The simple math for it is that

A. Ukraine will continue to receive arms from the West

B. Russia cannot acquire new arms due to sanctions and their inability to create arms locally.

When Russia runs out of arms it is game over. It may take a month, it may take a year. It may come down to a stalemate/war of attrition or not. Either way the end result does not change. The one with the constant arms supply will win.

The only way that this outcome would be averted is a lack of arms supply to Ukraine, the removal of sanctions for Russia, or Russia developing the capability to create arms locally as well as having the funds to do so.

Right now, some sources say that a large army group (I've heard 15k men a few weeks ago and about 15 or so battalions currently) is hunkering down in and around Brovary. But at the same time, a few battalions have been pulled out by Russia, Sumy's encirclement was broken, and Ukrainian troops have been taking back villages in the area.

So there is a large army group deep in enemy territory will a very long supply line, hunkering down for the long haul, while the city at the end of the supply line has decently closed them off and several towns behind their immediately position are being captured. That is just ripe for a very rough encirclement of a very large amount of soldiers.

And the best part is that the closest front, at Chernikiv, which could probably push through and get to them is also going on the defensive and had destroyed several bridges to put a river between themselves and the Ukrainian forces. Brovary is on the other side of that river, so their defensive line is going to prevent them from helping out.

Now, the Brovary army could retreat to the Sumy area and try to consolidate (if they're even allowed to retreat) and certainly a few units have done so, but then they'll have to push around Sumy, which has several units outside of the city which can block them, with Kyiv's eastern forces chasing them.

China ready to take its relationship with Russia to a 'higher level' - state media

The foreign ministers of China and Russia have met in China, prior to a meeting of government representatives from countries which border Afghanistan.

According to China’s state media, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that relations between the two countries have withstood new tests presented by a changing international situation.

Wang said China was ready to take their relationship “into a new era” and “to a higher level”.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov briefed his Chinese counterpart on the “special military operation” in Ukraine, as Moscow has repeatedly described its invasion of the country.

Lavrov said the two countries “oppose hegemonism and power politics” and “uphold the principles of the UN”.

He said ""Russia is committed to cooling tensions” in Ukraine and “will continue peace talks” as well as “maintaining communication with the international community”.

Wang said China had “always stood on the right side of history”, adding that the Ukraine “issue” had “a complex history” and claimed it was “the result of a long-standing European security conflict”.

Wang also said China supported the efforts being made by Russia, and all parties, to ""prevent a large-scale humanitarian crisis”.

He expressed concern about the safety of his boss, who was recently sentenced to nine more years in prison, saying that the world “should keep an eye on him”. 

#Volkov went on to say that when Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to go to war in Ukraine he actually ""shortened his years in power"" – and since Navalny is Putin’s ""personal prisoner”, he also “shortened Nalvany’s prison term”. 

Volkov also reacted to the Kremlin's seeming change of military strategy in Ukraine after Russia said it would ""drastically"" reduce military operations in Kyiv and Tchernihiv. 

According to Volkov, Putin was planning a ""blitzkrieg"" against Kyiv and now must admit he failed. But the admission comes ""too late"": despite Putin's ""very strong and capable propaganda"", Volkov suspects this failure will be hard to explain to the Russian people.

Russia hails China as part of new ' just, democratic world order' 

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed China as part of a new “world order” ahead a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.

In his first visit to China since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Lavrov said the world was “living through a very serious stage in the history of international relations”, AFP reports.

In a video released by the Russian foreign ministry ahead of his meeting, Lavrov said:

We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order.

Lavrov and Wang were later photographed in face masks bumping elbows in front of their national flags.

China has not published a readout of the two ministers, but foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin later told reporters that Moscow and Beijing will continue efforts in “advancing global multipolarity and the democratisation of international relations”.

Repeating a line used by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to characterise ties, Wang added:

d7dcaa57510cdafc4da25aa4b149abd0,trthc7,i2q22lz,"For those confused about Russia in Kyiv and N Ukraine front. 

Russia stated that it would reduce military activity in these areas. Also being reported as a drastic reduction (I’ve seen it both ways). 

Russia never said it would stop fighting in the north. It never said it would leave occupied areas. I see so many people who thought that’s what it meant. Russia says things in ways that can have multiple meanings. This allows them to have told the “truth” in their own way. They are sneaky. 

So what happened here was that Russia had units that got hammered for weeks and couldn’t operate anymore. A normal occurrence in war. These units have to pull back to refit. Yesterday we got video of VDV units leaving the front. What do we know about the VDV in the north? They got hammered worse than anyone. They would be the first units removed for combat ineffectiveness. So Russia is technically removing men from the front. But they aren’t retreating in any way. Russia isn’t going to launch anymore large attacks or try to surround Kyiv. This is because they simply cannot do it. They are just trying to act like it’s goodwill for negotiations. 

So Russia isn’t launching large attacks and is removing men. To Russia, they didn’t lie and that’s a reduction. In actuality it’s just what Russia was forced to do and didn’t have a choice. Russia may pull out of certain areas in order to shorten or tighten their defensive lines due to having less men. We have seen them do this in some areas and blow bridges. And now Ukraine has to go on the attack which is harder than defending and involved more casualties. 

The big reason for Russia to hold this land is to force Ukraine to station many troops in the north instead of sending them to the Donbas. But also all that land is a bargaining chip later on. And this gives RU the flexibility to try for Kyiv later on if things somehow change favorably for them.

P.S. this is why there’s reports of heavy fighting NW of Kyiv. I’m guessing Ukraine is still trying to drive RU out of Hostomel and Bucha and RU is still going to hold it.",1648653238.0,1648652997.0,t3_trthc7,t3_trthc7,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Can drones be piloted remotely from distant countries? Can a drone's pilot be traced? How does flooding the sky with countless western-backed drones work?

Forgive my ignorance on the subject. I just wonder if countries in secret could potentially be flying drones to take targets out for Ukraine in-masse. Obviously it's not going to advertised, but just curious how drone piloting works, and if it's something that's even possible. 

The pilots would obviously have to be experienced and know what they're doing, but if a drone cannot be traced, what's to stop a western country under siege from having pilots of other countries do it in secret.

Africa and Asia’s long-standing ties to Russia and resentments against Washington keep them on the fence—for now.

This month, South Africa’s ambassador to the United Nations, Mathu Joyini, took a moment from a debate in the U.N. General Assembly about the humanitarian fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to scold the United States for its past military follies, including in Iraq.

The United States and its Western allies, she suggested, had committed their own violations of the U.N. Charter and were simply pursuing their own geopolitical advantage over Russia by championing U.N. resolutions denouncing Moscow as an aggressor. “Making this point today in our discussion on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is not a form of ‘whataboutery,’ underscoring the point that many countries and their peoples suffer the consequences of wars that are not of their own doing,” she said.

The statement reflects the challenges the United States faces as it seeks to show Russia a unified diplomatic front in support of Ukraine. Besides the United States’ closest friends and military allies in the West and East Asia, most of the world is not interested in joining the U.S.-led campaign to isolate Russia. As outraged as they may be about Russia’s land grab in Ukraine, many countries have historical ties to Russia that they are not prepared to abandon, and they fear an economic blockade against Moscow will inflict severe pain on their own countries, fueling higher food and fuel costs and planting the seed for greater hunger and instability within their own borders.

Aleksandr Dugin, former adviser to Gennadiy Seleznyov (former chairman of the Duma from the communist party) and Sergey Naryshkin (current director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), former chairman of the Duma, and former Kremlin Chief of Staff) wrote this, according to Wikipedia, as early as 1997: ”Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics””. *1

William J. Aceves, at the time professor of law at California Western School of Law, wrote this in the Michigan Journal of Race and Law 2019: ”During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Russian government engaged in a sophisticated strategy to influence the U.S. political system and manipulate American democracy. While most news reports have focused on the cyber-attacks aimed at Democratic Party leaders and possible contacts between Russian officials and the Trump presidential campaign, a more pernicious intervention took place. Throughout the campaign, Russian operatives created hundreds of fake personas on social media platforms and then posted thousands of advertisements and messages that sought to promote racial divisions in the United States. This was a coordinated propaganda effort. Some Facebook and Twitter posts denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and others condemned White nationalist groups. Some called for violence. To be clear, these were posts by fake personas created by Russian operatives. But their effects were real. The purpose of this strategy was to manipulate public opinion on racial issues and disrupt the political process.””. *2

Some of the comments with many interactions that I have seen on social media have been quite inflammatory. I would be surprised if Russia isn’t currently involved, both to shift attention away from the war and to sow division within the US.

#Russia Proposes SWIFT Alternative to India for Ruble Payments

(Bloomberg) --India’s government is considering a proposal from Russia to use a system developed by the Russian central bank for bilateral payments, according to people with knowledge of the matter, as the Asian nation seeks to buy oil and weapons from the sanctions-hit country.

The plan involves rupee-ruble-denominated payments using Russia’s messaging system SPFS, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. No final decision has been taken and the matter will probably be discussed when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrives in India for a two-day visit Thursday.

A finance ministry spokesman wasn’t immediately available for a comment. 

India is keen to continue bilateral trade due to its dependency on Russian weapons and the prospect of buying cheaper oil as global prices surge. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been pushing back against pressure from Western nations by arguing that arms purchases from Russia are needed to counter China’s growing military assertiveness.

Under the proposal, rubles will be deposited into an Indian bank and converted into rupees and the same system will work in reverse, one of the people said. Undecided elements include whether the exchange rate will be fixed or floating.

Russia also wants India to link its Unified Payments Interface with their MIR payments system for seamless use of cards issued by Indian and Russian banks after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. suspended operations, one of the people said. 

The U.S., along with the European Union, cut off seven Russian banks from SWIFT -- the Belgium-based cross-border payment system operator -- including state-controlled VTB, Bank Rossiya and Bank Otkritie. Following the sweeping sanctions, Russia has been looking for alternate mechanisms to continue its trade hit by its war in Ukraine.

India has not outright condemned Moscow’s attack on its neighbor, saying only that Russia and Ukraine should end hostilities and seek a diplomatic solution through dialog. However, New Delhi is under pressure from fellow members of the Quad grouping, which includes the U.S., Australia and Japan, to take a stronger stand against Russia as the U.S. and its allies try to isolate Moscow.",False,1648622462.0,t3_trthc7,t3_trthc7,,0,-14,0,-14,0,0,

A) Slovakia has a single S-300 not upgraded and some 40 missiles. They said we want 2 Patriot systems, Denmark and Germany replied sure we will each give you one. Germany sent theirs right away while Denmark said it will arrive before April 14th and is currently being prepared for shipping. Slovak minister of defence already cast doubt on the S-300 transfer.

B) Greece said we have 4 and some 300 missiles but want F-16s and Patriot and it needs to be on our territory, we need to be onboarded and trained then we give ours to Ukraine. 

**Note:** 5 of these with the missile complement could make a difference but a small one since they are not upgraded, who knows how they have been maintained and S-300 old version is not really that good.

C) Turkey came in said we have this shiny new S-400 which recently took out a Ukrainian MIG from Belarus some 370km+ away. 36 batteries this thing could be positioned safely in the west and pretty much disintegrate anything Russia sent into Ukraine. It would pretty much dominate the Ukrainian airspace especially coupled by the existing S-300 batteries.

But Turkey is still bitter over the S-400 deal and getting cut out of the F-35 deal. So they said nope. First restore us to F-35 program, remove sanctions, give patriot system and start immediate deliveries of F-35 none of which is possible. Only then would Turkey deliver their systems.

&#x200B;

b7e7f05dadc6e5b4034e45cc72754535,trthc7,i2qnq66,"This is a big unknown. 

Russia has invested in an arsenal (something like 3000-6000) of low and medium yield, short and intermediate range tactical nuclear weapons for which NATO has no real equivalent. These are .1-10 kiloton weapons that can be fired from air-to-surface, as torpedos and anti-ship missiles, or other delivery methods on the battlefield. It's an asymmetric option that Russia has available to it as a counter to a superior conventional NATO force. That is, they believe they can use tactical nukes against enemy movements, ships or installations without triggering a NATO *strategic* nuclear response.

The big question is doctrine around their usage. Is it a matter of the President of Russia authorizing their use, and then leaving it up to individual commanders to use as if they were any other tool available to them? To what level is that authority delegated? Combined Arms Army? Battalion Tactical Group? Smaller? Would Putin order one such strike as an escalatory measure ultimately designed to deter and therefore de-escalate? Or would local commanders be at liberty to employ them as overwhelming force on the battlefield as a *fait accompli* to score a decisive victory without trigger MAD?

https://newslit.org/combating-disinformation-about-the-war-in-ukraine/

>Here are three tips to help you stay focused on facts as the invasion of Ukraine stretches into its second month.

>Be mindful of Russian disinformation tactics. While we usually can’t know for certain if a post or comment online is from a Russian agent or a paid troll, we can learn to spot common Russian disinformation tactics and narratives. We should also recognize the complexities introduced by new propaganda tactics, such as the fabrication and disingenuous “debunking” of pro-Ukrainian “fakes” by the Russians — a scheme to cast doubt on authentic posts and weaponize the ethos of fact-checking.

>Don’t fall for conspiracy theory narratives. Conspiracy theory communities often adapt their beliefs to fit new developments in the world, and the war in Ukraine is no exception. In this case, however, conspiracy believers are also falling victim to Russian disinformation narratives, such as the baseless claim that the United States is supporting the development of bioweapons in Ukraine or the absurd notion that the conflict is being staged by actors. (The parallels here to COVID-19 conspiracy movements, such as the #FilmYourHospital effort, are unmistakable.)

>Sharing misinformation in “support” of Ukraine helps the Russian propaganda effort. While it may be tempting to like and share social media posts showing supposed Ukrainian victories, inspiring vignettes and other hopeful messages, the prevalence of falsehoods regarding the conflict fuels Russian and conspiratorial claims that the war is being exaggerated or faked in some way.

You have to separate their statement that they're 'refocusing' on the Donbas from reality.  That statement's only purpose was to make their army appear less incompetent, however briefly.  They seem to be conducting only limited rotations and very few real withdrawals.  

Russian forces have dug in everywhere else and will probably stay there until a ceasefire.  There are only three areas they may move units out of.  One is the western suburbs of Kyiv where there may be either a partial withdrawal or a rotation, because several of those btgs are at 50% of their original strength.  Another is the region from Sumy through Kharkiv which they want to bring south.  But they won't bring it south through Donetsk.  They have two bridgeheads that flank the Ukraine-occupied southern section of Izyum and they'll come through there, eventually.  The third is in Kherson oblast, where there are quite a lot of Russian troops in defensive positions, but as with Bucha etc., several badly need replacing.  

I don't see them leaving the west bank of the river from Chernobyl on down, and they've built battlements around three directions outside Chernihiv, and they won't risk moving anyone from the southern regions north, even for an offensive, because they want to hold the water source there for Crimea.  It'll take a series of Ukrainian counteroffensives to change their minds on any of that.

It's not a ""total loss"" if you negotiate invaders from leaving and stop more bloodshed.

There is a path forward for negotiators. Agreeing to not join NATO and never stage nuclear warheads in Ukraine in exchange for a protected status from both the West and the East is a first step. Becoming a neutral country in the crossroads of these two spheres of influence could be a colossal long-term win for Ukraine.

There has been talk of a 100-year lease of Crimea to Russia which might sort out the water access too. The Donbass region is harder to solve, as is repayment of the damage Russia caused. Perhaps an offer of ""protected status"" of Russian language and culture in Donbass might satisfy the Kremlin.

The bottom line is any negotiated solution must allow Putin to save face. The alternative is more death and destruction.

It would, in two ways;

First is that it would create demand for Rubles. If a buyer has to settle a payment in Rubles, then they have to first acquire those Rubles by selling other currencies, or making other in-kind deliveries denominated in Rubles in exchange for the oil. Demand for Rubles means the value of the Ruble goes up. A Ruble going up increases Russia's purchasing power for imported goods and services.

Second, is that transactions not conducted in dollars are less subject to tracking, disruption, or law enforcement. This can allow Russia to skirt some of the challenges posed by sanctions, since the US and EU have less control over other currencies and banking networks.

The big question is whether or not oil buyers would agree to make payments in Rubles, or accept Rubles as settlements for other debt such as bond payments. So far, the answer seems to be no - and that they'd rather buy gas elsewhere or let their loans default than do business in Rubles.",False,1648661960.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2qnsbu,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Much of the population that’s left is either elderly or directly tied to the separatist state or Russia. If they’d never broken away, they would likely be similar to Kharkiv or Odesa now, which are also very Russian speaking/Russified cities that now identify very strongly as part of Ukraine. Kharkiv almost broke away in 2014, but the very powerful mayor there at the time prevented it from happening.",1648675895.0,1648675522.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2rlgy5,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

While these maps may exaggerate the divisions, it's not hard to understand.

People in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine are more likely to speak Russian as a first language, are more likely to have supported the pro-Russia candidates in national elections, and less likely to have supported the revolution that ousted the last pro-Russian president. There is a sizable minority, concentrated in the east and southeast, that identify as Russian - about 17%.

Those people tended to favor cultural, economic, familial and political ties with Russia over the west. They soon saw their preferred presidential candidate thrown out of power by mass protests in the western half of the country, and then laws passed that demoted the status of the Russian language (including things like mandating what percentage of a radio or TV broadcast must be in Ukrainian vs Russian, the language of business for private organizations and regional governments, etc).

Acute Radiation Syndrome is *hard* to get, to the point where I'm not convinced that digging trenches in the Red Forest would do the trick.

Wikipedia says: 

> In 2005, radiation levels in the Red Forest were in some places as high as one roentgen per hour (~9 mSv/h), but levels of ten milliroentgens per hour were more common. 

The accident was in 1986, i.e. 19 years before that, i.e. the 17 years that have passed since then are significant, both in terms of half-life (~30 years) and in terms of dispersion through plant growth, weather etc.
Just from radioactive decay we'd expect a drop from 9 to 6 mSv/h.

From my understanding (someone who knows this better may correct me), 1 mSv = 1 mGy for beta and gamma radiation (which we'd expect here). Wikipedia lists acute radiation syndrome as happening at doses ""as low as 0.35 grays"". So assuming 6 mGy per hour, they'd need ~2.5 days to get that dose - but ARS requires the dose to be delivered quickly, not over days.

The [tweet source](https://twitter.com/PeterCorless/status/1509314810705432581/photo/1) doesn't mention ARS though, nor any specific symptoms, and the trench-digging in the Red Forest seems to be just an arbitrary example of stupid activities to avoid, not a claim that that was actually the cause.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_radiation_syndrome mentions ""Dose rates high enough to cause the acute form (> ~0.1 Gy/h)"", i.e. you'd need more than 10x the worst level in the Red Forest to trigger acute sickness. The chronic form would be plausible if they managed to find the worst spot and stayed there for 5 days. But they'd have to find the worst spots, that's unlikely.

It's possible that they picked up some really cool, or rather, *hot*, souvenirs. Like graphite pieces or a bit of corium from the elephant's foot, or a fuel element. Or got sick from something else and were sent to this hospital because it's hard to distinguish food poisoning and radiation poisoning if you're not an expert.

I think it can be inferred that from the outset, the goal was to invade Ukraine and set up a puppet government under pretenses that the Ukraine army would ""lose"" like in Crimea in 2014 and the people would welcome the Russian Army in.

Based on what information is coming from Russia, it feels like the Kremlin (or parts of it) and Putin may be at odds where the Kremlin is trying to create an offramp with Donbas while Putin is still going for the puppet government thing. This is mainly from the fact that media is saying ""refocus on Donbas"" and Lavrov is saying ""retreat from Kyiv"" while actual troop movements don't support a withdrawal from Kyiv, this is assuming that Russian media is getting their sources from someone in the Kremlin. Note that this could simply be communication breakdown within the invasion forces where some of the boots on the ground believe their goal is still to retake Kyiv because the messaging pipelines are utterly broken.

Parts of Russian state media seems to be pushing the pov that a concession with Ukraine is fatal to Russian power and while arguably that may have happened worldwide, it's entirely possible that a concession with Ukraine is fatal to domestic power for the Putin regime and the current Kremlin in the way that the Afghanistan war was for the USSR.

What Ukraine is willing to sacrifice for an end to the war is Ukraine's discretion. At this point I imagine any vagueness here is by design. Zalensky has been clear that he is willing to ""forego NATO entry"" which was one of Putin's original reasons on paper to enter Ukraine. Whether or not that matters at all is unknown.

Not in the way most people think when they hear the word 'trust', not in a benevolent way. Russia can be trusted to follow it's own nature, and to follow long established patterns. Something even I, as an avid watcher of the topic, sometimes forget.

This invasion of Ukraine was seen coming long in advance by those paying attention, and you didn't need to be an intelligence officer being fed satellite images to see it coming. Likewise, Everything Russia has said about Ukraine wanting to be liberated, allowing humanitarian corridors, bombing civvie targets, is all within expected behaviour.

Keeping this in mind, I trust Russia not to use nukes. I also trust Russia not to stop the attacks. I also Trust Russia to ensure that the longer this goes on, the higher the chance rises that Putin is assassinated. I trust Russia to not back down despite this. Putin is all in, if he backs down now he will forever look weak back home, as a failure who doomed Russia. He can't have that, because it means he will lose his grip on power. Likewise, Putin won't use nukes for the same reason, he knows it will cost him everything. No matter how hopeless the situation seems, it's a move that he can't ever come back from. 

Waves of soldiers will continue to attack Ukraine, I trust that the attacks will scale down, but will not stop. This has become a war of attrition, where Putin sees two outs.

The first is to delay for a long enough time that there will stop being widespread media attention, allowing his war to fade away with a whimper. A couple of years of fighting in the donbass and nobody will be talking about it anymore, like with the initial 2014 invasion. 

The second is to get some kind of major concession in peace talks, that he could use to claim a victory. Probably aiming for Crimea+Donbas right now.

If neither of those two conditions can be fulfilled, If the war stays in the media spotlight and Russia can't get any concessions, the war will not end until putin is dead or in chains. If it does, We'll see Putin's removal from power after a couple more years anyways.

> Vladimir putin’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West in condemnation. Governments have supplied Ukraine with arms and co-ordinated crippling sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest against the invasion. But new polling data from The Economist and YouGov suggest a generational divide in opinions about the war.

> Ninety-two per cent of American respondents over the age of 64 said they sympathised more with Ukraine than with Russia. Yet just 56% of those aged 18-29 answered the same—a difference of 36 percentage points. In Europe the pattern looks similar. There was a 17-point difference between the shares of older and younger people in Britain who said they sympathise more with Ukraine, and a gap of 14 points in France. Young Americans were the most likely to say they sympathised more with Russia (10%), compared with 6% in France and just 1% in Britain.

> The generational gap in the poll was even more pronounced when pollsters asked whether Russia was deliberately striking civilian areas in Ukraine. Ninety-one per cent of Americans aged over 65 answered “yes”, compared with just 47% of respondents under 30. The younger generation was more split in its answer: 20% did not believe civilians were being targeted and 33% “aren’t sure”. Older individuals in Britain and France were more likely to answer that Russia was targeting civilians than younger generations, but by a narrower margin (18 and 7 percentage points, respectively).

> What explains this divide? One reason is that, on average, younger people tend to be less engaged in politics. Across all three countries, younger people who said that they were interested in politics were more sympathetic to Ukraine than their less-engaged peers. In Britain the gap between those aged under 30 and over 64 narrowed when factoring in that difference: from 17 points to 12.

> In France younger respondents who said they have an interest in politics were also more sympathetic to Ukraine. Interestingly, the reverse is true for the older cohort. Well-informed French respondents older than 65 were 15 percentage points less likely to be sympathetic to Ukraine than their younger counterparts. This may reflect a lingering sympathy for Russia among some older French people, linked to France’s cold-war posture of geo-strategic independence.

> But in America, a lack of political engagement can explain only part of the generational divide. The gap between well-informed older Americans and well-informed younger Americans is still wide, at 28 percentage points. Russophobic sentiment among older adults may be more important. Those aged 65 and older came of age in the midst of the cold war. By comparison, those aged under 30 were born after 1992, a year after the fall of the Soviet Union.

 >Renewable energy in Russia mainly consists of hydroelectric energy. In 2010, the country was the sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world, although it was 56th when hydroelectric energy was not taken into account. Some 179 TWh of Russia's energy production came from renewable energy sources, out of a total economically feasible potential of 1823 TWh. 16% of Russia's electricity was generated from hydropower, and less than 1% was generated from all other renewable energy sources combined.
 
**[Greenhouse gas emissions by Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Russia)** 
 
 >Greenhouse gas emissions by Russia are over 3% of the annual world total and are mostly from fossil fuels. Russia emits about 1600 megatonnes (Mt) CO2eq of greenhouse gases each year; about 5% of world emissions which is about 11 tons per person. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore air pollution in Russia, would have health benefits greater than the cost. Greenhouse gas emissions by Russia have great impact on climate change since the country is the fourth-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, and most of the country's emissions comes from the energy sector burning fossil fuels.

The Russian Army has deployed ~60% of their BTGs in this war--that's a huge deployment of Russian offensive land power. What the Russian Army didn't do, though, was deploy the necessary logistics and support troops to sustain their forces in the field. This sustainment issue may explain some of the perception of ""restraint"" in his piece, but it's clearly insufficient. 

Also, he spends too much time speculating on advanced Russian combat systems, like the T-14. Simply put: Russia does not have a deployable force of T-14 tanks. It's not worth spilling ink on in a serious piece on Russian land power. 

I feel like he's pretty deep in the Russian military information ecosystem, which is impacting how he's assessing events. 

There's a point in the articles where he almost seems to realize that he's not getting good information about the campaign from Russia, specifically the part about Russian spoxs overstating the success of their SEAD campaign, but it doesn't seem to have really clicked that there are other problems with the information coming out of Russia. 

Additionally, I think the long-view approach he's taking, that Russia has more strategic depth is relatively fair, but he's ignoring the fact over the medium term Ukraine is in the process of mobilizing their reserves which has a good chance of giving Ukrainian forces a window of superiority of offensive potential.

I don't think the lack of Russian air support is particularly mysterious. Russia has failed basically all combined arms tests in this war because of their fundamental communications issues. Russian Aerospace Forces have not been providing CAS because they can't talk to troops on the ground.

d8aa2c8de4e314eba987e5db33af409f,trthc7,i2qido6,"Crimea has historically had a large ethnic Russian population in addition to its Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainian population.

In Ukraine's 2001 census, they found that 60.4% of Crimea was ethnically Russian as compared to 24% Ukrainians. There were also 10.8% Crimean Tatars, who are a Turkic ethnic group. (I would use newer data but using the 2014 Russian census conducted after the invasion does not seem fair as they may have doctored the data to suit their narratives)

Beyond this, in 2013 shortly before the Russian invasion, 82% of the population were Russian speakers, so even among the ethnically Ukrainian population there were and are a lot of Russian speaking people.

But ultimately it's probably most important that there are simply just a lot of ethnic Russians in Crimea and they in fact make up the majority of the population. Russian-speaking Ukrainians do not seem to want to join Russia.

The situation in the Donbas is more complicated. Russian is the dominant language in the Donbas, 74.9% of residents in Donetsk Oblast and 68.8% in Luhansk Oblast spoke Russian according to Ukraine's 2001 census.

However, unlike Crimea the Donbas is not ethnically majority Russian, ethnic Ukrainians formed 58% of the population of Luhansk Oblast and 56.9% of Donetsk Oblast in 2001. That said, ethnic Russians did form the largest minority at that time, accounting for 39% and 38.2% of the two oblasts respectively.

As Russia is discovering right now though, sentiments towards Russia in the Donbas are much more negative than in Crimea, probably because most of the Russian speakers there are actually Ukrainian ethnically (and don't want to join Russia) and also because they have become the front line of a war waged by Russia and their separatists (the invasion of Crimea was comparatively quick and did not result in many civilian casualties). If we look back to the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum, ~84% of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts still voted for an independent Ukraine, so despite the Russian minority this was never an area where most people wanted to be part of Russia.

By comparison, only 54% of voters in Crimea voted for Ukrainian independence, probably reflecting the Russian ethnic majority of the region. Crimea also had one of the lowest voter turnout rates for the referendum. Enthusiasm for being part of Ukraine was never as high in Crimea as compared to other parts of the country. That being said, apparently 71.3% of Crimeans felt Ukraine was their ""motherland"" in a 2011 survey, so it's still not like the region necessarily loves being part of Russia, it's more like they probably don't feel as strongly overall about the situation since many of them are Russian themselves.

It's a group of people that believe they were robbed by their elders and arguably were. This in turn leads to zero attachment to their community and nation.

Would it be surprising then, if they then focused solely on the flaws of the country they believe betrayed them? From there, it's easy to fall into conspiratorial thinking, which leads to crank magnetism. In this case, if you believe your nation is bad, you sympathize with it's enemies and villify its allies.

First  - it would be demoralising for Ukraine to let the public know the real numbers of their losses. From a purely war tactics, it makes total sense for Ukraine not to disclose this information right now. I think we can safely assume that Ukraine has taken quite a few losses too, especially as the Americans, when they have revealed their estimates of Russian-Ukrainian losses, the Ukrainian losses are less than Russian ones, but still significant (IIRC, when the Americans claimed that in their estimate Russia had lost about 5000-6000 people, the Ukrainians in their opinion had also lost some 3000-4000, so less than RUS, but still a significant amount. The US numbers are also conservative in nature). 

Secondly - as much as I hate to say it, the Russian army isn't that incompetent. What we've seen has been a concentration of 1) bad logistics; 2) improper prep work for the invasion in general, such as bad/wrong intelligence and wrong judging of society's reception; 3) maintenance issues within the army due to either corruption or neglect etc. Despite all of this, however, the Russians did manage to advance significantly before the ukrainians started to push them back. It's been said several times that although the russian army is not as fearsome as it has portrayed itself to be, it shouldn't underestimated still.

There was no need to invade much further than the provincial (oblast?) borders.  He also likely wouldn't have been sanctioned as heavily had he tempered the scope.  He could have blamed this whole thing on Azov extremists and called Mariupol his goal (which happens to secure an overland route to Crimea).

Basically the full scale thing was a huge mistake predicated on the belief his military was a lot stronger than it really is, and Ukraine was a lot weaker/more corrupt than it really is.

This is how I know the current reduced scope is a crock of shit.  He could have just, yknow, **done that** instead of this month long waste of time and resources and sanctions and getting globally ostracized.

I *assumed* Western powers would be okay with a small bite and slap sanctions to scale.  **Never** in a million years did I think Russia would be stupid enough to go all-in, not because i'm some fantastic military analyst (i'm not) but because it seemed so fucking unnecessary for what their true goal was - secure lucrative resources and an important land bridge to Crimea.  Going all-in was so fucking dumb and may (will? has??) end up costing them far more than if they'd just called the whole thing off: financially, economically, influentially, and militarily.  They truly, completely jumped with glee into a giant puddle of shit.  All this is just scrambling to save face and pretend they still have influence - and as the walk-back of oil in rubles shows, they are chickenshit and megafucked.",1648664117.0,1648662841.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2qplec,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

Once you have that number of explosives, it turns out that you don't need much guidance at all. Just kill everybody in the area. This is what artillery does.

This is what people are talking about when they say ""Russian Shelling with GRADs"". This has been going on for over a month now constantly in Ukraine. Its cheap, its effective (well, effective at killing at least. I don't think the Russians are using them with the right technique though).

You can ""saturate"" an entire area of explosives roughly 30km away, as long as you know what you're aiming at. That's the point of artillery, killing large groups of people in an entire square-kilometer indescriminately, cheaply, and simply.

>Article 6 states that the treaty covers only member states' territories in Europe and North America, Turkey and islands in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer, plus French Algeria. It was the opinion in August 1965 of the US State Department, the US Defense Department and the legal division of NATO that an attack on the U.S. state of Hawaii would not trigger the treaty, but an attack on the other 49 would.[62] The Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African shore are thus not under NATO protection in spite of Moroccan claims to them. Legal experts have interpreted that other articles could cover the Spanish North African cities but this take has not been tested in practice.[63] This is also why events such as the Balyun airstrikes did not trigger Article 5, as the Turkish troops that were attacked were in Syria, not Turkey.[64]

Why did he alienate the markets for his fuel, ensuring that Europe would accelerate their move to a future free of Russian energy?

- Russian diplomats will not be trusted for generations.

 >The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (Japanese: 大東亜共栄圏, Hepburn: Dai Tōa Kyōeiken), or the GEACPS, was an imperialist concept which was developed in the Empire of Japan and propagated to Asian populations which were occupied by it from 1931 to 1945. It extended across the Asia-Pacific and promoted the cultural and economic unity of East Asians, Southeast Asians, South Asians and Oceanians. It also declared the intention to create a self-sufficient bloc of Asian nations which would be led by the Japanese and be free from the rule of Western powers. The idea was first announced on 1 August 1940 in a radio address delivered by Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka.

Outside of rebellions and fighting Turkey, Russia has struggled in the first year or two of fighting in major wars. WW1 being the major exception.

President Vladimir Putin had instructed the Russian government to develop a plan for switching payment for gas supplies to rubles starting next month. As a result, consumer countries had to expect Russia to insist on this from April 1.

However, there is little reason to see the current announcement as a concession.

Russia will not immediately demand that other countries pay for its gas exports in rubles, the Kremlin said Wednesday. It promised a gradual transition and said Russia should work on an idea to expand the list of its exports that must be paid for in rubles.

President Vladimir Putin had instructed the Russian government to develop a plan on how to switch payment for gas supplies to rubles starting next month. As a result, consumer countries had to expect Russia to insist on it starting April 1.

On Thursday, the government, central bank and gas company Gazprom are to present their proposals for the switch. Asked if payment would have to be made in rubles as early as Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""Absolutely not.""
More commodities to be settled in rubles soon?

However, there is little reason to take these remarks as a concession. Parliamentary leader Vyacheslav Volodin warned the European Union that if it wanted Russian natural gas, it would have to pay in rubles. Exports of oil, grain, metals, fertilizers, coal and timber could also soon be paid for in the same way. Commenting on these remarks, Peskov said, ""This is an idea that should definitely be worked on.""

The G7 countries refuse to pay for energy supplies exclusively in rubles and not in euros or dollars. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck had rejected this after a meeting with G7 energy ministers on Monday. A Russian government spokesman had explained postwendend that one wanted to stop then the supplies. It is unclear whether Moscow will carry out this threat.

However, the Federal Minister of Economics has decided to create all possibilities to prepare for such a development with the early warning stage of the gas emergency plan. He activated the early warning stage this Wednesday.

Germany must be prepared for ""the event of an escalation on the part of Russia,"" Habeck said. Therefore, he said, the precautionary measures are necessary, even if there are currently no bottlenecks in gas supplies. He said that this Wednesday, ""after coordination within the German government,"" he informed the European Commission ""that the German government has declared the first stage of the gas emergency plan, the so-called early warning stage."" Germany will ""not accept any breach of the supply agreements."" The G7 classifies Moscow's announcement as such.

And overuse of the word ""we"". Suggesting familiarity or membership that has not been established. ""we who?"" you should always ask.

Serfs today have some things much better than serfs centuries ago. There's better medical care, better food, cleaner water (although still not for everyone). But even in the United States we struggle to afford to go the doctor. Most people are a few missed paychecks from being on the street. Most people live in a condition of being forced to work for the more wealthy property owners in order to afford basic necessities - and many, especially those below the poverty line - are culturally conditioned to believe that anything above and beyond their needs is gaudy and unnecessary.

We get just enough to be comfortable, but never enough to stop working for the actual owners(one still has to actively put aside for retirement while they are able to earn income).

Ergo, anyone who is in a position where they can't stop working is existing in a dynamic of serfdom. Our society currently functions by keeping a certain percentage of the population in that condition.

Edit- I guess I should mention this isn't like a sneaky organic attempt at defending communism either. I just think after a certain percentage of the population exists in a condition of serfdom, we need to examine what is allowing a small fraction of the population to leech off of the rest like that. Income is vital to self-determination, and if a majority of lowest earning citizens exist in a state of serfdom, people are probably not being paid fairly for their work.",1648695004.0,1648694729.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2sqbl1,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

“It will work?!”

Soldiers really don't know what they're doing for a year. Relying on several hundred thousand clueless Young conscripts isn't how you build a professional, competent military.

Clue number two is the lack of advanced War college level training for Russian officers. They have informal, poorly structured classes for junior officers, but nothing that trains senior officers in broader strategic theory or even large scale logistics and supply.

Clue number three the continued use of top down directed planning. Senior commanders make plans and direct small units, with little room for junior officers to improvise or redirect attacks. Units get to their objectives with no understanding of what the wider goals are, so they sit and wait for their next objective.

Finally Russia lacks a professional NCO corps. NCOs, sergeants, are the backbone of Western militaries. Russia relies on junior officers to lead enlisted soldiers, which is much less effective especially an army that relies on large numbers of conscripts.

 >The resource curse, also known as the paradox of plenty or the poverty paradox, is the phenomenon of countries with an abundance of natural resources (such as fossil fuels and certain minerals) having less economic growth, less democracy, or worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. There are many theories and much academic debate about the reasons for, and exceptions to, these adverse outcomes. Most experts believe the resource curse is not universal or inevitable, but affects certain types of countries or regions under certain conditions.

Today most of the radiation is coming from long-lived isotopes like transuranics, and not the *really really* nasty short-lived fission products. So the radiation that the original victims were exposed to would be many orders of magnitude greater than what you'd be exposed to today. I still wouldn't go near that place, though.

At extremely high doses, like you'd get exposing yourself to chunks of a reactor core that was operating at full power just a day or two ago ([or handling a nuclear weapon core like idiot and causing it to go critical while you're holding the damn thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core)), you can sterilize your body and destroy your cells' ability to replicate successfully; essentially, you're a walking corpse just waiting for the tissue to break down. This can take days to weeks.

At lower acute doses like you'd get digging in the Red Forest after 38 years of the nastiest shit decaying, you'd probably get acute symptoms; nausea, headache, diarrhea, fatigue and weakness. If you got a real bad dose, you may need blood transfusions and stem cell transplants as radiation is very damaging to marrow, but that's usually the extent of it.

tl;dr - It probably true that you can fry yourself so bad than an IV wouldn't be possible, but it's unlikely you'd get hit that bad so long after the disaster (unless their CO had them in those foxholes 24/7 all month, which I wouldn't put it past Russia at this point).",1648691378.0,1648690985.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2sg3d9,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

**Abstract**  
[...]
>There were 28 short term deaths of which 95% occurred at whole body doses in excess of 6.5 Gy. Underlying bone marrow failure was the main contributor to all deaths during the first 2 mo. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation was performed on 13 patients and an additional six received human fetal liver cells. All of these patients died except one individual who later was discovered to have recovered his own marrow and rejected the transplant. Two or three patients were felt to have died as a result of transplant complications. Skin doses exceeded bone marrow doses by a factor of 10-30, and at least 19 of the deaths were felt to be primarily due to infection from large area beta burns. ",False,1648690181.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2sg3d9,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Russian people have a hard-on for victories of war because of USSR and defeating Nazism. You tell them that Russia needs to beat Nazis and they’ll gladly starve for the chance - not even kidding, their propaganda on military, defeating Nazism, on being the righteous country that can still defeat Nazism is extremely strong and they start teaching their kids about it very early on; everybody who basically opposes Russia in the west is either liberally brainwashed or a Nazi, basically.

Domestic ignorance about war crimes at the time can be attributed to a less information rich society. Most notably, WMDs is a lie many people had to fall for once in order to not fall for it again.

 >Article 6 states that the treaty covers only member states' territories in Europe and North America, Turkey and islands in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer, plus French Algeria. It was the opinion in August 1965 of the US State Department, the US Defense Department and the legal division of NATO that an attack on the U.S. state of Hawaii would not trigger the treaty, but an attack on the other 49 would. The Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African shore are thus not under NATO protection in spite of Moroccan claims to them.

The president isn't usually an expert military strategist. That's why you have the experts work for you and you let them do the planning and everything else.

Like Zelenskyy shouldn't be doing all the military planning becuese he just isn't as qualified as the people who are commanders in Ukrainians military. But that's not a slight that's a good thing. Work to your strengths and try to minimize your weaknesses.

Take Dwight D. Eisenhower in world war 2. He wasn't the best at any one thing but he did put people in charge of certain things who were far better than him. When he needed bastogne to get reinforcements during the battle of the bulge he didn't go to any random military commander he asked Patton.

It's almost certain their nuclear arsenal is significantly degraded below their public claims; Russia's shambolic, rotten military capability has shocked even the most astute observers. No doubt their nuclear force has suffered under similar corruption.

But that's not necessarily a good thing, because even if half of their strategic arsenal has been stripped for parts to fund mega-yachts, they still have more than enough to end the world. And corruption breeds problems: nobody in Russia's military is in the habit of asking questions. You don't ask why the major's buddy is allowed access to the maintenance area after hours. You don't tell anyone you sell half the rations your unit receives on the black market. And you probably don't start making a fuss when someone orders you to load a bomber munition that doesn't look quite right.

The actual state of Russia's nuclear arsenal and the controls over its use - particularly in a one-off tactical settings - are unknown, I suspect even to Putin. That's the problem with a kleptocracy; everyone is grifting, everyone is lying, and *nobody* actually knows the true state of affairs. If the clusterfuck of Russia's invasion has shown anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, it's that not even the highest leadership in Russia has the faintest idea what's going on.

 >A weasel word, or anonymous authority, is an informal term for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated. Examples include the phrases ""some people say"", ""most people think"", and ""researchers believe"". Using weasel words may allow one to later deny any specific meaning if the statement is challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place. Weasel words can be a form of tergiversation and may be used in advertising, (popular) science, opinion pieces and political statements to mislead or disguise a biased view.
 
**[Hyperbole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole)** 
 
 >Hyperbole (, listen; adjective form hyperbolic, listen) is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. In rhetoric, it is also sometimes known as auxesis (literally 'growth'). In poetry and oratory, it emphasizes, evokes strong feelings, and creates strong impressions. As a figure of speech, it is usually not meant to be taken literally.
 
**[Persuasive definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasive_definition)** 
 
 >A persuasive definition is a form of stipulative definition which purports to describe the true or commonly accepted meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes. The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as ""freedom"", ""terrorism"", ""democracy"", etc. In argumentation the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called definist fallacy. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.

Even if the Russians can take it, I don't think they could hold it. I'm not saying nukes are some kind of a guaranteed play that will definitely happen, but tactical nukes are still a real possibility. They're dangerous but smaller and precise with lower fallout and they're still a very plausible option, regardless of what Putina says.

Edit: I'm getting downvoted for suggesting tactical nukes, so I want to clarify, because i think there's a big misunderstanding between what I'm saying and what people are imagining. Small tactical nukes, the kind I'm referring to, are often surface detonated and VERY controlled compared to ones used in Hiroshima for example. They can selectively level just a few city blocks. People are saying it's not an option because of Fallout, so I wanted to clarify how Fallout is calculated. The amount of fallout generated by a nuclear explosion is proportional to the height at which it was detonated. Since I already used Hiroshima as an example, the fallout from those were absolutely massive in comparison to something like a small tactical nuke, because the nukes used in Hiroshima have an ""effective detonation height"" of about 160m. On a small tactical nuke that's surface detonated however, the fallout could be kept within a few miles. I'm not trying to get anyone hyped up over nothing, I'm not saying it's a sure thing he's going to use something like that, but regrettably, they are something Russia possesses and could decide to use with little to no concern on it effecting Russia or another NATO country.

But as CIA Director George Tenet noted in early 2004, the CIA had informed policymakers it had ""no specific information on the types or quantities of weapons agent or stockpiles at Baghdad's disposal."" The ""massive stockpile"" was just literally made up.  
>  
>In December 2002, Bush declared, ""We do not know whether or not \[Iraq\] has a nuclear weapon."" That was not what the National Intelligence Estimate said. As Tenet would later testify, ""We said that Saddam did not have a nuclear weapon and probably would have been unable to make one until 2007 to 2009."" Bush did know whether or not Iraq had a nuclear weapon — and lied and said he didn’t know to hype the threat.  
>  
>On CNN in September 2002, Condoleezza Rice claimed that aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq were ""only really suited for nuclear weapons programs."" This was precisely the opposite of what nuclear experts at the Energy Department were saying; they argue that not only was it very possible the tubes were for nonnuclear purposes but that it was very likely they were too. Even more dire assessments about the tubes from other agencies were exaggerated by administration officials — and in any case, the claim that they’re ""only really suited"" for nuclear weapons is just false.  
>  
>On numerous occasions, Dick Cheney cited a report that 9/11 conspirator Mohammed Atta had met in Prague with an Iraqi intelligence officer. He said this after the CIA and FBI concluded that this meeting never took place.  
>  
>More generally on the question of Iraq and al-Qaeda, on September 18, 2001, Rice received a memo summarizing intelligence on the relationship, which concluded there was little evidence of links. Nonetheless Bush continued to claim that Hussein was ""a threat because he’s dealing with al-Qaeda"" more than a year later.  
>  
>In August 2002, Dick Cheney declared, ""Simply stated, there's no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction."" But as Corn notes, at that time there was ""no confirmed intelligence at this point establishing that Saddam had revived a major WMD operation."" Gen. Anthony Zinni, who had heard the same intelligence and attended Cheney’s speech, would later say in a documentary, ""It was a total shock. I couldn't believe the vice president was saying this, you know? In doing work with the CIA on Iraq WMD, through all the briefings I heard at Langley, I never saw one piece of credible evidence that there was an ongoing program.""

Case in point, the Russian vehicles that broke down because they were running Chinese knockoffs of Michelin tires.  That’s part of the irony of this war.  Russian weapons are dependent on western supply chains.  Didn’t really know that much of the Soviet/Russian arsenal was either designed or built in Ukraine itself.  Go figure.  Chinese military quality is largely unknown.  They haven’t fought a real war against a real enemy, not ethnic minorities or protesting university students, in decades.  Much of their designs are Russian derivatives (“knock-offs”).  The PLA is engaged in much corruption and largely conscript driven like the Russians.  It’s hard to say what their effectiveness will actually.  So far, this war has proven that western military tech is better than Russian designs.  As knock-offs tend to be lower quality, can only imagine that Chinese tech would be in the tier below Russia’s until proven otherwise.

Of course it's self-evident to us that the Putin narrative is bullshit. But that's how these bubbles work.

But that point I was making is that even those lies have at least some shade of truth to them. Not all pro-Russian attitudes and activities in Ukraine were astroturfing. There is (or until the war, there *was*) a not insignificant amount of pro-Russia sentiment and cultural affinity among a large minority of Ukrainians who were leery of drifting to far westward. The new Ukrainian government did take steps and pass laws moving Ukraine closer towards a national goal and identity that many of them weren't comfortable with.

Not only that, NATO is a *defensive* alliance, Russia isn't really arguing its going to be a security concern for them, it isn't, what they're concerned about is that it hurts their ability to invade sovereign nations. It hurts their geopolitical strength and ability to fight wars against smaller neighbors.

They were upset Ukraine could try and join NATO because it meant they couldn't invade Ukraine, so they had to invade Ukraine to stop them from joining NATO. See Crimea 2014, Donbass 2016 and Georgia multiple times.

Well, no, people write that off because it came at a cost that far outweighed the advantages. Yes, he managed to pull away some (not all) of Ukraine's coastline so far, and he's pretty much out of cards to play. Even in this scenario, we're talking about the major damage being done and Putin basically cashing out now, before things get worse on his end. The only alternative is to keep shelling the rubble until they run out of shells, all the while getting torn apart by Ukrainian forces, since they've proven incapable of meaningfully advancing.

What did he trade for that? *All* of Russia's soft power on the global stage. *All* of their military legitimacy. *All* of their trust. Their economy has been blown to smithereens, they've removed millions of their own citizens from the global economy and hoisted them into poverty, they're arresting Holocaust survivors in the streets on YouTube. Their enemies are more united than ever and now wholly focused on mitigating ""the Russia problem"".

Was that really worth gaining a slightly firmer hold on Eastern Ukraine's energy reserves, now that no one but China and Brazil want their energy anyways? Is the current Russian regime going to *last* a decade to see their BRIC dream play out when their best plan for luring in new members is to shell the everloving shit out of their major cities?

I'm not writing it off - people are dying by the thousands - but I am definitely comfortable calling Putin's Special Operation a complete and total failure.

 Russia can no longer keep its western flank in tow via commerce or ideology. If Ukraine developed these oil and gas resources and shipped them west it would basically make Russia a backwater petrostate like Iran or Saudi Arabia.

So while it's quite likely this I'd about resources I think you have the plan backwards. Russia doesn't want to set up some new world order where they are the oil field for the BRICS. The oligarchs aren't parking their yachts in Shanghai or Rio.

They wanted to make sure they remain indispensable to Europe so that they could continue to use their military to push around their near neighbors.

To ensure it was watertight the government immediately passed a new act of parliament (law) a couple of weeks ago with opposition support: The Economic Crime Act. This plugged any holes they were worried about in that regard. They're also introducing Unexplained Wealth Orders which will basically allow for seizure that puts the burden of proof on the seized party to prove how they funded the asset etc.

If you will get spotted there, your guide just lost his job and you will get kicked out as well.
  
Original Red Forest is just a plain at the moment 700 meters from the Reactor 4 that exploded. Trees have been cut down and buried in trenches couple hundred meters away from the famous Pripyat 1970 road sign.  
  
Red Forest is a really dangerous place, you can still dig out parts of fuel and FCM [fuel containing masses] from the exploded reactor number 4 there.
  
Here's are some pics from my last trip in October 2021 from the area of Red Forest, those small mountains with radiation signs are trenches where trees from Red Forest were buried. Other pic also shows New Sarcophagus from western side [only visible from Red Forest].

Russians are really fucking stupid to get there without any protection at all especially using a heavy equipment which causes the radioactive particles from the soil to fly in the air.

Russia has nothing to benefit from or to gain from launching nuclear weapons. Nothing, nada, zero. What the hell would be the point of using tactical nukes at this point?

By a huge margin the easiest explanation is just temporal: both Clapper and Brennan were out of power for some time when the Hunter Biden story actually had any details to it. And I'm sure, in their experience (Brennan's especially) 99% of bullshit that appears in front of you at all times is Russian disinformation simply because there's so much of it - even if Trump has nothing to do with it (which seems unlikely to me).

The most effective propaganda has the air of truth about it, and sometimes (when you are lucky) an actual element of truth to it.

edit: It's worth noting too, the recent headline is: ""no evidence has emerged to back up suspicions from former intelligence officials, backed by Biden himself, that the laptop's leak was a Russian plot.""^[1]

This is essentially gaslighting in the form of journalism.

There are three cases, all three of which will satisfy the claim [1]:

* it's a successfully run Russian operation, in which case the CIA has no info about it - no evidence (Russia won't talk)
* it's an unsuccessfully run Russian operation, in which case the CIA has info - no evidence (protecting sources)

Political liberalism fought against the power of monarchy and churches over people, against social stratification, against disenfranchisement and for universal suffrage, equal rights for everyone and strong social programs - see e.g. JS Mill, or John Rawls.

As an example - these are Rawls first and second principles of justice:

> Each person has the same and indefeasible [permanent] claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all. [maximal under condition of equality and stability]

and 

> Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions:
> first, they are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and
>  second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the Difference Principle).

This is from the most influential liberal thinker of the last 100 years. Quite a stretch to not see this as left wing. The difference principle especially.

Liberalism is a big tent that extends to the center and has (with neoliberalism) center-right proponents, but that's neither the historical origin nor anything approaching a majority. So I'd argue it's not misused in this context.

>Tasks: The Russian plane was equipped with nuclear weapons

>UPDATED TODAY 12:42PUBLISHED TODAY 10:57

>Two of the four Russian planes that violated Swedish airspace were equipped with nuclear weapons, TV4 Nyheterna reports.
The Armed Forces does not want to confirm the channel's information, but believes that there is currently no cause for concern:

>There is no increased threat to Sweden here and now. On the other hand, we can not rule out a threat or attack from Russia in the long term, says the Swedish Armed Forces' Chief of Air Force Carl-Johan Edström to SVT.
In total, there are four Russian planes that violated Swedish airspace on 2 March this year. The attack plane must have been of the type SU 24 and escorted by a fighter plane of the type SU 27.

>According to TV4 Nyheterna, it is the SU 24 plan that must have been equipped with nuclear weapons. According to the channel, they must have been careful to show that they were equipped with nuclear weapons.

>Exactly how the Russian planes were armed, there is nothing we comment on at the moment. What I want to point out is that if we had seen an increased threat to Sweden, we would have informed about this, says Air Force Chief Carl-Johan Edström.

>The plane must have been on Swedish territory for about a minute. The violation took place east of Gotland.

>""Weapons hung on the outside""
The air force deployed two JAS 39 Gripen to ward off but also photograph the Russian planes. Something that could mean that the Swedish Armed Forces know what type of weapon they were carrying:

>In general, it can be said that most aircraft from Russia have their weapons hung on the outside, says Carl-Johan Edström.

>After the incident, a Russian representative was called up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

>There are established procedures for this type of case. These include calling a representative from the offending nation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It's sadly also worth noting that, as we've seen from the GOP and Trump - Russian psyops and propaganda have been in full effect for the past few years. Older generations in the United States still remember the Cold War and likely still associate Russia as a threat if they're running around doing ANYTHING warlike. Young people though, if they're not educated, are more likely to doubt themselves, be influenced by social media, or far-right propaganda.

And, although it's gruesome to cite it, Korematsu and the other cases that allowed the detention and forced migration and seizure of assets of Japanese Americans would almost certainly allow the government to target and seize the assets of a foreigner without compensation in support of a foreign policy or national security interest.

I think the government has a few different ways it could justify this. National security aims fall under the umbrella of Korematsu + progeny case law, and seizure of assets in connection to criminal wrongdoing can probably survive under the civil forfeiture jurisprudence, even without criminal charging the foreigners whose property they're taking.

How do you pay back lost territory? It wasn't just the British. Some of the richest families in America like the Roosevelts and others made part of their fortune on the back of the opium trade. America promoted the ""Open Door"" policy in China, which meant that whatever concessions Britain got, America demanded as well. Which is why the US Navy had a ""China squadron"" pre WW2. The first casualty in the war in the Pacific was actually an American gunboat, purposely sunk by the Japanese several years prior to Pearl Harbor.

Also, part of the Russian traditional paranoia towards the West also stems from the British and American intervention during the Russian civil war. Which is something that unless you take a college history course, you will not be taught about. We launched 2 separate invasions of Russia, one in the NW and one on the Pacific. That very much colored the view of Russian nationalists in the Soviet Union.

I'm not defending Chinese nationalism, which is entirely stupid and like everywhere else, is used as a political tool to manipulate the public. I was part of the post Tinanemen Square generation when the CCP hardliners realizing that the liberalization of the 80s made China vulnerable to Western values. In response they dialed up the nationalism back up to a 10 and I got spoon fed on TV how the West is always evil and everything's the CIA's fault.

Coming to 90's America was mostly a breathe of fresh air compared to that sort of environment. As 90's America had swagger and wasn't filled with spite and anger and lashing out. But 9/11 changed all that and Fox News became the US version of Chinese government TV. Literally using many of the same talking points.

 >A criticality accident is an accidental uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reaction. It is sometimes referred to as a critical excursion, critical power excursion, or divergent chain reaction. Any such event involves the unintended accumulation or arrangement of a critical mass of fissile material, for example enriched uranium or plutonium. Criticality accidents can release potentially fatal radiation doses, if they occur in an unprotected environment.

You are absolute right that individualism is a big part of liberalism - but that individualism isn't absolute. The persistence and stability of a society that can guarantee and protect the rights of all individuals is essential to political liberalism - as such individualism which severely harms or threatens the stability and persistence of such a system is not ""covered"", because this then threatens the liberty of future generations.

Liberalist individualism is mostly in opposition to the kind of collectivism espoused by conservative/illiberal regimes (e.g. Nazis/USSR/China) where the perceived ""good of the nation"" is taken as a legitimization to enforce uniformity and suppress the freedom of individuals to self-determination.

Of course one might ask if the limits to individualism in liberalism I sketched aren't basically the same thing, or rest on the same principles as these arguments from authoritarian regimes wrt to ""the greater good"" - but that's where the first principle of justice comes in - the set of liberties to be guaranteed should still be maximal and only (self)-limited by the condition that it must be coherent and consistent with everyone having the same set of liberties and the persistence/stability of a society able to provide and protect those liberties in the future as well (which is why liberalism has no problem arguing for restricing economic 'liberties' which threaten environmental preconditions for the persistence of liberal societies or even human life)",False,1648629713.0,t3_trthc7,t1_i2owg1r,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
