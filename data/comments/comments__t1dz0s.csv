>...A final point is we know that Putin is obsessed with his historical legacy. History is one of the few things he reads.

But secondly, it gives us a sense of where his head is at.

>I think from his point of view, you know, he’s 69. He can rule for only some years to come politically, but he’s probably getting old and he’s getting tired. It’s fairly obvious that he is tired and bored with much of the job. The last thing he wants is for his legacy in the history books to be the guy who lost Ukraine, the guy who rolled over and let NATO and the West have their way.

>So I think this is also about him feeling this is … I wouldn’t say his last chance, but one of his last chances to stand up for Russia and make sure that Russia asserts its real place in the world, forces the West to acknowledge that and in the process, that’s what gets him into the history books, **[so] he’s a chapter rather than just a paragraph.""**

While we will work to address any mistaken removals, which have occurred, we would like to remind users of a few areas where removals are consistent with sitewide policy:

* First, advocating for assassinating/killing or torturing leaders of nations is a direct violation of the sitewide rule against harm. We know that many users are extremely frustrated and angry at political leaders seen as responsible for this war and its humanitarian consequences, but this has been a firm rule for years now. Expressing any other manner of displeasure or anger at political leaders (provided it doesn't explicitly violate other sitewide rules, such as the ones against promoting hate speech) remain perfectly acceptable. 

* To that point, we have also noticed users suggesting that the Russian President is gay. We understand that the origin of this statement is not necessarily rooted in hate but rather as a form of protest as it's been alleged that Putin dislikes being associated with this rumor. Nevertheless, some of these comments will cross a line for us and the site as a whole if they play on hateful stereotypes and tropes about LGBT individuals. We will continue to be as deferential as possible to non-hateful interpretations of these comments to the extent possible, but just want to remind users that there is a limit to how they express such sentiments.

* Finally, there have been comments that promote hate against the Russian people and culture in general which we and the site construe as promoting hate on the basis of an identity. Russia is a country of 145 million people, with a rich and diverse culture. It's also a country where people are far from uniformly supportive of this war. Thousands of Russians risked detention to go out and protest against this war and many have reportedly been arrested, and 1/3 of Russia's armed forces are conscripts who do not necessarily harbor a desire to go to war. Painting with a broad brush to promote hate against the Russian people is never appropriate discourse, especially at a time when tensions are so high. That being said, we will continue to be as deferential as possible to non-hateful interpretations of these comments to the extent possible, where ""Russian"" or ""Russians"" can reasonably be interpreted to be referring to the Russian government and leadership.",False,1645821855.0,t3_t1dz0s,t3_t1dz0s,moderator,0,328,0,328,0,0,

Now for some analysis from experts:

[My report on day two of the war. Not the blitzkrieg  that the Kremlin seemed to have hoped for, and Ukrainian resistance has been impressive. But be wary of firm conclusions. Half of Russian combat power not yet committed & Kyiv not yet seriously tested.](https://twitter.com/shashj/status/1497318303936745472) 

A very long but fascinating thread on Russias early moves, some of which this commentator says are puzzling:

[Some very early impressions of the last two days. It's an operation with maximalist war aims, and Moscow's thinking on this war seems to have been colored by war optimism. It looked as though Russian forces were expecting a quicker UKR military collapse and easier gains.]
(https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1497222922431254531) 

Some more tidbits:

Main breakout appears to be in the south from Crimea. Russian forces pushed to Kherson, and Melitopol. There's sustained fighting for Kherson still and around Antonovsky bridge. Some early signs they may have entered Mykolaiv, but probably just a recon element

Russian forces retain significant quantitative and qualitative superiority. UKR forces have demonstrated resolve & resilience.

Black, radioactive rain. Even if someone survived everything else, the rain will poison them. Almost all will die of cancer. Help can’t reach them at first, whether because of radiation or because everything was destroyed and the roads are obscured by debris.

It's a lie.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

This is called the fog of war, and you need to use logic and reason when considering how much weight you give these type of stories. Just think, does it make sense that Ukraine would not only conscribe and bar 18-60 year olds from leaving the country, begging civilians to join the fight and molotov the enemy, and Ukraine begging to reopen negotiation channels that they themselves closed yesterday. If you consider all of these facts, along with their general request of any volunteer fighters in all of EU, it is pretty safe to say they are not being very successful in this whole conflict. They lost pretty much all of their air capabilities in the first hour, and haven't really faced any real combat but rather VERY SMALL skirmishes.

There would be regular CAP ops (combat air patrols) and AWACS coverage to ensure the airspace isn't penetrated.  There is precedent for this very tactic in places that Russia has operated aircraft in, even recently like in Syria.

While engaging Russian aircraft directly is provocative, it's been done before as far back as the Korean War. Traditionally thought it's far less escalatory than boots on the ground and direct military assistance such as air strikes on Russian ground materiel.

“I don't think it takes a grand geopolitical analyst to know that an offer of diplomacy as you rain down bombs, mortar shells, as your tanks advance towards a capital of 2.9 million people as your forces encircle, a capital as your political leaders make demands of demilitarization, make demands of a fundamentally neutral foreign policy, essentially removing agency that Kyiv should otherwise have, that is not the context in which diplomacy can succeed,” he added.",False,1645825276.0,t3_t1dz0s,t1_hyfng80,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

* A total demilitarisation of Ukraine, no more weapons within its borders

**Ukraine can't guarentee these things even if they want to.** Why would the *word* Ukraine won't join NATO hold any water when so many previous treaties have already been stamped upon? And how COULD Ukraine even properly demilitarise on its own when both parties know if the Ukrainian government asked all its civillians/battalions to turn in their weapons, a huge amount would refuse and continue fighting in guerilla warfare?

Russia has has everything they need without having to rely on the economy. They aren't concerned about what happens economically as they can recover afterwards from a stronger position, fueled by imperialism. Or perhaps they don't care what comes after at all, it's hard to say. As territory is captured russia will become increasingly solvent without being as impacted by sanctions

Of what russia imports (imported), 25% is vehicles and machinery and 14% of it is food. The only food that is important is what can keep the greater population alive and its army fighting. Russia is a net exporter. If there's an embargo on Russia, I don't see a reason they would not remain solvent provided the war was not overly taxing on the rest of the government. Continuing to capture resources may help to lessen the strain of a prolonged war

To the people saying that it's throwing away soldiers.. When a soldier dies that means that he doesn't need to be fed or equipped anymore. Complimenting the movement of troops and supplies to offset losses and used consumables can effeciently. Confronting militaries who want to preserve every life and hesitate constantly for the possibility of negotiation would theoritically give russia an edge in an all out war. Like sun tsu said, something something if you treat your forces overly well they won't be used at peak effectiveness 

Russia's military is (officially) about a quarter the size of nato's, but we don't know for certain what their tactics or their allies will be but it's obvious what the response will be. The rest of the world is entirely predictable to the point that they have it in writing how they will respond to any given situation.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov threatened in 2016 to ""take necessary measures"" to prevent Swedish NATO membership. According to a poll conducted by Sifo in June 2016, more Swedes are against a Swedish NATO membership than in favour of one. A government-sponsored report on the future of Sweden's NATO membership was released in September 2016.

Also, many Swedes were still relatively happy about the outcome of WWII (in which we were almost as bad as the Swiss, allowing Germany to run trains through our country and selling resources to all sides) and the half a century of stable peace that followed. During this half century, we also managed to have a pretty good spot in foreign politics, often being able to work as a mediator between states at war, since we were considered genuinely neutral.

As the political landscape of the world changed, Sweden transitioned more to being a ""close strategic partner"" of NATO. Allowing fly-overs of recon aircraft, carrying out exercises together, sharing intel, carrying out officially non-lethal operations in NATO-led conflicts and ensuring that all our military hardware was NATO compatible. People have been wanting to both have the cake and eat it in some ways, being relatively confident that if WWIII were to break out (which was seen as pretty much the only invasion scenario), we would align with the western world anyway, and it would be in NATOs interest to control the Baltic sea.

This scenario that Russia outright invades a country just to deter it from joining NATO is new and strange, it is also strange that NATO has so far been so apprehensive of finding alternative ways of supporting this country (until now very recently, that the flow of materiel seems to have started again).

If we're really going to only take the sanctions/aid approach that we seem to be taking, then we need to be ready to ostracize Russia for years to come. This cannot be a short term solution. Putin is gambling on that. His plan hinges on two likelihoods:

1) If he threatens to use nukes, the west will back down from any direct military action and not defend Ukraine for fear of starting World War III.

2) If he takes Ukraine quickly enough, the west will be unable to maintain the rage over it and tensions will die down fast enough that Russia's economic fallout is survivable.

To be clear - #1 is a bluff. If we took military action in Ukraine itself, but kept out of Russia then Putin wouldn't even consider using nukes. Nukes are the final action that any country can take, and such an act would only be the last and most desperate option. Putin is not an idiot despite what he wants us to think.

With that said though, the west seems to be unwilling to take the gamble of calling Putin's bluff on #1. Western leaders have looked at the downsides and decided they just aren't worth the risk for Ukraine. So that means we NEED to overcome Putin's gamble on #2.

Their modern arsenal is absolutely scary. Their Poseidon project, is a nuclear submersible drone. It has no crew and there for is smaller and quieter than a normal submarine. It is a stealth submersible with a 100Mt payload. The idea is that it can navigate into a harbor or up a river and sit on the sea floor for years never moving from its spot. When needed, it will detonate and cause a Tsunami that is a 100m high.

Their Avangard program is reportedly a missile that can travel at mock 20 (20x the speed of sound!) while still maintaining sharp maneuvers to evade anti-missile defenses.

But let's assume we are talking about a more traditional payload. Something in the 4Mt range. For reference, the U.S. uses Titan 2 as their main nuclear arsenal with has a 9Mt payload.

This would cause a fireball with a radius (not diameter) of 2.19 km.

At 7.27km from the blast is the zone in which most residential structures will begin to stay standing.

About 18.7km from the blast zone is when windows begin to not be broken from the blast.

And about 19.4km is the distance that you'd need to be to avoid getting 3rd degree burns on any exposed skin.

As for radiation the zone that a nuclear bomb gives off radiation that will 100% kill you is within the blast zone that would most likely kill you. But that isn't the only form of radiation. There is what is called fallout. This is the dust that the explosion has kicked up into the atmosphere that travels for hundreds of kilometers before settling. It's this dust, especially if ingested or inhaled, that causes death. The dust simply on your skin or clothes is bad. But not nearly as bad as breathing it in. Sheltering in place for 2 weeks is enough time for the radiation to decay by more than 50%.",False,1645824466.0,t3_t1dz0s,t1_hyfinbc,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

That 'accidental explosion' would contaminate Belarus and Russia too. They're *well* within any blast radius it could cause, even if it wouldn't be nearly as bad as the 80's. There's no way they'll do that, especially because they want as much of Ukraine as undamaged as possible.

Also, ICBMs don’t really need to be “moved”. They’re “intercontinental”, so their long range is kind of the whole point.

There are practical reasons: first, recruits must be equipped and we don't know that Ukraine has enough weapons to equip all Ukrainian males. It may not be constructive to have unarmed conscripts turned away from the border.

But why the males? A greater proportion of males will be able and willing to fight. They will have the mindset that this is what's expected of them. (This is a bit circular, that males are asked to fight because they are brought up being expected to). Note that no volunteer females are being rejected. It is simply that male conscripts will be (by a small %) more effective.  

A third reason is that it could be detrimental to Ukraine's image or even induce international backlash, from right-wing groups/governments - potentially. Ukraine has the good graces of the West, and anything which could lose that is a risk.

The 2014 revolution was on the surface a revolution against the ruling government, but the Russians perceived it as a revolution against Russian influence and a decisive step into the Western sphere of influence. As such, Russia annexed Crimea to probably secure her black sea navy and prevent Western militarization of the region. We can only make educated guesses with respect to Russian motives, but one thing is clear: If the Russian goal was to bring Ukraine back into her orbit, it had the opposite effect. Russian pressure only served to push Ukraine towards NATO, a line Russia does not want crossed.

Quite frankly, Zelensky overplayed his hand over the pipeline revenue issue and got more than what he bargained for.

The paper does not suggest that the Russians lack resources, it says that the Russians lack the logistical capabilities to keep their soldiers in Ukraine well supplied with those resources. To quote some more of the most relevant passages: 

*""Kiev and the Dnepr River crossings are at least 150 to 200 road miles from the Russian border, and its army will require at least several days of fighting to reach them. Before that, they will undoubtedly have to resupply, refuel, and replace combat losses of men and material at least once, which will require an operational pause.*  
*In his article “Feeding the Bear,” Alex Vershinin argues that there are serious logistical challenges to a Russian invasion that is supposed to roll over the Baltic states in 96 hours and present the West with a fait accompli. Russia has built an excellent war machine for fighting near its frontier and striking deep with long-range fires. However, Russia may have trouble with a sustained ground offensive far beyond Russian railroads without a major logistical halt or a massive mobilization of reserves.""*

Furthermore, the CSIS also state that ""*Kharkiv is just over the border from Russia and is a major road and railroad junction. If Russian forces did not control Kharkiv, it would seriously diminish their logistical capability to support a central thrust toward the Dnepr River and beyond.*"" As far as we know, Kharkiv is still in Ukrainian hands, as are other key transport hubs, and this presents a serious obstacle to keeping the invading Russian forces supplied.",False,1645826649.0,t3_t1dz0s,t1_hyfpfcb,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

But he saw the wall fall, and his life was uprooted when western forces took over- he felt humiliated by having to evacuate his office, for example, and abandoned by the USSR since they were unable to back up their operatives. Obviously, as the losers, the Russians were treated as such and sent back home, and her theory is that this created a lifelong desire in him to put the West in it's place the way they had once done to Russia.

You're telling us to take Russia at face value right?

You do realize that means ignoring the fact that they said ""oh ignore all those troops...they aren't a threat...""

Nuclear weapons and conventional force are completely different things.  Nukes simply aren't useful in an offensive capacity.  You immediately die in retaliation as soon as you use them offensively.  They purely exist for defensive purposes.  The question is what's worth defending with them.  And the answer is not ""a couple Su-35s"".

Taking Russia at face value absolutely means ignoring the words that are coming out of their mouth.  When it comes to amassing troops while saying ""oh those troops aren't for an invasion"" you prepare for an invasion.  When it comes to ""we'll throw a nuke at even the smallest military intervention"", you ignore that too.",1645823062.0,1645822875.0,t3_t1dz0s,t1_hyfh6i2,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Best case: Ukraine holds out for long enough that the war becomes incredibly costly and bloody for Russia, and the cost of taking Ukraine vastly outweighs any possible benefit. Dissent within Russian government/people due to sanctions and a misguided war means Putin gets ousted and a more level-headed leader willing to engage in dialogue takes his place.

Worst case: Ukraine falls, and either Putin continues into NATO territory making an even bigger gamble that NATO won't invoke Article V, or a line is accidentally crossed by either NATO or Russia that drags the two into armed conflict. It'd be very, very bloody and Russia is almost certain to lose in a conventional war which means nukes could be launched if Putin is backed into a corner.

Or, sure, just fart out the Kremlin propaganda that Ukraine has to surrender.

They spent this long planning it and it's still not going nearly as well as they wanted. Trump was also pretty consistently pressured to uphold the measures we had taken to contain Russia. He often ended up acting after being forced by Congress or public pressure which may have delayed timelines while they waited for opportune moments to do things like exit the Open Skies Treaty. Trump actually did that AFTER he lost the election which led to Russia starting to exit then finishing the official exit at the end of 2021.
