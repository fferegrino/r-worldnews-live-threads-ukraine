Russia's plan clearly is to reach Kyiv as quickly as possible and force Zelensky to surrender, including Ukrainian forces across the country. If Russia can't take Kyiv quickly or if Zelensky refuses and resistance continues across Ukraine, Russia's costs and problems multiply.

Interestingly, Russia's plan resembles its operation in Crimea in 2014 in some ways. There was clearly a hope that if they moved fast enough, with VDV and SOF, and targeted some key Ukr capabilities, they could achieve a fait accompli with minimal violence. That didn't happen.

But Russia assembled a massive force in case its most optimistic scenario didn't pan out most of which hasn't even been committed into Ukraine. They will escalate and it will get uglier if they fail to achieve their political goals with the more limited force option.

The Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports.

The assault appears to line up with Zelenskiy‚Äôs warning that tonight could see Russia‚Äôs attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home.

c51014ebc84ac587e0f52d5010f13179,t1n65b,hyh64y8,"Here are some of the most recent developments:

Explosions and fighting have rocked the east, west and south of Kyiv, where the Russian assault has continued overnight in a siege apparently aimed at seizing the city. Residents have been taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents.
‚ÄúThis night will be the hardest,‚Äù the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an address. ‚ÄúThis night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.‚Äù
‚ÄúMore than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours ‚Äì a majority to Poland and Moldova,‚Äù said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that ‚Äúmany more are moving towards its borders‚Äù.
The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning.

Ukrainian armed forces say they have repelled Russian attacks on an army base and on a major thoroughfare in Kyiv.
Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a ‚Äúgang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.‚Äù
Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin.
The US department of defense said a Russian ‚Äúamphibious assault‚Äù was launched on Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine.
A report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system ‚Äì a step that some countries had been reluctant to take. Among other sanctions, The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov ‚Äì largely symbolic, but it follows appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said: ‚ÄúWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.‚Äù
Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an ‚Äúexistential‚Äù war between Russia and the west.
The UN security council has voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld.
The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with ‚Äúimmediate effect‚Äù from the organisation‚Äôs committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday ‚Äúas a result of the Russian Federation‚Äôs armed attack on Ukraine‚Äù.

I.E.A dictator/criminal having substantial on-the-book assets in foreign countries and the foreign government just decides to completely appropriate these funds for their own purposes, e.g. paying own national debt, investing in infrastructure, or just donating to charity, etc.

Edit: Based on the responses it seems like it's been a perfectly valid option against problematic dictators in the past. I would love for Putin-related assets across the world to be seized and invested in healthcare, infrastructure, environment, etc, but I don't know how realistic that would be. The U.S. might be willing to seize Taliban assets for their own use, but seizing Russian assets might open up a whole new can of worms that they're not willing to deal with, so it seems like right now they're just freezing them for now.",1645848714.0,1645848245.0,t3_t1n65b,t3_t1n65b,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

You know what‚Äôs not going to happen? WWIII.

This is a two fold concept. Is it scary? Yes, but it‚Äôs scary for everyone. It strikes terror in everyone, even the enemy, in this situation being Russia. 


It‚Äôll always be an idle threat. Treaties and alliances have been created around it. 


Is Putin mad? Has he gone insane, with dementia, Parkinson‚Äôs, etc? Idk and it doesn‚Äôt matter.


At the end of the day, there are more people in the room with him that we can account for. And those people don‚Äôt want to die any more than we do. They may be heartless, greedy, and cold. But even then they don‚Äôt want to explode into pink dust nothingness.


Just like any other political figure head, there is a threshold beyond them we don‚Äôt see. A threshold of human beings that want to have air in their lungs by the end of this day.


So even if Putin is absolutely craven, perhaps already dying, and wanting to end his time on this earth with a bang, it won‚Äôt end in nuclear war.

I was very wrong in this community early on because I believed Russia would not invade the whole of Ukraine. I believed that because doing so made no practical sense. There are just far too many consequences relative to the advantage of taking the entire country. I thought he'd take DNR/LNR based on the investment Russia made to separatist infighting over the past 8 years, then repeat the [Salami Slice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_slicing_tactics) strategy to territories to the north. Rinse and repeat. 

So now I am trying to think from Putin's perspective. What's changed in his lifetime in conventional war? What is so different now that would make me think such an invasion is crazy, while he thought it was the right move? I think it's been starring at me this whole time. Does Putin not understand how Social Media can influence a conflict? It's a relatively new concept that may be foreign to him, and I am not sure how much he weighed in on how the worlds attention would be captured or that Ukrainian forces would be emboldened through our modern society that is so interwoven. I may be completely wrong in this suspicion, but it's just a thought.

It wasn't even that graphic, couldn't see blood, but his agony was obvious and I'm still a little in shock that I've seen someone die on film. I've seen death before, news footage and museum photos and all that, but it's different when it's happening in real time and when you can see it happening to a single person and not a faceless mass. I think I'll be all right, but it was a lesson learned I need to avoid these. Humans are not meant for this. I'm 4,000 miles away and not in a position to do anything but donate money and sit through a vigil every time the sun sets in Ukraine, so it's pointless for me to follow things so closely. I have a good imagination. I've been watching these threads for days now and I think that's stress enough--adding more mental toll does not make me in any way more helpful to Ukraine. For everyone feeling a similar way, strong, compassionate minds are going to be needed as this goes on, so try not to feel ashamed for not letting yourself suffer through it if it's too much.

Go read up his presidency. There's a decent outline that goes over some of it, but there are a tone of articles. The overview is that he started with over a 70% approval rating. But just last October it had dropped below 25% amid a lot of issues surround offshore business holdings (Pandora papers), media suppression tactics, the sacking of people speaking again him, and general concern that he was just more of the same business elite that has always ruled. Among a host of other issues.

This doesn't mean he's not being a good wartime leader right now. People are multifaceted and complex.

Flanking might be possible from above/below, but that again depends on Russian positions.

The Ukrainian advantage in Kyiv is the defender-advantage in city-warfare - it's hard to get a foothold where you're not constantly surrounded and lacking the ability to see far and anticipate counter-attacks. Defenders lose that advantage the more they move outside their zone of control.

It's also a matter of supply-lines - which I imagine would be hard to maintain when extending beyond a defended core.
And then it's certainly also a matter of the makeup of the forces. Pushing forward on open field is something you can sometimes do to with armored vehicles - less so with infantry. 
I don't know about Ukrainian vehicles in/around Kyiv, but I would guess infantry is a lot more numerous.

O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,

As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?

In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!

These systems are also mobile. The most effective means of destroying them is the use of a SEAD(suppression of enemy air defenses) mission. They require a fairly high level of organization and effective use of combined arms. Even with a technological advantage they can be fairly difficult to defeat. You have to locate, isolate, suppress, and destroy. Every time you fail that mission they just relocate. They may have a technological advantage but it's not a significant enough of one to allow them to steam roll over them. It becomes increasingly difficult because the Ukrainians are generally relying on ambush tactics against armored convoys, the effective losses make it more difficult to maneuver into a position that you can effectively suppress a target. Warfare is unbelievably complex. Without proper ground support your relying almost entirely on air to get in to a position in which they can engage these targets. 

Also on airsuperiority. Battlefields are incredibly dynamic and fluid environments. This is especially true of air combat where even the loss of a single plane is enough to shift the entire dynamic. These planes also have to leave and refuel. With Russia being on the attack they have a much larger area they are expected to cover, and each time a sortie has to drop back for fuel or arms a new sortie has to be on station in order to prevent the loss of air power. But this doesn't always happen and for a variety of reason. Even 10min without air can be more then enough to halt an attack in place.

With time, Solovey became more and more preoccupied with Vladimir Putin‚Äôs health, claiming that the Russian president has long been on the brink of death due to some terrible disease.

The ‚ÄúSVR General,‚Äù along with top specialist in occultism‚Äù Andrey Kosmach (another regular guest on Solovey‚Äôs YouTube channel), have long been key sources of the political analyst‚Äôs most outlandish stories.

3) After Crimea, Ukraine bought tons and tons of shoulder fired anti tank missles. Unlike the russian systems or the older TOW heavy missles, NLAW and Javelin can be fired without need of a tripod. Two people can quickly set up, attack a armor column, and melt away. Ukraine has repeatedly shot up armored columns moving on roads. This seems to be why Russia has been trying to capture airports and landing troop transports there without full Anti Aircraft suppression. They've lost at least 2 transports ( 200 or soldiers per transport ) and even if they disembark, they still have to run the gauntlet of roads guarded by Our Lady St Javelin.

4) I am now suspecting that Russia expected at least some elements outside of Donbas, to defect or at least turn on Ukraine, or that they expected to be welcomed as liberators by some groups. I am suspicious that SOMEONE fed them false info on the level of support they could expect from locals and so they underprepared.",False,1645850117.0,t3_t1n65b,t1_hyh5q0i,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

My guess (and I‚Äôm not an expert by any means) would be annexation of eastern Ukraine up to the river and toppling the current government to install a puppet. The full invasion would be necessary for this goal in order to crush the Ukrainian army and cement a victory.

Long answer: It's possible, but that would incur a lot of hostility from the rest of the world. Of course they've already invaded maybe they think it wouldn't be any worse than it already is. That would make it less likely that any sanctions get rolled back though (Crimean sanctions are in effect until Russia relinquishes Crimea).

They are by no means winning, but it looks like Russians underestimated the resistance they would face, and paid the price for some risky (attempted) aerial insertions.

Currently, Russian troops are trying to enter Kiev in what was predicted to be the fiercest night of fighting yet. The sun is about to rise. It sounds like its been brutal, but it's hard to confirm anything.

Most military analysts agree it's not a matter of if Kiev falls, but when, provided no one arrives to relieve the Ukrainians, or a diplomatic option doesnt materialize.

Internationally, there's almost universal condemnation of Russia. The notable standouts are China and India, who abstained from voting on a security council motion to end hostilities, which Russia veto'd. 

It's hard to get a handle on Putin. Some intelligence info (hinted at by US Senator Marco Rubio who is VC of the intelligence committee) suggests Putin ain't right. But that's all we know. International sanctions are piling up, though Russia has not yet been kicked out the SWIFT international payment system as far as I know. NATO is taking an increasingly aggressive posture and moving lots of troops to the Ukrainian border. However, it remains unlikely that they'll intervene as the threat of nuclear retaliation from Putin seems credible.

The Ukrainian President remains in Kiev, even while it's under an active siege. He is purported to be personally directing the city's defense. He is widely seen as a heroic figure now, and live or die he will be the historical face of Ukraine's resistance. In stark contrast to Putin, who now not only seems maniacal but also inept as the Ukrainian invasion has stalled significantly.

I remain personally hopeful that Putin might be amenable to a ceasefire if things go on much longer. It wouldnt get Ukraine its territorial integrity back, but it would buy time for domestic pressure to build on Putin, and for Ukrainians to regroup and (hopefully) evacuate more people if it looks like there's no hope.",False,1645848457.0,t3_t1n65b,t1_hyh1ryr,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Instead, numerous attacks have been rebuffed. Russians have  lost transports full of soldiers. The whole while, Zelensky is there, standing bravely, and telling the world exactly what is happening. Sanctions work slowly, which is why Putin wanted to act quickly. But quick victory isn't what he's getting.

Literally no one is under the confusion that Ukraine can defeat Russia. But providing a stalwart defense drastically increases the costs to the Russians, economically and politically, every day and hour that it goes on. Even when the Russians take these cities, they'll be fighting guerillas. Even when they lose Kyiv, the government will operate from the next fall-back line.

Article 5 isn't automatic; a country has to request it and it has to be accepted by other members. Moreover, Article 6 defines what constitutes an armed attack appropriate for invocation of Article 5:

> - on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France 2, on the territory of Turkey or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;
> 
> - on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

The second definition clearly doesn't meet the threshold - no French or occupation forces of France were in Ukraine when the Treaty was signed. That leaves the first definition; An embassy is *customarily* considered foreign soil, but is not always legally so. 

There would absolutely be some debate on if this situation meets that threshold. If French forces were caught in the crossfire? Probably not. If French forces were attacked directly? Possibly.

All the other circumstances surrounding the crisis have room for debate, but it's pretty straightforward that Putin would have had nowhere else to go but nuclear provocation if he was serious about his other threats. Now he has overextended militarily and politically inside his own sphere, which can only make it easier for other Russians to act against him. Whatever happens in Ukraine going forward, Putin is weaker today than he was a few days ago.

Whenever I watch Trump and the Republican party navigate a crisis, the thing that stands out the most is how they never care about what will happen down the road. They throw everything into derailing the crisis here and now, in the hopes that it will fade away before it does lasting damage. It works, way more often than it ought to work. The lesson from that is not to escalate every nuclear confrontation to the edge of disaster, but rather to always try to survive to fight another day. Winning a grand strategic showdown is enticing, but not dying in a nuclear holocaust is a condition of any victory.

Firing a nuke would be an instant escalation on the world stage. And, probably lead to destruction of most of the world.

EDIT: Comments got locked while I was replying, here is my reply:

Funny how in that other comment I linked, you led with this:

> I'm Russian

And yet here you say ""I'm of Russian descent."" And you know, I believe you. I think you're telling the truth here - you're an American born to Russians.

Yet you still parrot Russian propaganda and pretend as if you're neutral. I understand that a lot of Americans see this as ""fair and balanced"" reporting, but I don't think you're actually neutral like you say.

Let's start here. You say ""I don't want to crush morale"" as you repeatedly go around attempting to crush morale. You've made that ""they're in Kyiv in 2 days lol"" comment repeatedly, and now here you are saying ""the Ukrainians are gonna be slaughtered lol."" Hardly a way to ""not crush morale.""

[Here you are parroting the same misinformation that was on the front page of /r/russia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/t14gi4/russian_tank_ran_over_a_car_in_ukraine/hyfzys0/?context=3) You have the nerve to say ""that's misinformation"" and then spread misinformation of your own, repeatedly.
