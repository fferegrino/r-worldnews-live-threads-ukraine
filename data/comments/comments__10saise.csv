>  
>The new weapon, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), will allow Ukraine's military to hit targets at twice the distance reachable by the rockets it now fires from the U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). If included as expected in an upcoming weapons-aid package first reported by Reuters, the 151 km (94 mile) GLSDB will put all of Russia's supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea.  
>  
>This will force Russia to move its supplies even farther from the front lines, making its soldiers more vulnerable and greatly complicating plans for any new offensive.  
>  
>""This could slow down \[a Russian assault\] significantly,"" said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine's former defence minister. ""Just as HIMARS significantly influenced the course of events, these rockets could influence the course of events even more.""  
>  
>It is not yet compatible with HIMARS, but the United States will provide Ukraine new launchers for the rockets, said sources. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.  
>  
>When the United States first sent HIMARS launchers in June, it supplied rockets with a 77 km (48 mile) range. This was a major boost for the Ukrainian military, allowing it to destroy Russian ammunition dumps and weapons storage facilities.  
>  
>Once Ukraine has the new glide bombs, say military experts, Russia will need to push its supplies even farther away.  
>  
>""We are currently unable to reach Russian military facilities more than 80 kilometres away,"" said Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko. ""If we can reach them practically all the way to the Russian border, or in occupied Crimea, then of course this will lower the attacking potential of Russian forces.""  
>  
>Crucially, Ukraine will soon be able to reach every point of the occupied overland route to Crimea via Berdiansk and Melitopol. That will force Russia to redirect its supply trucks to the Crimean bridge, which was badly damaged in an attack in October.  
>  
>""Russia is using Crimea as a big military base from which it sends reinforcements for its troops on the southern front,"" said Musiyenko. ""If we had a 150km (munition), we could reach that and disrupt the logistical connection with Crimea.""  
>  
>Beyond the logistical impact, the addition of a longer-range weapon to Ukraine's arsenal could help shake Russian confidence.

>Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that while Ukraine would benefit from an even longer range weapon, GLSDB is ""a really important step to give the Ukrainians longer reach and to keep the Russians guessing.""

>  
>WASHINGTON — The number of Russian troops killed and wounded in Ukraine is approaching 200,000, a stark symbol of just how badly President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion has gone, according to American and other Western officials.  
>  
>While the officials caution that casualties are notoriously difficult to estimate, particularly because Moscow is believed to routinely undercount its war dead and injured, they say the slaughter from fighting in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and the town of Soledar has ballooned what was already a heavy toll.  
>  
>With Moscow desperate for a major battlefield victory and viewing Bakhmut as the key to seizing the entire eastern Donbas area, the Russian military has sent poorly trained recruits and former convicts to the front lines, straight into the path of Ukrainian shelling and machine guns. The result, American officials say, has been hundreds of troops killed or injured a day.  
>  
>Russia analysts say that the loss of life is unlikely to be a deterrent to Mr. Putin’s war aims. He has no political opposition at home and has framed the war as the kind of struggle the country faced in World War II, when more than 8 million Soviet troops died. U.S. officials have said that they believe that Mr. Putin can sustain hundreds of thousands of casualties in Ukraine, although higher numbers could cut into his political support.  
>  
>Ukraine’s casualty figures are also difficult to ascertain, given Kyiv’s reluctance to disclose its own wartime losses. But in Bakhmut, hundreds of Ukrainian troops have been wounded and killed daily at times as well, officials said. Better trained infantry formations are kept in reserve to safeguard them, while lesser prepared troops, such as those in the territorial defense units, are kept on the front line and bear the brunt of shelling.  
>  
>The last public Biden administration estimate of casualties came last November, when Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that more than 100,000 troops on each side had been killed and wounded since the war began. At the time, officials said privately that the numbers were closer to 120,000.  
>  
>“I would say it’s significantly well over 100,000 now,” General Milley said at a news conference last month in Germany, adding that the Russian toll included “regular military, and also their mercenaries in the Wagner Group.”

> Moscow will be forced to go for broke in the near future due to the fact that internal problems will not allow the Kremlin to drag out the war.
> 
> Putin needs to present something that looks like success to the Russian citizens. The military leadership of the Russian Federation needs this to demonstrate to the president that they can be effective and relevant, that they still matter.
> 
> Therefore, they will attack with no regard to costs. 
> 
> ""They can stop or change the plan only if they see that Ukraine has a sufficient amount of equipment, ammunition, weapons and trained personnel.” Russians understand that if they do not attack now, by late spring it will be too late.
> 
> A source at the headquarters of Russian forces in Ukraine confirms preparations for an offensive. According to him, the generals are ready to ""cannon fodder"" tens of thousands of servicemen in order to please the High Command. None of the obvious dangers are taken into account. “Ukrainians receive precise details of all our movements from Western intelligence services,” the source says. ""It is impossible to accumulate sufficient forces in any area without setting them up for HIMARS and long-range artillery strikes.""
> 
> According to the source, the problem is not merely capturing territories and cities, but holding on to them. ""After our attacks, instead of settlements, we get a moonscape with the remnants of a hostile population,"" says the Russian military source. ""Enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups operate in occupied territories. They hit in the back, direct artillery, mine roads, capture and interrogate our servicemen. With things like that we can only hold the front at the cost of huge losses.""
> 
> Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan told New Europe: ""By February 23, we expect the Russians to continue offensive operations in prepared sectors of the front, where the necessary infrastructure has already been built and there are defense lines for retreat. It will mainly be mass infantry attacks. It will be most beneficial for Russia to attack from the area between Vuhledar and Soledar.""
> 
> ""I consider Kupyansk and Svatovo to be another possible direction of attack out of the village of Valuiki, where a large base and a Russian logistics hub are located. The task of this group will be to push the AFU up to the city of Lyman, and try to surround it.""

The group (if still alive) then proceeds to attack the defense position, previously marking their own position (i.e. leaving a mark on a tree). If the first group is dead, the second one is sent, without the equipment, as they are supposed to pick up the equipment from the first group bodies. As they are much lighter equipped, they are much more agile and have higher chances to reach the position of the first group. If they reach the position, they call the artillery and proceed to assault the defense position.

Leopard 2 orders are backlogged and unless significant investment is made into their production, they will remain backlogged.

Leopard 2 is a vehicle that is at the end of its designed life, so it's unlikely that countries will build new factories for a 50 year old tank. Germany and France are were working on the Leopard 3, so either that or another modern tank will take over for any new major production runs.

Nuclear weapons have saved us, the United States, from having to send our young off to die in WWI and WWII numbers since WWII ended. Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan have been nothing similar at all even though the first two were pretty horrible.

It's hard to do it, but I try to put myself into the shoes the older generations that fought in these wars before nuclear weapons existed. If you're in the Pacific, you're getting mentally prepared for a potential invasion of Japan. Your family members back home are getting prepared for massive losses of their loved ones. Then the US surprises everyone and blows up two entire cities. The effectiveness of a real wonder weapon has been demonstrated, and it saved everyone from their fear of a Japanese invasion. I bet it felt like the days of hundreds of thousands of our kids don't have to die every time someone in Europe decides it's time to conquer the world. Then, less than 10 years later, we're at war again in Korea. Let's say you were an 18 year old young man in 1942 with a 13 year old kid brother when you enlisted for WWII. The war ends in 1945, and you're now 23 with an 18 year old little brother. The Korean war starts in 1950 when you're 28 and your little brother is 23. The draft starts, and since you served in WWII, you don't have to sign up. Your little brother had to sign up for Selective Service since he wasn't a vet, and he gets drafted and sent to Korea. You know that a weapon exists that was used 5 years prior to force the Japanese to surrender, and they were way stronger than Korea. The news from the Korean War isn't great, and you're frustrated and waiting both for bad news regarding your little brother and for the US to grow some balls and nuke the asshole Chinese that are now pouring into the country. Another month passes by and a car shows up in front of your house to let your family know that your little brother died in combat. You had the solution that would have saved your little brother's life. Just drop some nukes like we did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was supposed to mean no more cars showing up to houses to deliver bad news to moms. 

I think the willingness to talk about using nukes on other countries is because we know that the alternative almost always boils down to ""boots on the ground.""

The West truly means it when they say that Russia and Ukraine need to negotiate themselves when the time comes. In the meantime, we provide aid to get Russia to leave Ukraine.

The way the Crimea attack works is something like this:

1. Spring 2023 -> Ukraine takes back the south (Melitopol and the surrounding rural areas of the two occupied provinces in the south).
2. Summer 2023 -> fighting continues in Donbas, Ukraine gets more military aid for the Donbas fight and to threaten Crimea
3. Late summer/early fall 2023 -> Ukraine breaks into Crimea and forces Russia to negotiate. Based on how much and how fast they break will decide whether they get Crimea + Donbas, Donbas, or Crimea + Donbas - Sevastopol, or everything.

The project outlines don’t go into detail about how this would happen, but a “budget” of 20,000 euros was listed for both the Italian and Austrian resolutions, with a further 15,000 euros for each “in case of successful voting.” It’s unclear whether these sums were intended to be paid directly to the two politicians or were budgets for the entire projects.”

Edit:

What is most worrying is it shows how cheaply they were bought.  No one received more than €5K Euros at a time.  The ""Election Observer"" event had a total budget of €68k.

So either these people were easily bought, or were looking at the payouts as perks for already being aligned with Russian political goals.",1675444994.0,1675444103.0,t3_10saise,t1_j72iwv9,,2,26,0,26,0,0,

With around 150 tanks arriving in Ukraine by spring, it's quite possible Ukraine will have built up enough rested or fresh troops and materiel to launch a stronger and more potent counter offensive than anything we've seen from them before. With that in mind, despite continual reports of Russia's ""new big offensive, for realsies this time"", we don't really see any indications that Russia is capable of a powerful push. If they are, then the time is absolutely now, because once tanks start showing up its only a matter of time before Russia is on the backfoot again. 

And yet, every new day looks the same: just throw more bodies at it. Not because anyone thinks it's a good idea really. I just think no one in Russia has any better ideas. I'm speaking as someone from inside Russia, in Petersburg. I really get the impression that no one knows what to do at all, so just keep doing what we did before, and hope it doesn't get worse. Putin almost certainly gets a very distorted report on current events so he is incapable of really fixing the situation with his own intervention. 

There has been more talk lately about Ukraine's ability to re-enter Crimea, enough that makes me suspect this might be the or at least a focus of their next major move. If so, I think its the smart choice because hitting Crimea is going to have the most effect on Russian psyche outside of hitting Russian territory. The exodus of Russians fleeing a Ukrainian liberation force will send shockwaves across Russia. It is a whole different matter to the Donbas. I don't think Ukraine needs to even capture it entirely to have this effect - as long as it puts the fear of God in Russians who are living there - at that point, Russia has basically lost in the eyes of the population.

The Russian economy is running on borrowed time. They'll start cutting off pieces of the economy like a triage system, sacrificing the poor non-Russian ethnic regions first and low-priority public spending. So far, urban Russians have largely been sheltered from the negative consequences of the war, but facing the reality is not a matter of if but when. If the public becomes unstable, it makes it increasingly likely that a faction will exploit that and make a grab for Putin's chair. 

Ultimately I don't think us common folk know anywhere near enough to make accurate predictions, but I won't be surprised if this is wrapping up by early next year.

That's exactly why Boeing hasn't made them. No one uses them right now, and they weren't going to start making them until they have a customer. They may have a customer soon.

There's only a couple of times in history in which an arms manufacturer preemptively makes a ton of wepaons without a government asking for them first, and those occasions were all big risks on the part of those companies.

It has no advantage over the tanks in this war, it's actually at disadvantage in most areas, but it still reliably crumps targets other than enemy tanks and it can take out a tank with a bit of luck and positioning (or the enemy tank and/or its crew has a screw lose).

1) Gun

The 105mm L7 gun was appropriate for its time and age, but the vast majority of tanks in Ukraine (besides the heavily ridiculed T-62) are a tier or two above in firepower and armor protection, with 125mm guns (or 120mm on the newly promised Western arrivals).

A more modern ammo was made for this gun that kept it viable even against some modern tanks, but its availability is uncertain.

2) Armor

The armor protection on Leo 1 was fairly light for a tank, a typical trait for its generation (with the exception of UK Chieftain),  with a heavy focus on mobility and accurate firepower. It was one of the fastest and most maneuverable tanks of its era. 

The reasoning at the time was that new HEAT warheads were so effective against steel armor that it was simply not practical to try and design an armor that could withstand it, and it was better to focus on being fast and precise to shoot first.

This attitude changed with the realization that adding ceramic materials to the steel armor dramatically improves resistance against shaped cumulative charges (HEAT warheads), but this knowledge was only used in the design of the following generation.

Most tanks in Ukraine are just that.

The only way the 9 month story makes any sense to me now is if it's used to justify ATACMS delivery in the very near future, outside of that I would expect to see GLSD in Ukraine within weeks.

edit: adding reuters link stating their source says delivery could happen as early as March. I'm no rocket scientist but somebody has an interest in pushing the 9 month narrative and someone has an interest in getting them their ASAP, I'll let you decide.

There are those who believe the propaganda and will not accept anything but the total conquest of Ukraine. There are likely to be Russians who also know the truth or at least hate Putin and/or don't want their loved ones to die.  

The problem is that it isn't up to them. It's up to their dictator Putin.  

He's also counting on the public remaining as crushed and powerless as always, along with the fact that the public would rather the Wagner mercenaries and prisoners die in the war rather than their loved ones.  

Those who have swallowed the Kremlin propaganda and *really* gone to town with it can sound like the ultra nationalistic and crazy QAnon types. Julia Ioffe said some of them are baying for Ukrainian blood. Some of those people are members of online groups, again like QAnon but pro-Putin, nationalistic and pro totally conquering Ukraine.  

To those like that, they won't accept anything but complete victory. If anyone tried to withdraw they would brand them as a weak coward and a Nazi supporting traitor. That could potentially be a dangerous label to attach to a dictator. It could make them appear weak and libel to be replaced with another dictator. So I cannot see any dictator withdrawing even if they wanted to.  

As for the people rising up, well I cannot see that happening either. They're crushed and have been for many decades. Putin is unstoppable. The police are brutal and the ""justice"" system is designed to cripple you for life with debt, assuming you don't die in prison or from the police beating you.  

From some the Russian public's perspective, Putin being replaced is actually a scary prospect. They will know that if that should happen Russia will likely fall until a Putin v.2.0 rises to take his place.

Actions speak louder than words. So far, the German government has turned out to be just talk. That $100 million Euros hasn't even been touched yet and if they don't spend it in the next couple of years, then it can't be spent. As for the regular budget, German military spending is down for 2023, and the 2024 budget isn't looking that good either.

> +110% in the Rheinmetall stocks in the last year is only one of many signs of this.

Stock price is a measure of profitability and not a metric for production capacity. Markets see that demand for weapons isn't going down, so they're hopping onto the gravy train. That doesn't mean that new factories are going to be built.

Germany needs to invest in production capacity or they're going to lose out on many sales.

A good sign, but in the case of Rheinmetall looking to fill out their munitions production capacity. That capacity, by the way, is [being paid for by other countries](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/01/06/rheinmetall-explosive-factory-hungary/).

Part of the reason why we're not going to see this with the Leopard 2 is because Krauss-Maffei is a German firm, and they've been very, *very* firm on not expanding Leopard production outside of Germany. The only country to have performed licensed production of the Leopard is Switzerland.

Poland asked for licensed production and a tech transfer, but Germany said no. The slow production rate and licensing issues iss why Poland is buying Abrams from the United States and Black Panthers from South Korea.",1675428965.0,1675427802.0,t3_10saise,t1_j71hppm,,7,-5,0,-5,0,0,

*That's my point*. They're swamped.

They're not doing any great expansion of their production lines, so they're *going to remain swamped for the forseable future*.

It takes a lot of time and money to spin up tank production. They aren't iPhones. KMW has some slack, but even if they go to 3 shifts of production, they're going to need new factories to get the tanks out in the next few years.
