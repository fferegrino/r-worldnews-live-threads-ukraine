Let me explain. The phrase makes its way into the press repeatedly because Russian officials are being quoted, but printing that phrase over and over again brings legitimacy by making it seem clinical and routine.

When the media starts using that phrase on its own to describe the war it diminishes the horror of this war and desensitizes the reader by making it seem like things are under control and normal.

But in reality we are witnessing genocide, terrorism, kidnapping, rape, murder, threats and aggression towards Europe, and a potential world war. There is nothing clinical or routine about any of this. These are not innocent goals on some Putin ‘bucket list’. 

80 years ago no one would have printed ‘The war in Europe will continue until all of Hitler’s goals are met’. No we would have said ‘Madman Hitler unleashes terror on Europe and murders thousands’.

On 11 January 2023, Russian Chief of the General Staff (CGS) General Valery Gerasimov took personal command of the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine.

Gerasimov’s tenure has been characterised by an effort to launch a general winter offensive with the aim of extending Russian control over the whole of the Donbas region. Eighty days on, it is increasingly apparent that this project has failed.

On several axes across the Donbas front, Russian forces have made only marginal gains at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties, largely squandering its temporary advantage in personnel gained from the autumn’s ‘partial mobilisation’.

After ten years as CGS, there is a realistic possibility that Gerasimov is pushing the limits of how far Russia’s political leadership will tolerate failure.

Yes, Ukrainian counter offensives yielding success will affect Russian morale, but the effectiveness of depressing Russian will to fight will depend on the type of success they get. Liberating square kilometers of mostly empty land or minor towns in the Donbass or Kherson won't really do much. The Ukrainians need major victories such as encroaching on Crimea, retaking Melitopol, severing the land bridge to Crimea or liberating Mariupol for the Russians to really start eating their own. How likely all that is, we will have to see.

And on the flipside, a similar effect exists on the Western side. The measure of Ukrainian success in the counter offensives are directly linked to the amount of future Western support they can expect. If Western audiences start to believe the war has been reduced to a stalemate and no further successes are possible, then politicians will be less happy to funnel large amounts of support that way. It's very clear that the narrative on the political fringes is that they don't want tax-payer money to go to a ""senseless war"", but as long as Ukraine is showing success, that narrative doesn't really have any power.

So frankly, a lot is riding on the Ukrainian offensives. And unlike previous pushes, the Russians are actually prepared for these. And while it seems likely that the Ukrainians will achieve some measure of success, with the limited information that we have, it's hard to state if they can achieve enough to buy continued support from the West.",False,1680375965.0,t3_128ajgi,t1_jekh5n8,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

Now Ukraine HAS been able to visibly gain dominance in the air with drones, and that capability really can't be overstated; gives eye of god scouting and targeting for artillery, lets very small squads set up successful attacks, and performs much of the CAS missions aircraft would do anyways(though at an admittedly lighter impact due to armament weight constraints). But the crux of the matter is that Air Superiority requires a lot of deep strike missions to clear out AA systems and radar, and Ukraine won't ever be able to do that as effectively as it would need to for their own planes to have anything resembling acceptable lifespans.

What evidence are you providing to show this, because the article you used as a source states that the FSB has provided zero evidence of espionage...

>The acknowledgement that the WSJ journalist detained by Russia for espionage really was sniffing around two tank factories is absolutely shocking.

According to your article, he was *thinking* about travelling to a tank factory and interviewing people on the street. So even if I accept your premise that interviewing people next to strategic locations is ""sniffing"" (which is absurd, you can find thousands of interviews of people on the roads around Area 51), he didn't even do it, he was thinking about it. 

From your article:

>Kolezev added that Gershkovich was thinking about taking a trip to nearby Nizhny Tagil, home to the Uralvagonzavod factory — where Russia produces tanks and other military vehicles. 

>“He has this idea to interview some people on the streets nearby Russian military factories,” Kolezev said. “He wanted to know what people think about the war.”

>NBC News has been unable to verify whether Gershkovich followed through on any of these reporting goals.

This ain't illegal in the US.

>The FSB provided no evidence or further details on when Gershkovich was detained.

So...do you have some contact in the FSB or something?

And all the equipment the West has sent has been destroyed and so its just a matter of killing another 7 or 8 soldiers in Bakhmut before the whole frontline collapses everywhere and the Russian army can roam freely across Ukraine in their shiny shiny new T-14 Armatas and shoot nazis and satan worshippers and ungodly trans soldiers left and right.

Western intelligence believes Moscow may only have a few left in the fight.  
  
Ukraine's special operations forces recently published footage showing a Russian Zoopark-1M counter-battery radar being destroyed, according to a Friday intelligence update from Britain's defense ministry. It said the footage was released on March 23 and that the attack unfolded in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.  
  
Several Ukrainian media outlets reported last week that Russian Zoopark counter-battery radar systems had been taken out in combat by Kyiv's special operations forces.  
  
Britain's defense ministry said both Ukraine and Russia have been constantly trying to eliminate each other's counter-battery radars throughout the 13-month-long war.  
  
""These systems are relatively few in number but are a significant force multiplier,"" the ministry noted in its update. ""They allow commanders to rapidly locate and strike enemy artillery.""

But there has been an steady increase in Russian losses (and recent plateau) since the beginning of February.  This could be due to RA becoming more reliant on shorter ranged artiliary due to losses, wear of longer ranged cannon, or substandard training of artiliary crews, all of which leaves them open to counter battery fire.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,128ajgi,jejk0xn,"From the article i linked.

If Russia is indeed desperate, then North Korea is a promising source: it has a lot of ammo & equipment, and it’s all compatible with Russian equipment (since it’s all basically Soviet knock offs). Moreover, the North Korean soldiers are supposed to be better trained than the Russian mobiki, and so they could prove a lot more useful in offensive operations. There are, however, significant logistical obstacles to making use of any such aid. First, and obviously, there’s the distance: it’s nearly 10,000km from Vladivostok to, say, Voronezh — a train trip through Moscow takes over 6 days. For the amount of ammo to make a dent on the front, there would have to be supplied in sufficient quantities. The last time rail traffic between DPRK and Russia via their only link over the Tumangang Friendship Bridge on November 4th last year was observed, the train had 3 railcars. Each railcar can carry about 100 tons, and a 152mm shell weighs about 50kg (these are the 155mm-equivalent for the Russians, so most important). Thus, my rough calculation is that 1 railcar can carry about 2,000 of these shells, so a train of the type we saw could carry 3,000 shells. Doubling the capacity would mean 6,000 shells per train, and VSRF right now is still firing 15,000 shells per day. In other words, to make a dent on the front, the Russians would have to be running more than one train load per day, every day, over a distance of 10,000km. I don’t know about you, but I do not have such faith in Russia’s logistical capabilities. If this aid to materialize, it can at most help VSRF avoid collapse due to shell hunger on the front.

I also find it hard to believe that with a relatively high failure rate of their older munitions that NK would be willing to part with large quantities of their recent production. As paranoid as that regime is, you would think that they would be keeping a large quantity in reserve. I also find it hard to believe that North Korea could manufacture new rounds in sufficient quantity to keep up with the demands of the war.

I think their illegal bases on artificial islands they made in the South China Sea gave the CCP the mistaken impression it might be able to eventually be able to take Taiwan and the international community would accept it. They confused most nations just ignoring their claims and pretending those bases on islands don't exist with an acceptance of Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea *and Taiwan.* They realized that the international community won't accept it.

The CCP see Russia being economically punished in a way that could seriously degrade their hold on China. The huge economic growth that lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty has slowly petered out and COVID caused the kind of unrest in the population the Chinese government hadn't seen in decades. They reversed course on COVID restrictions practically overnight in response, a massive signal the CCP knew they had too and a case of very rare concession to popular opinion. Sure they stamped out those protests but what happens if things go from a stagnating economy to a huge recession that wipes out the gains made by so many Chinese citizens since the 90's? Who knows if they'll be able to stomp out the next bit of mass unrest, even the strongest police states are vulnerable if it gets bad enough and the CCP know that.

Right now the CCP is happy to buy some cheap oil and gas from Russia because doing that hasn't aroused much pushback against them but they are still very cautious giving Russia any overt military support. And while they might have dreams about northern territorial expansion they know it could come with dire consequences for their own regime. *If* Russia disintegrates into smaller states, which I think is much less of a certainty than some in these threads seem to think, the Chinese are going to be very cautious to not end up in their own economic hell like Russia is currently in.

This is fully wrong.

It it meant to make the transport grid 3 dimensional because it doesn't scale well in 2-D.

There was the side goal of convincing California to drop the incredibly over priced rail plan that they had which was so absurdly overbudget before even starting that it was going to cost something like 100 mil PER MILE.  Thousands of times more expensive than high speed trains in other countries.  That project NEEDED to die.

Public transport is fine, but there is no doubt that if a system could be built such that pickup and dropoffs could be location direct, instead of at periodically spaced stations often far from final locations, it would be a much better system.

I know there is a reddit sub culture of people who think that current public transport is this amazing thing, but it really isn't.  Even in countries where public transport is great, commute times are still higher than they would otherwise be due to the need for walks and transfers.

I do think that this war can sometimes be hard for western military thinkers to wrap their minds around because the entire method of fighting wars is so different in the west. Ukraine is fighting without air superiority and is having to stretch resources far more thin than anything the US is used to. They’re also facing a lot stronger of a conventional threat but at the same time Ukraine has some advantages that the US or other western countries just aren’t used to like a higher tolerance of casualties and the knowledge that comes from fighting on their home turf as well as the ability to rely on local militias and national guard units defending their own towns and homes. Many American military analysts have also failed at predicting Russian movements because the Americans think along the lines of “this is what would make the most military sense for Russia” and not necessarily based on what the political constraints the Russians operate within. That’s not to say western intelligence or warplanning is bad or useless (it’s been a big reason Ukraine has held on) but just that we can’t assume that because someone was an expert in American or British of French warfare that they necessarily understand how this war is being fought.,False,1680398017.0,t3_128ajgi,t1_jelgagl,,4,3,0,3,0,0,
