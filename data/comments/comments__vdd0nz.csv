More now from the UK Ministry of Defence's morning update on the situation in Ukraine.  
  
The MoD says Russia's forces in the Donbas are likely to be operating in increasingly ad hoc and severely undermanned groupings.  
  
It points out that Ukrainian authorities have said some Russian Battalion Tactical Groups, that would typically compromise 600-800 people, now only consist of about 30 soldiers.  
  
Several weeks into the invasion, Russia changed its strategy to focus on the Donbas, the region in south-eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatist groups have been fighting for eight years.  
  
Front-line fighting is often between small groups on foot on both sides, the MoD says, which makes some of Russia's overall advantages, such as having more tanks than Ukraine, less relevant.

‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôre working this very, very hard,‚Äù he said, adding that assistance is getting in ‚Äúat record speed‚Äù and the US is in ‚Äúconstant conversation‚Äù with Ukraine.¬†

Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äúhas shown no inclination of stopping the combat‚Äù and negotiating in good faith, and until then, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be committed to helping Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces defend themselves and try to take back the territory, particularly in the east, in the south, that they‚Äôre trying to take back now,‚Äù he added.¬†

Kirby reiterated that the conflict with Russia ‚Äúcould be a prolonged effort‚Äù but said additional aid from Congress is not necessary at this stage.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not at a point right now where we believe, you know, we need to plan for another supplemental package. We‚Äôve only just begun spending and producing off the supplemental package that they just approved,‚Äù he said.¬†¬†",False,1655395669.0,t3_vdd0nz,t3_vdd0nz,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

Day 113 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet, well, other than the one shelling around 2pm and then another missile strike from Belgorod at 11pm. Kinda weird that being shelled only once (with one missile strike) can be considered quiet, but that‚Äôs just how it is right now, it‚Äôs definitely better than being shelled non-stop the entire day.

Those two big explosions yesterday night turned out to be missile strikes, they targeted a food factory. As always there was a lot of footage from that place, and not a single military target in sight. They must have been producing some Nazi food then, or was it one of those biolabs that Russians fear so much?

Actually, speaking of biolabs, today Russian MOD did post that they found the documents about an American biolab in Merefa, where they are apparently testing new viruses on mental hospital patients. Sounds pretty insane, but that‚Äôs just what is expected from Russia these days. Talking about those mysterious biolabs is perhaps one of the only things that Russians are consistent about, unlike their war goals. 

That also most likely answers the question of why they were firing missiles at Merefa every day for weeks, must have been trying to destroy that biolab, but it looks like they are very bad at aiming, or that biolab is just very good at dodging their missiles.",False,1655429388.0,t3_vdd0nz,t3_vdd0nz,,0,72,0,72,0,0,

From CNN's Matthew Chance, AnneClaire Stapleton, and Katharina Krebs in Brussels

US weapons will help Ukraine seize back Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea and Donbas, the Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy¬†Reznikov told CNN's Matthew Chance in an exclusive interview in Brussels.

""We are going to liberate all our territories, all of it all, including Crimea,"" he said.

""Crimea is a strategic objective for Ukraine because it's Ukrainian territory,"" Reznikov added. ""But we will move step by step.""

The defense minister said the first step would be stabilization of the situation on the ground to prevent further losses against Russian forces. The second stage, he said, is to push Russian forces back to their positions before the invasion on February 24.

Only in the 3rd stage, he told CNN, would there be discussions with Ukraine's partners on ""how to liberate territories, including Crimea,"" Reznikov said. Ukraine officials say they will not use the weapons to attack the Russian Federation, however, Ukraine does not consider Crimea to be Russian territory.¬†

When asked if attempting to recapture Crimea by military means would further provoke Russia -- which considers Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation -- Reznikov said that was not a consideration.

There have been alarming warnings from Ukraine that the flow of weapons from Western countries is too little and too late.  
  
As Russia continues to bombard the Donbas, pleas for more help are sounding more desperate by the day. Ukraine's deputy defence minister says that, so far, the country has only received 10% of what it has asked for.  
  
EU leaders from France, Germany and Italy are in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelensky to give assurances that they will supply more weapons to Ukraine - after the countries received criticism for not doing enough in response to the war.  
  
What weapons Ukraine is asking for:  
  
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser President Zelensky, said that to end the war, Ukraine needed 1,000 calibre 155mm howitzers (long-range artillery launchers), 300 multiple-launch rocket systems, 500 tanks, 2,000 armoured vehicles and 1,000 drones.  
  
Some weapons that Ukraine wants, like the Himars systems, require weeks of training before they can enter battle, according to top US defence officials who have defended the pace of arms deliveries.  
  
Which countries have sent the most weapons:  
  
The US announced it was sending the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which fires precision-guided rockets that can hit targets up to 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery Ukraine currently possesses.  
  
The UK is sending M270 multiple-launch rocket systems with M31A1 precision munitions to Ukraine. The government says that Ukrainian troops will be trained how to use the weapons in the UK.  
  
The UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine, along with other vehicles, drones and missiles - spending ¬£1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support in total.  
  
Germany has promised to send its most modern air defence system - the Iris-T - to enable Ukraine to shield an entire city from Russian air attacks - despite an international perception that Germany does not want to arm Ukraine.",False,1655380914.0,t3_vdd0nz,t3_vdd0nz,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

From CNN's Oren Liebermann and Chris Liakos

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia is ‚Äúin a very difficult place‚Äù and Ukrainian success could depend on how quickly it deploys heavier weapons to the frontline for a counteroffensive as opposed to a counterattack.

Speaking to CNN‚Äôs Oren Liebermann during the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels, Wallace said:

‚ÄúI think Russia, we're going to discover, is in a very, very difficult place, certainly in its depth of its reserves and its morale and that will make every meter they fight for even harder. And at the same time, we're now going to see some of these heavier weapons coming into the hands of Ukraine delivered into the country and that will again change the balance.‚Äù

Wallace added that Russia will be ‚Äúdesperately trying to find some form of victory no matter how small to make its morale feel a bit better,‚Äù but was not confident for how long Russia can sustain this offensive.

‚ÄúRussia has been in the field for months; remember, they were predominantly deployed three months before the invasion. No army is designed to be [a] conscript army out in the field that way, badly equipped, suffering huge losses,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI think the key here is how quickly will Ukraine deploy some of these heavier weapons and how quickly will they mount a counteroffensive as opposed to just counterattacks and how successful that‚Äôd be. That's why the West is very keen to help with their training and make sure that they apply those weapons in a way that makes that difference,‚Äù Wallace added.

He praised Ukraine‚Äôs determination, saying he is ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù that with ‚Äúthat home advantage with the moral component with the fact the international community is absolutely determined to support them, Ukraine will start to push back in small ways Russia and make Russia have even more problems in its army.‚Äù

Asked on whether he worries the economic hardship cause by the war could shift public opinion against Ukraine and wear away NATO support, Wallace admitted that there is a cost-of-living crisis across Europe but said that ‚ÄúRussia has chosen to use food, use fuel as a weapon‚Äù and that ‚Äúa lot of people's day-to-day problems they're facing is actually driven by Russia.‚Äù

Lavrov defends independence of courts in separatist regions
More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

Lavrov has insisted that courts in an area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent.

He was being questioned about two Britons recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic ‚Äì after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian troops.

Lavrov says he is ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù in whether the West views Russia as responsible for their fate.

‚ÄúI am only interested in international law,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAccording to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.‚Äù

The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the Ukrainian military.

Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds ‚Äúthis should be decided by a court"".",False,1655407074.0,t3_vdd0nz,t3_vdd0nz,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Some highlights:

We assess that up to 90 per cent of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as well as up to 60 percent of private houses. An estimated 350,000 people were forced to leave the city.
The humanitarian situation is devastating, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of this conflict.

To date, OHCHR has verified 1,348 individual civilian deaths directly in hostilities in Mariupol, including 70 children. These deaths were caused by air strikes, tank and artillery shelling and small arms and light weapons during street fighting. The actual death toll of hostilities on civilians is likely thousands higher.

Electricity, gas and water supplies in Mariupol were cut in early March, while it was still icily cold outside. People spent days and nights in cold basements and apartments. Older people and persons with disabilities were often confined to their apartments. Many were killed by shelling, while others burned or were suffocated in fires which could not be extinguished due to a lack of available fire services. Due to a shortage of drinking water, people took long, dangerous trips to wells or open reservoirs to procure such water as could be found. Others were forced to melt snow or to drink water extracted from cars or other equipment.

The centralized sewage system ceased to function. Not only were food supplies scarce, but people had to go outside during ongoing fighting and under shelling to cook on open fires.

Despite our attempts at verifying, it is not clear to what extent the parties to the conflict complied with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. Civilian survivors shared varying accounts, but most reported that military positions were often placed in the immediate proximity of civilians and civilian objects. Attacks on those positions were common practice. The harm to civilians was extensive.

More than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been taken as prisoners of war from Mariupol since early March. My Office received allegations of the killing of a Ukrainian soldier hors de combat in Mariupol, and ill-treatment of several others. In the absence of access to prisoners of war in territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups, my Office has not been able to assess their conditions of detention and treatment.

Likewise, having a flow of Western guns in NATO 155mm means that if there *are* last ditch reserves of 152mm ammo, Ukraine can use those up now without compromising their medium-term defence capabilities because they can get ammunition from factories within NATO, which is a major purpose behind NATO's push for ammunition standardisation.",False,1655401343.0,t3_vdd0nz,t1_iclg7b7,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The critical question is, can we get the pieces there, can we supply what the equipment needs to run 24/7/365, and can we fix it if it breaks.  Dumping a thousand pieces of artillery is only helpful if you can keep the artillery supplied with sufficient operational ammo, spare parts, the tools to load the artillery and maintenance kits to keep it running, and whether you can fix it and get it back to the field right away if something like a barrel going wonky from use, or an elevation mechanism motor going bad, requires a repair.  If you can't keep it 100%, you have to make adjustments on how you handle it.  If you're not doing all of these in balance, you might have more pieces than you can deploy efficiently at once, or multiple pieces that go to junk when you can't fix and repair.  If you have additional systems that you're bringing in, that's multiplying the issue.

Take the M777 for example.    Yes, the Ukrainians are receiving more and more pieces, and they're slowly getting the logistics up to speed to match up with what the batteries need to continually fire, but if something busts or goes wrong on a gun, they have to ship it back to Poland to fix it, then ship it back.   When your front is hundreds of kilometers away from where they're needed, it's a huge problem, and if you just dump more into the mix, you're only going to exacerbate the issue.  Spare barrels and maintenance kits are being shipped in, which will help, but they need to figure out if it's sufficient to help.

Getting the balance right takes time, especially when you're doing it in the middle of a war.   The absolute last thing you want to do is to turn on the firehose when there's holes in your system.

During the presidency of Victor Yushchenko (January 2005 ‚Äì February 2010) the Ukrainian government declared that the lease would not be extended and that the fleet would have to leave Sevastopol by 2017.[12]

Sevastopol is one of the only warm water ports Russia has access to (doesn't freeze over with ice for part of the year like others do)

Russia was going to be kicked out of Sevastopol in 2017, and once Yanukovych got ousted there was no chance of Russian being able to manipulate Ukraine's government to extend the lease.

In urban warfare, the engagement distance between forces drops considerably.   due to sheer amount of cover.   Also, the number of troops you would need to storm and take territory increases dramatically, as now, not only do you have to clear out terrain horizontally, but you need to do so vertically with multi-story buildings.   Each of those buildings can become a chokepoint.  Manpower commitment from the assaulting force goes up dramatically.

By engaging the Russians in a protracted close-in struggle, you're partially negating the effectiveness of the artillery and air assets, as they can't strike too close to their own attacking troops (if they're worried about that, of course).  The Russians have had the advantage of building up the supplies and logistical points in that part of Ukraine for some 8 years now, which means artillery and vehicles can operate with less worry about supply lines.   Thus, you negate the overwhelming advantage by making it not as big of one by getting right into the face of their troops.

In addition, with the sheer number of equipment and manpower the Russians are bringing forward, their combat support, logistical supply lines and command structure are going to be busy.  Keeping Russian forces engaged means continually exposing those elements for targeting.

""French President Emmanuel Macron asked Ukraine to make concessions on its sovereignty to help Russian leader Vladimir Putin save face, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.""

Sorry but I don't trust a word Macron says, he has to buy gas from Putin so Putin has a hold on him in that respect.

Edit: I cannot reply individually to the following replies - I will just say it is a quote from [politco.eu](https://politco.eu) which ""Despite its relative newness to the Brussels media landscape, Politico Europe has ranked above established publications such as the Financial Times, The Economist, BBC and the Wall Street Journal, as well as Twitter and Facebook.""

The article does seem to be a reasonable summary of what Zelensky expressed.

The entire article: ""French President Emmanuel Macron asked Ukraine to make concessions on its sovereignty to help Russian leader Vladimir Putin save face, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.In an interview with Italian TV channel RAI‚Äôs ‚ÄúPorta a Porta‚Äù talk show broadcast Thursday evening, Zelenskyy was asked about Macron‚Äôs comments on Monday, in which he warned Europe must avoid humiliating Putin.‚ÄúWe want the Russian army to leave our land ‚Äî we aren‚Äôt on Russian soil,‚Äù Zelenskyy replied. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt help Putin save face by paying with our territory. That would be unjust.‚Äù Zelenskyy added that Ukraine would never recognize Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea.Macron was looking ‚Äúin vain‚Äù for ‚Äúa way out for Russia,‚Äù Zelenskyy said.

The Elys√©e rejected Zelenskyy‚Äôs allegations. ‚ÄúThe president of the Republic has never discussed anything with Vladimir Putin without the agreement of President Zelenskyy and has never asked President Zelenskyy for any concession. He has always said that it was up to the Ukrainians to decide the terms of their negotiations with the Russians,‚Äù an Elys√©e official said Friday.

In a speech at the closing ceremony of the Conference on the Future of Europe on Monday, Macron said Europe must ‚Äúnever give in to the temptation of humiliation, nor the spirit of revenge,‚Äù when it came to Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine.

The French president also said ‚Äúwhen peace returns to European soil, we will need to build new security balances.‚Äù The reference has been read as an indication that Macron was still seeking to reach a compromise with Putin.""",1655382484.0,1655377272.0,t3_vdd0nz,t1_ickf4h6,,3,-11,0,-11,0,0,

After capturing, the privateers could bring the case of that prize before their own admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. A letter of marque and reprisal would include permission to cross an international border to conduct a reprisal (take some action against an attack or injury) and was authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct reprisal operations outside its borders.

As hard as the US steamrolled Iraq we advanced an average of less than 1 mile per day, Russia is averaging about 0.15km per day right now, with Ukraine taking roughly 0.5km per day in the area around Kherson.

Germany declared war because the US had really already chosen a side, just as it had in WW1. the USA just couldn't galvanize their populace to shed blood over it.

The difference between then and now is that the scale of involvement will be limited by knowing there will never be any repayment of the aid, and that there will be economic consequences at home. The USA was never put to the test in this respect during the world wars.

The world wars were not a disaster for the USA. And despite what you suggest, being the world's only unipolar power doesn't fall into your lap by accident.",False,1655384494.0,t3_vdd0nz,t1_ickrirq,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

I don't mind the US choosing the sides of their allies. I do mind them crippling them and dismantling them as a power after victory. 

That is the initial point I was making.. the UK gained nothing for themselves from WW2, it was heroically, stupidly, selfless in a way the US never is (they could have supported France had they wanted - they didn't).
