\#Ukraine army: We have inflicted devastating blows on Russian assets

  
Ukraine's Armed Forces have released their morning briefing where they say they ""managed to inflict devastating blows on groups of occupying troops.""  
  
They say their airforce destroyed three Russian war planes, one helicopter, three unmanned aerial vehicles and shot down two missiles. The BBC is yet to independently verify these claims.  
  
Ukraine's army also said that while Russia continued to bomb ""densely populated areas of Ukrainian cities"" this week, its troops have failed to advance on several fronts, including Donestk, Luhansk and Mykolaiv.  
  
""The enemy continues to bear losses on retreats in certain areas,"" the statement says.

This conduct is like 'textbook' strategy of defence in depth that Finnish Armed Forces plans to use to defend in Finland in case of russian aggression. Infantry manouver (generally defending the main roads and surrounding areas), heavy use of indirect fire, concentration of not giving air dominance to the aggressor.

Main point generally is not suicidal defense of every inch of motherland, but stalling the offense by defense and small counterattacks (strike and fade, usually using the forests and infantry), indirect fire. Basically if you see 100 russian tanks rolling in, you dont take all your tanks there for big decisive battle, no, you bombard them, retreat, attack, poke at them, frustrate the enemy. It's like Irregual Warfare and death by thousand cuts. Static defense lines are not conductive in situations where enemy has theoretically superior firepower available.

Technically the finnish strategy isn't even to 'win', it's only purpose is to cause maximum casualties and equipment loss to enemy, and this way force enemy to not attack or stop the attack before total loss for finland.

Of course finnish landscape supports this kind of fighting much better than the ukrainian more open landscape, but I think the general idea is the same.

And note: This is my general impression of how Finland wants to fight and defend, I'm a civilian and don't hold any significant position in finnish army other than being part of the reserves. And this strategy isn't a secret exactly, it's showcased in various videos published by finnish army in youtube for example.",1647420589.0,1647420399.0,t3_tfa2u8,t3_tfa2u8,,0,212,0,212,0,0,

Gerashchenko wrote that Mityaev was the commander of the 150th motorized rifle division and posted a photo of what he said was the dead officer.

""Operational information as of 06.00 16.03.2022
Today / 02 : 15 ID: 6231a1964909af001342b92c

The twenty-first era of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began.

The state, position and nature of the actions of the defense forces have not changed significantly during the last day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to inflict devastating blows on groups of occupying troops in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and, in some areas, to counterattack.

According to the results of the previous day, due to the actions of the air defense of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three planes (two of them Su-34) were destroyed. In addition, one helicopter, three operational-tactical UAVs and two cruise missiles were shot down. Additional information is currently being clarified.

Air Force aircraft continued to launch missile and bomb strikes on ground targets. Nine airstrikes were carried out on columns of equipment and clusters of occupying troops.

The occupying forces continue to launch missile and bomb strikes on the infrastructure and densely populated areas of Ukrainian cities.

The enemy continues to bear losses on retreats in certain areas. The main efforts of the occupiers are focused on consolidating and maintaining previously occupied borders and defense areas.

Remember, our strength is in the truth! Let's win together! Glory to Ukraine!""

https://cepa.org/the-next-10-days-will-decide-this-war/

I'll paste this article here, very well-written and interesting, by Ben Hodges, retired Lt. General.  
  
The Next 10 Days Will Decide This War  
  
  
Russia’s effort to conquer Ukraine may culminate within the next 10 days.  
  
The Russians are in trouble, and they know it. That's why they have reached out to China for help and why they are now recruiting Syrians.  
  
Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition, and manpower. That’s not based on any inside intelligence — it’s clear from open source information and my own experience. I could be way off, but I am confident of this assessment.  
  
An essential caveat to my assessment is that we, the West, led by the US, must accelerate and expand the support we are providing to Ukraine on the scale and with the sense of urgency of the Berlin Airlift (June 1948-May 1949). They need the weapons and ammunition to destroy the rockets, cruise missiles, and long-range artillery that are causing most of the damage to Ukrainian cities, as well as the intelligence to locate those systems, and the ability to hit Russian Navy vessels that are launching cruise missiles into cities from the Black Sea and the Azov Sea.  
  
The time challenge for Russia is not just military. The effects of sanctions are growing — Russia may soon default on $150bn of foreign currency debt —and Russian domestic resentment is also growing (we should remember that it’s unusual as well as extreme brave for ordinary people to protest in Putin’s Russia and for television editors to suddenly interrupt their own programs waving anti-war placards.) We should do all we can to fuel that discontent and to let courageous Russians know they have our support.  
  
Ammunition shortages  
  
The Russians are experiencing ammunition shortages. Their transition to attrition warfare is driving up consumption rates beyond what they had planned and what they can sustain. They will still have a lot of the conventional artillery and so-called dumb bombs. But as we know from past US military operations, the most sophisticated munitions are very expensive and so more limited in availability. The Russians are likely to be having the same experience; in addition, they thought the campaign would end within a few days so large stocks were probably not prepared. Wartime consumption always exceeds planning numbers, and urban combat exacerbates that. Sanctions will also have assisted —Finland and Slovenia used to provide some munitions to Russia, and those have now stopped.  
  
Manpower shortages  
  
The Pentagon has said that 50% of Russian combat power was committed in Ukraine. At the height of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we were about 29% committed. And it was difficult to sustain that.  
  
This plays directly into the discussion of the encirclement of Kyiv. Russia does not have the manpower or firepower to encircle the Ukrainian capital, let alone capture it.  I have been to Kyiv several times.  I was there in Kyiv five weeks ago, met President Zelenskyy.  It is a very large, dense major urban center on the banks of one of Europe’s largest rivers. It is a difficult, complex urban terrain.  
  
The Ukrainians are going to be able to keep it open and prevent encirclement, especially if we can get the flow of weapons and ammunition up to the levels needed. There will be, unfortunately, be increasing attacks on the city by air and ground systems, and many more innocent Ukrainian citizens will be murdered, injured, or displaced.  But I don’t believe it will fall.  
  
Russia’s dilemma is only worsened by its combat casualties. Although I am always skeptical about enemy body counts, I do believe the numbers of dead are in the thousands (possibly in the 5,000-6,000 range suggested by US sources) and the numbers of wounded much higher. The modern battlefield is extremely lethal, especially for poorly trained or disciplined soldiers. These are very high numbers for just the first two weeks of war and many come from Russia’s elite units — they are hard to replace (and the Kremlin won’t be able to conceal these losses from the Russian public and all those for long.)  
  
Reports of low morale, dissension between commanders, mutiny on at least one vessel, desertion, and so on, all within the first two weeks are indicators of major manpower problems. And in pure numbers, the Ukrainian armed forces still outnumber or closely match Russian forces actually on the ground in Ukraine.  
  
There is no suggestion that the Russians have big units lurking in the woods somewhere (and the Pentagon has said it sees no signs of significant reinforcements.) So it’s apparent that the notional 900,000 strength of the Russian military is a hollow number.  Their public call for 16,000 troops from Syria and elsewhere indicates this. Employment of “stop loss” by Russia on conscripts whose time is about up is another indicator. The Ukrainian diaspora is flocking home to help the fight; Russians are not coming back home — and indeed, many are leaving to avoid Putin’s fight.  
  
There is now an opportunity to exacerbate their manpower problem.  The next intake of conscripts into the Russian Army is on April 1, when around 130,000 Russian families are required to send their sons (18-25) to Conscription Centers where they will be inducted into the Russian Army as privates.  
  
We should do all we can to influence that next intake by using a combination of human outreach as well as cyber/technical means to bypass the Russian blackout on journalism and social media. Millions of Ukrainians, Georgians, Germans, Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians, and Finns have friends, family, business contacts, employees, and customers in Russia.  They should be reaching out to them directly — Lithuanians have already launched a campaign along these lines. If we can get some percentage of those families to resist, joining those thousands of Russians who are already showing the courage to protest, that would send shockwaves across Russia.  
  
The next 10 days are decisive. It is a race and I’m not seeing enough urgency. We need to push the gas pedal to the floor now, immediately.

Other rocket parts landed next to the pumas, and yet more near the lion enclosure. Yury Kyrechenko, the zoo’s deputy director, said war had come so fast that they had been unable to prepare properly. They were doing their best, moving the most dangerous animals to more secure enclosures, he said. But there was little they could do in case of a direct hit. “After three weeks of this idiot’s genocidal war, it really would be the icing on the cake; to see lions, tigers and leopards free to roam Mykolaiv’s streets.”

All of this is extremely bad for Russia. The only things that would have been worse are if he'd announced nuclear forces repositioning in Poland and the Baltics.

In 2019, only the US, Bulgaria, Greece, the UK, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland meet or exceed the 2% spending benchmark. Even that is the highest NATO defense expenditure since the fall of the Soviet Union. If NATO countries heed the call here (and some big spenders already have), that would be an increase of $90B per year. That's like adding two UKs to the alliance.

* **Through the International Criminal Court (ICC)**
The International Criminal Court is a relatively new institution that has been operating since 2002. Its jurisdiction is international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.

* **Establishment of an international ad hoc tribunal**
One of the possible scenarios for prosecuting Russia's top political leadership is the creation of an ad hoc international tribunal (special tribunal). 

* **National trial**
Another, albeit unlikely, way to condemn the leadership of the Russian Federation may be a national trial in Russia itself. This scenario is, of course, possible only if the regime in this country changes to a democratic one.

Andriy Shevchenko on plans to house refugees

Former Ukraine footballer Andriy Shevchenko says he will take in refugee families at his Surrey home as he aims to support 150 Ukrainians in the UK.

The former Chelsea and AC Milan striker is also launching a programme with the World Food Programme to raise £1m for his home country.

He's told BBC Breakfast it was a ""devastating time"" for him, his family and all those in Ukraine at the moment.

He says he had a lot of friends who wanted to help provide accommodation including in student flats.

Shevchenko says he has spoken with the ambassador to Ukraine here and is hoping to host a couple of families at his home.

He adds his own family would probably stay in Ukraine, particularly as his mother has a health condition which made it difficult for her to leave Kyiv.

""This is a situation that hundreds and thousands of families in Ukraine are facing and we have to make a decision,"" he says.

He also thanked people in the UK and around the world for their support for Ukraine.",False,1647427856.0,t3_tfa2u8,t3_tfa2u8,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Zelensky to address US Congress  
  
  
For his latest high-profile speech - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will deliver a virtual address in about an hour to the US Congress.  
  
It follows a speech he delivered last week to the UK Parliament, echoing Winston Churchill’s stirring words during World War Two, and a speech to Canada's Parliament yesterday.  
  
President Zelensky has addressed members of the US Congress before - in a Zoom call a few weeks ago.  
  
Back then he pleaded for more support. This included requests for fighter jets and a no-fly zone.  
  
It’s likely he will repeat those demands – increasing the pressure on President Biden.  
  
There is some support in Congress for providing fighter jets, but the no-fly zone is a red line – because that would put Russian soldiers in direct contact with US and Nato soldiers, escalating the conflict.

I asked one of these people for a source and she gave me a link to some ""Lithuanian experts"" on Twitter. I tried going down the rabbit hole, but it involved too much Google Translate and I got confused.

The Twitter account was either quoting the ""experts"" or it *belonged* to one of the ""experts,"" I couldn't tell. It linked to the full text of the allegations on Telegram.

The only other source I can find is a group called ""Vakcina nuo vatnikų"" on FB which reprints the ""expert"" commentary and links to the same Twitter account as well as to a subreddit and Reddit user. The public comments on the FB page angrily dispute that the protest was fake. 

I don't want to provide any of the links in case it's disinformation. 

A day later, Ovsyannikova hasn't been publicly denounced as a fake. Zelenskyy has publicly thanked her for her stand, and I've just seen footage of her being briefly interviewed after her release. She's still speaking out against the Russian invasion.

I don't know why I wrote all that except to say that I haven't found any reliable statements from any ""experts"" with actual credentials who are willing to be named. 

I'm assuming the people denouncing her as a fake [**edit:** in the circle of anonymous, self-referring links offered as evidence) are in fact Russian bots.

&#x200B;

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War)

&#x200B;

""The Russo-Georgian War was a war between Georgia on one side and Russia and the Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other""

""On 1 August 2008, the Russian-backed South Ossetian forces started shelling Georgian villages, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the area. Intensifying artillery attacks by the South Ossetians broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement. To put an end to these attacks, the Georgian army units were sent in to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August. Georgian troops took control of most of Tskhinvali, a separatist stronghold, in hours.

""Russia accused Georgia of an ""aggression against South Ossetia"", and launched a full-scale land, air and sea invasion of Georgia, including its undisputed territory, on 8 August, referring to it as a ""peace enforcement"" operation""

Fifteen-point draft deal would involve Kyiv renouncing Nato membership ambitions in return for security guarantees

Details incoming...

Ukraine and Russia have made significant progress on a tentative 15-point peace plan including a ceasefire and Russian withdrawal if Kyiv declares neutrality and accepts limits on its armed forces, according to three people involved in the talks.

The nature of western guarantees for Ukrainian security — and their acceptability to Moscow — could yet prove to be a big obstacle to any deal, as could the status of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and its proxies in 2014. A 1994 agreement underpinning Ukrainian security failed to prevent Russian aggression against its neighbour.

Although Moscow and Kyiv both said on Wednesday that they had made progress on the terms of a deal, Ukrainian officials remain sceptical Russian President Vladimir Putin is fully committed to peace and worry that Moscow could be buying time to regroup its forces and resume its offensive.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Financial Times that any deal would involve “the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine” captured since the invasion began on February 24 — namely southern regions along the Azov and Black Seas, as well as territory to the east and north of Kyiv.

“We propose a ‘Ukrainian model of security guarantees,’ which implies the immediate and legally verified participation of a number of guarantor countries in the conflict on the side of Ukraine, if someone again encroaches on its territorial integrity,” he added.

Ukraine would maintain its armed forces but would be obliged to stay outside military alliances such as Nato and refrain from hosting foreign military bases on its territory.

Ukraine, Podolyak added, would as part of any deal “definitely retain its own army”. He also played down the significance of a ban on foreign bases in Ukraine, saying that was already precluded by Ukrainian law.

Two of the people said the putative deal also included provisions on enshrining rights for the Russian language in Ukraine, where it is widely spoken though Ukrainian is the only official language. Russia has framed its invasion as an attempt to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine from what it claims is “genocide” by “neo-Nazis”.

The biggest sticking point remains Russia’s demand that Ukraine recognise its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the independence of two separatist statelets in the eastern Donbas border region.

Ukraine has so far refused but is willing to compartmentalise the issue, Podolyak said.

“Disputed and conflict territories \[are\] in a separate case. So far, we are talking about a guaranteed withdrawal from the territories that have been occupied since the start of the military operation on February 24,” when Russia’s invasion began, he said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended Chinese President Xi Jinping's timetable to invade Taiwan, according to documents purportedly written by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.

""Xi Jinping was at least considering taking over Taiwan in the fall - he needs his own little victory to get re-elected for a third term - there the struggle within the elite is colossal,"" an agent in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, allegedly wrote on March 9.

China will hold its 20th Communist Party Congress this fall, and Xi has said it will be a ""major event."" Analysts have predicted that Xi will either be re-elected as the general secretary of the Communist Party or be elected to the chairmanship of the party, a position that has not existed since 1982.

""Now, after the Ukrainian events, this window of opportunity has been closed to him, which gives the United States the opportunity to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with its competitors on favorable terms,"" the FSB agent added. ""It was in this case that we launched a trap mechanism for China with our actions.""

,tfa2u8,i0wbca7,"People need to understand that [Russia](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dont-worry-the-us-would-win-a-nuclear-war-with-russia?_amp=true) cannot win a nuclear war with the United States. Any nuclear war between the two would result in a Russian defeat. Putin isn’t suicidal:

> In a nuclear war with Russia, U.S. victory would remain the most likely outcome. That's primarily because the U.S. has better potential to get more nuclear warheads onto Russian targets than Russia could get onto U.S. targets.

> The extension here is that while both nations retain a triad of nuclear strike forces -- ICBM-armed ground bases, aircraft, and submarines -- Russia would struggle to utilize the aircraft and submarine components effectively.

> For a start, Russia's strategic bomber force is aged and nonstealth in nature.

> While the Russians are attempting to upgrade these capabilities, they are a long way from being able to rival U.S.-equivalent platforms such as the B-2 bomber. Correspondingly, in the event of war, Russian strategic bombers would find themselves highly vulnerable to detection, interception, and destruction by U.S. fighter interceptors.

> Similarly, Russian nuclear strategic submarine, or SSBN, forces are also less adept than their U.S. counterparts.

> Yes, the Russians have developed a relatively new class of SSBN, the Borei class, but that program has been delayed repeatedly and only three boats are currently operational. While the Russian Navy has ten other SSBNs, all those boats were built in the Soviet era and they struggle with maintenance issues. They are also loud.

> That matters in better enabling U.S. intelligence services to monitor the location of Russia's SSBN force at all times. In war, this would enable U.S. Virginia class attack submarines to hunt and kill the Russian fleet before they reached their launch patrol sectors. In a crisis, the U.S. would surge its attack submarines to ensure redundant capability.

> Moreover, the U.S. Navy is considering placing nuclear-armed missiles on some of its Virginia class attack submarines and is actively developing a next generation SSBN boat, the Columbia class.

> The second weakness of Russian nuclear forces is that they are underfunded and less competent than their U.S. counterparts. Put simply, their equipment is less reliable, less available, and their leadership lower in quality. This is a problem for Russia in that the exigency of effective nuclear strike command, control, and operational competency is impossible to overstate. If one unit fails to deliver on its mission, an adversary could launch a counterstrike or its second wave strikes.

> Still, this is not to say that the Russian strategic forces are not courageous. As I've noted, we all owe a particular debt to one of these men, Stanislav Petrov, for his decision to stand up against superiors and save the world.

> Ultimately, Petrov's courage speaks to the broader issue: the horror of nuclear war.

> After all, even if the Russian air and submarine strategic forces were defeated by U.S. forces, the Russians would still retain their ground based ICBM forces. And the range of Russian ICBMs mean they would be able to hit every major U.S. city with confidence.

> Put another way, even if the U.S. won a nuclear war by retaining smaller cities and a large rural population and denying the Russians the same, the social and economic consequences of any nuclear exchange with Russia would be horrendous.

> And that should remind us of a great quote from the movie ""Crimson Tide.""",False,1647445646.0,t3_tfa2u8,t3_tfa2u8,,0,-2,0,-2,0,0,

I get the sentiment but US has previously made India give up oil from Iran and Venezuela. Also there is a huge matter of EU countries still buying a significant amount of their oil from Russia. If it is a toss up between reigning in inflation and getting a very essential commodity(oil) for its people and the optics of India buying oil from Russia (Noting concrete, only some bureaucrats discussing it in some sections) then I think everyone knows what will happen.

The thing is either pre-recorded or broadcast with a delay, so anyone jumping out with a poster would be cut clean from the video. Unless, of course, you wanted everyone to see it. 2. She was a news editor for this same channel for 8+ years, so she was behind some of the most prominent Russian fakes about the 2014 invasion and on. 3. She got 0 backlash for her protest (they fined her for 30k rubles for the Instagram post, not the poster, and the court hearing was held on the same day or the next one, which is unheard of in such circumstances). 4. If her protest had been real, she would have been dragged in the mud for months and wouldn't have gotten away as easily.

TLDR: It's a staged protest aimed at contributing to the narrative of ""ordinary Russians having nothing to do with this invasion and actively opposing the regime"". Please, don't buy it. Especially from the Russian state media. There're Russians who are genuinely against the war, but Marina is not one of them and has never been.

When an 'Expert' says it, I instantly know that they haven't re-examined their pre war assumptions about the Russian military and don't know shit about Russian doctrine.

We are currently in the phase where they fall back on long-range seige warfare with zero regard for civilians.

The hilarious part about this strategy is it plays right into Ukraine's hands strategically. (The loss of life is tragic and it makes me sick, but I'm talking big picture). It further strengthens Ukrainian morale, international support and gives weight to Ukrainian requests for more equipment and assistance.

At some point soon there is a 50-50 chance Ukraine starts making some advances.

It's also likely that during this time, Mariupol and/or Kharkiv will fall; no one can last forever without supplies.

But even if both those cities fall, Russia is still not winning this war. Strategically, they've already lost; economy, reputation, diplomatically, prestige.

Ukraine has also lost though. But in the long run will likely win (post-war, as allied money flows in to help rebuild).

 >The Russo-Georgian War was a war between Georgia on one side and Russia and the Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, on the other. The war took place in August 2008 following a period of worsening relations between Russia and Georgia, both formerly constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The fighting took place in the strategically important South Caucasus region. It is regarded as the first European war of the 21st century.

Other factors:

* Ukraine basically having a training ground for soldiers for the last eight years in the East.

* The Ukrainian army recognising in 2014 that it needed to change.

* EU and USA agreeing to partner with the Ukrainians to prepare them for this war.

* Russia ""holding its punches"" in the initial invasion to avoid civilian causalities. (I do think think this one is understated -- they went into Ukraine trying to avoid their normal ""level everything"" tactics).

* Russia unable to manage so many fronts.

* Russian intelligence being out-of-date ... they are lethal but lumbering. Kind of a 90s army but this is the 2020s.

* Ukraine fairly electing a Russian-speaking ""clean-skin"" populist with good media skills, made it hard for Russia to paint the Ukrainian government as corrupt anti-Russians nazis.",1647436426.0,1647434213.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vk1kl,,1,13,0,13,0,0,
875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,tfa2u8,i0vo24z,"There's a whole host of reasons, I suspect. 

First, Ukraine has been in war for 8 years. They were absolutely kicked back in 2014 and as a result, they pretty much built their army up from scratch. They've been trained by various NATO member states in all different kinds of aspects of defence and they've been focusing on total defence strategy - active duty army + volunteers in territorial defence + reservists. 

Second, US intelligence. It's been spot on this time around and as transparent as they can be without showing their sources and how they gather their information. 

Third, you can bet that Ukraine studied heavily how previous conflicts with Russia have gone. They looked at their own experience in 2014, Georgia's experience in 2008, and Syria most likely as well. They knew fully well that Russia lies and tells whatever suits to the international media, which means they knew that the moment they'd be attacking back, Russia would claim Ukraine started an offensive against Russia. They probably learned Russia's weak spots (such as the reliance on rails, perhaps) and Ukraine's strong spots, and tried to see how the overlaps can benefit Ukraine. 

And fourth, Ukraine's PR-game and information war online has been superb so far. Sure, in Russia's sphere of influence, it's a different story and in places that are anti-US or pro-Russia, people voluntarily choose to believe Russia. BUT: it's also important that you get the large countries and entities on your side and Ukraine has done it very well. 

And last but not least - fighting morale is very important as well. Ukraine is defending itself and its statehood. They see that there are countries behind them and supporting them, even if we're not militarily engaged. They've been able to keep Russians at bay in most areas now, for a few days. This all helps, even in the midst of devastation and death. If you lack a belief in self, don't see any support from others, it's much easier to crumble.",False,1647435577.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vk1kl,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

""The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence performed poorly during the conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making contact with his combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone.

They also did not have long-range surface-to-air missiles that could be fired beyond the air-defence zones of an adversary.\[360\] Opposition-affiliated Russian analyst Konstantin Makienko observed the substandard conduct of the Russian Air Force: ""It is totally unbelievable that the Russian Air Force was unable to establish air superiority almost to the end of the five-day war, despite the fact that the enemy had no fighter aviation""

Additionally Ukraine will go into an economic boom due to EU membership and essentially be spending the next two decades designing and fulfilling a defence strategy solely based on keeping Russia out, based on the lessons of this war.

To understand this, you need to have watched Russia since the Chechnyan conflict (the first one) or at least the Georgian conflict. Russia burned themselves *hard* in Chechnya. They got their asses handed to them in city warfare in the first round. Then they tried the level everything approach. They won, but it *still* cost them massively.

&nbsp;

Enter Georgia. Putin freaked out about the prospect of Georgia joining NATO and sent in his forces. Despite what a lot of people think, military analysts agree; the campaign went really bad for russians. Sure, they beat the Georgians handily, but that was to be expected. Georgias armed forces were small. The problem was that the russian forces performed horribly. So bad in fact, that it led to most of the top echelon of the officer corps being replaced and a complete revamp of russian forces composition and methods. They styled themselves after western battle groups after this. They though this would solve their problems. They did however solve the ghost of EU/NATO by leaving enclaves of disputed territory. The same method as in Moldova.

&nbsp;

Enter Ukraine 2014: Putin panics again. He had just watched the first large demonstrations against him ever. Then the color revolutions swept the middle east. He watches Khadaffi in Libya fall. And suddenly his attempts to subvert democracy in Ukraine through Yanukowich fails and he sees the prospect of Ukraine next door slide to the EU and NATO (EU and economic prosperity is the one he fears btw, not NATO) and them succesfully out his ally. He uses the playbook from Moldova and Georgia and takes Crimea. That runs smoothly, so he creates the eastern enclaves as added punishment and security. Again the russian troops do NOT perform well in the eastern provinces. (The ""rebels"" pretty much are just ""green men"" again) Why? Must be the russian armys outdated equipment. They embark on making new fighters, new MBT's and new IFV's. As usual the problem *really* is the incredible lack of initiative thaught to lower officer corps, the lackluster training and the **immense** corruption. Sanctions hit, and their new development gear proves too ambitious for their really quite horrible industrial and tech capabilities and is iced a few years later.

&nbsp;

Ukraine 2021/2022. Since 2014 Putin has kept Ukraine destabilized by repeatedly using the threat of escalation in Donetsk. Again and again he ramps up troops, the West and Ukraine reaches compromises and he backs down. He embarks on a new round of the same after Zelensky is elected (which he immediatly hates), and another one. But this second time, Biden is in power. And Biden and Obama saw 2014 and *hated* what happened then and that their hands were somewhat tied. He was prepared. Ukraine was also prepared. They had spent the last 8 years building a sense of nationality in ALL parts of the country. Western countries had trained ukrainian troops for the better part of all 8 years and advised. The Ukrainians themselves used the Donbass conflict to their advantage; rotating hundreds of thousans through the eastern frontline to gain combat experience. And the Ukrainians did **real** upgrades to their equipment and started production of a lot of their own, quite effective equipment. They also reformed their armed forces and *this* reform was real and effective

&nbsp;

And so Putin escalates. He has **not** realized the changes in Ukrainian mentality. And he is **not** expecting everyone to not make moves to deescalate. He certainly has **not** planned to invade at that time. His escalation on borders gets stonewalled. He turns up the heat, ramps up forces. Still get stonewalled. Escalates language to scare everyone to back down. Nothing. No response other than support for Ukraine. Everyone has had it with him. At **this point** he is trapped. He can not back down, he will look weak back home. So he decides to invade. At that point everyone starts arming Ukraine. And when he finally sends in troops, he believes in a) his own propaganda about his forces strenght b) that sanctions on the level about to hit him are unthinkable c) that someone will back down and worst of all for him d) That support for Russia in Ukraine is at 2014 levels. He thinks they will fold, and quickly.

As neither Russia nor Ukraine have air supremacy, and Russia only has localized air superiority, this means that neither side has a good counter to enemy artillery.  


So we're seeing drones and counter artillery being used by both sides against artillery. But it does show that in a conflict where one side cannot gain air supremacy another tool is needed. However, western doctrine places air supremacy as essential, and we've seen past seen in past conflicts that western military will simply delay ground operations until they have gained it. In a hypothetical conflict where this is not an option, the west would need something else, but I'm not sure this is probable enough to cause a shift in doctrine.  


Rather I expect arms manufacturers will see a market among smaller non-western militaries that may find themselves in a similar situation as what we see in Ukraine. I see drone technology as the future in this area. Especially if it provides a good counter even when faced with enemy air supremacy.

As far as the question of ""How do we know that the Russians are going to struggle?"", it's because Odessa is historically a deathtrap to invading militaries. They've got a lot of tunnel systems designed to turn any fighting into a hellacious sort that strictly favors the defenders.

Furthermore, according to all accounts I'm aware of, the Odessans are a proud people that have spent the last ~30 years turning their city into a wonderful location. They see what's happening in other cities occupied by Russia and they are absolutely furious that the Russians may decide to step into THEIR town and pull the same shit. The Russian landing force is relatively small (I think it's roughly 20,000 last I heard) compared with the population of the city (at 1,000,000). Even if only 2% of the population chooses to resist, that's an equal number of people to the invading group, which leaves aside the Ukrainian military units stationed there.

Common military wisdom is that to actually enter and take a city by force, you need to have at MINIMUM a 5:1 numbers advantage over the defenders.

At this point, or any other point in time, any agreement signed by Russia should not be valued any higher than the paper or parchment that their delegates signatures are on.

Budapest Memorandum was a security guarantee signed by Russia regarding Ukraine's denuclearization, broken.

Minsk Protocol was a cease-fire and escalation with LPR/DPR Russian backed separatists that Russia continued to supply even with OSCE oversight and proof of their involvement.

Minsk II similar to above.

That is just the last 30 years, I have no doubt further research and digging would produce additional examples of more of the same.

(1) Russian Air Force is lacking tactical strike capability, and has little in precision guided weapons.   They can either drop bombs safely on places that don't help the ground battle, or come in low and get shredded by ground unit with man portable SAMs.   Basically, their air force is burning fuel and ammo and not helping right now.

(2) Predominant damage is being done by artillery, cruise missiles, and short-range ballistic missiles.  NFZs will do little to stop them, as the only way is to destroy the launchers.

(3) Takes awhile to implement, position what you need, and sustain a 24/7 coverage.   Also risk of friendly fire downing your own planes, especially as most threats to Ukranian forces are coming in low.  Also risking action against Russian military, which would be an escalation if the NFZ forces have to engage.

Otherwise, you're dealing with imported cane sugar.  It's safe to get it while you can so you can hang on to it.

American canned goods have *way* too much sugar because of the way our agriculture values corn syrup due to... a lot of things... but one reason you put sugar in canned or pickled stuff is to make it palatable.

&#x200B;

One has to understand that Ukraine, for all its positives, is still an Eastern European nation, and thus riddled with corruption and poverty. Things started to really change only after EuroMaidan, and even then only for the middle class and upper classes. It was still a poor country, with not so great prospects BUT it was moving forward much faster than Russia. Zelenskyy wasn't universally loved (heck a lot of my friends there - mostly middle class - were downright against him), and Ukraine's path towards becoming a modern western nation would have been long and full of false starts and backsteps (same as many other countries in the region - Serbia, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria etc)

&#x200B;

But along comes Russia - who instead of banking on the support of a significant % of the population - decided to invade and grab Crimeea and other territories when Ukraine was weak. This lead to a very, very fast de-rusification of the country, it's hard to be pro-russian when they've invaded your homeland and killed your compatriots. 

&#x200B;

Now Russia is trying again - but this time they've burned off any and all goodwill bridges with the Ukrainian world as well as the West in general. If only to make sure Russia can never try again - Ukraine will likely receive massive aid packages from EU and US, as well as from other international bodies such as the IMF. A rebuilt Ukraine - built up at western standards - will be a slap in the face for Russia, who will now have on their immediate border a neighbor sharing their language but significantly more prosperous (and whom it deemed as inferior/not worthy of an existence just a few weeks ago).

Rebuilding will take some time, but you have to remember that most of the country is more or less untouched. The overall prosperous western part of the country is still there. For better or worse - only around 15-20% of Ukrainian territory is actually affected by the war. Ukraine has a base from which to rebuild from (for now), and it will be built back much better than before (the infrastructure wasn't amazing to begin with - we're still talking Eastern Europe levels, or worse USSR level quality).

The speaker started with strategic culture theory as the underlying of why Russia is the way it is.

In a somewhat short bad summary:

First - they've been invaded a lot, so they have the eternal ""we're going to be attacked"" mentality. Several of those attacks that came from European side managed to penetrate deeply into Russia, so they're sensitive on that side.

Second - Russia doesn't have a history of good leadership, but ever since mongols it's basically been a long line of authoritative leaders, who rule with a strong arm. So much so that Russian's don't know otherwise and whenever someone does try, so far it has always failed badly, hence strong-armed ruler = calm and stability. 

Third - Russia has many layers within itself how it sees itself (protector of all Russian-speakers, protector of the eastern-orthodox faith (so-called Third and Permanent Rome), etc.) and Russia stands on a three legs - religion, strong leader, and the average Russian person. (that part is much better explained in the video)

Fourth - because of its history, Russian people are used to suffering. When they suffer, it's okay, because what will come later, will be better and everything will be fine then. If they need to suffer, there must be a good reason for why it is necessary.

Fifth - this was more about Finland. He brought up that Russian children learn one specific poem from an early age in school, which basically depicts Finnish people as nothing more than people living in huts and their city being a little dump in the swamps. Basically - pretty derogatory. His implication was that a fear of others being anti-Russia and also less-than-Russia is being instilled in children from a young age.

Basically - f\*\*\*ed up history and subjugation of people for hundreds of years by strong-armed leaders have made Russian people act, behave, and react in a certain way.",False,1647442699.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vyjkt,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

The ONLY reason it was justified was because of FALSE LINKS to Al Qaeda and 9/11, and then chained with possession of WMDs, which turned out to be false as well.

The thing is, you can make an equal case for North Korea, Assad (who ACTUALLY used chemical-weapons recently against his own people), Putin, hell even Duterte and his cruel drug-war. But we don't because it's not as simple as just invading a sovereign territory.

You know exactly what is said about Terrorists & Freedom-fighters. There's a reason when you strike an apartment complex in Baghdad that you create 10 more terrorists than the one you killed. There's a reason an insurgency existed and a vacuum of power opened up, facilitating the likes of ISIS.

 >The Crucified Soldier refers to the widespread atrocity propaganda story of an Allied soldier serving in the Canadian Corps who may have been crucified with bayonets on a barn door or a tree, while fighting on the Western Front during World War I. Three witnesses said they saw an unidentified crucified Canadian soldier near the battlefield of Ypres, Belgium, on or around 24 April 1915, but there was no conclusive proof such a crucifixion actually occurred. The eyewitness accounts were somewhat contradictory, no crucified body was found, and no knowledge was uncovered at the time about the identity of the supposedly crucified soldier.

And yet it's not stopping them from taking objectives. 

You can say things about how Russians lack this or that, but if slowly more and more Ukrainian land falls onto Russian control, without Ukraine ever gaining any of it back, total fall of Ukraine is a matter of time.

Poll ""Will Russia control Kyiv by June 1st"" has 30% voted yes.

Poll ""Will Russia control Kyiv by 1st of Jan 2023"" 40% voted yes.

So while it seems people are currently predicting that Kyiv will not be occupied, it's a close vote, and in addition, it seems that the expectation is that most other cities in Ukraine will fall, leaving Kyiv a lone fortress standing. Also, based on phrasing of those questions, peace treaty/surrender which would not result in Kyiv having Russian troops enter it, would still count as ""Kyiv did not fall"". I couldn't find a poll that measured the chances of Ukraine surrendering with awful terms, but it seems likely that rather than have Kyiv bombed to the ground, Ukraine would rather surrender.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Integrated_Operational_Plan

Basically the US only had a single plan for nuclear war for many many years, that plan was to strike first and disable everyone they considered an enemy. The reason why they only had one plan is because they didn't have the budget or foresight needed to make alternative plans for limited wars and the general consensus was and still is that there's no such thing as a limited nuclear war. 

The plan for simultaneous strikes was rather optimistic, this was during the time when most bombs would be dropped from airplanes so they made a super complicated schedule to make sure they didn't interfere with their own planes but obviously couldn't account for simple things like windspeed and direction which made the entire plan useless. Then again they had planned 23 strikes just for Moscow (and many more later on) so I guess there was some redundancy.

The plan also dictated that everything should be spent immediately, no reserves and no follow ups. Everyone who was privvy to this at the time knew there would be no ""after"" in the event of a general war.",False,1647432494.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vfxar,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

I am not in Ukraine and have not lived there. 99% of my information comes from what is essentially ""the West"". Be it reddit, friends, acquaintances, conventional news, etc.

I don't mean to say that the news may be intentionally biased, as if there was some big evil plan. I just mean to say that the west is its own culture and, therefore, has its own massive echo-chamber as well. You see this on a much smaller scale all the time (democrats vs republicans, left vs right, ""your team"" vs ""my team"" in soccer). Two people with theoretically the same information can make completely opposite judgements based on how they _feel_ towards the object or entity being judged, and they then go on to reinforce this bias with like-minded equally biased people.

In fact, the few people I know who have been to Russia have always described it as one of the best places they visited and they described how landing back here (in Portugal -- I'm from Portugal) felt like going back to the dark ages. Do I think that what they said corresponds to the broader truth about the country? Of course not. But I can't deny that these people came with a very different report than what I expected.

Do you know that feeling when you hate something or love something or feel so passionately about something that you so easily ""get your pitchforks out"" for it? For example, say you hate your boss, or your teacher, or a specific group of people who wronged you in the past. Every little thing they do, you will see under a negative light, even to the point of not giving them the benefit of the doubt and not accepting an alternative view. You will typically create constant obstacles to them, even if sometimes unconsciously. It is quite obvious to me that we do this with Russia. Nothing they do is well-intended. All they do is evil, they are all either ""poor, crazy, or ignorant"". While it is certainly true that they have behaviours which are outrageous, I'm sure that they also aren't quite as ""poor, crazy, or ignorant"" as we believe them to be, by the simple fact that we have been raised in an environment where we are made to think that of them. It is exactly like when people are raised within a religion/cult -- it becomes very difficult to not see things as ""us"" vs ""them"" and concede that the other side might have some valid points sometimes, even if they mostly do not.

So, in summary, I believe that I do not know the real truth. That is not saying that I think that Russia is in the right, that they have reasons to do this, that attacks aren't happening, etc. I am merely stating what seems obvious to me: no one is all bad in this world. Absolutely no one. So there is no reason to assume that the news that reaches me is entirely true, because it tries to paint Russia as ""all bad"". And, furthermore, that the news aren't trustworthy (they never have -- whenever the news reports about some topic I know deeply about, it is always outrageously wrong, so I need to assume they are equally incompetent for other topics), so I can't blindly trust the news either.",False,1647433619.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vj209,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Any amphibious landing against a defensive position is tough, taking any defensive position is tough but when it comes from the water you do not have many options on direction or surprise. This of course leads to heavy casualties as you can expect the defenders have set traps, pre sighted guns and mortars on likely positions you will take. So that handy collection of rocks that will provide cover has mines in front of it, that suspiciously undefended approach has a couple of hidden machine guns pointed at it. The invaders are also exposed to fire all the way in, there might be underwater obstacles designed to rip the hull out of your landing craft so as you stumble ashore half drowned from your gear you have to keep it together enough to straight into incoming fire, the second wave has it a little easier as the blown up landing craft from the first wave will provide cover but now your view of the enemy is hazy due to all the smoke from the shell explosions and gunfire, you are tripping over the dead and the water is now blood red from the first wave and now the defenders are warmed up and really pouring on the fire.

What is more likely in many people's view however is this is mostly a distraction to tie up troops so Odessa can not send troops to help further up the coast to defend against land attack from elsewhere. In combat tying up the opposition is just as important as defeating them when it comes to securing another objective. The Russians want the port, they need it, so the do not want to shell it into oblivion to soften it up to do a easier amphibious landing so likely it is a feign.",False,1647414556.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0uty4d,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,tfa2u8,i0vn7k7,"To be frank, it puts a lot of NATO lives at risk for near-zero gain and greater risk for escalation.

On the tactical level, the Russian air force has proven itself to be much worse than previous speculation indicates.   Half their air force can only do fighter things - they're not equipped for tactical strikes.  Their tactical support strike capability has been risible, as they lack the precision guided munitions to deliver accurate strikes outside of man-portable SAM range to aid ground forces where it's needed.  Every time they do a low-level strike, their planes and helicopters have been shredded by the high density of man-portable SAMs.   All their air force can do is drop a few dumb bombs from extreme heights and hope for the best.   So that asset is neutralized.

On a theater level, you have cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.    Any planes covering an NFZ would have trouble catching cruise missiles, and can't do anything about the ballistic missiles.   Ideally, if you're going to stop them, you'd blow up the launchers - but those are going to be outside Ukraine, so that's a non-starter.

Then there's the operational risks of sustaining a proper NFZ, besides starting a fight with the Russians.   You're going to get attrition and accidents from maintaining the constant flights needed.   You're also putting NATO assets at risk to friendly fire from Ukrainian MANPADs if the planes have to go low (cruise missiles and low flying ground support) - who knows if the Ukrainian forces have had training to deal with that.

And on a rather clinical/cynical level of thinking, we already know that Russians are being stretched thin.  An active air element has to be resupplied, repaired and maintained, which is a further strain on their supplies and ammunitions stores, which have been already poor.

If one Russian ICBM hits a city in Europe or North America it will likely kill more people than have died in this war in 3 weeks of fighting.  If you think the Russian army is indiscriminate in their killing of civilians, you should talk to the blast wave of a nuclear warhead.

Imagine for a minute that the US had the capability to destroy ICMBs and submarine launched warheads with 90% accuracy.  And imagine Russia fires 1000 of its deployed warheads using those methods.  Let's assume half of them fail to launch, hit their targets, or detonate.  If the remaining 500 hit only targets that are protected by the magical US missile defense, then 5 cities would be destroyed.  Millions to tens of millions of people would die right away.

 >The Winter War, also known as the First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. The war began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three-and-a-half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

They have been striking back. Western intelligence estimates the Russian forces have been literally decimated, by the classical definition of that word.

>And yet it's not stopping them from taking objectives

Not any of their major ones. They've been advancing on Kyiv for how long now? What objectives have they bought with ~20,000 casualties?

>You can say things about how Russians lack this or that...

Think logically for a moment. They're trying to take a country of 233,000 square miles with a mere 3 football stadium's worth of people.

Russia has its strengths - but Ukraine is fighting smart while Russia clings to extremely old tactics. Ukraine doesn't have to kill every soldier themselves, it's why they've been targeting Russian logistics (exacerbating the pre-existing problems in Russia's failure to plan). All the tanks in the world do you no good if they have no fuel - why spend expensive ammunition destroying one tank when you could spend that same ammunition destroying the fuel truck that will fuel a dozen?

>So either we ask when will Ukraine start winning fights

They are winning. They're not focused on individual battles, their plan is for the war itself - hell, tell me an individual battle the Russians won... You can't, because they haven't won anything but an unimportant city or maybe two. All those forces have to be *fed*, and they initially sent them out with MREs that were years out of date. All those vehicles need fuel - destroy that and the tanks can't run. The territory ""held"" by Russia isn't even secure, see the ongoing logistical problems as evidence of that.

These strategies were developed by Western sources (read: US) to help a smaller country fend off a larger invasion. You're focused on individual battles when you should be looking at the overall condition of their invasion force. They're *floundering*. What good would it do to attack Russian troops directly when starvation and low morale will do the work for you?",1647422222.0,1647421058.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0v1euy,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

It made far more sense for Putin to invade Ukraine between 2016 and 2020, however he didn't. Why? Because he feared Trump's instability might lead to a war with NATO.

We cannot say for sure if Trump would have fucked up Afganistan like Biden did, but even if we assume he did. It doesn't change the fact that Putin was cautious with Trump.

Having Biden in power and then seeing America's lack of political will to stay and smoothly transition out of Afganistan made Putin confident that the US and NATO would not intervene in a Ukraine invasion.

Following WWII; the majority of these great powers had taken damage and fallen into the shadow of the two emerging powers of the bipolar world of the Cold War - the US and the USSR.

By the historical definition (and into the modern age) a lot of those states still fulfill Great Power status - strong worldwide diplomatic presence, the ability to project power; and definitely spheres of influence.

We also have much better active tank armor. When the enemy fires on an Abrams or an American APC, it has sensors on the outside of the vehicle that detect the incoming project, and it has a bunch of cannister launchers on the outside that can fire in response, to destroy the projectile with small pellet shotgun blasts before it gets close enough to damage the vehicle. These sensors and active defenses are so accurate and quick to respond that they can even destroy different varieties (but not all) of tank shot fired at them.

More generally, the advantage of Western artillery and armor is just that it's way more fucking accurate. We have all these quality of life systems like really good, tested communication networks, a network of information-feeding systems (from drones, satellites, recon in the field), laser, thermal and radar targeting, fast-acting command, integrated command, and a doctrine emphasizing independence, that all flow together (flow being a relative term -- compared to Russia it's a smooth-as-silk river). They make firing and counter-firing on artillery and other enemy positions much more accurate.

One Western battery can probably do a lot more damage to actual enemy forces than 3-4 Russian batteries can do to enemy targets because the Western forces actually get real-time data on the enemy's location, and their artillery is targeted so accurately and authorized so quickly that they actually successfully shoot the enemy virtually every time they open fire. With Russian systems, they are rarely able to even find the enemy in time to open fire, and when they do find the enemy they don't get authorization in time, and when they do get authorization in time they still don't have good enough data from the field to know if they're even hitting what they're supposed to.

>Right now, Carlson may be the most powerful conservative in America. “No one carries more weight in Republican and conservative politics—no one—than Tucker Carlson,” said Jeff Roe, a Republican strategist who managed Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign. “He doesn’t react to the agenda, he drives the agenda. He’s the gold standard for Republican philosophy.”

After the First World War,  Keynes attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 as a delegate of the British Treasury. In his book, he argued for a much more generous peace, not out of a desire for justice or fairness – these are aspects of the peace that Keynes does not deal with – but for the sake of the economic well-being of all of Europe, including the Allied Powers, which the Treaty of Versailles and its associated treaties would prevent.

If you are killing enemy soldiers while retreating and giving up land, you're still losing. There is only limited amount of land Ukraine can give up before there is no longer Ukraine

> You're focused on individual battles when you should be looking at the overall condition of their invasion force. They're floundering. What good would it do to attack Russian troops directly when starvation and low morale will do the work for you?

What good is enemy low morale if you keep losing land, cities, defensive lines and such?

> Russia has its strengths - but Ukraine is fighting smart while Russia clings to extremely old tactics. Ukraine doesn't have to kill every soldier themselves, it's why they've been targeting Russian logistics (exacerbating the pre-existing problems in Russia's failure to plan).

2) I don’t know if you missed it, but Ukraine has started launching successful counteroffensives in the last 24 hours. Let’s see Russia try to hold that territory. 

- Russia does not have air superiority. 

- They have failed to capture any major city.

- They can barely feed their own army (asking China for MREs as an example).

- They have called up military cadets and Syrians because they can’t replace their personnel losses. 

All of this says: Whatever they hold now, they can’t sustain it. 

And we haven’t even talked about how muddy it’s going to get for those Russian tanks as it warms.

3) Ukrainians have made it clear: they will never surrender. Russia can bomb them from afar (only until their logistics fail), but they can’t actually take and hold any major city.

 >A kangaroo court is a court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides, and is typically convened ad hoc. A kangaroo court may ignore due process and come to a predetermined conclusion. The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority which intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations (compare show trial). A kangaroo court could also develop when the structure and operation of the forum result in an inferior brand of adjudication.

Every person I have personally come across (I know that makes this anecodotal but my point stands) that has bandied about the phrase ""unskilled labour"" would have a fucking breakdown if they had to do most the jobs they considered unskilled. This goes for the brainwashed poors as well as the elite twats that use this phrase.

Labour is labour. Some takes more training than others. However, some people don't have the mental fortitude to do a job and some people don't have the physical fortitude. Some don't have the intellect for some jobs. That doesn't mean any labour is unskilled, it just means some labour takes more skills garnered over a longer time.

Define ""retreating"" - they're not retreating, because they're denying the Russian forces the big battle they're looking for. Hell they're barely giving up land: Russia is largely stalemated and bogged down thanks to fuel shortages and the muddy Ukrainian terrain off-road.

>What good is enemy low morale if you keep losing land, cities, defensive lines and such?

What defensive lines? You're thinking about this from the perspective of a WW2-style engagement, when this is anything but.

>So you'd say Ukraine on purpose is leaving Mariupol surrounded in horrible conditions?

No - Mariupol is one of the few places where Russia has made progress...  but even there they're still fighting over the city, and it remains in Ukrainian hands. The conditions are awful, but consider: even there, the Russians are running out of supplies, because there's no logistics to resupply them.

> Or the forces moving to surround Kyiv?

Kyiv is not surrounded. They have 2 spokes coming towards it, from the North West and the East. Both spokes are bogged down and unable to make any significant progress due to those same logistical issues, no ability to go offroad due to the mud, and constant hit-and-run attacks destroying their supplies.

>Kyiv seems to be the last bastion here, the last fortress to fall

This language is assuming your conclusion: No ""fortress"" has fallen.

You're misunderstanding the nature of this conflict entirely. The Ukrainians aren't engaging the Russians the way the Russians want to be engages. There haven't been any decisive large battles, because that's what Russia *wants*. Their military tactics are largely massed artillery fire supported by tanks (WW2 style). By denying them the type of engagement they want, you're fighting on your own terms, and aren't literally handing them victory. Ukraine is *starving them*.

Russia only had a certain amount of supplies for their military pre-staged. Getting more is troublesome due to embargos, internal supply chain issues, corruption, lack of domestic production, and and the afore-mentioned logistical shortcomings.

*Hell they haven't even managed to establish air superiority*, the Ukrainians aren't using their aircraft *much* because of all the Russian SAMs on their own border, but notice how the amount of bombs they're dropping has trickled down, they're relying on rockets and artillery now for their war crimes...  because either A.) they have run out of jet fuel, B.) they have run out of such bombs, or C.) they don't have many combat-ready aircraft left.

Kyiv is not surrounded. The Russians have not managed to capture a single one of their major objectives. They failed to prepare adequately, they can't resupply their own troops, and the ones who are deployed are resorting to looting grocery stores to feed themselves (those supplies will run out very quickly). Russia **can not** keep this up - hell, did you see the trains running towards the Ukrainian border last week with civilian vehicles scrawled with the Z? *That's the level of desperation and preparedness* the Russian military is at, they can't even supply their conscripts & cadets with operational military vehicles anymore because their shit is falling apart. They're running out of supplies, they've already run out of food (see the plea to China to provide them with MREs again), they're begging soldiers from other nations to join in, and their cash reserves were cut in half a the beginning of the conflict by sanctions they never expected.

And now, to top this all off, the Ukrainians have launched a counter-offensive in the last 12 hours. I'm guessing they must have judged enemy morale to be at a breaking point.

Edit: something else I think you need to be aware of - Russia's GDP was only on the order of $1.4 trillion in recent years. It's *not great*, it's smaller than the state of Texas. You think a nation that size can actually keep its on-paper HUGE army in good shape? No, of course not - that's why their shit is falling apart, why their supplies are extremely limited, why they're relying on soviet-era shit and only have some small amount of modern weapons systems. Hell did you see they're still flying MIGs that were first built in the 1960s and 70s? US intelligence has estimated that they've actually deployed over half their combat-capable forces to Ukraine...  **And they're still unable to establish air superiority or capture any of their major objectives**.",1647437026.0,1647435837.0,t3_tfa2u8,t1_i0vcjz0,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

beyond that, as I'm been wondering since this clusterfuck started, Russia has several independence movements in the country, all of which are held in check by fear of Putin and the army. 

Azerbaijan is already making moves around nagorno-karabakh (reporters in the area have been saying they're taking advantage of Putin being distracted) + we;ve seen troops KIA pulled from there so they've got a shot. Japan is already making comments re: the islands, Moldova re: Transnistria. 

at some point, the loss of like isn't just a ""people dead"" issue, it's a ""how does this affect Russian positions in the rest of the world"" issue. if the brigade of 30k Syrian volunteers materializes, the FSA will take the chance to carry out attacks there as well, and who knows what will happen w/ the independence movements in Russia. if Putin's out of power, Ichkeria at least will take great pleasure in making Kadyrov suffer worse than Gaddafi, and some watchers have predicted Bashkoristan may be the first movement to try it's luck.

They only work as deterrent. When illegal action is taken, even by a nuclear powered state, that bluff must be called. The alternative is acceptance that a nuclear power can act at whim with no check, balance, or stop. If the world accepts that now, it will set precedent for all future situations. Likewise, if the world refuses the threat and acts in equanimity and in defense of all. 

If a guy breaks into your house with a shotgun and you find yourself between an extreme possibility (death) and your sleeping wife and children, you step back as told or slam what's left of the door forward, jamming the gun between the door and doorframe, or slam the gun up, hitting the would-be invader with barrel, maybe breaking his nose. Maybe you scare him off. Maybe you still die. But if was going to kill you he was already going to kill you, and if he was going to kill you he was going to kill your family. Your chances of death are high either way. Better to take the option that provides a higher probability of survival. 

Because in a nuclear situation you either auto-accept defeat and issue surrender the moment a nuclear power comes knocking or we learn an effective method of countermand and countermeasure.
