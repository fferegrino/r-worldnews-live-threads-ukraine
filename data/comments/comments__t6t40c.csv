Day 9 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Just to give some information about the general situation, there’s still some food in the stores but we are not sure for how long, you can easily stand in a queue for 3 to 5 hours before you get your turn to enter the store. The price of the food itself pretty much doubled since the start of the war, and it was already really high here before the war, seriously a lot of food here costs either equally or even more expensive than in Europe and USA (not counting places with really high cost of living).

No joke, I compared the prices and here stuff like dairy and eggs costs up to 30% more on average, meat is about equal, vegetable oil is about 10-30% more expensive and the list goes on. And now those already absolutely unreasonable prices doubled for most stuff. Basically the only thing that is actually really cheap here is alcohol. 

There were photos that in Mariupol even a single loaf of bread now costs around $4, before it was around 0.50 cents. Just to give you some idea, average monthly salary is around $300-400 (and most people can’t even work right now), and the average pension here is $150 (and for a lot of people it’s only $70-100). 

About the personnel in stores, in a relatively big supermarket they said to us that from their normal 300 people of their staff only around 55 are left, some left the city already, others can’t get to the store itself as public transportation is no more, you either have a car or you have to go everywhere on foot and some people live really far away.

Today it has been comparatively quiet, especially compared to yesterday when it felt like we could die at any moment. Honestly, never in a million years did I think that I would be celebrating my birthday under the constant sound of explosions, it feels so surreal.

And while today it was quiet there’s now an extremely ominous rumor going around, which our mayor says is a fake but it still really scares us. Basically they are saying that if Kharkiv doesn’t surrender in the next 72 hours russian army will destroy the city and now we don’t even know what to think. I even saw a truck with anti-tank fences going to the edge of the city, and the edge of the city is literally less than 1 kilometer away from our home.

I’m not sure that fleeing the city is an option, people are saying that it’s pretty hard getting on an evacuation train, and as we don’t even have a car getting to the train station is a challenge by itself. Taxi apparently now costs a lot, they are charging around $130 for rides inside the city (was around $3-5 before), and if you want to get to another city it will cost ranging from $330 and into thousands of dollars.

Upd. Thanks for all of your kind words, I do appreciate them.

Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated. We didn’t know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn’t miss ... We knew we had to get out to survive, but the incoming fire was intense

One journalist took two rounds to his body armor, and another was wounded. The team has since returned to the UK.

It took 10 years to build Kharkiv's Feldman Ecopark, and just one day to destroy it, zoo director Vitaly Ilchenko said after it was hit by Russian missiles.

Home to around 2,000 animals, the zoo is located just outside the city, covering more than 354 acres.

A day before the war began, its Facebook page showed a video of a monkey enjoying fruit snacks.

The very next day, the zoo said it had been hit by five Russian missiles, killing and injuring some of the animals, prompting calls for volunteers to help rebuild.

Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city like no other. Everything about it is special.

When it comes to its zoo, it stands out, big time. It’s three-and-half times the size of Kyiv's and home to half as many animals.

When the rockets began falling, zookeepers let some of the animals - like deer and moose - free from their enclosures and into the park’s forest so they wouldn’t get scared or injured.

On the first morning of the invasion, Russian shelling broke the glass aviaries of housing monkeys, porcupines and raccoons and the distressed animals fled.

While zookeepers managed to find them, they cannot locate a pair of dholes and asked locals to help.

But even a war can’t stop life. On the last day of winter, following Russian grad rocket attacks, the zoo's pair of kiangs welcomed a baby colt.

Announcing the new arrival, it declared: ""We can’t be defeated.""

Local officials in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson said Friday that Russia is not living up to its side of the bargain on proposed “humanitarian corridors,” even as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle in the region.

Leaders from Ukraine and Russia announced Thursday they had agreed to temporary cease-fires to support “humanitarian corridors” for civilians to be evacuated and so food and medicine could be delivered. But local Ukrainian officials in the Kherson region say that the Russian military is not working with them and is instead pushing a plan to distribute its own aid unilaterally.

Regional governor Gennady Laguta wrote on Facebook on Friday that the “occupiers” had not given the go-ahead to send humanitarian aid to the Kherson region through the proposed corridor. Laguta said that Ukrainian authorities had readied 19 trucks, but they were not yet being allowed to go in. The Russians “say that they will provide humanitarian aid themselves,” Laguta wrote.

In his own message to Facebook, Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaev said that the agreement was not helping the city. “Despite yesterday’s agreements at the highest level, in practice,” Kolykhaev wrote, “all this is not yet working.”

“But, judging by everything, ‘good liberators’ are preparing to bring their ‘rescue’ to Kherson. First they brought the situation to a critical point, and then heroically they will save us,” Kolykhaev wrote, referring to Russia.

In light of this situation and out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia, we have temporarily suspended our reporting from the ground in Russia while we get clarity on this legislation.

We join other media in standing up for a free press and unimpeded access to accurate, independent journalism in Ukraine and Russia.

That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated.

At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it would temporarily suspend the work of its journalists inside Russia in response to a new law passed by Putin the outlet says “criminalizes independent reporting in the country”.

“We have with great regret decided to temporarily suspend our news gathering inside Russia,” John Micklethwait, the Bloomberg editor-in-chief, said. “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country.”

The BBC announced earlier today it would temporarily halt its news operation in Russia due to the new law, as has the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

I've seen these two get conflated multiple times in recent days. Hoping this helps to distinguish:

Balkans - SE Europe, bordered by the Mediterranean, Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas. Includes countries from Croatia to Greece. Wide range of culture and history, as they were a bit of a crossroads for many empires, including Slavic roots (i.e. similar to Russian heritage). Does not directly border Russia. Most, but not all are part of NATO. Ukraine is not a part of the Balkan states, but often gets lumped in due to some cultural similarities.

Baltics - smaller enclave of countries in NE Europe. Bordering Russia and the Baltic Sea. Some Slavic cultural history, but largely more Nordic. High income economies. All three are part of NATO.

The Met is tasked with carrying out “any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”, it said Friday, and is “appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes”.

“Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may themselves have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine at any time from 21 November 2013 onwards,” the Met said.

Investigators are seeking out people who have a direct link to relevant information, rather than the general public submitting social media posts or media reports.

“This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine. Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK,” said Richard Smith, the head of the Met’s counter terrorism command.

It could even come from the west, what was considered the preferred evacuation route to the Moldovan border.

Is this video accurate? 

I don't buy any of it. This ""advanced soviet strategy"" seems like a bunch of nonsense, and there are no advantages to what the russians are doing.

As if its okay for the soldiers to be starving in the vehicles that are out of fuel, and have lost all the mobility and momentum advantages.


And the theory of Russians sending in their shittiest soldiers first to ""weaken the lines"", also seems far fetched. Considering it will absolutely crush the morale of the fighting force, which is extremly important to maintain in any war.


Also that Russians don't care as much about losses, is also a stupid point. Considering it will be catastrophic on the homefront, especally in the long run.

But you make a lot of assumptions on that journey. If NATO declared a no fly zone and put planes in the sky, Russia may choose not to confront them. They are already being embarrassed in this conflict by Ukraine, do they really want the world to see their planes dropping out of the sky? If there was direct confrontation, Russia probably wouldn't escalate to nuclear bombs in retaliation. MAD still exists, Russia is barely hanging on economically and militarily, would they really want to literally blow up their country and the world? If they are rational (an assumption I know), then hell no. They might retaliate with cyber attacks or launch an attack on a NATO country (which would get put down quickly), but escalating all the way to nuclear exchanges is not a given, probably even not likely.

As Putin commits more and more of his nation's resources into this battle there is always a chance the risk assessment changes.

Russia has long been the champion of slavic causes in Europe. In fact Russia’s support for slavic europeans directly led to the first world war. 

However, I think this is changing. With Europe and the vast majority of slavic countries rejecting Russia in favor of Ukraine, they are effectively denouncing Russia as the leader of the slavic peoples. 

Ukraine now has the mantle as the defender of Europe and are showing themselves to be the superior slavic country. Once Ukraine officially enters the EU (imo an inevitability at this point) the soft and hard power of Europe will be drastically strengthened. 

The EU will become a superpower not just because of Ukraine but a stronger European identity which will allow for more federalization of the block and ability to project power. 

Once Ukraine (and imo eventually Belarus) join the EU Russians will see the quality of life of their neighbors greatly surpass theirs. Depending on how Russia evolves post Putin we could see a realignment of the Russian political body to favor integration with Europe.

So here is my prediction for things several years or maybe decades down the road: 

1. Ukraine takes the mantle of the greatest slavic country from Russia
2. The EU becomes a superpower capable of force projection on par with the US.
3. (The really crazy one) Russia eventually joins the EU",False,1646429888.0,t3_t6t40c,t3_t6t40c,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

The USSR and Russia have had Nuclear weapons since 1949 and have yet to use one outside of a test. Granted the US and USSR never directly engaged on the battlefield... 

However, we do have multiple examples of nuclear powers going into direct conflict without it resulting in nuclear war... The USSR and China in their 1969 border war, and India and Pakistan in their 1999 border war. 

There is a very very small chance Putin would use a tactical nuclear warhead against NATO troops, but saying any intervention to save the Ukrainians will result in a nuclear war is simply  hyperbolic. 

It is my opinion that NATO has the moral imperative to do more to help the Ukrainians, including declaring and enforcing a No Fly Zone.

You guys keep typing this ""It's overblown!"". 

I'm going to explain to you why it not only isn't overblown, it's inevitable. 

One thing a lot of people don't understand about human beings as a species is how emotionally driven we are. The western tradition of liberal democracy, state sovereignty, human rights, nationalism, etc etc goes back largely to the enlightenment era. Specifically the assertion that people are rational, self determining, beings and because of this are naturally free beings, or at least *social* beings. Beings who have concerns and ideas and desires broader then themselves. 

Basically our political systems are all founded on the notion that people make good choices because people are well intentioned even at their worst. 

This is wrong. 

The old cliche that the greatest argument against democracy is the average voter. That is not wrong. 

With that in mind, during wartime especially, fight or flight mode takes over. You? You are horrified by Russias actions (understandable) and want to fight them. Fair enough, but it's not logical, and let's not pretend it is. It's not logical because you know that the ability to end the entire world is something both parties of this possess. You are saying nobody would ever *rationally* use them. Again, people are not rational. People are emotional monkeys. People kill each other over parking spots. People shoot up schools for media attention. People think McDonalds tastes good. 

Look at Ted Cruz. Actually look at that fuck. You think he is driven by anything but animal lust? No. He's a psychopath, like Putin. Psychopaths by definition have no conception of consequences. That's one of their defining features. 

You think Putin thought this shit through? Really? 

The most likely way a nuclear war could start is by accident. This is another thing people don't understand. The near-misses we've had (and there's been far too many for you to justify your blasé attitude)  were because of things like computer glitches or somebody not knowing what a dot on the radar was. 

But let's talk about what nuclear war actually is. While everybody knows you can't ""win"" a nuclear war, both sides are trying to mitigate the damage as much as possible. If it takes launching a few more missiles at Moscow to save Chicago the US will do it. The goal, the impossible one, is to destroy the enemy's nuclear capability and defense systems before they have a chance to launch. The only slim chance you have of approaching anything like that is to pre-emptively strike, or at least respond full out to any smaller strike. It won't work because it can't work, but that's the only thing the generals ever had. The situation is unwinnable unless you can commit genocide by surprise. 

You can't. 

With that in mind, the militaries of the US and Russia are not omnipotent. They pretend to be, but they aren't. They won't know a nuclear missile has been launched until they see it on radar or some intelligence agency gets tipped off. Russia's failsafes I do know are set up so that they activate in the event of a nuclear explosion on Russian soil. Who knows how accurate that system is. Probably not very. 

The moment NATO and Russia start shooting you will see those very emotional, irrational, beings we call human hover their pointer fingers over the big red button in anticipation. The person doing this will be terrified, he will be assuming that the opponent is about to launch. If you want logic in people that's pretty much the best we get: we are smart enough to know other people are smart enough to kill us. 

Somebody shoots a cruise missile. It shows up on NATO radar. Generals are unsure what it is. Message is relayed to Biden. Biden has 30 minutes to decide whether to order a launch or let the missile hit its target without retaliation. 

The only way Biden has any hope of preserving some semblance of human life in the continental US is to launch those missiles. 

Putin will then launch his. 

Those not incinerated will starve. 

All that will be left of humanity will be the charred remnants of our monuments. A mountain of rubble and ash will be the only legacy you leave to this earth. A legacy to be appreciated by nobody. 

We have only averted nuclear war by miracle. By dumb, god given, luck.

If I may speculate: This was the first time in *years* that I saw nations actually respond in a meaningful *preemptive* manner to Russian disinformation tactics. For a long, long time Russia would do something underhanded, and then Western news media (I have especial notice of U.S. news media for obvious reasons, but I saw it elsewhere too) would only begin to point fingers back at Russia months after the damage was already done in internet disinfo bubbles. By the time actual politicians acted upon it, there would already be entrenched portions of the conservative electorate gleefully regurgitating things their Definitely Real and Patriotic Countrymen had told them to say well in advance. It's harder to pull out a hook than it is to prevent one from sinking in in the first place.

Brexit? By the time any countermessaging was applied, the narrative was already locked in.

Trump/Russia collusion? By the time any countermessaging was applied, he was already the Republican nominee, and by the time political action was taken he was already President and actively suppressing inquiries.

COVID disinfo? The Russian trolls ran rampant getting people to scream about FREEDOMMMM when governments were still trying to bureaucratically implement best management practices. And in the U.S. you had the President on camera shouting that it was all a ruse and even if it wasn't you can just fix it with sunlight and soap injections and horse dewormer.

But as soon as Russia started this invasion up? Biden declassified U.S. intelligence months in advance, and Western nations had begun coordinating their planned responses at the same time. Media started reporting about ramping Russian hostilities across the board. When the invasion hit, the international response had already been prepared and ready to go, and the disinfo spinners could barely get their teeth in because conservative politicians had put out the Russian aggression message in advance in response to shared intelligence instead of echoing their electorates' online-generated sentiments. The people most likely to be affected by Russian propaganda on this topic, as they had been in the past on so many others, were now primed instead to be hostile to Russian aggression and shouting patriotic declarations about sovereign borders and strong militaries. And the people not likely to be affected by Russian propaganda, well, could very clearly see all the information before them.

In effect, and to cheekily relate this to the pandemic, the Russian virus has previously been infecting the West for years with new strains and all of the usual suspects that get infected by it are unvaccinated. This time we rolled out a vaccine in advance and inoculated them before they could spread the virus. At the same time, the primary viral vector shut down due to a blanket quarantine (economic sanctions undermining their online presence and corporate entities suddenly taking them seriously for fear of losing Western business). Result: Nearly everyone in recently heavily divided political spheres is now calling for the destruction of the Russian state, because none of them got infected beforehand.

I guess in a roundabout manner, I'm saying that vaccines work very well, including propaganda vaccines.",False,1646429407.0,t3_t6t40c,t1_hzda2v7,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

As an employer, I can say this is not unique to lazy or uneducated workers - most human brains will find the ‘shortcut’ eventually in this type of situation. You have to really motivate them to keep at it, or find that exceptional person who thrives in a super consistent and boring routine.

a way to put it is that yesmen are only loyal so long as they can be provided for and are often conspiring for theri own means. in soviet russia Stalin managed to keep his yesmen in line and satisfied enough to be truly loyal.

Problem is more modern russia is built on capitalism, despite its claims, and money, vs someone who has a shitload of charisma.

I dont fully agree with it. ""leader of the slavic people"" is a term that i would rather avoid. I dont see it as a battle with one nation ""winning"" an becoming the ""leader"" (i dont think you did mean it that way either but just to make my own position clear).  And i also do think that Russia will remain the most important slavic nation if only because of sheer numbers.

But the other perspective and predictions yes i can understand them but i wonder how much of it is whishfull thinking. It would be an optimal outcome from a european point of vieuw , eventually leading to step 3 of your prediction.

It does seem very far off for now as it wont happen under Putin. Putin will leave office naturally eventually but that might take a very long time. And in 10-20 years from now the world might look very different. It is also far from guaranteed that Russia will go a different direction under a new leader in the far future. The moment of succession is always a critical moment for the stability of authocratic regimes and realistically it could go both ways. Its a long term perspective on how democracys can move forward.

Both China and Europe would love to have Russia on their side. For europe this would mean that Russia would eventually become a free and thriving democracy,for China it would mean that Russia remains a more or less authocratic regime (i do realize that the current regime,while authocratic in nature,does have the support of the majority of the population). For now Russia seems to be firmly in Chinas camp. Maybe eventually it will turn around.

Even better would be NA/EU,Russia and China all working together to move the world forward. Though that would mean that democracys and authocracys are able to live with eachoter and respect eachoters interests and differences in culture and political structure. Succesfull democracys are a bigger thread to succesfull authocracys (succesfull authocracy might seem like a contradiction in termino but China has been rather succesfull in many areas) then the other way around. Which is why authocracys do fear such a potential alliance. For this to be possible in the future this fear (which is realistic) has to be adressed in a credible way.

In the beginning they had their vehicles basically filling the entire road in closely packed positions with a small lane in the middle for supply vehicles. A drone strike could take out several vehicles and cause a major traffic issue.

Now they only ever double up their column if there's trustworthy (not muddy, no trees) ground on the side of the road to drive around disabled vehicles. They also have a LOT more distance between vehicles in either case. This is largely why the convoy ballooned in length. It wasn't particularly getting more vehicles, it was just stretching out.

There's also been, in the satellite imagery, a LOT of driving in loops/circles in the dirt/fields to the side of the road. This almost certainly represents the convoy stress testing their tires to figure out which ones need replacing. It's becoming more apparent that the Russian army hasn't been properly doing preventative maintenance on their wheeled vehicles. This means they haven't been turning over the engines and doing a bit of a drive, to work the air pressure systems for the tires and to prevent the tires from sagging. Furthermore, if they haven't been parking the vehicles painfully close together while in open-air storage, sun-rot sets in on the exposed tires since they aren't being shaded by the nearby vehicles.

In short, the convoy is learning, but that's coming at a lot of expense. Namely in time and in the logistical capacity to support all those troops/vehicles while they sit there and do nothing.",False,1646436372.0,t3_t6t40c,t1_hzdrexh,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

No we wouldn't fight this war.

We all might die in the following few weeks. But we wouldn't actively fight this war.

NATO  could crush the russian military in a matter of weeks (maybe even days considering its apparant state). The US alone wouldn't take long. We wouldn't even have enough time to complete basic training.

The only reason why this is not happening is nukes.

So the only question is whether escalating this war ultimately leads to nukes flying around the globe.

Therefore you need to assess whether and when Putin would be willing to kill himself and take the whole world with him. You also need to see that he can not make that decision alone and that certain other parties (e.g. China / India) who are now friendly to Russia and hold a certain amount of influence on Putin have 0 interest in getting wiped from the planet due to this conflict.

The only somewhat rational take here is that you only use nukes if you are facing annihilation anyways and that you might as well take the rest of the world with you.

Nobody is actively threatening Russia (or Putin for that matter) and even a crushing defeat in Ukraine does not lead to Russia getting attacked and not even necessarily to Putin getting deposed (even though it gets far more likely).

So is Putin mad? Because otherwise the nukes won't fly even if we intervene and kick him out of Ukraine.

But if he is mad, aren't we doomed anyways?Who (that wouldn't stop him now as well) will stop a mad men from attacking other countries and at a certain point we will have to fight back anyways which will lead to the mad man pressing the button?

So why not do it now and prevent all the needless slaughter?",1646436780.0,1646436420.0,t3_t6t40c,t1_hzdr6cf,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Probably still doesn't work, but the russian air force has been scared to fly in UA right now without it, so one wonders if the threat and time cutoff would do the trick or not.

Not really sure what to say here.

How exactly do you think a no fly zone is enforced? Really mean words and lots of angry faces? How do you think a no fly zone is enforced in a region where there already aerial campaigns ongoing? 

NFZs can only be enforced through either the belligerents agreeing to the NFZ, or those aircraft are destroyed in combat, along with their bases and support installations.

People who are in charge of whether or not to enact a NFZ are in fact knowledgeable about what such a measure would mean.

When they say it is a direct commitment to war, they are telling the truth, and honestly a very sanitized version of it. A NFZ has historically been the precursor to open hostilities, and that is exactly how it would be here, and everyone understands this.",False,1646434771.0,t3_t6t40c,t1_hzdnqlr,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

>**NATO Art. 5: COLLECTIVE Defense**The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

Please be kind enough to note the fundamental difference between MUTUAL and COLLECTIVE. Just one word, but quite important difference.

Please note also that EU's Art. 47.2 INCLUDES de facto NATO's Art. 5.

the target cities will be decimated, but if nukes can be shot down or contained somehow at least some cities and targets could be saved...

with the iron curtain in Israel I wouldn't be too surprised if we have something like that for nukes without even knowing we have it, albeit it's probably not been tested fully because then it'd be outted...

so yes, nuclear war is possible but it'll be less dramatic than full annihilation but it'll still suck horrendously and hopefully we have some defenses....

Basically all of Microsoft's current services now take the form of Software-as-a-service - so instead of buying a license key which then means you can use Microsoft office or windows forever, you pay a yearly subscription fee. 

Microsoft has said they will not make any new sales in Russia. What I think OP is getting at is that it's not totally clear what constitutes a ""new sale"". For example, I recently started a new job at a company that uses Microsoft software for everything. When I joined, the company would have to get an additional license from Microsoft (so they go to Microsoft and say we now have 1 new user, please give us 1 new account and increase the amount you invoice us each month). If Microsoft considers this to be a new sale, it would essentially mean Russian corporations cannot effectively expand or upgrade their services- they're stuck at their current number of employees, current amount of onedrive storage, etc etc etc. 

Also, contracts have to be renewed. If you reach the end of your current agreement with Microsoft, will they let you renew it? Or do they consider renewals to be sales? If the latter, every major corporation in Russia is on a ticking time bomb to completely switch their entire set up. When the last company I worked at decided to switch everything over to Microsoft, it was a two year long effort with IT consultants flying between cities and pulling crazy overtime to ensure a smooth transition.",False,1646429801.0,t3_t6t40c,t1_hzd9tv2,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Appeasers such as yourself believe he absolutely will launch a nuclear strike if we get involved in any capacity, and so we should continue to allow him to do whatever he chooses, and hope that at some point he decides to stop on his own.

Those who don't share your faith in appeasement instead believes that Putin is personally a coward, who sits behind a 30 meter table with his generals on the other side because he's deathly afraid of Covid, and that he's lived a life of abject comfort and wealth. That he's a man who flees to a bunker in the Urals even when there's no direct threat to Moscow.

The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.

 >The FGM-148 Javelin (AAWS M) is an American-made portable fire-and-forget anti-tank missile fielded to replace the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile in US service. It uses automatic infrared guidance that allows the user to seek cover immediately after launch, as opposed to wire-guided systems, like the Dragon, which require the user to guide the weapon throughout the engagement. The Javelin's HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks by hitting them from above where their armor is thinnest (see top attack), and is also useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight. As of January 2019, the Javelin has been used in over 5,000 successful engagements.

So, in the current situation, they would be way more likely to crash or be shot down, and each of those things and the pilots in them are expensive.

 >The First American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Republic of China Air Force, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was formed to help oppose the Japanese invasion of China. Operating in 1941–1942, it was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), Navy (USN), and Marine Corps (USMC), and was commanded by Claire Lee Chennault. Their Curtis P-40B Warhawk aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Recruited under President Franklin Roosevelt's authority before Pearl Harbor, their mission was to bomb Japan and defend the Republic of China, but many delays meant the AVG first flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war.

Everything about it went from *some* academic merit (in 1997)... to (potentially) religious doctrine. If he cannot honestly reassess then he's in for a world of hurt as reality catches up to him.

Not to mention the problem he also has is that like many sneak attacks such strategy loses effectiveness as a result.   Keep in mind him getting those extra few votes in the right place came from one thing:  money.  How effectively can he pull off buying politicians, social media, and election influence if he's got no money?  Any support he had came from opportunists, not true believers of his little cult.

He could say that he's retreating right now and absolutely nobody would believe him. But at the same time nobody's going to be able to stop him externally.

It's just my opinion, but I think that the absolute best way to stop Putin for good is to let his people/military tear him down.

If it were full-on NATO versus Russia, Russia would lose. But even more people then in all of Ukraine would die along the way.

Instead nato should offer every single bit of support that can't be used as obvious and clear propaganda by Putin. We should be delivering them our helicopters, as I believe we are now, sending them every bit of our intelligence, anything that can't be filmed and spread across the TVs in Russia.

Anything else is going to end up in a war that will require a full-on invasion of Russia to stop him, and obviously that has the opposite effect. I don't think he's going to stop at Ukraine if given the chance, but I also don't think he's going to succeed at that anyway.

I feel like the most effective end goal is to see him continue to take losses in Ukraine and be forced to pull back, possibly in a way where thousands of soldiers end up defecting all together.

HE got bunkers. Not his officers. And as I stated, his officers still enjoy all the type of stuff you can do that you can't do in a nuclear wasteland, like taking walks, see the sun, breathing fresh air, not living confined 24/7, etc.

Also there is only so much a bunker can do. For example, it can't protect you from hordes of angry survivors that literally have nothing to lose and don't care about being shot if they can serve as fodder for the next wave to get closer until they manage to storm the bunker and tear you apart to pieces. Also there are most likely secret forces by NATO stationed in places that would not be hit by the nuclear blasts with bunker boosting capabilities that would be sent with the only purpose of killing Putin, by effortlessly flying in a now completely disarmed Russia and dropping bombs on all those bunkers. So survival even there is not a guarantee.

\> Go read about Curtis Le may who wanted to bomb the Russians out if   
existence In the 50s and 60s / generals like that still exist today in   
the west and In Russia.

Except that in the 50s and earliy 60s there was no MAD, nukes just ensured it would be a very, very, bloody war, which is very different from today where a nuclear exchange turn Russka into a crater. Le May and Curtis weren't willing to die just to bomb Russia, unlike Russian officers which would need to die or at least severily downgrade their lifestyle just to approve a nuclear strike.
