Day 52 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was very quiet around my area, but they continued shelling elsewhere and also fired one of their Kalibrs at another residential district, but there’s something special about the place they attacked with it today. And what do you know? It yet again has to do with time travel!

After doing some research on the location I found out that the place they targeted would indeed be a valid military target. Or rather it would have been a valid target around 8-12 years ago. They targeted the factory “Proton” that 12 years ago was involved in production of BTR-4 for Iraq, but that factory was liquidated 8 years ago.

Doesn’t this remind you of something? Of course it does! Just around a week ago Russians said that we would destroy a chlorine tank that stopped existing at least 9 years ago. What the fuck is wrong with their intelligence service?! Is all their information as old as USSR itself? Do they live in the past?

Also something bizarre is happening on Russian media. Today on Solovyev’s show one of their “guests” basically said that “our army has accomplished their mission” and that diplomats need to do their work now. He said that they should let us do our denazification on our own, and that they don’t need another Afghanistan. Either they are changing the narrative now, because they wouldn’t let anyone say something like this unless they had permission, or someone is going to fall out of the window soon.

From CNN's Cecelia Armstrong

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Saturday that “the UK will stop at nothing to ensure Ukrainians have the resources they need” to defend their country against Russia’s invasion, according to a statement on social media.

Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Saturday afternoon, according to the tweet.

In his own statement on Twitter, Zelensky said the two spoke about the agreements reached during Johnson’s recent visit to Kyiv earlier this month, adding that they spoke about defense and macro-financial support as well as the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. 

According to a statement from Downing Street, “the Prime Minister paid tribute to the bravery of Ukrainian forces who continue to valiantly defend their country's freedom.” 

“President Zelenskyy updated the Prime Minister on the situation in Mariupol, and the Prime Minister said he saluted Ukrainian resistance in the city. The pair discussed the need for a long-term security solution for Ukraine, and the Prime Minister said he would continue to work closely with allies and partners to ensure Ukraine could defend its sovereignty in the weeks and months to come,” the Downing Street statement said.
“The Prime Minister updated President Zelenskyy on new sanctions from the UK that came into force last week and said the UK would continue to provide the means for Ukraine to defend itself, including armoured vehicles in the coming days. The Prime Minister said international support for Ukraine only grew stronger and that he remained convinced Ukraine would succeed, and Putin would fail,” according to the statement.",False,1650146829.0,t3_u510fs,t3_u510fs,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

President Biden this week approved an additional package of $800 million worth of weapons, ammunition, and security assistance to Ukraine.

The US has, for the first time, agreed to provide Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials a few short weeks ago viewed as too great of an escalation risk, including 11 Mi-17 helicopters; 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons[ and 300 more Switchblade drones.

 On Friday, a senior defense official told CNN the first flight of weapons and equipment was expected to arrive in the region in the following 24 hours and would be picked up at the border by Ukrainians and taken into the country.

The official referred CNN to the US Department of Defense for more details.

[RAZVEDOS: Are we fighting a war or are we masturbating?](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1515275351810875392)

> 'How do you…!, blyat, a f\*cked up question! Look - 'How do you feel about the fact that the MoD announces strikes on the decision-making centres in Ukraine?'. I feel about it this way - dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, please decide, are we fighting at war, or are we masturbating? Because if we are masturbating, then we need to stop this dry fapping, walk away and count our losses. Say right now, 'stop', because it's clear that masturbation does not lead to success, you see? I apologise for this language of mine. 

> So, if we are fighting, then we need to fight. To fight is to strike everything, otherwise you cannot win at war, you see? If we continue doing this shit, then… our border checkpoints will be shelled, our bridges will be blown up, our 'Mosvka' will be shot at, or it will burn on its own, it will go on, and on, and on. We need not to announce strikes, but to strike, strike deep, we need to f\*ck over all the airports of Ukraine that exist, all of them, with anti-aerodrome missiles. Make them look like moon surface with craters, so not a single f\*cking plane with Bayraktars could land on them, you see? We need to f\*ck all their railroard connections, with such big f\*cking rockets so that it would take years to repair. And when they're done repairing them, strike them again. All railroad links need to be f\*cked. We need to not shoot people, but infrastructure elements. 

> So… f\*ck, this is obvious, right? If vehicles supplies are coming from there, then the vehicle supplies need to be f\*cked. Roads, we need to f\*ck bridges, transport junctions, f\*ck them ourselves, not waiting until they attack us, but destroy everything they have. And then, the question of supplies, Bayraktars, all questions will be solved. How can we… we have a country, the largest in Europe - Ukraine. It has 40 million people of population, but we aren't touching population, let's talk territory. This territory has a f\*ck ton of landing strips, aerodromes, though there aren't that many that are capable of recieving large tonnage planes with vehicles. Such aerodromes are few. So all these aerodromes must be killed, all of them. Then we kill them once again, and then again, so nothing's left of them, no landing strips, no service and refuelling stations, nothing. Because if we fight on one piece of land, but the supplies keep coming and coming, then this makes no sense, you see? If we are allowing the enemy an opportunity to constantly get reinforcements, and they are getting it from around the world, then we might not be able to make it. If it's obvious to me, why isn't it obvious to generals, I don't know.

> 8 YEARS SINCE OUR SQUAD'S ENTRY INTO SLOVIANSK 

> 8 years have passed since the day when our squad entered Sloviansk during the 'April of Hope' in 2014. Today, another participant of the defence of Sloviansk was killed in Mariupol - callsign 'Kamaz'. 

> And, unfortunately, despite the fact that, after being late for almost 8 years, the Russian Federation openly intervened in the war (with forces that would have been 'more than enough in 2014', but not nearly enough 8 years later) - the Victory is as far as during the summer of 2014. If not further. 

> Looking at the idiotic and ridiculous movements of Kremlin gnomes, I'm wondering: 'Are they actually waiting until '12-languaged' (translator note: nickname for Napoleonic army that was very diverse during 1812 war) would come to help Ukrainians? Or perhaps this is precisely what they want, to quickly surrender and go down in history as gravediggers of Russia and Russian people? And this role is so endearing to them that they are morally ready to go to the tribunal of these 'dear Western partners'? 

> In Donetsk, everything is turning green. The most favourable weeks for offense are wasted. There is no mobilisation in the Russian Federation and it is not yet expected. And this means, that IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS VICTORY CANNOT BE EXPECTED.

He regularly gets cosmetic treatments to his face (probably botox), showing a desire to turn back the clock. 

He replaced 1,000 of his personal staff last month just out of paranoia. He keeps purging his security services and top military leaders, even before they failed him in this war.

You can read about the book and the ideas of Dugin here [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics).

Now some things about the Ukraine make sense:

""***Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.***""

Dugin about the USA:

""***Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.***""

Let’s say Moscow is changing the story. For me, this could mean 2 things:

1. Getting into a war with NATO means they can more easily mobilize their forces. Currently, mobilization is a problem. Russia “only” recruited 20.000 of the needed 60.000 soldiers for the Donbas offense so far. Being at war would make this easier. Downside for Russia would be that mobilization is highly political loaded and not popular (at least, that’s my interpretation). Also, if Russia is officially at war, attacks on Russia might be seen as “existential”, which could lead to nuclear escalation. Why? Because according to Russian military doctrine, nuclear weapons are part of their defensive structure when they are threatened in that manner (I do believe it’s also part of their offensive structure btw).

If they officially at war with NATO and they start attacking NATO territory (eg. a staging place on Polish territory), it will be interesting to see how NATO will react. Immediately retaliating against Russia would very much play into their hands from a propaganda standpoint. I know it’s easy to say “article 5 would immediately be triggered if that happens” but I am not so sure it would. Technically, yes probably, but strategically perhaps no so much. 

2. It’s “easier” for Russia to lose to NATO, then it is to be defeated by Ukraine. Easier in terms of selling the current losses to the Russian population and building propaganda around it. This could help Russia in setting up a frozen conflict in which they keep what they have without calling a true defeat. They have done this before (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_conflict). Downside is that some egos will seriously be hurt and this could mean even more terrorizing of the civilian population in occupied territories. 

Either way, it seems that the momentum (if there ever was any) for a cease-fire has definitely passed.

The rules governing international arms sales (and yes, as crazy as that sounds there are rules) often boil down to ""second hand sales need to be approved by the original vendor"".

Part of the reason for this is so that, for example, Singapore couldn't sell its F35s to a competitive peer, like  Russia/China (to be broken down and analysed), or to an adversary like North Korea. The other part is a genuine prevention of proliferation of high grade weapons systems - both for conflict reduction reasons and to prevent technical edges being lost.

It is also bad enough PR having Saudi bomb Yemen with UK planes and US bombs without some Central African warlord that neither are actually allied to committing genocide with second hand F16s or Challenger Tanks.

The same rules govern the East German IFVs that the Czechs wanted to give Ukraine (Germany needed to approve) and the Harpoons that apparently the UK want to give Ukraine (the US will need to approve). I would expect Sweden needed to approve the 3rd party NLAW shipments to Ukraine too.

>The horrific scenes coming out of Bucha, Irpen and other Ukrainian cities (see EDM, April 13) “not only make [Russian President Vladimir] Putin a war criminal,” Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev says, but “show ‘the quality’ of the Russian army.” The soldiers who serve in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are so undisciplined and prone to criminal actions that they will pose a serious threat to the country itself once hundreds of thousands of war veterans return home, Inozemtsev argues. The behavior of the Russian military is not that surprising in one sense, the expert writes. After all, it was sent to fight by an organized criminal group, the Putin regime; and “if one such group steals, why should the other not specialize in murders?” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>But in thinking about the future, it should be obvious, he continues, that the several tens of thousands of Russian ruling elites will simply flee if and when Russia is defeated, whereas the much larger number of angry, traumatized, and physically and psychologically damaged veterans of the Ukrainian war will not. And the latter’s presence will bleed back into broader Russian society in horrific ways. Consequently, “even if Putin meets his next birthday in The Hague or does not live that long—and the chances of both these scenarios are growing today with unimaginable speed—the rapists, murderers and marauders will be returning to society and will significantly change its nature,” Inozemtsev says. The veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya were not as dangerous for Russia society: not only were there fewer of them and they came back gradually but also social norms at that point were better and exercised a greater influence on the behavior of veterans, he continues (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>Inozemtsev notes that Russian military commanders in Ukraine are either turning a blind eye to, encouraging, or even ordering the troops under their command to commit mass murder and atrocities. And this means “that even after the departure of Putin, the country will have to deal with the criminalization of society that he sponsored over several decades.” In comparison, he asserts, “the ‘accursed’ 1990s, will appear a model of gentlemanly behavior and decency” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

>A major reason for that fear is that ever more Russians are arming themselves. Even prior to February 24, 2022, when Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, some observers suggested there were as many as 25 million guns in private hands in the Russian Federation. Wars almost inevitably lead to a bleeding back into society not only of people accustomed to violence but of weapons that allow them to engage in such acts (see Monitor, July 21, 1995 and August 22, 1995). And in response to that threat, ever more Russians have been buying up guns and ammunition since February, fearful that international sanctions will limit their access to such defenses or raise prices enough to put weapons out of their reach, even if returning veterans-turned-criminals wield them freely (RBC, March 23).

>The Russian government is now mulling new and more restrictive laws on gun ownership.

>Just how rational are they actually acting? 

They're acting very rationally.  They invaded with a smaller force than would have been necessary to control Ukraine. They were counting on Ukraine rolling over. Goals were: 

1. Inflict terror.
2. Track down specific anti-Russian Ukrainians, and war-crime them.
3. Land bridge to Crimea (and secure Crimean water supply).
4. Cut off all Black Sea access to Ukraine.


Seems like they've accomplished all of those, except #4; even if it came at a pretty huge cost. 

>Do the people in command and Putin himself ACTUALLY think they are already in a WW3 scenario?

Nobody has observed any activity that suggests The Russia is planning on proceeding with escalation against NATO. The Russia has actually permitted the west to meddle pretty hard in terms of supply and training and intel support, and still has only made empty verbal threats. You'd better believe it: When western intelligence sees actual nuclear preludes, the tone will very much change sharply.  We'll know several days in-advance.

1. Their military reputation's taken quite a hit. Even if the Ukrainians are using mostly the same thing, most countries actually do judge these things like that.
2. Shift of perceived balance from armor to handheld anti-armor and the rise of drones don't favor Russian defense exports: they sell a lot of armor, their AT mostly sucks, and they don't sell many drones. Turkish defense exports, on the other hand, will benefit.
3. They need to replace their lost equipment from this war, and that will probably take precedent over arms sales.
4. They are under sanctions, so supply of components is in doubt.
5. Selling less things is a negatively reinforcing loop. Less orders mean each unit costs more to recoup R&D costs.

They had to know what they were doing is injust or wrong. Even in a hypothetical scenario where Russia has the right to be pissed at Ukraine (which they dont), there is no excuse or justification for the attacks on civilians on the scale that we have seen. It is one thing to fight military on military, but another to commit genocide. They are criminals, there is no other way to interpret it.

However, we should exercise restraint and poise when considering the Russian population. It would be easy to look at them and say they are complicit too, and no doubt some are complicit and fully support this conflict and are no better than Putin or his execution squads.

There are also a large group in Russia who are misinformed to a degree that they truly have no idea what is going on in Ukraine or why. Even the Russians who are not misinformed, that do know the true nature of this conflict, understandably would be reluctant to speak out in any way because they know how serious the punishment is. We have seen limited protests in Russia at the beginning of this war but they were quickly broken up.

In America, we must keep this in mind, and not fall into the US vs THEM mentality towards the Russian people.

Nationalism is also a factor. They've been spoonfed propaganda since forever, and Putin's asset in the early 2000s was that he understood how mass media worked and how to harness it, and at the same how to take control of it. 

During Perestroika when Russians started going abroad, they felt a deep sense of betrayal seeing western stores filled to the brim with consumer products. The Putin era, although representing a complete butchery of the constitutional state formed in the waning years of the USSR and the wild 90s, also raised the standard of living for the avreage Russian. They are not nearly as developed as the west, but going from potatoes and turnips in the 80s to western electronics and fast food is a 100 years of progress in a decade. 

The state collapsed in the 90s yes, and Putin's entire political career has been centered around beeing the strong hand preventing weak men and western enemies bringing back the chaos. 

So TL;DR; the russians are apathic, they've been living in a paralell world driven by propaganda centered around nationalistic tendencies and had their standard of living raised. It's been an ongoing process for 20 years succeeding 'dark ages' as some would call it.

In 2012, Svoboda received 10.45% of the vote in the parliamentary elections. In 2014, the combined vote between Svoboda and Right Sector (which Azov is under IIRC) was something like 6.51%. By 2019, the Svoboda party list got like 2.15% and failed to win any seats at all. By contrast, the far right LDPR in Russia that was run by the late Vladimir Zhirinovsky has received between 6-13% of the vote in all Duma elections, obtaining 7.55% in 2021. The former leader of the Russian Wagner mercenary group is also quite well-known for having pretty explicit Nazi tattoos as well.

It also does kind of matter that Zelenskyy is the Ukrainian president. While the term ""nazi"" gets thrown around a lot for any far right groups, Ukrainian and Eastern European neo-nazism are generally actually antisemitic. The Azov ideology in particular is not only antisemitic, but also anti-EU and anti-NATO, too. 

Finally, the fact that we know about Azov at all is largely a _reaction_ to the fact that Russia has been invading Ukraine for the past 8 years. Azov made a name for itself because it successfully drove out the DNR rebels from Mariupol in 2014. Their reputation is a direct consequence of the fact that Russia has been fighting this war against Ukraine's identity for this long, which has naturally stoked a nationalist response which, in this case, has led to ultranationalists becoming a famous fighting group. 

After this war is over, Ukraine really should deal with these far right groups (it's not just Azov, there was another far right group that was a militia operating near Brovary a few weeks back). Azov has been accused of human rights abuses and torture as well, so it's not like you can simply ignore the problematic history either. But until that happens, Ukrainians are dealing with an invasion where Russia has been accused of, fairly credibly, war crimes on a daily basis.

In fact, the elite of the world is thought to have built and own large underground structures to protect themselves, their families and the families of people in powerful positions, for decades into the future in case of a powerful, imminent existential threat.

What’s more concerning for him is that the Russian land will be completely uninhabitable due to nuclear- toxicity, for thousands of years, in case if NATO decides to go nuclear. It will mean the death of the historic empire he cherishes so much, takes pride in and has been trying to preserve by subjugating  Chechnya, Northern Ossetia, and attempting to do so with Georgia and Ukraine.

The same nuclear threat is upon very densely populated Europe, and everyone who will be deeply effected on the soil of Eurasian continent. The animal kingdom will suffer greatly, the species will be contaminated with radio toxicity and wiped out, the water will be undrinkable, the ecological disaster will be immeasurable, it goes way beyond the singular lives of people in the stupid governments with nuclear weapons used to manipulate each other to get what they want, and the innocent civilians are the ones who will suffer as a result, not the elite on top.",1650137359.0,1650136821.0,t3_u510fs,t1_i4zkm6b,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites, and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

 >In international relations, a frozen conflict is a situation in which active armed conflict has been brought to an end, but no peace treaty or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. Therefore, legally the conflict can start again at any moment, creating an environment of insecurity and instability. The term has been commonly used for post-Soviet conflicts, but it has also often been applied to other extended and unresolved territorial disputes. The de facto situation that emerges may or may not match the official position asserted by either party to the conflict.

The head of Azov when it was formed is no longer involved in it, having moved into politics a few years ago (where his party failed to get any successes and only had like 2% of the vote). He was one of the more prominent neo nazi members.

A while ago Azov was integrated into the UKR national guard much of the command structure was reshuffled amd since then it has been notably less influenced by ethno nationalists and neonazis.

Worth noting the modern, national guard version of Azov is multi national, multi religious and multi ethnic, and is defending a country run by a Jewish president. It also removed a number of leaders who had unsavoury views.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Baum's name is sometimes credited in the book (in the appendix by Volkov, which is found in some editions, where Volkov describes the origins of his book). The names of most characters are changed, some elements of Baum's novel are removed, and some new elements are added.

And 2) Putin may be acting out a Russian Nationalist fantasy. These two failures on his part leads him to posit two things that don't seem to be true at the moment. 1) That Putin can be appeased and 2) that arming Ukraine is both useless and dangerous.

He claims NATO's assistance will lead to Russia attacking the supply lines on NATO soil which would lead to NATO defending itself which would eventually lead to a sensor malfunction on Russian soil that convinces them to launch a nuclear warhead. Yet Russia isn't attacking the supply lines and has already retreated to the East. So the first part of that position has already been proven false. Nor does he acknowledge the Eurasian empire theory  (see Timothy Snyders book The Road To Unfreedom). So his 2nd position that Putin can be appeased is incomplete.

We are expected to have -10% growth if we cut the gas off immediatly because gas is used for creating basic ingrediance in the industry. For example in our chemical industry. Not only would many chemical plants shut down, every industry dependent on chemical products would too. Same with glass, aluminium, etc. And its nor only us. Germany is very creditworthy and could wether the storm by loaning money but italy already has a dept crisis and is very dependent on gas aswell. That would mean another euro crisis, just this time with the 3rd largest economy in europe and not just greece.

Think about it this way. If we demanded from america to not import oil from middle eastern dictatorships anymore, especially saudia arabia, what would this mean? Prices for fuel would skyrocket, from 2 dollars /gallon to 7, 8, 9. That would not only hit the ordinary person refuling, it would also mean the end of every industry that uses oil as an ingrediant. Additionally transport via ship or truck would be massively more expensive and many buisnesses would not be able to pay for that or would have to rise prices. Inflation would go though the roof. And next election they will vote accordingly.

Importing from dicatorships like saudi-arabia is immoral, but neccesary.

>The biggest objective for European NATO nations would be to hold strategic points, awaiting the US to fully mobilize. The backbone of NATO is the US, which is why it prevents another World War. 

This would be more true in the past than now, but Russia's military is much smaller than it was in Soviet times. If Ukraine can do this much damage to Russia, Europe's militaries would most likely be very capable of doing more than just holding strategic points if the opportunity arose, which they most likely would. Given a military opening they would press any advantage they could see and not just hold to that objective. Though you're right that it would be the primary objective I think it's worth mentioning.

Just because NATO is a defensive organisation doesn't necessarily mean NATO wouldn't, for example, fight to push Russia out of Ukraine or parts of Europe, or potentially even in to Russia.

> * Wet temperate weather
> * Ukrainian hasty defense
> * Strength/opposition factors against Ukrainian frontline troops

and then when the numbers he gets sort of kind of match extrapolated navo and/or ukrainian numbers, he calls it a day.

Now to be fair to him, that much analysis is more than i've seen anyone else try to do. And any good analysis has to start somewhere.

having said that: 

- he already notes himself that his numbers for UA match nato extrapolated estimates, while his numbers for RU are 25% below NATO extrapolated estimates.  
- early Ukrainian numbers are likely inflated due to being caught off-guard and Russia making large early gains. Thus, linear extrapolation seems unwise.  
- i'm not completely sure how his calculation works, but it appears to ignore the defenders advantage Ukraine should have had during much of the war.  
- Nor does it include estimates for Russias hasty retreat on the northern front.  
- The conclusions (of similar WIA/KIA on both sides) do not appear to match the reality of how effective remaining forces are. Specifically, on the northern front Russia suffered such losses that many analysts claim those BTG are no longer combat-ready, whereas no such analysis has been made for Ukranian northern BTG's, even though we have more access to UA intel.

3. There is a long-standing trend of defenders having an advantage. This has been true for centuries and is true even in modern warfare. A relatively bad defense incurs 2 attackers killed for 1 defender; better defenses kill at least 3 attackers per defender. This logic states that worst-case RU's losses are approximately double UA's, as UA hasn't been on the offensive much

 >The third neighbor policy is a facet of foreign relations of Mongolia referring to its building relationships with countries other than Russia and China, the two superpowers that historically had a sphere of influence extending to the country. The economy of Mongolia is dependent on exploitation of the country's mineral resources, which include copper, gold, uranium and coal, and thus the country is vulnerable to pressure from foreign countries and corporations involved in resource extraction.

And this statement is the classic reddit logical fallacy fallacy. TLDR: accusing someone of logical fallacies or biases without paying attention to the context or the actual situation at hand. 

Basically, the situations listed above were FAR greater periods of Global Tension between nuke powers. Yet in every situation, cooler heads prevailed. It's not about survivorship bias, it's about the fact that there is a MASSIVE amount of shit that has to happen before a war goes nuclear. All of which would get noticed. Nukes have to be moved, government officials have to be moved, military bases need to be fortified or soldiers need to be moved, then the government has to agree, and finally the guy doing the actual firing has to decided whether or not to fire.

Even though I don’t claim to know what’s going on in Putin‘s head, but the nuclear threat is not off the table, never have been, never will. As long as governments spent trillions of dollars on the system modernization for their nuclear arsenal, there is no reason they won’t use it if they absolutely have to, and if they have power to do so. All immature reasoning of people on Reddit doesn’t hold the water if you look at the facts and consider the history (The US almost got nuked by the Soviets during the Cold War; all NATO countries are currently significantly increasing their military defense budget, and the whole European and world‘s geopolitical climate have drastically changed after Ukraine’s invasion).

If Putin, in his own words, thinks that “there is no point in having the world if there is no Russia in it”, and if he doesn’t get his way, he’d rather have the world destroyed than be dictated by the Western hegemony, then it’s fair to suggest that this line of distorted, narrow-minded reasoning is not out of realm of possibility. When someone is motivated by emotional and irrational ideas, rather than logic and humanitarian values, and as long as that someone is the head of authoritarian government, then nothing is off the table, the rest is a chain reaction.

Except for literally everything we've seen take place in this war. There is a lot of reason to doubt their capabilities at this point, and the only way to prove those capabilities would be to invite the same level of destruction on their heads as you wish to avoid on ours.

I'm saying they wouldn't get put of the silo, and there are several stages of escalation before Nukes would be brought into play if Putin were sane.  If he isn't,  then those escalations would not matter regardless and he would have initiated with Nukes.  It is a null result either way and, thus, should be ignored.

Define functional... if it cannot be used for a specified purpose, even if it is capable of being used for that purpose, then it is ipso facto not functional.

>According to your string of argumentation its because the US arsenal isnt functional.

The police profile serial killers and terrorists. That doesn't mean they agree with their views. But the fact we go to the trouble to profiling such people shows that it is important we do so. If we don't then we learn nothing from history. If we don't learn from history then it can easily repeat again without us noticing. Building up a profile on dictators, serial killers and terrorists is horrible, but important if we want to try and catch them or try and stop them before it's too late.  

I don't believe Putin is insane either. In fact he hasn't done anything particularly new or different nor out of character. If people are surprised by his actions then it isn't his fault, it just means that people haven't really got to know him. He has actually been very open and spoken publicly and on record to other leaders and the world about some of his views, especially towards Ukraine and starting this new Cold War.  

In many ways he's a product of the system. That isn't to excuse him, not in the least! But it does mean that when Putin dies, which will probably be of old age, then a Putin v.2.0 will take his place. You'd have to be a strong dictatorial tyrant to survive such a corrupt system and also be able to work with the mafia. A weak leader would be eaten alive by such a system. The alternative would be utter chaos! In a long lasting power vacuum there would be infighting which would destabilise the region and affect other countries.  

I actually partly blame the governments and businesses who worked with Putin and Russia for the image of apparent respectability he hid behind until this war started. People chose to work with Putin and the corrupt system. Sometimes they did it for greed and power. But by doing so they gave Putin the thin veneer of respectability to hide behind and normalised his actions. He's had people assassinated in Russia and other countries using radioactive material and chemical weapons, we know Russia is a heavily corrupt mafia state, Russia has used chemical weapons in other wars, he's annexed regions. The list goes on, yet everyone did business with him. If it wasn't for Ukraine screaming so loudly at the world and being media savvy this would have been easily forgotten too.  

If you want a crash course in Putin I highly recommend the PBS Frontline series The Putin Files and Putin's Road to War. I recommend you watch all the full interviews which they've published. Out of them all, the two to watch would be with Julia Ioffe. Here's her [The Putin Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1HWNcLDK88) interview and here's her [Putin's Road to War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNo2FPQDQw) interview.  

Julia Ioffe also writes for Puck at https://puck.news/ There's a soft paywall though. Firefox reader mode displays the articles. I don't know if Chromium browsers have a similar mode or not.

You may also find a 6 part PBS series from 2019 called The Dictators Playbook interesting. I'm not sure if it's on Youtube or not. When I see people saying the Russians should rise up, I can't help but think of the people of North Korea or other dictatorships. It's worth watching the first part just to hear the extent the indoctrination is performed on the people.  

Feel free to call me jaded and cynical, but I don't expect anything to happen with the war crimes investigations. They are important, if only to record the events as part of history and as part of the Ukrainian peoples process of coming to terms with what is happening, provided they come out on top in this war that is. None of it is new though. Not for Putin, nor for other wars.  

War is horrible. Truly horrible. It's often said that war is hell. Yet people get all nationalistic and beat their chests and demand blood. Some soldiers do get caught up in what they're doing. It isn't pretty. In one documentary there was footage of troops in Afghanistan cheering at the sight of a bomb or shell dropping on a target. I contrast that with a story from an old man I met who was a courier during a WW2. One time he had to take a message through no-mans-land while the artillery shells where dropping. When the shelling got too close he hid in a crater and ducked down. He glanced back and there, in the same crater was a German courier - his counterpart. They both waited until the shelling eased for a moment, and then they both moved on their separate ways.  

Before anyone reading this tells me he should have shot the German, that wasn't his job. His sole function was to get the important messages from points A to B. Getting in to a fight would risk the message not getting through or being captured. He would go anywhere and use any vehicle he could take if it meant getting the message through. The shelling wrecked his ears. He was almost completely deaf.  

That story stuck with me. It sums up the futility of war. Two people, doing the same basic job for different sides and both stuck in the same crater while each sides shells where falling.  

I also knew an old Polish man who was forced to fight for the Nazis and was captured by the allies. He was a young farm lad when Germany invaded. He was told to fight or they'd shoot his family. That's the one and only things he ever told me about his past life from before he was settled in the UK. I know that depending on who you ask some would say that would make him a bad person. Would it have made a difference if he and his family been been shot by the Nazis? Or did his fighting make a difference?

I'm also inclined to think that medium-range ballistic missiles, which NATO has spent decades of research and fielding to negate, would not be a concern either if launched at a NATO member. Further, and as said earlier, I argue that submarine-launched missiles would also be ineffective because counter-SSBN units are likely in range of those forces at this time as well.

I think that govs were not only greed but also naive. They surely are partly to blame for it (look at Germany for example, but not only them). 

I also fully agree that war is futile and terrible. That's why I mentioned that I'm against every country's decision to invade other countries, not just Russia.

The system itself is also wrong. I mean, people fight with others because they have different opinions or other ethnicity. There is also propaganda brainwashing people (it's very visible in Russia's case but I doubt that there is a country without any kind of propaganda). Sadly, I doubt that it can be changed. 

There is history that make people act in a certain ways but as long as we will hold the grudges from the past, we won't be able to truly move away from it. I'm not saying that people should forget the past but it is insane how much hatred there is in people for something that other country did to them 200 years ago. It's violence that makes more violence. People are encouraged to continue this by rulers who in many cases (imo) should be arrested instead of letting them rule and govern countries.

Speaking of psychology and propaganda, should that subject interest you please read about [Edward Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays). He's considered to be the pioneer of PR and propaganda. He took the groundbreaking research on psychology by his uncle Sigmund Freud and basically used it to sell products and aid politicians and governments. He exploited how our brains work. For example, getting women to smoke was all thanks to him. That's just the tip of the huge iceberg. Even the Nazis used Bernays work. Goebbels had Bernays publications in his personal library.  

I've noticed a couple of times you've mentioned the Russian propaganda regarding the war against the Nazis in Ukraine. That actually plays in to their hand. It masks the real reason for the war in Ukraine.  

Put simply, Putin is an ultra paranoid Soviet era KGB agent. He thinks that anything, and I do mean *anything*, which goes wrong is due to America and the CIA. He's still fighting the Cold War in his head. He truly thinks that America and the CIA are going to topple him as they have with other dictators. That would mean his death. He is obsessed with how other dictators have been toppled. He's watched tapes of their final moments over and over. He's ranted about it to people in the Kremlin.  

So what's this got to do with Ukraine?  

Simple: Democracy.  

To him, democracy is a tool of America and the CIA. To him Nato is a tool of America to push democracy into other countries. He's deadly afraid that should the people of Ukraine have real democracy that the public in Russia will look at their friends and family in Ukraine and start to long for freedom too and to demand Putin step down. Dictators rarely get to retire. Nearly every single time a dictator looses *any* power, or illusion of power, they are killed. North Korea is one major exception, but their dictatorship is very unusual compared to others in that it has passed down through the family, but not without bloodshed within the family.  

To try and stop the Russian public from demanding democracy and his removal, Putin has given them a corrupted and twisted form called [Sovereign democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_democracy). It isn't real democracy. They still have no freedom. Putin will always win every election by any means.  

Another tactic used by Putin, and this one is the entire linchpin of his actions in the rest of the world, is to drag down democracy in other countries to the level of Russia's fake democracy.   

Think about it. Putin is using the greed and divisions which already exist in our countries against us. He then points to our countries and tells the Russians to look at how corrupt and impotent *all* democracies are. And if they are that corrupt, as corrupt as Russia is, then the Russian public will not try and strive for true democracy and freedom as *there is absolutely no point*.  

Have you heard of the [Internet Research Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency)? It's basically a Russian troll and propaganda outfit. It's task is to sow division in our countries to make us all look as bad as Russia. There's [another timeline of events here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Before_Donald_Trump's_2016_candidacy)  
 
The really sad part is that Putin's plan is working. That Russian troll propaganda outfit has been playing many opposing sides and exploiting peoples hatreds. For example, they supported both white supremacists and BLM, they've supported different opposing politicians in America. That isn't to say that everything is Putin's fault. No, the cracks in our societies have been there long before Putin was born. He's just exploiting them to accelerate the fall of democracy so that he can live a little longer and keep Russia from collapsing.  

That's what the war is about: Putin staying alive and Russia not collapsing.  

The whole Nazi thing is purely propaganda for the Russian public. Ukraine have made that easy for Russia though with the [Azov Battalion/regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion). Openly supporting Naziism, using Nazi paraphernalia and being investigated for war crimes by the UN is such a bloody stupid own goal.

I actually fear that the current stance on Russia will soften over time, especially if western countries elect a pro-Putin leader.  

The public in the western countries may tire of the price of fuels and food. Greed will make people and businesses want to make money in Russia again. Putin and his agents will definitely be trying to tempt people to do business with Russia.  

To make matters worse, with all the problems going on around the world, prices rising, the influx of asylum seekers from Ukraine, combined with some western leaders appearing weak, all this will cause a rise in the far-right parties and groups as well as hatred and resentment towards foreign people. We will likely see people voting for whoever promises to be tough, strong and sort these problems out.  

Ukraine has to keep the attention of the politicians and the public in the rest of the world. If they let up then support may start to fade as people grow tired of the same old news and their attention will turn back to their own problems, such as rising costs and whatever fears (such as foreigners) politicians and other groups are exploiting to gain or retain power.
