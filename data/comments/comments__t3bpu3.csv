You would think Russia would have to engage in a form of siege warfare. Destroy all critical infrastructure for oil, food, and water. Right now the lights are on, the water is running, and people have plenty of food to hole out in Ukrainian cities. They'll never leave or surrender. If all the critical infrastructure is blown out, refugees will flee to the border by millions, and all that will be left to defend the cities will be soldiers. Then the battle becomes much more straightforward. 

If civilians stay put, cities are impossible to enter because you literally need to clear every single room of every single house. There will be an 80 year old lady or a toddler with a molotov cocktail sitting behind every door. And with the constant resupply of food, fuel, water and materials, the conflict will be prolonged until Russia's economy collapses, Putin dies of old age, or both.

It's been shown that you need unity when it comes to Russia.

NATO is one example. NATO is guaranteed safety from Russia.

The other example is Germany. East and West Germany absolutely fast-tracked their reunification. The opportunity for it was extremely narrow, if it didn't happen right then and there it may never have happened. They did it within a year and it was an increase of 25% in terms of population, GDP per capita was maybe about a third.

Germany handled it, with difficulty, yes, but they handled it. And the actual act of joining was completed within a year.

Ukraine would expand the area and population of the EU by 10% which seems totally sustainable as it's also been about 15 years since the last major expansion. And while it's lagging behind in GDP it would bring huge advances in resources, in diversity of population, in security and in creating a new counterweight to France and Germany in particular and to create a gateway to whatever Russia is going to become. Show the Russian (and Belarusian) people that a path into a genuine more equitable brotherhood of nations is possible.

This is a geopolitical opportunity the likes of which hasn't been seen in thirty years and the EU should jump at the chance, while of course holding to the acquis as well as reasonable.

If Odesa, Lviv or Kyiv (or especially given a different regime in Belarus, Brest) aren't just as much at the heart of Europe as Zagreb, Lisbon or *sob* Glasgow and the population is in favour of EU membership then I don't see why they should be excluded from the club especially since the positives far outweigh the negatives.

Plus, it will show the UK how straightforward it would be to rejoin and eliminate the perception of the EU as an overly bureaucratic paper tiger (although, arguably, that's a beneficial perception at times).",1646048984.0,1646040604.0,t3_t3bpu3,t3_t3bpu3,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

What I mean is that if Putin doesn't care about western media coverage of the reasons why he attacked Ukraine he might also not care about their coverage of the reasons of why he (hopefully soon) turned back and stopped the attack.   

He easily created the narrative in Russia that they are doing this to de-Nazify Ukraine etc. so he might as easily create a narrative that an agreement was reached that benefits Russian people and that he actually won.   

It works both ways - if he didn't care about the west when he started the attack maybe he won't care either when he's pushed out of Ukraine

Remember, the media also tries to paint US citizens like we are in complete alignment with our government, we are not. The media finds the worst examples on US citizens and magnifies it. Most of us want all countries to be free and independent (from US and all threats). We get lied to too.

Most of us are strongly against and angered by any type of oppression of any people type. 

At this point in the US, it's filled with some many different types of people, there isn't really one mindset, we are all learning to co-exist. 

P.S. I can only assume in any country in the world, the citizens are going to have more of a belief of what that countries government and media want the citizen to believe regardless if thats the truth or not. So a person who has never really been outside of their own country and only receives information from their own countries media... that person has a pretty great chance of being misled. It is very  hard to, first, conceive the idea of reality being different and then break from a lifetime of being told one thing. The movie ""the village"" is a good representation of what being isolated and misled can do. 

With how connected the world is and how much people travel now, it'll be hard for any country to lie to it's people. I pray.

- This does not end with today's peace talks

- Russia will capture one major city, probably not Kyiv

- At second round peace talks, an accord will be reached for a ceasefire

- At third round peace talks, Ukraine will allow Russia to have Crimea and certain eastern disputed territories, retain the rest, and in return receive no restriction on EU membership and the withdrawal of Russian forces

- Removal of sanctions will be tied to reparations

So Russia will not even attempt. Because if they attempt they have hell to pay, without getting any result. No Russian plane can enter US airspace at least on west of river as US is too good. One naval deployment in Odessa is adequate to defend Ukraine from east at least. USA air force is on stand by but have not engaged in combat but we know that USA UAVs have a kill ratio of 64:1 against Russian Sukhoi fighters. Russia cannot afford to its fighters against those odds. So any nuclear bombing runs are out of question too. That leaves land based missile launches. Russia sucks with those. Seems they are able to launch only 1 out of 3 times for surface to surface nuclear warheads. Their best chance is nuclear subs, but USA has completed its sweep of the ukraine ocean even adjoining Crimea. Any submarine to Ukraine nuclear warhead will be intercepted by USA in an instant. Actually within 2-5 seconds. So Russia stands no chance. It is within the first 10 seconds that a nuclear warhead is easiest to intercept.

Historically, no country is without blood on its hands. Russia, the US, UK, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, China, Turkey, pick your poison. This isn't in question, it's just a matter of reading the material from previous foreign and domestic conflicts, Special Military Operations, Wars on Terrorism, Liberations, rooting out Ne'er-do-wellers, as most countries in the modern era like to avoid the words ""Declaration of War"".

  
Once you've done that, learned about the conflicts, spend some times learning about the lead-ups to them, the motivations behind them. The societal views of the country that is attacked or invaded, and how the aggressor viewed that country. The geo-political reasonings, the socio-economic gains, the strategy behind occupying or annexing, the strategic values of certain areas, the gains in resources to be had.   
What you will consistently see is two narratives played out. 

  
The justification, which we see here as; ""removing a drug-addicted leader, removing neo-Nazism, peacekeeping, recognizing the independence of two separate independent regions"" among many others. 

  
The political and economic reason; Ukraine logistically and strategically is a very important piece of land to Russia in the mindset of the former Soviet Union and USSR in regards to its self-defense, and self-preservation. Through natural land barriers it creates or furthers gains of access to to prevent a ground force from invading, to a warm water port and ship-yard that their Navy requires to effectively operate from, to large reserves of Shale accessible Natural Gas, farmland, and mineral deposits.

  
I personally believe, and for all of the right reasons, that the reason so many of us have invested ourselves into this conflict, on dominantly on the side of Ukraine (myself included), is because we recognize and sympathize with the people of Ukraine, who are fighting to defend their homeland, homes, families, and lives from a foreign invader, and from going from a free Democratic society to operating under an Autocratic and partially Oligarchic society.

  
My point in all of this, is while you and I are vested in the interests of the ""People"", governments are mostly interested in the ""Value"" of Ukraine, for any of the multitude of reasons above, and countless more than what I've listed here. 

  
All I ask, is that going forward, no matter the outcome of this conflict, or others that continue to be held around our world, is take the time, be aware of your own governments policies and stances, where and why they operate outside of your countries borders, and act to hold them accountable. Let your voice be heard.

  
Realize that so much of what divides us today is ideology that has been pushed upon us by Propaganda, Media, ways of thinking from a previous generation, and foreign conflicts. That no matter how much we are made to be racist, xenophobic, preach hated towards differing races, class, or opposing political ideology, we will always share more in common than what we allow to create the rifts and barriers that are so often self-inflicted.

  
I'm not asking everyone to become an activist, just to be informed, take a stance when you can, to the extent of your ability and well-being, mental or physical.

Now, the problem is that Russia in general, and Putin even more so, are terrible losers. They're that kid who would turn off their PlayStation and don't let anyone else play if they start losing. So I'm really concerned that Putin might just throw a ""Fuck you, world! If I can't win, neither can you"" and start deploying Nukes just for the sake of causing major losses to the West so he can feel like he is winning something,¬†at least until the west¬†start firing back.  


I really hope I'm wrong, after all, I'm just another armchair general on Reddit, but from what we're seen now I think we can expect one of those 3 things to happen soon:  


1 - Russians turn against Putin, force him out of power (or kill him) and stop this madness before it causes irreparable damage to their economy and relations. That's unlikely because has to be done by those in the upper ranks and close to him, but would be a ""best-case scenario"" and the Russian economy would likely be able to recover in a few years if they play it nice during this period.  


2 - Putin throws a tantrum and starts firing nukes because he realizes he can't win otherwise. Even if he succeeds in war, his country's economy and relation with the West will be completely destroyed. Russia will be the new North Korea and the Russians will not be happy with that, especially the rich Russians,¬†heck, even Putin himself will probably¬†not like that,¬†his super yacht¬†would likely never be allowed no where near an EU shore again. So since he is going down one way or another, why not drag the rest of the world along?  


3 - West (NATO) decides to attack preemptively trying to neutralize¬†Russia before they do anything stupid. We all know that the US will not sit still and wait for the¬†Russians to fire the¬†first nuke so they can fire back, there is a 100% chance they will fire first if they have enough evidence that an attack is imminent. This is extremely dangerous and could fail miserably, and will most likely still end up in an atomic war anyway, but could maybe minimize damage.I really don't see this playing out any different than that at this point, Russia is not willing to talk and is starting to escalate the war involving Belarus. The longer it goes the worst it gets to Russia and its people, who will start pressuring Putin out harder and harder, so he will probably do something stupid pretty soon unless someone stops him before he gets the chance. He could still negotiate and stop this now, come up with an excuse and try to make it look like he won and is stopping war because he is a good guy, but if he does that, he will not be able to maintain his power for too long because his reputation will be ruined.

It's emboldened countries in asking for NATO membership, it's cost his military dearly (while exposing the lie of the Great Russian Military Machine for what it is), it turned a former comedian and mildly unpopular president into a HERO, and it literally united the entire Western world against him.

I have no idea what Putin saw in this that made sense. This is why no one thought he'd actually invade Ukraine, because it would immediately destroy Russia and their credibility on the world stage. After this, the only thing people will fear is Russia's nuclear capability. Everything else about them has been exposed. This is what corruption and greed does.

If you don't need friends, that's fine. India is welcome to make their own foreign policy decisions, I mean shit, we're helping Ukraine do that right now. But you can't complain when the result of those foreign policy decisions means that other nations don't want to prioritize you.

Indian students were told to leave for weeks in advance, they stayed. Suddenly they want priority from Ukraine, which is fighting for its life and Poland which is coordinating the world's response and moving supplies into Ukraine. India's diplomatic mission feels comfortable bullying an already beleaguered nation.

It's very effective deterrence to anyone launching at all, because of the potential risk for MAD, but saying we will immediately go into MAD scenario if, as an example, a single nuke is launched towards Ukraine, is kinda exaggerating things. I do, unfortunately, think a limited nuclear strike against Ukraine is a possibility, albeit a fairly unlikely one given what we suspect about Russia's objectives with this war, because Russian doctrine has always included the possibility for limited nuclear escalation. (And just in case someone misconstrues this as me saying this is well and dandy and the west should do nothing in that case to prevent further escalation, dear god please no it's not ok and I do rly hope US will get involved conventionally at that point/with clear de-escalation boundaries e.g. by saying we will only go as far as current Ukrainian borders)

I will say that I think it highly improbable that there will ever be a nuclear first strike against another nuclear armed state, because yes - that pretty much will go into a MAD scenario. In the scenario where a limited strike against a non-nuclear state happens, as would be the case of a strike against Ukraine, we will have ballistic track of any missiles launched. We will be able to see that the missiles are targeted towards Ukraine, and not at the rest of the west. At that point we're kinda in uncharted territory, and the western leaders will have to decide: yep - this is worth ending the world over, before firing off all the nukes. I just -- don't see that happening to be honest, and I would also suspect (well more like fervently hope) that the threat of (in my opinion, very likely) NATO intervention in the event Russia does fire off a nuke towards Ukraine is enough to deter them from doing so. They may be able to pressure Ukraine as is, but it can't be said that they're doing... particularly well, and western intervention will pretty much guarantee their loss.",False,1646050693.0,t3_t3bpu3,t1_hyropr9,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

We can already see the effects the war is having on the ruble which is presumably what would happen to the Russian stock market as well. In a country which is functioning normally, such as America, not opening the stock market would also cause the economy to weaken although it is hard to say to what extent. This is due to various factors such as the population not being able to invest more money into the market and companies not able to start IPOs (initial public offering). Most stock exchanges place circuit breakers, which is a tool to prevent large fluctuations in the stock market due to anticipated selling from news. This is essentially what Russia has done, placing a big circuit breaker on their stock market to prevent people from dumping their shares and crashing the market. Although in the short run this move will prevent the market from crashing, as long as Russia continues to keep fighting the war in this manner and suffer economic losses of this degree, their is no way that halting the stock market for a few days will totally prevent it from crashing further.

Putin is a Tyrant (by the old Greek meaning of ""A leader who lacks traditional legitimacy, but holds power only by his own strength or charisma"") Tyrants often field large armies, with impressive weapons, for the purpose of projecting strength and intimidating their citizens and their neighbors.

But a Tyrant cannot field a *competent* army. Not if he wants to sleep without fear of being couped. He has to keep a tight grip on his generals, allowing them no initiative and allowing none to disagree with the Tyrants commands. The Tyrant will often flex his authority by directly interfering with his generals plans, and telling them what to do and proposing courses of action himself.

This explains why those Paratroopers were dropped into the airport without support on the first day. The officers on the ground could see that the armored support wouldn't make it in time, but none of them had the initiative or the backbone to alter or push back the plan.

We can already see the effects the war is having on the ruble which is presumably what would happen to the Russian stock market as well. In a country which is functioning normally, such as America, not opening the stock market would also cause the economy to weaken although it is hard to say to what extent. This is due to various factors such as the population not being able to invest more money into the market and companies not able to start IPOs (initial public offering). Most stock exchanges place circuit breakers, which is a tool to prevent large fluctuations in the stock market due to anticipated selling from news. This is essentially what Russia has done, placing a big circuit breaker on their stock market to prevent people from dumping their shares and crashing the market. Although in the short run this move will prevent the market from crashing, as long as Russia continues to keep fighting the war in this manner and suffer economic losses of this degree, their is no way that halting the stock market for a few days will totally prevent it from crashing further.

Putin is using the ""madman"" trope. Acting like a madman that is willing to go absolutely batshit insane for any provocation is something russian dictators did so in the past.

There is someone who wants to rob chocolate from a store, so he pulls out the gun, wields it into the store owners face and begins screaming on the top of his lungs on how he will absolutely shoot anyone in the store if he doesn't get chocolate. Now it's also clear that nobody would risk life in prison for a piece of chocolate but because people are scared that he will do it, they will either give him the chocolate or try to negioate with him.

&#x200B;

Russia is going to be looking for land concession which doesn't seem likely for the Ukrainians. They will also be asking the Ukrainians to entreat the western world to reduce sanctions and potentially for Ukraine to take a more pro-Russia stance. The final concessions they will ask for is that the Ukrainian military surrender, and a blanket ban of on Ukraine entering into NATO. These are so that Russia/Putin can save face.

&#x200B;

The Ukrainian side is likely more simple and will involve financial concessions to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure, Russia announcing an immediate withdrawal from all Ukrainian lands and concessions regarding the ability of Ukraine to join NATO. They may also seek public apology and admittance of the failure of their invasion, as well as the maintenance of Ukraine as being fully independent of Russia and resumption of non-nuclear proliferation in terms of Russia handing off nuclear weapons to Belarus.

&#x200B;

While some of these are negotiable there are two that stick out to me, that will be considered non-negotiable.

For the Ukrainians:  
Independence & ability to join NATO.

&#x200B;

For the Russians:

Land concessions & a blanket ban on Ukraine entering into NATO.

&#x200B;

I believe that Ukraine might, just might, accept the loss of the two separatist regions as long as they could pull out the persons who wish to retain Ukrainian citizenship as that would clear the way for the Ukrainian entry into NATO and in exchange for maintaining their independence from Russia. However, this is absolutely unacceptable to Russia and Putin in particular and is the least likely scenario.

We in the US like to refer to it as a kleptocracy (AKA the Oligarchs are stealing everything) because contracts are often handed out to the companies the Oligarchs control, enriching those companies and the people who run them. This is ironic because, by that definition the US, could be called a kleptocracy as well. A major difference is that Russia tends to have more fully state run organizations than the US.

Well yeah because Putin was the one who stoked anger into people and made a huge disinformation campaign.

We shouldn't allow ""political views"" to be an excuse for people to spread hate and want to rip rights and freedom away from others. Some people were wrongly called Nazis for their political views. Some were *not* though, and this is an important distinction.

Many people all over the world had ""political views"" that aligned with Putin's Russian propaganda. Some of those politicians who did this are literally still on stage today supporting him. If we forget that part and disregard calling out the people that had ""political views"" that led to this conflict, another Putin-type will take advantage of that voter base, stoke the fire again, and rise up in the future. We have to learn from this situation to make sure innocent soldiers/people are not emboldened by people who fall for propaganda and use hate in their ""political views"".

ABSTRACT: The recent Russian approach to strategy has linked nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) tools of influence into one integrated mechanism. The article traces the intellectual history of this Russian cross-domain concept, discusses its essence and highlights its destabilising effects. By analysing a case outside of Western strategic thought, it demonstrates how strategic concepts evolve differently in various cultural realms and argues for a tailored approach for exploring coercion policies of different actors. The findings of the study are applicable beyond the Russian case, and relevant to scholars and actors exploring, utilising or responding to cross-domain coercion strategy.",False,1646045270.0,t3_t3bpu3,t1_hyrgyu4,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Putin is finding out most 3rd parties think he is the bad actor. Putin *is* objectively bad, but his moral sense is filled with righteousness, and he sincerely believes he and Russia are victims and the West are the aggressors. If you listen to his speech before he declared war, it was classic victim narrative, full of grievances and a reverence for a nostalgia that was romantic and omitted all the sins of the Soviet system. He had to take action, in his mind, to protect the innocent eastern Ukrainian Russians who were being killed by evil Nazis. And he must take action now against Ukraine before it leads to an even more dangerous situation down the road (‚Äúthe West are trivializing our security concerns‚Äù). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually being reasonable, because down the road this is even worse. Any reasonable person would see so.‚Äù

Some people are saying he‚Äôs gone nuts. But he probably believes it 100% and feels justified. He got emotional many times.

The danger is, because he believes he‚Äôs right and the West believes we‚Äôre right and good, we could walk ourselves into WWIII. 

Re: the comments here, many are dehumanizing. I see comments cheering on for painful outcomes on some Russians. We all are susceptible to turn things into good v evil. (If you catch yourself using coded language like ‚Äúdisgusting, subhuman, monsters, any kind of slurs, demons, etc.‚Äù towards the ‚Äúother‚Äù, you‚Äôre mind has been taken over by morality, like a shark switching into killing mode. It‚Äôs all unconscious. You start wishing pain on the other because they aren‚Äôt human, you‚Äôve dehumanized them. 

If you can picture a y-axis, where the best of humanity is at the top (angels, inspirational figures like religious leaders, political heros, celebrities, others who transcend humanity) and the worst at the bottom, those who are sub-human (racists, pedos, Putin/Nazi, animal names, ‚Äúrat, dog, etc‚Äù)

It‚Äôs evolutionary tied to the emotion disgust. 

‚ÄúThose X people make me sick.‚Äù 

The people at the top, people are attracted to them, crowds reach out to them, you want to touch them.

Remember that Ukraine and Russia were the same country until the early 90's.

So in terms of handing the Donbas and Crimea to Russia, it's not a great loss for Ukraine, they don't really have a historic connection to the regions.

Their supervisor gets told a rosier picture, because they want to look good. There is still some honesty here, but it doesn't reflect the situation on the ground.

The generals suspect there is something wrong, but they're pretty closely connected to Putin. Looking too closely at it will mean you need to do something to fix it, which involves telling Putin that his army sucks. If you say anything, you get thrown out a window.

So there's no accountability at the top, because taking responsibility for accountability gets you 2 gunshots to the back of the head. Instead, the plan is to plug your ears and pretend you do not know; remain ignorant and hope that it won't ever come home to bite you.

Someone suggested we bomb nuclear launch sites, others believe a video game cut scene is the real MVP of the war. The fact is, no one knows what the hell is going on.

Everyone needs to calm down a bit. 

The difference this time is that more are aware because they were too young in previous conflicts so it's overwhelming. We're also on a 24 hour news cycle where anyone in the world can grab a phone, edit a video, lie about what's happening and there's no way to check or any way to hold them accountable or to journalistic standards (which totally doesn't exist anymore, but once upon a time Non-biased actually meant non-biased.)

It would be incredibly easy to feed disinformation and they count on it. So going forward, confirm with multiple news sites outside of Reddit, in your country and internationally. It'll take weeks to years to sort everything out during this information dump but if you pay attention, you'll see glimpses of what's really happening.

The war doesn't need you to be flooded with anxiety for it to exist. It's going to be there anyway. The best thing to do for your mental health is to ground yourself. This is super overwhelming and it's scary, but it's day six. 

It may feel like day 48, but if it does, walk away. Take a shower, stretch, put a load of clothes in the wash, love on your pets and check their food bowls, make a list of your grocery shopping, eat something and then come back. 

We can't help anyone if we're sleep deprived and paralyzed by fear. We're the reserves. The people in Ukraine will continue to need the  support from their allies: emotional, financial and mental. The last thing we all need to do is Jedi mind trick ourselves into believing everything is real.
