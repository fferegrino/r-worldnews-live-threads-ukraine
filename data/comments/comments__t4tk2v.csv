They have, a lot. Why do you think it's stuck and didn't drive to Kyiv three or four days ago. It's been ambushed a lot. If it's 40 miles long then a small ambush might affect a few hundred feet of vehicles. It's quite a lot to attack and the Russians are defending it. We know they have some Pantsir missile defense systems with it so it makes it risky to use the Bayraktars.        
It got stuck because of broken and destroyed vehicles. It's cold as fuck at night and maybe they ran the engines. As they clear vehicles and creep down the road, they are also clearing the area in front of the convoy. At one point they were facing stiff resistance in the area where the convoy needed to go and it had to stop. Then when the entire convoy has to stop, it takes quite awhile for 50 miles of frozen traffic to all start again. Stop and go, sitting there idling, wasting gas and getting ambushed.      
Then you need a resupply of gas because you were stuck for so long unexpectedly. Not an easy resupply either. It all compounds. The entire route along the convoy is now blown out buildings. At this point it seems to be destroying everything near it's path to protect itself as it crawls towards Kyiv. Add to that the troops may not be eager to enter the fighting and it's probably pretty easy to sandbag what is already a shit show.",False,1646202888.0,t3_t4tk2v,t3_t4tk2v,,0,343,0,343,0,0,

Russian here. Our state university of one of our towns started propaganda campaign by sending messages to students with the following text(original and deepl translation):

original:

Граждане, объясняю положение. А то многие не понимают некоторых вещей.

Российским войскам запретили фото и видеосъемку, чтобы не возмущать население Украины видео и фотографиями причиненных разрушений и убитых солдат ВСУ.

Поэтому все что сейчас есть в сети – снято в основном хохлами, которые цепляются за каждую небольшую победу, за каждый подбитый грузовик. С учетом масштабности наступления и количества горячих точек – у них похвастаться особо нечем, об этом же говорит количество их фейков. Хотя конечно без потерь с нашей стороны тут не обойдется, нужно это понимать и принимать. Это война.

2. Как бы вы ни относились к Путину – сейчас нашему политическому и военному руководству нужна наша поддержка. Война это конечно плохо, но проигранная война – еще хуже. В это непростое время желать поражения нашей армии, агитировать против Путина и военной операции, разводить пораженческие настроения, ныть про санкции и паниковать – равносильно предательству, за которое в скором времени придется ответить.

Уже ничего не остановить, жребий брошен, теперь мы все в одной лодке. Все последствия мы будем разгребать потом, а сейчас нам нужна победа любой ценой. Даже если для этого нужно будет применить более тяжёлое оружие, чем применяется русской армией сейчас.

3. Это не война «за дворцы Ротенберга и яхты Сечина», это война за историческую справедливость и собственную безопасность. Россия всегда была дружественной к Украине. С распада СССР Россия всегда помогала Украине: льготы, преференции, ресурсы продавала дешевле чем другим странам, давала выгодные кредиты. Россия относилась к Украине как к братской стране. А чем Украина отплатила? Тем что что захотела вступить в НАТО, военную организацию весь смысл существования которой направлен на противостояние сперва с восточным соц. блоком, а потом с Россией.

Это настоящее предательство, это удар в спину. Почему Украина захотела размещения американских военных баз и вооружений на границе с Россией? Против кого это направлено? На востоке только Россия. Далее, зачем нужно было потакать украинским националистам? Их там не более 20 % от населения (сосредоточены в основном в западных областях, бывшая Галиция), которые не хотят иметь ничего общего с «москалями». Остальные 80 % населения Украины за дружбу и партнерство с Россией.

4. Отдельно хочу сказать про санкции. Такая большая и ресурсная страна как Россия должна стремиться к АВТАРКИИ, мы не должны зависеть ни от кого, тем более от нашего потенциального врага. Поэтому все санкции и запреты в перспективе даже полезны для развития собственной промышленности и способствуют самообеспечению.

Всем нашим солдатам и офицерам я хочу пожелать мужества и отваги.

Помните, мы поддерживаем и переживаем за вас. Слава Российской армии!

Translated:

Citizens, I am explaining the situation. Because a lot of people don't understand some things.

Russian troops have been banned from filming and photographing so as not to anger the Ukrainian population with videos and photos of the destruction and dead AFU soldiers.Therefore, everything that is now on the net is filmed mainly by the Khokhlyas, who cling to every small victory, every lorry that is hit. Taking into account the scale of the offensive and the number of hot spots - they have nothing to boast about, the same can be seen from the number of their fakes. Although of course there will be losses on our part, one has to understand and accept that. This is war.

No matter how you feel about Putin, right now our political and military leadership needs our support. Of course a war is bad, but a lost war is even worse. At this difficult time, wishing for the defeat of our army, agitating against Putin and the military operation, spreading defeatism, whining about sanctions and panicking is tantamount to betrayal, for which we will soon have to answer.Nothing can be stopped, the die is cast, we are all in the same boat now. We will deal with all the consequences later, but right now we need victory at any cost. Even if this requires the use of heavier weapons than those used by the Russian army now.

this is not a war ""for Rothenberg's palaces and Sechin's yachts"", it is a war for historical justice and our own security. Russia has always been friendly to Ukraine. Since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has always helped Ukraine: it has granted privileges, preferences, sold resources cheaper than other countries, and given favourable loans. Russia had treated Ukraine as a brotherly country. And how did Ukraine repay the favor? Because it wanted to join NATO, a military organization, the whole raison d'être of which was confrontation with the eastern socialist bloc, and then with Russia.This is a real betrayal, a stab in the back. Why did Ukraine want to deploy American military bases and armaments on the border with Russia? Who is this directed against? There is only Russia in the east. Further, why should Ukrainian nationalists be indulged? There are no more than 20% of the population (concentrated mainly in the western regions, formerly Galicia) who want nothing to do with the ""Muscovites"". The remaining 80% of Ukraine's population are in favour of friendship and partnership with Russia.(4) Separately, I would like to mention sanctions. Such a large and resourceful country like Russia should strive for AUTHORITY, we should not depend on anyone, especially on our potential enemy. So all the sanctions and bans are in the long run even useful for the development of our own industry and contribute to self-sufficiency.To all our soldiers and officers I wish courage and bravery.Remember, we support you and are worried about you. Glory to the Russian army! (Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version))

I'm as moved as everyone else by Ukrainian's apparent grace and resolve and the world's outpour of support but the cynic in me feels that it's easier to support a cause when it doesn't involve much immediate sacrifice on your own part.

Ukraine knows this and so, at least right now, the answer is easy and uncontroversial: Sanctions, aid, and moral support for the Ukrainians whose morale feels like the only thing between us and World War 3 at the moment. But once the gas prices climb and midterm elections approach in the US (and probably similar things in Europe) expect the dialogue to get nasty. These sanctions will cost us-- that is how sanctions work-- so we need to come to terms with that and decide it's worth it, that we refuse to become bitter and divided over a few bucks at the gas pump.

The pandemic and its symptoms have left a number of leaders under huge scrutiny at home;

Think Turkey’s Erdogan and Turkeys more recent economic failures.
Think Boris Johnson and his recent issues regarding lockdown parties.
Think Emanuel Macron and the number of protests in recent years.

Keep in mind a number of leaders are also coming up to the end of their tenures.

These are the types of leaders who in many respects would benefit off of making a hardline approach on Russia and Putin in order to rally support at home. 

I’m not taking anything away from Countries uniting against Russian Tyranny and think that this is great for global unity (however horrible a situation). I’m also not suggesting global leaders wouldn’t unite against Russia in support of Ukraine. I just feel that the back of the pandemic and the social and economic unrest that has ensued has made this invasion a unique context and perfect storm for leaders to unite and present a strong internal and external image. This context, and it’s uniqueness compared to that of Russias previous attempts in Ukraine and Georgia (to name a few) is the miscalculation that will be the demise of Putin and Russian intimidation in my opinion.

1. It's important to understand what's meant by 'Russian state media.' A lot of people seem to think that state media is just Putin and his cronies ghostwriting every single word that comes out. Obviously, that's not how it works. They are obviously heavily regulated and get directives/guidelines, but not every single thing said by state media is a direct link to the minds of the Russian government. It became apparent to me that people didn't understand this when state media sources started to put out false flags multiple times a day before this invasion, only for none to be used in any governmental context. This thread kept panicking about every single one though. So if you see state media being gung-ho about nuclear weapons, for instance, know that that's probably their idea.

2. It will take a lot to get NATO involved. Like, *a lot.* People also seemed to think that a single misfired missile or destroyed vessel would lead to article 5 being invoked and a subsequent third world war. That's not how it works. We've even seen stuff like a missile being misfired onto Polish territory, and absolutely nothing came of it.",1646205787.0,1646205712.0,t3_t4tk2v,t3_t4tk2v,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Imagine you were a General in the Russian army, you had orders for your units to take part in the Invasion of Ukraine, and you thought this would be the end of Russia, or risk a global nuclear war. You think about how to prevent this. If you refuse the order, you lose your job, or get shot, or something in between, and someone else takes your place who will do the job. If you somehow botch the attack completely and let your people get massacred - well - your people die, and you can't countenance that either.

But if you mess up the supply situation on purpose, there's the hope the army will be forced to pull back and there's a chance to resolve the situation.

Could it be possible that instead of the Russian army being incompetent, what we're seeing is the result of something like this?

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and basically sat on it for 8 years. He essentially didnt care about taking anything else for 8 years and then suddenly boom, he decides that January 2022 is the right time. Why? 

In 2021 massive natural gas deposits were discovered in the black sea. Ukraine was to begin production in 2024. Russia is the largest natural gas producer in the world. Now suddenly Ukraine is competition. 

Now let's look at the way the invasion strategy. He recognizes the break away regions in the east and focuses most of their energy on taking the black sea regions while making half hearted attempt at taking the capital in the west. The focus has always been on securing the black sea where the gas resides. Its further evidence by how friendly Turkey suddenly became towards Ukraine. Turkey does not want Russia in the black sea.

Wasn't the Russian intelligence agencies one of the best in the world? If that is ( or was) the case then they would certainly know that there is no evidence of nazification going on in Ukraine or ANY western country, then why are they feeding this bulls@%t to their (obviously insane) president?

Did they actually want Putin to react the way he did? They would certainly have known the world wouldve sanctioned the living s@%t out of their country in reprisal of them invading another sovereign country.

I honestly believe this has all been some ploy by the russian intelligence and military as a way to oust their president from power the only way they  know how. Putin atm is ruling Russia with an iron fist and running the country to the ground, Russian media portrays him as indestructible the  majority of the population brainwashed with this, if they tried to stage a coup whilst this persona was still in effect the coup would fail, they NEED the populations backing behind them and what better way to do this than to make Putin look like a weak pathetic madman in the eyes of their people and the world in general.

It kind of explains why the Russian military has been so inept and illfully unprepared for a conflict they themselves instigated, why they seem to have sabotaged their own war efforts.

They want the people of Russia to stand up against their tyrant, to vote a no confidence in their ""leader"" so the generals etc.... can move in and take Putin from his ""high castle"" in a staged coup.

I truly believe Moldova citizens should prepare to evacuate. After Kherson has fallen, and the recent tweets about russian air assault on Mykolaiv, I think the next target is going to be Odessa. Of course the resistance there will be fierce, but unfortunately russians have the troops to just keep throwing them at the city. And after Odessa falls, land connection to Transnistria is easy. Yesterday there was a russian air strike on an Ukrainian radar station in Izmail. Look it up on a map. russia will probably deny Ukraine its access to the Black Sea too, in the process of connecting to Transnistria. And frankly I don't think Moldova stands a chance, specially knowing they have russian ""peacekeepers"" on their territory already.

Boy I hope I'm wrong and russia collapses sooner than that.

in fact, if Russia takes only a part of Ukraine, however, the rest of Ukraine will most likely be admitted to the European Union making it impossible for Putin to expand further into Europe (and Finland could also join NATO).

I’m afraid that is a fact. Zelensky will either be captured and forced to sign some surrender under duress, or he might die in battle. This would obviously further raise his profile and status. The best case is he somehow manages to live and runs a government outside Ukraine. 

But the facts remain the same. Russia will (regretfully) win. But then what do they do? They’ll never have the support of the people, without which the nation simply does not function. There are far too many ways ordinary people can inflict demoralising losses on an occupying force without actually fighting. 

What’s more, there will be so many armed to the teeth civilians out there to cause and inflict pain on any occupying force. So eventually the Russians will have to leave in one way or the other, even if they install a puppet government it would be overthrown immediately. 

Which is sadly why we can expect a serious escalation of events and basically a total destruction of the Ukrainian state and will to fight as the only acceptable outcome to Russia. So the big “strong” Putin doesn’t lose face.

Just because Russia is committing war crimes right now does magically exclude and forgive other questionable activity being done around the world. A lot of other countries have blood on their hands.

This isn't intended to be a bad faith argument or justifying Russia's current actions.

Realistically speaking, the current Ukraine government is going to go into exile and get accepted into organizations such as NATO and EU nominally without de facto control of the country. While Russia would set up a puppet state in Ukraine without UN recognition while absorbing parts of the territory. Russia's economy is going to suffer but nothing catastrophic is going to happen to them since they have a crazy amount of gold reserve before the war and for most of the essential resources they're net exporters. 

Although the Russian hegemony had been in decline ever since the beginning of the century and will continue to do so, it'll exist but becoming less and less relevant in the world of geopolitics, potentially absorbed under Chinese sphere of influence at the end.

Like everybody is telling me that we need to stop Putin now or else he’s going to continue to just grab more territory. Do people here honestly think that he’s going to invade Finland or the Baltics after Ukraine? 

Like yes I understand Putin is an authoritarian thug who has needlessly invaded Ukraine wasting thousands of Ukrainian and Russian lives, but he’s not a suicidal moron. 

Putin doesn’t want to get into a hot war with nato. This isn’t to mention Russia can’t invade occupy multiple countries at once. I mean just look at all the problems the Russian military is encountering in Ukraine right now, do you really think Putin would be stupid enough to make an armored thrust into Helsinki or send paratroopers to Riga? 

And before you say no I was not one those people who said that Putin wouldn’t invade Ukraine. Spending billions of dollars amassing thousands of troops on the border just to show off your dick isn’t something anybody does. **Ukraine and places like Georgia or Moldova is very very very different than NATO or EU nations** People continue to ask me if I know the true threat of Russia, but I could ask the same of you. Do you really know the threat of Russia or are you buying into the overhype?

Now because people especially many of our leaders have bought this line they are spending massive amounts of money increasing their military budgets. If they haven’t well the hawks are on their way whipping up fear much like they did during the war on terror. It’s kind of scary how similar the arguments are. Hell the media is even starting the rehabilitation process of truly nasty warmongers like John Bolton. 

Instead of increasing military spending or refusing to cut defense spending when it’s already insanely high (like the case in my country of the U.S.A.) we can instead use that money for healthcare, education, housing, anything other than the already bloated defense budget. But no, the hawks continue to scare us into giving up our civil liberties and continue to condemn our most vulnerable to poverty. First it was the war on terror, today it’s Russia, perhaps it will be China tomorrow.

I suck at reiterating stories, but the way he told it to us it was clearly not meant seriously. Anyway, the next week he said that he saw newspaper articles about tax offices suddenly going after Asian food chains to check for tax evasion.

This guy was an economist, and was new as a politician. He did not expect his staff to take every little thing he said seriously without questioning it. The moral of his story is that it's incredibly easy to surround yourself with yes-men who do not question a single thing you say, also here in the west.

Relationship with Gazprom and Rosneft  
As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the Nord Stream pipeline project, which planned to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries.  
  
At the time of the German parliamentary election, according to Rick Noak of The Washington Post:  
  
In 2005, Russian President Vladimir Putin's friend Schroeder hastily signed the deal just as he was departing the office from which he had been voted out days earlier. Within weeks, he started to oversee the project implementation himself, leading the Nord Stream AG's shareholder committee.\[88\]  
  
On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used.\[89\] Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.  
  
German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.\[90\] In an editorial entitled Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout, the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.\[91\] Democrat Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, likened Schröder to a ""political prostitute"" for his recent behaviour.\[92\] In January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP, a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners.\[93\]  
  
In 2016, Schröder switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2, an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.\[94\]  
  
In 2017, Russia nominated Schröder to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft.\[95\] At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis.\[95\] Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post.\[96\] His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.\[97\] German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying ""I do not think what Mr Schröder is doing is okay"".\[98\]  
  
Schröder also serves on the International Advisory Board of the China Investment Corporation (CIC).\[99\]",False,1646214828.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz156n3,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

I also credit him and Merkel with thoroughly destroying Germany’s political landscape and subsequently for the rise of the right-wing AfD.

Schröder’s party was the Social Democratic Party, but Schröder was more of a centrist. So the party that was once the “left-wing-but-not-socialist-choice” for people became a centrist party under him.

After eight years of Schröder utterly demolishing the left side of the German political spectrum, Merkel was elected. Now, Merkel’s party, the CDU, was the Conservative party. The “right-wing-without-being-nazis-choice”. You know, healthy conservatism. However, just like Schröder, Merkel was very moderate, to the point of being a centrist. She too moved her party radically to the centre. SPD and CDU became almost indistinguishable. It pulled the even more conservative bavarian sister-party CSU a bit further to the left and created a big political vacuum on the right side of the CDU/CSU-Union. A vacuum that AfD filled. They then kept radicalising and are now just a bunch of populist Nazis in our parliament.

But that entire thing, the two major parties becoming a centrist mess, that started with Schröder. That’s on him.

Once it becomes illegal for a bank to lend, typically a notice goes out and the borrower has the option to either pay out the affected bank or for its portion of debt to transfer to another bank in the syndicate (which can legally lend). It’s not unusual in international finance, specifically in development finance. If this were to be a bilateral loan, that’s a different story.

Consider this.   Before the war a Russian business was valued at R100m and had 100m Shares then each share is worth R1.  


The stock market closes / shuts and that share is still listed as  worth R1.  Suppose the market stays shut for 3 months.  The business can still operate but will struggle because of the sanctions.  You just cannot buy/sell the shares of that company.  


With sanctions the business loses most of it's revenue and assets so in 3 months it is only worth R20m.   It still has 100m shares so each share is now worth R0.2.

At the time before the invasion the west and subsequently NATO, was looking weak. The US looked ridiculous pulling out of Afghanistan after 2 decades and having the Taliban essentially take over in days.  Europe was relying heavily on Russian oil and there was infighting amongst NATO countries.  Russia had annexed Crimea without a shot fired and while the sanctions hurt them Russia moved on with out a major hiccup.  I truly believe Putin thought he would take all of Ukraine with not much more effort than the Crimean annexation.  I think this shows by how large of a force they presented and how little support they had for that force.  I believe he knew there would be some fighting but that Ukraine would likely negotiate away their democracy and freedom relatively quickly due to the insurmountable force presented to them.  He likely thought a reltively quick incursion wouldn't rattle NATO countries as much and wouldn't give them enough time to really strategize as one.

Well none of that happened.  NATO rallied like never before and dropped sanctions in lockstep and they dropped them hard.  Germany cut off the natural gas pipeline plans which surprised a lot of people.  Basically NATO said we are willing to take a big economic boot to the gut to deliver an even bigger boot to Russias nuts.  Ukraine defended, and continues to do so, far better than anyone expected.  This unity likely kept Russian allies and friends from being far more supportive.  Now he is up shit creek.  Putin has always ruled with a strongman persona and backing down isn't something he does...so they move forward with a war in Ukraine.  I imagine they are hoping the work they have done the last year to be internaly stable will hold them over and that the EU will eventually crack and remove sanctions due to a need for Russian oil, gas, and wheat.

&nbsp;

*The goal:*

Create ""Greater Russia"". A new state covering all of the former USSR but this time not as a collection of states. All of them folded into Russia. 

&nbsp;

*The problem;*

 NATO, EU and UN. 

&nbsp;

*The solution;*

Break up the EU, break up NATO and eventually the UN. If possible; split up the US.

&nbsp;

*The method;*

 Covertly finance and support political fringes and extremists on both sides of the spectrum. Forment dissent and division among NATO countries, EU countries and especially internally in the US. Divide allies, sow distrust. Get Russia friendly politicians elected. 

&nbsp;

*Current success status:*

Brexit was *heavily* influenced by russian political campaigns on social media, russia friendly media and politicans directly supported financially by russia through campaign donations and strawmen. The same was attempted in several other european states. Several european top leaders have talked Russias case over the last decade. Orban is one obvious candidate. Trump got elected on the back of a *vast* long lasting influence campaign against Hillary Clinton, and a massive propaganda campaign to get him elected.

I think we will see this go worse and worse for Ukraine compared to the early days where Russia attempted to just blitz cities with armor without proper support or supplies, expecting surprised Ukrainian forces to not put up much of a fight. Now that the early shock strategy has failed, they will resort to more traditional tactics and Ukraine just doesn't have the same amount of soldiers, tanks, and most importantly planes.

If you look at pictures of his face before and now, it appears a lot puffier. Very characteristic of taking steroids (not those) like prednisone.

Precautions in the hospital for that kinda patient are pretty severe since they have like zero white blood cells.
  
Homeboy also seems to be rushing his legacy/getting Ukraine quickly come hell or high water and came out swinging with the nuke threats almost immediately. Why such a rush? Why seem to so be so nonchalant about MAD all of a sudden? My concern if he is dying is that he won't care what happens afterward to the rest of us. We already know he can stomach heavy casualties, Russian or otherwise, pretty easily. Couple that with a dose of impending mortality, losing his invasion, tanking his country's economy and place in the world... scary stuff. In the past he said what good is a world without Russia in it. I worry he thinks the same of himself. I'd also assume he knows everything about US defenses because of our last president. 

Granted, I'm a pessimist, live near a coast, and don't really know anything about military or Russian anything. I do think it's premature to have faith in Ukraine's eventual victory.

 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II; the war ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

So many have a very cynical view of western media.

The irony is the truth is far more cynical which is a bit sadly amusing - the over the top coverage is for clicks/views and thus money...

Many views in non-aligned democracies is 'war is bad but both sides are at fault'

You have to understand that during Soviet times - in fact, well into 1980s - you could still be sent to a colony prison in Siberia. To Siberia, in 1980s, because you protested, most of the time peacefully. 

Putin is doing exactly the same in Russia, albeit most people are just jailed for the night, fined, their crime is listed in their record, and then they are released. Still - you can be beaten, badly; you can be mistreated, badly. People are afraid and most of us have no idea what it is to live in a state where there exists such control over media and justice. It’s so pervasive that you don’t always talk about these kinds of things with your friends because maybe your friend knows someone in the authorities and might tip them off. It may sound ridiculous, like a bad movie about Stasi and Gestapo, but they absolutely monitor things - especially now that they’ve made it a possible crime to talk and discuss the war in Ukraine. 

These people would probably be safe to protest in hundreds of thousands of even millions, but someone would have to coordinate it first, and that demands time, effort; and the chance they won’t be locked up and jailed.

I spend a lot of time with social issue, psychology, philosophy, culture, moral and ethics. A lot of observing and talking to all kind of people and mindsets. I made my own peace with accepting that around 90-95% of people are “the masses” and are living without too much of deep thinking / awareness. It's not a bad thing, nor do I blame them, but it helped me to understand how people see the world and why they act the way they do. And why it's not that easy to solve other people's problems from your own perspective. I just wish people had more compassion, empathy and a bit more self-awareness.

It's difficult to see what's on the other side, if you never put any effort or interest in going there and finding out yourself. At the same time, there are also not many stimuli set by governments etc. to motivate people to think outside the box. 

That's why I changed my mindset of not getting upset with ignorance. It annoys me, but who am I to judge. If I want to change something, I can change myself, and hopefully, my actions will motivate others to do the same.

Finland could be the next target as well. The EU might join in to save them with a joint war on Russia, or it might not, they've made no promises the way nato has. A small nato country on Russia's borders could be attacked. Even after Ukraine, they may calculate they could take somewhere like Estonia or Latvia in a blitzkrieg before nato can mount a response, or they may just try to set up a breakaway region on the east side of those countries as a save the war for later deal.

I'd expect Moldova to be the next target though because of the breakaway region there Russia can claim they are protecting. 

Other options are Georgia and Armenia, but I think they want those countries to exist as a buffer zone between them and Turkey. Even though Edrogan is running Turkey into the ground (super high inflation there because he believes interest is a sin or something like that), they have a powerful military because the west has backed them for decades as the most sane country in the black sea/middle east region that could kind of counter extremism - whether communism, islamic extremism, or fascism. Plus they are a nato country and Russia seems like they'd prefer as few borders with nato's troops as possible.

From the very start it has been in Putin's interest to end the war quickly before the rest of the world could react. He had the element of surprise. And that has all been wasted. Why on earth would that be a good thing from Russia's perspective?",1646210933.0,1646210587.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz0z709,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

With that said, Russia is a corrupt state. There’s a word called pakazuhha, which here means “a mess” in general, which is often used to describe how some things in Russia are approached.

I’m faaaaar from underestimating Russia’s military might, but with that corrupt state, it is not impossible that their military uses a lot of pakazuhha. 

First - they get money, top to bottom. I can bet that quite a bit of that money disappears into the pockets of various people on the way down, so that it doesn’t quite always make it to the things they need. It was very much done so during the Soviet Union, but not with money, with things (eg when you were a building engineer, chances were that you built your summer house with bricks and mortar etc taken from your building site). It’s not impossible that the various generals or whatever take a little bit here and there for their own and then cook the books to make it look real. Again, that’s what was done during the Soviet era - you had a plan, the plan stated that X number of something had to be achieved, the plan nearly always was too ambitious or not conceivable, which meant that the actual state of the plan and the numbers were often made up and made to look proper, although the reality was completely different.

There’s another phrase to explain it - the village of Potemkin. It means a pretty facade, with the crumbling buildings behind the facade. It’s completely possible that Russia spends a lot of money on some kind of new tech (submarines, for example), but then does not spend money on the maintenance of their large arsenal in general, or not nearly as much money as they should. Even with your brand new tech, you still need to maintain and spend money to keep it as it is, but if the money disappears a bit on the way something will always be overlooked due to lack of funds.

This is just a speculation and based on what I know was done during the Soviet era, but considering the corruption and whatnot in Russia, I wouldn’t completely disregard the possibility that the same practices have carried over to modern times as well.",False,1646210710.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz0z709,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

* Ukraine is very culturally close to the West and the EU. These people in Ukraine would not be seen as people from the third world or the near-East, but as Europeans

* This is an actual war. Thousands have died and many tens of thousands more will die.

* The scale of this war is very large, in area and numbers. This is the first time in a long while the world has seen militaries of comparable military strength and tech go against each other.

A lack of gas supplies from Russia means hundreds, if not thousands of EU citizens dying from a lack of heating.

* Putin has spent decades building up Russian influence and power. Everyone knew, everyone saw it, but now it's clear that he will use war.

With many other wars, whilst the invader may have been powerful, there was a little chance of a world war growing out of it. Terrorism, yes, but not a world war (the war with ISIS for example or the war in Afghanistan). 

This is different, for many, I think. Also because Europe was the centre of both world wars before - people draw parallels. 

And last but not least - Ukrainians have fought back. My personal opinion is that the reason in the beginning (and before the war started) only mostly Eastern European countries supported them was because we knew what the outcome could be and we know what would happen to these people, so we felt especially shaken and threatened. But for the rest of the world, the fact that they managed to put up a fierce fight for the first three days made people (and countries in the EU) rally for them.

There is an import ban on the specific technology that is required to modernize their industries. Apple has pulled all product sales and is limiting services in their country.

Oh yeah, and because they have frozen their markets and effectively can't leverage their own nation's debt to raise money... they are likely going to default on any loans they have. Their investment rating has already dropped to junk.

 >Godwin's law, short for Godwin's law (or rule) of Nazi analogies, is an Internet adage asserting that as an online discussion grows longer (regardless of topic or scope), the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Adolf Hitler approaches 1. In less mathematical terms, the longer the discussion, the more likely a Nazi comparison becomes, and with long enough discussions, it is a certainty. Promulgated by the American attorney and author Mike Godwin in 1990, Godwin's law originally referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions. He stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in memetics.

As for every other country, our politicians' views don't necessarily convey the citizens' opinions. The people I know and I myself are supporting Ukraine as much as we can (through donations, etc.). Hope we'll be choosing the right side before it's too late.

I'm just a bit concerned, that people don't see Indians in whole as 'bad people'. We share border with Pakistan (who wants one part of India) and China (who wants the whole India lmao), and these 2 usually cooperate. It's important for India to maintain her security (which Russia helps her in) against these 2 military powers. Historically, West has never supported India when China invaded or Pakistan shelled. I don't want to be the Indian government right now tbh for they've to choose between a bad best friend and a morally correct unknown person :(",False,1646214324.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz14k3y,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Another example I think of is the Taiping rebellion. Western mercenaries, adventures and volunteers trained and led a much smaller force of well disciplined and motivated rebels to overthrow the massive army of the Qing Dynasty.

In both of these cases the superior force was outdated in both doctrine and equipment, and were defeated despite massive numerical advantage. In many ways there’s a lot of parallels with this war today. 

I’m a bit busy right now but I will try to think of some examples where in invading force was defeated in this manner. Those are both examples of revolutions. I’ll add more when I have time.

While I personally hate that the US is allies with Saudi, it’s also true that the fighting spilled over into southern SA, too. Regardless of anyone’s feelings on the topic, the US has honored that alliance and supported SA/the Yemeni government…

As have all of NATO and several other countries. War is hell, and unfortunately, what happens with the weapons after they are given to said ally is out of the supplier’s control.

In a perfect world, the US and NATO would never have even have gotten involved. But the sad reality is that Iran chose to back the militants that overthrew the government, and they were very successful at doing so. SA doesn’t want Iranian influence like that to it’s south, and neither does the US/NATO.

It’s classic geopolitics (specifically, a proxy war) and is vert similar to what the us and NATO are doing to support Ukraine vs. Russia.

ff2c4126b5e4220ba94ad5acea3ac323,t4tk2v,hz0oofs,"4 reasons the shit stain Putin thinks he can’t leave. 

1.	He would look pathetically weak and probably lose power.
2.	His border with the west would be pushed back from the relatively narrow gap between the Carpathian Mountains and Belarus, to a massively flat difficult to defend plain that encompass the western half of Russia (and includes Moscow). A strategic disaster. Belarus would also become incredibly vulnerable, as it would stick out into western territory surrounded by the Balkan states and Ukraine. Again very difficult to defend. 
3.	Half of Russia’s funding comes from oil and gas, and a huge portion of that is sold to Europe. Ukraine was discovered to have previously unknown vast reserves off the coast of Crimea in 2010ish, which once tapped would cut into Russia’s biggest source of funds. This is why Putin invaded Crimea in the first place, to eliminate a future competitor.
4.	They would lose a warm water port, which Russia has almost none of.

Bonus reason. Putin can’t pull back to his pre-invasion position of just holding Crimea either because of water. Crimea used to get nearly all its water from mainland Ukraine via an aqueduct. After Putin annexed Crimea, this water supply was cut off by Ukraine. This has caused a lot of problems for Russia, which is why securing the water supply by holding south Ukraine is important.",False,1646202345.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz0ogv6,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

It comes from the idea that if you surround some troops with an awful lot more troops and they face near certain death, a lot will surrender, so for generations military planners have been scaling this up and finding to their cost it’s not so simple to apply this to a whole army or city or country. As the size of the group you attack increases, so too does the threat have to be getting exponentially larger. You end up having to get to the level of realistic fear of nukes being deployed to be able to break the will of a whole country. Below that level group psychology kicks in and you just rally the people against you. People not interested in the war or against it are hardened against you, etc. we’ve seen it time, and time and time and time again right across wars and armies and terrorists, etc. if you’re going to attack a country, you’re going to have to win militarily, because the will against you isn’t going to break until the writing is on the wall. 

Ukraine needs to not attack attack targets inside Russia for fear of triggering that sea change in opinion.",1646208225.0,1646207785.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz0vjn7,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The Romanian Revolution (Romanian: Revoluția Română) was a period of violent civil unrest in Romania during December 1989 as a part of the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries around the world. The Romanian Revolution started in the city of Timișoara and soon spread throughout the country, ultimately culminating in the show trial and execution of longtime Romanian Communist Party (PCR) General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena, and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania.

The Soviet media frequently covered racial discrimination, financial crises, and unemployment in the United States, which were identified as failings of the capitalist system that had been supposedly erased by state socialism.

The organization first operated in Eastern Galicia (then part of interwar Poland). It emerged as a union between the Ukrainian Military Organization, smaller radical right-wing groups, and right-wing Ukrainian nationalists and intellectuals represented by Dmytro Dontsov, Yevhen Konovalets, Mykola Stsiborskyi, and other figures. The ideology of the OUN is described as similar to Italian Fascism.

 >Threads is a 1984 British apocalyptic war drama television film jointly produced by the BBC, Nine Network and Western-World Television Inc. Written by Barry Hines and directed and produced by Mick Jackson, it is a dramatic account of nuclear war and its effects in Britain, specifically on the city of Sheffield in Northern England. The plot centres on two families as a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union erupts. As the nuclear exchange between NATO and the Warsaw Pact begins, the film depicts the medical, economic, social and environmental consequences of nuclear war.

In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the entire observable universe would type a single complete work, such as Shakespeare's Hamlet, is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).

It's a combination of factors.

IIRC for bigger intel organisations you wouldn't just have one person analysing the whole thing but lots of analysts each doing a specific piece.

The issue with Iraq is that it turned out there were big pictures missing from who the source was, and one ex military guy was feeding multiple different countries intel feeds similar but different information.

They didn't check their sources with each other and so 'multiple' sources created a more reliable picture. (Pretty sure he was trying to flee Iraq)

THEN add that politicians were looking for said thing to be true.

Guarantee there would have been a handful of analysts around the fringes of those reports saying 'I assess this is complete crap because xyz'.

So it's a usually a combination of multiple different issues, rather than one. (If the different nations intel orgs had devulged their source to each other - issue solved).",False,1646210157.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz0z5e8,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

- Deposed a communist government (2009)
- Installed a so-called pro-EU government
- Turned out they were thieves, stolen a billion dollars
- An oligarch appeared and started ruling from the shadows (cca 2014)
- He got overthrown with the help of USA and Russia
- A coalition of pro-EU and pro-russian government installed (2019)
- Shortly after, the pro-russians backstabbed the pro-EU part and suddenly we had a pro-russian government which failed managing COVID
- Elected a pro-EU government (2021), which was failing... But now war started and we have tens of thousands of refugees and we got united, and probably will stay pro-EU from now on... If Russia doesn't invade...",False,1646215440.0,t3_t4tk2v,t1_hz10n6p,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

In the meantime, the EU has sidestepped a bit on the matter, not offering the jets they promised to Ukraine some 48 hours ago, and Kyiv is being battered.

American estimates is that Kyiv will be facing a siege for 4-6 weeks, and depending on the result, the war will take 10-20 years to resolve.

From what I can see, the rest of the world is giving 'halfassed' humanitarian aid while Ukraine dies out there. I think the countries are realizing that their attempts to do a proxy war on behalf of Ukraine benefits them little so they backed out a bit.

Making things worse is that Ukraine is getting their intelligence reports slower than expected, so it's possible the intelligence they have is no longer of any important use.

Does the average Russian deserve to be harmed because of the actions of leadership almost entirely beyond your ability to influence? No. Does the average Ukrainian deserved to be harmed just because your leadership is blatantly insane and evil? No.

The problem is that we can't stop Putin from starting these fights if he wants to, and we can't directly participate in those fights either. The moment US/NATO planes/toops cross over that border the chance of the world becoming a useless glowing ball rise dramatically.

But we cannot allow this behavior. The world has seen over and over again what happens if you let someone get away with it.

And so we're throwing everything we can at the problem, and as I began with, for you in the citizenry, it doesn't matter if it's a bullet or a buck, you're getting hurt. Someone else asked why it has to be your job to remove Putin and restore sanity to the world. It's because we can't. If the world is doomed to end in nuclear fire, then so be it. But it won't be us that pushes the button first. The only entity that can attack Putin directly without worrying about the planet burning as a result is Russia itself.

What Putin has started must be stopped, and with Armageddon being courted by direct action, all we can do is indirect action. It sucks, and as an American I tell you that I sit here and I accept my share of the blame for what is happening to you and your people. I can tell myself nice things about how ""We're doing this for the world."" and all sorts of things, but even if those things are true, it doesn't change the fact that we ARE hurting innocent people in the process. And for that we all share in the blame, whether or not we want to acknowledge that fact.

I cannot offer you an apology, because even though there is something to apologize for, I cannot do so in good faith. Putin is a monster and must be stopped, and I will support the actions taken to do so. But for whatever it may be worth, I don't ignore the consequences of what we're doing, and I won't forget the suffering we're causing.

And if a new day dawns and Putin is removed while his replacement orders the Russian armed forces to stand down and withdraw from ALL of Ukraine's territories? Then I will absolutely campaign for aid to be given to the Russian people to try and limit the damage caused by our actions. Just as I will campaign for further aid to be given to the Ukrainians to help them recover from the damage caused by Putin's actions.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

 >On September 6, 1976, Lieutenant Viktor Belenko of the Soviet Air Defense Forces defected by flying his Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25P ""Foxbat"" aircraft from near Vladivostok in the Far East of the Soviet Union to Hakodate Airport in Hokkaido Prefecture of Japan. Belenko's defection caused tension between Japan and the USSR, especially after Japanese and American specialists disassembled and examined the aircraft. This examination revealed to the US that, while impressive in speed, the MiG-25 was not the super-fighter that they had feared it to be. It was later returned to the USSR still disassembled with some parts missing.

On top of that, it isn’t just America, or even just “the West,” that is providing Ukraine aid. It’s not a proxy war between the US and Russia, because more than the US is involved in providing aid to Ukraine. And it’s not a proxy war between Russia and NATO, because NATO is not a State.

The second issue is that it doesn't matter what I think. If Zelenskyy was a mere comedian and later did not kill Russians in Donbas, then he is obviously not the same as Milošević. If he did kill Russians in Donbas, then he is. Russia seems to think he is, so that's why they are invading, or rather, why they SAY they are invading. 

Just to contrast, if you think Milošević committed genocide, would you say that the USA committed genocide in Vietnam? Their official stance was to stop Chinese expansion but they didn't kill one Chinese person there. It was almost all civilians. How is that not genocide but the war in Bosnia is?

My issue is with double standards. If what Russia is doing is horrible, and it is, then NATO is guilty of the same thing.

Milošević wanted to integrate Serbian populated territories with Serbia during the breakup of Yugoslavia. He just didn't care if he had to kill Muslims to do it. Which makes it a war crime.
