> Lada cars have been a symbol of Russia’s self-reliance since they began rolling off assembly lines during the depths of the Cold War.

> On Wednesday, Lada’s factory floors ground to a halt as Western sanctions deprived its parent company of the parts and supplies it needs to make cars, according to people familiar with the matter. Thousands of workers have been placed on leave.

> The disruption shows how Russia’s economy is beginning to feel the bite of sanctions the West imposed on Moscow after Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine. Russia’s exclusion from the Swift interbank payments system has made it hard for Russian companies to transact with suppliers. Supply routes, particularly through Ukraine, are shut and the ruble’s devaluation has made paying for parts from outside Russia much more expensive.

> Such a stoppage was once unthinkable. During Soviet times, Lada’s parent company AvtoVAZ erected a giant factory on the banks of the Volga River, capable of nurturing a homegrown supply chain.

> Today, however, AvtoVAZ is owned by French car maker Renault SA and the Togliatti plant relies on a Renault factory in Romania for subassembly and components.

.. 4 Russian tanks came to the village in Sumy region. Locals sit around their homes watching with interest the life of mammals. The tanks stop, the crew comes out, the two tanks pour fuel into the other two and everyone leaves. And 2 empty tanks are standing in the middle of the village. The locals ran into the tanks of Ukraine flags and čkurnuli around the houses, sitting waiting.

The first two tanks (visibly fuel narili) see 2 tanks with Ukrainian flags and let's shoot them. Rozchêračili tanks, came up understood what their own, broke up. The locals are laughing quietly.

2 tanks that were left on the move, went to the village of ob 'íždžati (apparently lost). And there's a bridge on 5 tons for cars. One tank enters and the bridge collapses, the tank beaks his nose into the river sinks the whole with the crew. The locals are already laughing out loud.

One tank left. Went and went, found a ditch and turned over there. The crew got out pushing pushing pushing, so they left that tank there lying and went to voyasí.

That's how a village without a single shot with two only flags of Ukraine defeated 4 tanks of Russian occupiers.

Танки зупиняються, вилазить екіпаж, з двух танків зливають топливо в інших два і всі уїжджають. А 2 пустих танки стоять посеред села. Місцеві вибігли встромили в танки прапори України і чкурнули по хатам, сидять чекають. 

Повертаються перші два танки (видно топливо нарили) бачать 2 танки з українськими прапорами і давай їх розстрілювати. Розхєрачіли танки,  під‘їхали поняли що свої, розстроїлися. Місцеві давляться зо сміху тихенько. 

2 танки , що лишилися на ходу, поїхали село об‘їжджати (видно загубилися). А там міст на 5 тон для легкових автомобілів. Заїжджає один танк і обвалю’ється міст, танк клює носом в річку тоне весь з екіпажем. Місцеві уже в голос ржуть. 

Лишився один танк. Їздив-їздив, найшов ров і перевернувся там. Виліз екіпаж штовхав штовхав, так і лишили той танк там валяться і пішли восвоясі.

They will also need to be repainted so that Russian forces don't confuse (or deliberately mislabel) Ukrainian MiG-29s as Polish/NATO aircraft and thus justify widening the war significantly. 

Translation: This will take time. 

Additionally: 

3) 28 MiG-29s is a good start. It doubles the number of MiG-29's the Ukrainians have in their force but ground wars are very rarely won exclusively by fighter aircraft. Also, the MiG-29 is forty years old (entered service in 1982) and there are many, many much more advanced fighters out there. Additionally, the Russians have ***hundreds*** (plural) of their own MiG-29s and hundreds (plural) more of the more advanced Sukhoi fighters. Maybe it's true that the Ukrainian air force is vastly better trained but in the words of Chairman Mao, ""Quantity has a quality all of its own.""

Finally, wars are not exclusively fought and won by fighter jets. That is just one tool in a much larger toolbox of weapons and systems that can and will need to be employed for one side to emerge victorious. 

***TL;DR-*** Stop obsessing over the MiG-29s. Even in the best-case scenario, they will take some time to get there and be effectively employed and will not be a silver bullet against the Russian Invasion.",False,1646845456.0,t3_tab3zs,t3_tab3zs,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

* They expected the war to be over in two weeks.
   * As it stands they still control very little of the overall country, especially from a population standpoint.
   * Even at the low end of estimates 4 thousand dead and well over double that injured will send a population of troops home that will paint the actual picture of what occurred to their friends and family.
   * Approaching 1,000 vehicle losses is beyond embarrassing and I'd be willing to bet totals well over a couple billion in total loss when accounting for some of the more expensive equipment averages it out.
* They prepared themselves for sanctions by building up tons of reserves in cash and gold.
   * It appears that somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3rds of their assets were frozen.
   * Outside of China and a few other nations no one is going to buy the gold reserves off of them, and they won't do it at anywhere near market price.
   * War is incredibly expensive, every day this drags on only compounds the cash issues they have.  The 20 billion a day that was thrown out a number of days ago I think is the US cost of war which Russia wouldn't pay.  Even so I think its fair to say it is costing them anywhere between 8-12 billion a day.
   * They didn't expect cancellation.  I think this is evident by not taking steps to move more factories and sub plants towards nationalization.  Business, even internal ones, will grind to a halt and will take a substantial amount of time to nationalize.  Even then, will the populace enjoy all of their Russian made knock off's?

This is one thing I think people are missing with the jet issue. We've all built it (and a no fly zone) up in our minds as the key to victory. If jets are sent, Ukraine wins; if not, Ukraine loses. But Ukraine still has the majority of its existing air force, and Russia as now established a big ""umbrella"" with surface to air missles providing more protection from air strikes. Would Ukraine getting 30 jets help the war effort? Definitely. Would those jets prove decisive? *Probably* not. These are not magic jets, they won't win the war on its own.

Russian forces *still* haven't taken more than a couple of important cities, and none of the major ones. They *still* haven't achieved air superiority, and *still* can't figure out how to properly supply their army. There's no indication that Russian reinforcements are on their way, and they probably wouldn't be much help anyway. Russian logistics are already stretched beyond their breaking point.

The Russians have so far conquered shockingly little of Ukraine's total territory, while stretching themselves thin along difficult to defend roadways that are surrounded by hostile, unbroken Ukrainians. 

For all this noise about a few dozen obsolete fighter aircraft, the Russians haven't been able to do shit to slow (never mind stop) the flow of western anti-tank and anti-air weapons into Ukraine. The armor and aircraft that *should* be giving the Russians an advantage over the Ukrainians remains *insanely* vulnerable until that changes, and the Russians aren't even making progress on that front.

And if they do somehow capture Kyiv (something I don't consider likely, given that Kharkiv, with less time to mobilize and prepare, has held for two weeks now) they still have to occupy it. Remember how difficult it was for the US, with unchallenged air superiority, an abundance of supplies, and *much* better troops, to occupy cities in Iraq? 

If these reports of an imminent Russian default are even half accurate, I can't see how Kyiv falls before the Russian economy does. And even if Kyiv does fall, it's not like the Ukrainians are likely to just throw up their hands and admit defeat. Russian war crimes have all but guaranteed that a significant percentage of the Ukrainian population will be hostile (and I mean actively hostile, not just angry) towards Russians for the foreseeable future. Good fucking luck to the few thousand Russians tasked with pacifying a city of *millions.* 

You think Russian morale is shit now? How the hell do you supply an occupying army in hostile territory when you've struggled to supply those same troops during an invasion that you spent months preparing for? And that was before sanctions started trashing the Russian economy. Wait until the troops on the ground realize that their already shit pay is worthless and they are risking their lives while their families back home are being gaslighted into thinking they aren't in any danger.

In regards to comments about the people of Russia having no control over their government since Putin is a dictator...

A dictator only derives power from the people that control the citizenry such as military and police. Those military and police have wives, husbands, kids, aunt, uncles, etc. They have to make a choice of if they choose to follow the oppressive orders. If all those people choose the path of ""just doing what I'm told"" then they have to deal with the ramifications.

Same with the people. They have to choose to accept it or to rise up and revolt. The US isn't free because the British were nice people. The US is free because tens of thousands of people died.


Edit: I will add many free and democratic countries had to do the same.

The US is under no obligation to do business with the people in Russia if they don't want to fight to remove an oppressive regime, as well is under no obligation to do business with any country or business that chooses to do business with the people of Russia.",1646849229.0,1646849130.0,t3_tab3zs,t3_tab3zs,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Ammonia isn't typically used as a chemical weapon, from what I'm reading.

It's too light to be used on bunkers or basements like chlorine gas...some reports say ammonia-laced shells were used in Syria, but I don't know...

But ammonia is used to clean up (decontamination) after hydrogen cyanide or chlorine gas.

It is, of course, day 12 of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. The third round of negotiations between the Russians and the Ukrainians on the Belarus border. All sorts of international efforts and intermediation. We've seen it from the Israelis, from the French, from, I mean, you name it. The Turks, they're talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians to hope to see if there's any possibility of a climb-down. So far, I absolutely don't see it. Feels to me that President Putin is hellbent on removing Zelensky from power and capturing Kyiv.  
  
And it is important to recognize that the Ukrainian government has won the information war. And that means that the information that is getting out about the war is overwhelmingly being portrayed and pushed out by Ukrainian sources. That makes the Ukrainians look brave and courageous, and also makes the Ukrainian fighters look like they're pushing back the Russians to a greater degree. And frankly, that's a useful thing given the alternative, but it's also important to understand that on the ground, the Russians are indeed getting closer to encircling and taking Kyiv. They are taking a lot more territory in the south, and along the coast towards Odessa, the largest port city of Ukraine.  
  
And while it is true that some Russian fighters have laid down their arms, those numbers do not look large. And certainly the Russians are also moving towards more destructive, and also less accurate weapons, which means more danger to the Ukrainian citizens. I think if you're making a bet here, it is not a Russian climb-down. I don't see anything in the recent statements from the Kremlin that say that if the Ukrainian government gets rid of Crimea, recognizes its Russian, as well as the expanded territories that the Russians have declared as independent in the Donbas, other than there would be a cease fire. I don't buy it. And even if it was a cease fire, I think it would be temporary until the Russians had more troops on the ground, and then they'd continue. But it seems very clear from everything the Russians are actually doing that the intention is not to look for an escape route. It's not to look for a negotiated settlement.

It seems like theres a general tactical stalemate, with the russians only able to slowly advance due to their sheer numbers and desperation to keep moving.

In my opinion, the real reason why NATO doesn't get involved in Ukraine are:

1. The USA is too war weary from war in the middle east.
2. The casualties numbers for a non nuclear convention war with Russia could be horrific. However I think this is unlikely, given that the likelyhood of WWIII is small even if the west gets involved.
3. The USA and the west as a whole want to be in top shape to fight China if need be, its true foe. In theory Ukraine can turn into a middle east-like quagmire for the west. While the Russian armies in Ukraine would be crushed with little doubt, if Putin refuse to make peace, he can just keep sending sporadic waves of attacks into the meatgrinder. Because the US-NATO-West would not pursue Putin's armies into Russia's borders, as that would be the actual scenario of WWIII and nukes, it means they could be forced to stay for as long as Putin wants or can endure. Putin with the current sanctions certainly can't sustain a long war effort like he is doing with Ukraine, but I think sporadic prod attacks at Ukraine's borders are doable in the long term, assuming Putin manages to transform Russia into a big North Korea. This means China would be eating popcorns the whole time, buffing up its armies and maybe even selling weapons, while the West would be stuck on a quagmire and the USA would be so war weary that a conflict with China, even if it is an invasion of Taiwan, would not be accepted by the population. In my opinion of all reasons given, this is the one most likely and the one to carry more weight. If China was not a concern, I have reasonable confidence the West would had already taken a more direct stance in this conflict. Remember, the USA actually has a sort of informal obligation to defend Taiwan if it comes to that, it can't afford to get cold feet in that situation without being severily undermined internationally, and unlike Russia, China has way more money to survive and withstand super sanctions, not to mention it would be harder to convince the world to sanction them in the first place.

About nukes and WWIII, I don't see it happening. This isn't reasonably how nuclear deterrence work and Vladimir Putin doesn't get to rewrite nuclear deterrence by throwing tantrums, there is a decades long tradition for deterrence. Nukes and its use, are reasonably reserved to avoid an unconditional surrender or a defeat in your homeland. It is a defensive weapon, it isn't meant to sustain wars of aggression in third countries. I don't see Putin, and even if he does, I don't see his commanders agreeing to launch nuclear strikes over a third country where Russia is the aggressor. Nukes are only to be used in a situation like if NATO-Western forces crossed the borders into Russia, and even then it is possible you wouldn't actually see them fired off until the situation got so bad, like NATO conventionally destroying the russian army inside of Russia, ready to take Moscow and announcing they will not accept anything else but the unconditional surrender of Putin. Only then would nukes be worse the risk. Note, that during the Cold War there were actual clashes between the USA and Soviet forces, in the Korean War US pilots engaged with Soviet pilots, no nuclear war happened or WWIII. Putin wants his legacy, there is no legacy to be had if Moscow and St Petersburg are dust, Putin's officers are regular people that at the end of the day enjoy the big and small pleasures of life, like being able to see the sun, take a walk and you know, not being confined 24/7 to a bunker where the oppression of your dictator will not be directed towards millions, but towards the small number of people he still commands, which includes you.",1646849856.0,1646849652.0,t3_tab3zs,t3_tab3zs,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

The consequences of these actions will reach the Americans. 

While the United States has made a good deal of progress in terms of renewable and nuclear energy  (some states more than others) the backbone of this country’s energy is still natural gas and oil. Russian energy only makes up a small percentage of America’s total usage sure, but if Russian energy gets blocked in other places like Europe that means supply goes down and price goes up there and American (and Canadian) producers will sell in Europe causing supply to drop and prices to rise here at home. Also a 5% drop in supply does not mean a simple 5% rise in cost. *No, cost will rise until demand for oil&gas drops 5%*. And considering how inelastic oil and gas are, well you can see why the price is set globally, not regionally. 

Also it’s not just prices at the pump that will go up. We use oil&gas products from everything from plastics to fertilizer manufacturing, the latter being critical as the breadbasket of Europe has just found its self in war. Chinese semiconductors are critical when we’re already facing a shortage. Sanctions on them will only cause further pain on everything from car manufacturing to medical equipment. 

Now one may say that [polling](https://qz.com/2139291/most-americans-are-willing-to-pay-more-at-the-pump-for-ukraine/) shows Americans are broadly willing to pay more to help Ukraine. That is certainly in admirable goal, but it strikes me as naive. It seems that the American public does not know the full extent of the consequences of our actions. They think that they’ll just have to pay a bit more at the pump when it’s other products like food and transport that will also cause them harm.

People on Reddit have been posting over and over again that we have to do what we must in order to help Ukraine win. But now that you may have a better picture of the economic consequences involved I have to ask you.

Deputy mayor of Mariupol Sergiy Orlov has just been speaking. Says city under ""continuous Russian shelling"", genocide taking place, 1170 people killed, 47 buried today in a mass grave. No water, heat, power, gas, with residents drinking snow and burning firewood. ""It's medieval""

Orlov: ""Putin is intent on having Ukraine without Ukrainians. It's pure genocide. The attack being waged by Russia isn't simply treacherous. It's a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.""

Orlov says Russian army has shelled evacuation corridor, mined the road and put in a check point. 200K people desperate to leave, only 2-3K able to get out daily on 21 municipal buses. The others destroyed. Russians deliberately shelling assembly points for those trying to exit

Russian soldiers also fire on private cars trying to escape the siege, Orlov says. Not at them but alongside so they are forced to return to Mariupol. ""They are shooting and bombing the humanitarian corridor. That's the situation,"" he says, calling for an immediate no-fly zone

Yuri got the good news that he was allowed to buy a car, so he rushed down to the car dealership. 

""I'm here to buy a car!"" Yuri exclaims.

The dealership manager says, ""sorry, we only sell cars by appointment.""

So Yuri asks to make an appointment. The dealership manager looks at his appointment book and says, ""we are fully booked, and the next available appointment is in two years.""

""What day?"" Yuri asked. ""March 14th,"" the manager responds.

""Is it morning or afternoon?"" Yuri asks.

""Why does it matter? It's not for another two years!"" says the manager.

Yuri answers, ""because the plumber is coming to fix my sink in the morning.""

Ekaterina is walking along the street when she sees a long line of people. So she goes to the back of the line and asks a man ""excuse me, comrade, what is this line for?"" The man shrugs and answers, ""I saw this long line, and figured it must be for something good. Perhaps it is for meat?""

Ekaterina walks up the line a few blocks and asks a woman, ""excuse me, comrade, what is this line for?"" She responds, ""I don't know, but it must be for something good. Perhaps it is for fruit?""

Ekaterina continues up the line for a few blocks to the front of the line, where she finds an old man leaning against a wall at the front of the line. ""Excuse me, comrade, what is this line for?"" she asks.

""I don't know,"" he answers, ""I was tired and stopped to rest against this wall, and then people started lining up behind me.""

""Then why are you still waiting? Why don't you just leave?""

The old man snorts and says ""what, and lose my place in line?""

---------

A rumor spreads that there will be oranges at the store today, so a large crowd of people gathers outside.

After a couple hours, the store manager comes out, stands on a crate, and announces, ""comrades, only Party members will be allowed to have oranges today."" Much of the crowd leaves, but many are still there.

A couple hours later, the store manager comes out again, stands on a crate, and announces, ""comrades, only long-standing Party members will be allowed to have oranges today."" Most of the crowd leaves, but a few dozen remain.

A couple hours later, the store manager comes out again, stands on a crate, and asks: ""comrades, you are all Party members?"" The crowd nods in unison.

""You are all Party members of long standing?"" The crowd nods in unison.

""Then, comrades, I shouldn't even have to tell you that there are no oranges.""

 >Starstreak is a British short range man-portable air-defence system (MANPADS) manufactured by Thales Air Defence (formerly Shorts Missile Systems), in Belfast. It is also known as Starstreak HVM (High Velocity Missile). After launch, the missile accelerates to more than Mach 4, making it the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile. It then launches three laser beam-riding submunitions, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit on the target.

- I'd bet good money it will only be a matter of months after the war that sanctions are loosened and big businesses return. It will be quiet, but it will happen. Russia holds too much leverage. It will take a while to fully wean ourselves off their oil and eventually we'll still need/want it. And greed always wins out in the corporate world.
- The Russian people have a history of enduring hardships for the cause of Mother Russia. They hold their leader in high regard and will sacrifice for them. It's a deep cultural vein that most other nations just don't have a parallel for.
- The expectation that their economy is crippled may be overblown. Europe will still but their gas, China and India will too, plus their wheat, and other goods.

In 1971, the UN put up China's seat to a vote and gave it to the PRC.  The ROC's representatives refused an offer for a separate seat as Taiwan and were subsequently ejected after another UN motion.  The PRC ended up with the UN Security Council seat and being recognized as China in the General Assembly.  The ROC was left out of the UN altogether and the PRC has used its veto to further its interests and keep the ROC diplomatically isolated.

Russia inherited the Soviet Union's seat as a permanent member.  I think that's been a fatal flaw of the UN system.

That's why, more recently, we've seen discussion of the Polish ""trading"" them with the US for used F-16s.  The problem with that is that even used F-16s cost significant amount of money for the planes as well as the training in their use.  Who's going to pay for them?  My guess is that they want the US to foot the bill.  

Now, I have no problem with the US spending significant amounts of money to help support Ukraine but, as has been pointed out by some in the US leadership, what good will more fighters do for Ukraine?  They aren't much using the ones they already have because, while Russia hasn't been able to establish air dominance neither have the Ukrainians.  That basically means that the airspace isn't safe for either side to perform combat operations.  If that's true, it makes more sense, to me, for the US and the rest of NATO to focus their resources on providing equipment that CAN be used by Ukraine (like more Javlins, Stingers, body armor, rifles, ammunition, Turkish drones, and the older S-300 anti-air systems the Ukrainians have asked for and have the training needed to use).",False,1646847398.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_hzzu3on,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Thermobaric sounds scary but it's not new, not super bad, and the Russians aren't the only ones to have used them. When used against military targets, they're not really that much of a change from any other ""enhanced"" explosive over a bag of black powder. They're designed for a specific task of damaging fortifications that ""unboosted"" explosives would struggle to penetrate. If you disagree with thermobarics, you probably won't like how modern ATGMs like the Javelin work either, where they melt through armour and then incinerate everything inside the vehicle, and you really won't like napalm or white phosphorous which cause agonising burn deaths.

The issue with thermobarics is more that when combined with indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas, the oxygen-consuming and pressure-dropping nature of thermobaric weapons has the potential to cause mass casualties even in civilian-grade bomb shelters through suffocation or internal organ collapse.

That said, if I were Putin, I'd start live video-recording myself next to a nuke button, saying, ""give me everything I want bitches...upper hand. Because, thats exactly what Putin is operating under. Producing fear of the ""what ifs"".

And I've seen in the media, a lot of people saying, ""Why is that? It's because we only care about white Europeans. We don't care about what's happening in the developing world. We don't care what's happening with the poorest countries in the world."" I am sympathetic to that view, but I think it's overly simplistic. In fact, I think that the view holds most effectively in the opposite way, in the sense that there are already a million and a half refugees from Ukraine streaming into Europe. And that's, frankly, not as much of a story as what's happening on the ground in Ukraine and the implications for NATO, for the global economy, and even for direct confrontation between the US and Russia. If those 1.5 million people were coming into Europe from Africa, or from Central Asia, or from the Middle East, it would be a much bigger story.  
  
Why is that? Well, because first of all, very few men, mostly women and children, and perceived as Europeans, rightly or wrongly. The fact that these are overwhelmingly white, and Christian, and culturally seen as similar, makes more Europeans more willing to welcome them and integrate them. It doesn't say great things about humanity, but I do understand that reality, and I think we should point it out. And so even when we talk about five or 10 million Ukrainians leaving Ukraine in the coming weeks, and those are the numbers we're thinking about at the high level, you're talking about a crisis that would lead one of four Ukrainians to flee their homes, their land. And what kind of disaster would have to befall your country for you to even consider that? It's almost unimaginable. And yet that's not the biggest part of this crisis, because 500 million Europeans will find a way to take care of and integrate those Ukrainians.  
  
No, the reason that this is getting so much attention is because of the impact it's going to have on the global economy, and at some level, because of the impact it's going to have on the future of the global order. When you have the largest grain producer in the world attacking the fifth largest grain producer in the world, when you have a country that has some of the biggest oil and gas reserves that is now being cut off from the advanced industrial economies, the impact on everyone in the planet is so much greater than if you have poverty, and death, and deprivation for a whole bunch of kids and women in Yemen, or in Afghanistan. Doesn't take away from their suffering, but it makes it completely understandable why everyone in the world would say, ""Oh my God, grain prices are doubling. Global starvation is going to go way up.""  
  
I mean, the impact on poor people around the world from this crisis is going to be a hell of a lot greater than any of the other individual crises we've seen in those countries. And I think we have to recognize that. We have to understand. So yes, we should be paying more attention to Ukraine. Not only because it's 44 million Ukrainians who are being unjustly invaded and having their civilians unjustly targeted by the Russian military, but also because the impact of this for people around the world. And not for rich people who will be just fine, but for poor people who won't, and poor nations who won't.

“On August 20, 2012, President Barack Obama used the phrase ""red line""[27] in reference to the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, saying, ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.""[28][29] The phrase became a source of contention when political opponent John McCain said the red line was ""apparently written in disappearing ink,"" due to the perception the red line had been crossed with no action.[30][29] “

Now that’s not entirely fair. Obama sought authorization from Congress to retaliate. But the use of force bill never received a vote. Congress and much of the American public were against new involvement in the Middle East.",1646857418.0,1646855913.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_i00hf2v,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Detonating nukes at high altitude would cause large-scale EMPs, which would destroy society as we know it. In a wholesale nuclear exchange, this would be a *likely* strategy, and in affected areas, it would take out the power grid and anything with an unshielded antenna and potentially some sensitive electronics. It would also take out some satellites in orbit.

It would not destroy the earth as we know it, there wouldn't be much of an environmental impact long term directly from the high-altitude nukes. Very minimal radiation or impact to the ground. It'd fuck us completely as a society, though. Back to the 1800s we go, but without the physique, equipment, livestock (sufficient numbers of draft animals) or knowledge to survive.

Not a doomer. This is just reality of what we'd likely face in an all-out exchange. Let's hope it doesn't happen.

Of course, the effects of the EMPs would probably be only part of the problem. They'd be followed by strikes on military and strategic civilian targets. We'd then have a lovely range of possibilities -- death by fireball, death by effects of the blast wave, death by fallout, death by starvation. Pick your poison.

the first couple formula milks we tried were not working and my niece was just constantly throwing up and it didn't help that she had stomach issues which caused just an incredible amount of stress on the baby and all of us the first 3 or 4 months of her life as it was just non stop crying and out of 24 hours the baby probably cried for 23 and slept for 1 hour. 

there were times where i broke down and cried because i wasn't understanding why nothing we were doing was helping because we just couldn't figure out the formula situation. 

i am not smart i mean i understand stuff but there's a lot of things where there is a delay for me so it made me feel worse because i couldn't figure out what the fuck to do and i missed a lot of shifts at work because i felt horrible leaving home when my parents were burnt out handling the baby and my sister was already burnt out. 

eventually thank god and thank the peds doctor we landed on a formula that started working and it helped so much in improving her stomach issues and while it didn't help with her sleeping and lack of the fact that she was being fed something the right formula was such a i mean i can't even describe. 

reading your comment about that mother and formula instantly transported me back to my nieces first 3-5 months of her life and the immense difficulties we had here in the states with the luxuries we have as far as being able to drive to doctors, buy formula, buy diapers and have a home in which the baby was safe and was being taken care of 4 people. 

i myself don't have kids, hell i am not even married or a gf but that whole period made me realize how immensely challenging it is for parents when they have kids and how crucial things are the first months of a babies life. 

i can easily go on amazon or find the formula my niece takes and buy it within 5 minutes and these poor people like the mother in the story and many mothers around the world not just ukraine end up losing their babies because they don't have the luxuries that we do in terms of being able to procure what we need for our children. 

i'm already a grown man 40 years old but those first 4-5 months of my niece's life i grew up in a way that i cannot describe. i will always give endless respect to parents and my heart goes out to these parents in conflict areas like the lady in the article. it's just sad. that's it.",False,1646857174.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_i00j9li,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I don't think many are saying that active US intervention *would* or even *likely would* lead to a nuclear war. I think people are saying that the current risk is near zero, but the risk rises to maybe 10% (pulling that number out of my ass) if the US or NATO directly intervenes with a NFZ or boots on the ground. And a 10% chance of mutual nuclear annihilation is not an acceptable risk to NATO to justify it.

Not saying I agree or not. I waffle on the issue. But right now we're looking at thousands, perhaps the low tens of thousands of casualties in Ukraine.  This could grow to a hundred thousand, perhaps. Even 100,000 deaths is still less than 10% (or substitute other reasonable percentage) of the number of people who would die from a nuclear exchange. Therefore, the expected value of an intervention costs more lives.

This doesn't factor in the expected benefit created by removing Russia as a global or regional threat for the foreseeable future, of course. But that's not a guarantee with intervention. They could retreat, then become a hermit kingdom with a shrunken economy but still massive industrial and agricultural base. Now with a clear threat to communicate to its people, and able to direct its resources disproportionately to its military. It would continue to be a regional threat, but more along the lines of a mini-USSR. An active intervention isn't a) nuclear annihilation or b) Russia is removed as a threat. There's c) a new cold war for decades with a heavily armed hermit kingdom 10x more dangerous than North Korea.

EDIT: This also doesn't factor in the *cost* of Russia growing in power and threat if they successfully take/neutralize Ukraine. So it's obviously more complicated than the pure cost-benefit of short term lives. Still though, I imagine that NATO's current analysis of the cost-benefit is similar to what I laid out.",False,1646852498.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_i0078v1,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The jets are big and heavy. They can't be loaded into a truck, so you have to haul them behind you which paints a massive target on them and Russia's military is so f'cking disorganized, half of them might fire on the transport while it is still in a NATO country.

If you fly them in, you risk Russian antiaircraft weapons being turned around and pointed over the border and attacked - or worse, them shooting down another commercial airliner that got too close.

I imagine neither Poland nor Romania would be super thrilled about risking someone shooting into their countries (there are people living there after all).

The build up to an invasion force of 150k+ forces took weeks and they're getting ripped apart for minor gains. Most people fail to grasp the sheer immensity of starting up and maintaining the war machine, which is why most modern wars are somewhat limited engagements. Only a handful of times have countries engaged in total militarization in the modern era and most of those times the majority of participants (both winners and losers) were near the breaking point or had already broken when it ended. 

The cost in both money and time to prepare another force or keep reinforcing this one is huge, and Russia's economy may not be able to bear it. Plus, once you win, holding an occupied territory where literally every citizen wants you gone and is willing to pick up a weapon to force you to leave is crazy expensive and difficult to do and often fails. Ask the US about almost every war they've gotten involved in since WWII, and Russia doesn't have close to the economic power the US has to be able to afford pointless boondoggles.

I do think Russia will eventually win a pyrrhic victory here and get some concessions from Ukraine while blowing up their own economy in the process. That said, at no point will the other ""90%"" of Russia's military be brought to bear, Russia would likely collapse as a country trying to pull it off.

The regional, culturally similar countries should be expected to take in those refugees - because tomorrow, it could be them. In this particular instance, the white Europeans are stepping up to care for their regional neighbors.  Can't say I see the same happening in any great coordination amongst the middle east countries.

> What is taking place in Ukraine now is horrific. It's painful. And we see human suffering, we see destruction at a scale we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. And I would like to commend the courage of the Ukrainian people standing up against the Russian invasion, standing up against Putin’s forces. And that's also the reason why we are stepping up our support. And also why NATO Allies have implemented the most severe sanctions ever. And also why we are mobilising support from the whole world in condemning and calling on Russia, and President Putin, to end this war. At the same time, we have a responsibility as NATO Allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine. Because that will be even more dangerous, more devastating, and will cause even more human suffering. So we have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in Ukrainian airspace. And of course, the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes, fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes. And our assessment is that we understand the desperation. But we also believe that if we did that, we'll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries, and causing much more human suffering. So that's the reason why we make this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support, stepping up support. But at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in their airspace.

The reason gas prices rise is because we like to buy off the global market.  It's often cheaper to import gas than to use our own.  But it doesn't mean that the US is going to have a gas shortage.

As for semiconductors, Taiwan and South Korea contribute to 70% of the chip supply.  Sure, China makes some, but if we're not selling our chips to China, those same chips are now available.

Semiconductors - SMIC is a small player in the market and is/has already been under US sanctions for years.

Oil - US domestic production was already forecast to increase this year by more than we imported from Russia last year. Anyway, the effects of the block are basically that the US will pay a bit above open market prices for oil (fewer places to buy from, less competitive pricing) and Russia will make slightly less from oil sales vs open market prices (fewer customers, less pricing power with remaining customers).

A quick skim is that Russian crude (Urals) is currently trading at about a $25/barrel discount to the benchmark grade (Brent), whereas pre-conflict it was typically about $2/barrel under Brent.

It can considered to be a misfire if there is a worthy target nearby. ie theyre is a military base/radio communication tower/airport right beside a school.

Collateral damage is tricky. What is and isn't considered collateral damage is usually decided by the side that controls the narrative (usually the winning side, or the side with more allied-countries) and more often than not this ruling is contested by the losing side. There have been those that have argued that the USA bombings of Vietnam, Serbia, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan crossed the line of what is collateral damage and there was an intent to hurt civilians either physically or psychologically.

I wouldn't call this intentional genocide, as genocide is a bit more systemic. Also Russians consider Ukrainians 'like brothers'.

You do that now a days to Mr. Biden and those same people who called Bush stupid will flag you for being a white supremacist demestic terrorist, or a nazi, which ever is more chic to call people at the time. The problem with doing that, is it normalizes the phrase, so when there actually is a nazi or a white supremacist/ terrorist, people just assume someone is blowing something out of proportion and dismiss it.

I remember CNN and other 24 hour news outlets saying the story that there were no WMD in Iraq and that we never should have been there and blaime Bush for all of it. Well, there were no Nuclear WMD, that's true, but there was missiles with a range greater than the UN security council said they could have with the capability of delivering sarin gas, which is banned by the Geneva Convention. So something illegal designed to deliver something illegal and it was used to kill over 20,000 civilians of a particular ethnic background.. but no nukes? Bush completely and utterly wrong then and only him. I have to hand it to CNN though, they did such a good job of associating the acronym ""WMD"" to solely mean ""Nuclear weapons"" most people to this day don't think WMD can mean anything other than Nuclear ballistic missiles.

If you want to see a side of Bush most people don't know, try looking up some of his interviews before he was running for President. It would be nice to have a President half as competent as Bush was right now, imo. Not saying Biden is complete trash, he is at least more unifying and a better statesman than Trump could ever be, but still.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Occasionally while reading events I'll have  moments where I feel like ""screw it, we *should* do more"", but then upon thinking about it more I come back to the conclusion that on the whole, it's still a bad (or at least incredibly dangerous) decision for the US or Nato to intervene in any more direct way. 

Mostly in terms of discourse on here I guess I'm just frustrated that in many of these circular arguments the OP especially seems more concerned with ""winning"" the argument than in actually seriously weighing options. And obviously, yeah, we are all arguing on Reddit, so we are about as low on the importance pole as you can get in terms of actually having any impact at all on this. Nothing we say on here has much impact. But still...

I also feel like there are actual things that could be discussed that are very related to these circular arguments but get completely lost in most of them. For just one example - I feel like the United States is in a very strange and precarious position right now in terms of it's involvement, in the sense that it could really shape international outlook on the US foreign policy for years to come. It's caught in the middle of two opposite problems.

\*On the one hand, you've got people saying that if the US does not intervene more directly, clearly all of it's rhetoric about caring for human rights and human life etc etc. is all bunk, and it will be remembered for not caring, not being ""worthy"" of the being the ""world-police.""

\*On the other hand, you've got people saying that if the US DOES intervene more directly, it will just show that the United States is absolutely incapable of *staying out of any war, ever*. That ever war just ends up being a war-profiteering exercise for the US. And this will absolutely play into the hands of US opponents like China, who wish to somehow paint this as a war of US aggression, despite the fact that the US isn't even in the war. Making that narrative stick, will become a *LOT* easier if this US does enter the conflict at some point.

The potential for regime change, even if low, and the incredible amount of uncertainty as to the disposition of those nuclear forces, if that were suddenly to happen, if Putin were to be removed, immense existential question mark for all of us living in the world. Or the impact of what happens if we have direct fighting between Russia and NATO. Right now, we have a proxy war. We have indirect fighting. We have the Russians fighting in Ukraine, and then we have all the NATO countries sending advanced weapon systems. I mean the best sniper rifles they have, the best air defense they have, jet fighters, increasingly being sent over to Ukraine to fight and kill the invading Russians.  
  
It's perfectly legitimate for NATO countries to do that. I'm not suggesting it's a bad idea. I'm simply suggesting it's a dangerous reality because increasingly you have NATO fighting against Russia. And the idea that, well, as long as it's not NATO troops directly in battle that somehow it's okay. Well, I mean, maybe you can justify it to yourself that way, but the Russians won't see it that way. Putin won't see it that way. And the potential that we have, significant escalation, cyberattacks, economic warfare, asymmetric, disinformation attacks, even terrorism against NATO countries from Russia, seeing that as perfectly fine in an environment where acts of war are being committed against them. It is an incredibly dangerous environment. And one that implies a reprise of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. One where you have major nuclear powers in a showdown against each other.  
  
I'm not in any way predicting World War III. I don't think it's imminent. I don't even think it's all that close, but I recognize it's possible. And so, again, it would be inconceivable for me not to spend most of our time focusing on this crisis as a consequence of that, given the implication.  
  
So anyway, a few of my thoughts this week as we get kicked off and what's clearly going to be a brutal, and depressing, and challenging week for us all, but all the more reason to do our best, and try to make a difference.

 >The bombing of Dresden was a British-American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, during World War II. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 772 heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed more than 1,600 acres (6. 5 km2) of the city centre.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Given the preparation time though - hard to say. I think at minimum there would be a record of the perimeters so de-mining can be more focused after the war.

Obviously this is speculation regarding the situation here - who knows.

As per keeping them out of the hands of spies - minefields for beaches are more of an obstacle than a weapon. If the pattern is narrow enough you can't get armor through it without de-mining. If you are only landing troops, who can actually keep the pattern in mind when coming under suppressive fire? Even if they know exactly where the mines are they would have to clear them, massively slowing down any attempt at taking a beachhead under fire.


Edit: this is specifically defensive mining in your own country. I know Russia provided Afghanistan what records they could of mines planted as an invading force - but in general I think less concern placed tracking that kind of thing and obviously impossible when airdropped like butterfly mines).",1646850173.0,1646849647.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_hzztyp7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

The gaslighting when BlackLivesMatter, Universal Healthcare and basic income are brought up. All the while the wealthy have never been wealthier than they are today and the income gap keeps growing.

The reason the U.S. gets away with it is because it is but a macro version of what is happening on the micro level within people's homes. The Narcissist, the enablers and the willing and untiring flying monkeys are in too many American households.

 >The Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against the Government of Syria to Respond to Use of Chemical Weapons (S.J.Res. 21) is a United States Senate Joint Resolution that would have authorized President Barack Obama to use the American military to intervene in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. The bill was filed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on September 6, 2013 in a specially scheduled pro forma Senate session that took place during the last week of the August recess. The bill would have authorized only 60 days of military action, with the possibility of a one-time extension of 30 days.

 >State capitalism is an economic system in which the state undertakes business and commercial (i. e. for-profit) economic activity and where the means of production are nationalized as state-owned enterprises (including the processes of capital accumulation, centralized management and wage labor). The definition can also include the state dominance of corporatized government agencies (agencies organized along business-management practices) or of public companies such as publicly listed corporations in which the state has controlling shares.
 
**[Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)** 
 
 >Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal') is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of property and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. Communism is a specific, yet distinct, form of socialism.

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

But on a basic level, the world has been in this situation before- in Vietnam, in Korea, in Afghanistan when the Soviets invaded- and we know at least that historically, these conflicts have *not* expanded to NATO countries.

If you want NATO involved, I completely understand- I don't relish not being able to have a solution any more than you do- but I think it's disingenuous to say the west isn't making honest commitments here. Russia is the most sanctioned country on earth now, and Ukraine is going to have all the defensive weapons it can handle for the foreseeable future.

But even if NATO decided to declare war today, it's not like Russia would immediately stop. If anything, the impetus to take cities (to then use as defensive positions against the incoming NATO invasion) would only grow, and we'd see outright massacres on a scale we haven't seen since WWII. Is it worth NATO intervening if it means tens of thousands more civilians die in the short term? I don't know- there aren't any good answers here.

The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's **man-made** and allegedly **intentional** aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement. As a large part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.[10] Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine[11] and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government.[12]


——

The famine of the **1920s** affected all of the Soviet Union, and that time Stalin **didn’t** refuse outside aid, in fact the United States delivered a great deal of help in hopes of influencing young Soviets. It didn’t work as they attributed the food to Moscow instead.

The **Holodomor** is specifically the intentional manmade famine of the 1930s.",False,1646849408.0,t3_tab3zs,t1_i000xu4,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I think we don't necessarily need to go all-out military action, but NATO does need to take some additional steps. That means increasing the military pressure on Russian forces in Ukraine, which is likely achieved through (limited) additional military intervention, most likely the supply of heavier armaments and offensive rather than defensive capabilities, potentially with ""advisers"" to support their effective deployment. USSR did this in Korea and Vietnam without escalation.

We also need to make it clear that NATO is not standing idly by, that unless there is an immediate and total Russian withdrawal at this time, the consequence will be the full-scale deployment of unrestricted NATO forces into Ukraine, but no further.

We don't want to destroy Russia, but we are quite happy for Russia to destroy itself. We're not interested in controlling Russian territory, but we are interested in protecting our own.

I don't understand the argument for people asking for NATO involvement.  
NATO themselves are telling the world the reasons why they aren't getting involved. Yet many remain confused. It seems clear to me.  
  
Here are recent comments from a press conference with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg:  
  
> What is taking place in Ukraine now is horrific. It's painful. And we see human suffering, we see destruction at a scale we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. And I would like to commend the courage of the Ukrainian people standing up against the Russian invasion, standing up against Putin’s forces. And that's also the reason why we are stepping up our support. And also why NATO Allies have implemented the most severe sanctions ever. And also why we are mobilising support from the whole world in condemning and calling on Russia, and President Putin, to end this war. At the same time, we have a responsibility as NATO Allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine. Because that will be even more dangerous, more devastating, and will cause even more human suffering. So we have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in Ukrainian airspace. And of course, the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes, fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes. And our assessment is that we understand the desperation. But we also believe that if we did that, we'll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries, and causing much more human suffering. So that's the reason why we make this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support, stepping up support. But at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in their airspace.  
  
Seems pretty clear cut to me. And that's from the civilian leader of NATO who's held the office for since October 2014. His entire administration, Russia has been waging war in Ukraine.
