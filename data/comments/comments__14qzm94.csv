Thankfully not much has happened here since my last post (well, other than the constant doomposting about ZNPP being possibly blown up soon), it was mostly quiet here. There were no missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv directly, but yet again there were some aimed at towns in Kharkiv oblast, and in the usual Russian fashion they targeted civilians. There was also an attempted Shahed attack during the previous night, but they were all intercepted before reaching their targets.

Yesterday Russians tried to bomb a funeral of one of our soldiers in Pervomaiskyi. They fired an Iskander missile at a residential district, and they missed any of the soldiers that were present, but they injured 43 civilians, including 12 children (the youngest of whom were 3 and 9 *months* old), fucking bastards. It’s a miracle nobody died considering how many people got injured. The missile landed in the middle of a street, right in front of a high-rise residential building, and destroyed a bunch of cars that were parked there. And after doing something like this they try to frame us destroying their ammo dumps as “targeting civilians”, just how hypocritical can one nation be?

In the last couple of days Kharkiv has been getting thunder non-stop, and though usually we are apprehensive of it because of the war, this time we really didn’t mind the sound of it (which is completely indistinguishable from actual explosions). We always loved hearing thunder before the war, so we thought that it would now be forever ruined for us, but it turns out that we actually pretty much stopped caring about explosions altogether after experiencing them so many times during the last year and a half. It’s wild how well humans can adapt to things like this, but it is also somewhat dangerous, because you should never stop fearing explosions, they don’t stop being lethal just because you get used to hearing them all the time.",False,1688588560.0,t3_14qzm94,t3_14qzm94,,0,192,0,192,0,0,

Containments are designed for direct airplane strikes and even with that breach you still have to get into the reactor vessel to really get material airborne. Fires from missile or other explosive would certainly aid spreading of radioactive contamination but it’s nothing like a melting Chernobyl (absolutely nothing like it). The one warm shutdown core is more concerning but it’s still going to take a hell of a lot to get to fuel and get that fuel airborne. I don’t want to diminish the human life at risk but I imagine a missle strike resulting in release of radiation from non-fuel areas that affects the local area 10-20 miles. If Ukraine can get in and provide any cooling source to spent fuel or shutdown cores the threat of melting fuel (and airborne fuel) will drop a lot.

The EU imposed sanctions against Moscow as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But loopholes raise doubts about whether these are working.

There is evidence that dual-use items that can also be used for military purposes are reaching Russia – from microelectronics, to replacement parts for related industries, to cars and weapons. How can this be happening in spite of sanctions? Where are the loopholes? To find out, DW reporter Miodrag Soric went to Georgia, a Western-oriented country that officially supports the imposed sanctions. Georgia is also a close neighbor of Russia, with all the economic ties and geopolitical dependencies that that implies. Allegedly, large amounts of exports continue to go to Russia via countries such as Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia. How do they get there? How can this be stopped? Miodrag Soric searches for clues.

By Michael Drummond, foreign news reporter

As Ukraine and Russia continue to accuse each other of planning to cause an explosion or other incident at the nuclear power plant in eastern Ukraine, it raises questions about what would happen if such a blast did occur.

Eugene Shwageraus, a professor of nuclear energy systems engineering at Cambridge University, told Sky News: ""The installation is not built for housing troops and military equipment.""

""Obviously, power plants are there to generate electricity and misuse of any industrial facility is a concern.""

But he added that nuclear power plants are built ""pretty robustly"" and said there was a difference between real dangers and perceived dangers.

Because the reactors were shut down months ago, Professor Shwageraus told Sky News, the most dangerous fission product that was being produced - iodine-131 - has now decayed to safe levels.

Iodine-131 is important, he says, because it is both:

volatile (very mobile in the environment); and
dangerous to humans when encountered.

But with the iodine from previous reactions now decayed to safe levels, the remaining isotopes of other elements that remain are not as much of a risk because they may be volatile or dangerous when encountered, but not both.

Asked if a large explosion at the plant would scatter any of the remaining radioactive materials further afield and thus present a problem, he said: ""A bit further means you will contaminate the parking lot of that power plant.""

""In a briefing on July 22, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that U.S. President Joe Biden is not prepared to provide Ukraine with ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles with a range of over 300 kilometers. Sullivan noted that, while providing the necessary resources to support and defend Ukraine remains a key goal of the U.S., another key goal is to “ensure we do not end up in a circumstance where we’re heading down the road towards a third world war.”""

""Jake Sullivan, Yermak’s counterpart in Washington, has established very consistent contact, occuring on a regular basis. It is no longer just the two of them but also, as I recall, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, and the leader of the military forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Negotiations are well underway, but Sullivan has publicly declared his opposition to such a choice [granting Ukraine long-range weapons], and he has reported his opinion to the President.

There is one word here, Escalation. They are dragging their feet because the White House is afraid of escalation. Jake Sullivan, in my opinion, has made a huge error. I believe this block is still in place due to him and numerous other White House aides.""

An odd placement, if that is an explosive charge. ZNPP uses PWR-style reactor systems (specifically, Soviet VVERs), so the turbine would be decidedly on the non-nuclear (non-radiation) side of things.

Of course if the goal is to (relatively) safely make the plant unusable in case the Ukrainians get it back, blowing up the turbine certainly would do it.

EDIT with some additional info on the reactor containment. The outer hull is a thick (""meters"") layer of prestressed, reinforced concrete that is not easy to crack or penetrate (usually there is a an additional steel encasement beneath the concrete as well).

&#x200B;

>Because the reactors were shut down months ago, Professor Shwageraus told Sky News, the most dangerous fission product that was being produced - Iodine-131 - has now decayed to safe levels.  
Iodine-131 is important, he says, because it is both:  
\- volatile (very mobile in the environment), and  
\- dangerous to humans when encountered  
But with the iodine from previous reactions now decayed to safe levels, the remaining isotopes of other elements that remain are not as much of a risk because they may be volatile or dangerous when encountered, but not both.

We don't know if Russia is going to do anything at all, and there's nothing we can do to stop them. 

But there are things we *can* do. For one, [donate money to Ukraine](https://u24.gov.ua/). If you don't have money, consider becoming a volunteer with the [ENGin Program](https://www.enginprogram.org/). All you have to do is talk with a speaking buddy one hour a week for three months.

The problem is that you are seeing this as an all or nothing situation. You're staring at the word ""nuclear"" and losing all perspective. Incidentally, this is *precisely* the reaction the Russians want. They want you scared at the power they supposedly wield by daring to blow up a nuclear power plant.

The point is that it is *not* all or nothing. You can blow up a nuclear power plant in a way to create a huge incident with massive nuclear fallout, or you can blow parts of an otherwise shut down and dormant nuclear power plant that simply renders it unusable forever, without causing any type of nuclear fallout to speak of for the environment. 

The best evidence we have is that Russia is planning to do the latter, rather than the former. And in that case, we're not talking about creating a nuclear incident, destruction of the environment, risk of contamination to the region let alone other countries. So in that case: why should NATO get involved? If there there no real effect, there is also no need for a counter reaction. Simple as.

So as always, we need to look at the actual facts and stop buying into the hype. If they blow it up and create an actual issue: by all means lets respond proportionally or even disproportionally. But if they blow it up and it's just a pile of rubble on top of a now useless reactor in a limited area - then no, there should not be an intervention.",False,1688566058.0,t3_14qzm94,t1_jqr4v9b,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

If you have a line clearing charge, you might rather take apart the individual charges and drop them from a drone.  If you have a cluster bomb, you probably rather fire it into a trench or even take it apart and drop one by one on people in that trench.

0bf577b11fb5e5ea7a6d68de708749e2,14qzm94,jqrex93,"Ok, let me preface this: I'm not a nuclear engineer but I know enough about physics to make one more try to dispel some of the pseudo-knowledge floating around, so here goes:

1. First, the reactors have been shut down since last fall, so most of most of them have entered ""cold shutdown"", where decay heat is low enough that very little or only passive cooling should be enough. One reactor they kept up at a low reactivity level until about 3 weeks ago or so (too lazy to look it up again) for some utility power, but it's been shutdown too now.

2. Iodine tablets: Forget it. Iodine tablets are not anti-radiation pills (do no exist) but they are supposed to protect specifically your thyroid gland in case of an accident with an active reactor. When uranium splits, the fragments can be all kinds of sizes (called fission products, FP) that are very radioactive and start to decay. One of the most radioactive (indicated by its low half-life, look up relationship half-life and activity if you want to learn) ones is a radioactive iodine isotope. In addition to its high activity (many FPs are very active), it also has a few other nasty properties: First, it's a gas, so it quickly disperses once it gets out of the fuel cladding and the reactor. Second, your body will think ""great, free iodine"" and store it in your thyroid gland, where it decays and causes cancer and other damage. To prevent this, you take the iodine pill, which saturates the thyroid gland with iodine and prevents the uptake of the radioactive iodine. It solves an immediate but specific problem during a nuclear accident. However, it only applies to active reactors having an accident. Radioactive iodine has a half-life of 8 days, so it is pretty much gone within a few weeks. There is basically no iodine left in the ZNPP right now because the reactors have been shut down for so long, so iodine pills do nothing (except side effects, ask a medical professional about those).

3. Huge area contaminated by radioactive particles: Not impossible to be the end result, but also not very likely and here is why: If you ever look into specific data from accidents like Fukushima, you will notice that most of the contamination comes from specific isotopes, strontium 90 is one of them. Why isn't there more, say, plutonium contamination outside the NPP perimeter? Because plutonium particles are heavy and if you want to disperse material, you need energy to shoot particles everywhere, the heavier the particle, the more energy needed to get it far. Why is this relevant? The energy has to come from somewhere and in bad accidents like e.g. Fukushima or Chornobyl, most of the energy for dispersing the material came from the (surprise) reactor. The hot reactor would boil water to steam, heat air (and in case of Chornobyl add the graphite fire in the reactor generating hot smoke etc.), which will physically pull (especially lighter) fission products like strontium with is (strontium salts, which quickly form, are also water-soluble, another reason why this is one of the more common contaminants). At ZNPP the reactors are shut down for a while now and decay heat is very low, it would be very difficult to disperse the material from it over a large area (and an explosion has, surprisingly, not much energy only a lot of energy in a short period of time, which physicists call ""power""). Would it be a problem if someone blew up the reactor or fuel pools? It would be a disaster, but probably not nearly as widespread as Chornobyl or Fukushima.

4. Fuel cladding: Nuclear reactor fuel is encased in little pellets, which are then slid down pipes that are sealed and arranges in so-called fuel bundles. This is known as ""fuel cladding"" and means that reactor fuel is generally sealed in and can't easily get out, even if you pop the reactor top off (which is regularly done e.g. for refueling). So, how does it get out during an accident? In case of Chornobyl, the reactor was at extreme power output, at Fukushima it was the residual heat right after shutdown (the reactors had been shutdown right when the earthquake hit, the tsunami that interrupted cooling hit only a few hours later, so there was a lot of decay heat from the FPs). In both cases, the heat was enough to melt the little fuel pellets, pipes and bundles into a blob (meltdown), which made the fuel particles accessible to be dispersed. In science, you always have to hedge you bets because weird things happen, but if you simply blow a hole in the cold reactor, it is unlikely to release huge amounts of radiation. Additional things must happen.

This is a basic rundown, I've simplified a few things drastically for brevity. Hope it helps.

EDIT: I'm not saying that if you have physical control over the plant you couldn't cause a bad disaster, but it would require some, very likely noticeable, prep work like turning the reactor to full power for a few hours or days etc., at least more than just explosives, probably.",1688567967.0,1688567783.0,t3_14qzm94,t1_jqr90l4,,1,44,0,44,0,0,

The slightly longer version is:

1: The most dangerous particles, by definition, degrade the fastest. The rule of thumb is to tape up your windows and stay inside for 2 weeks. Being prepared means having food, water and entertainment to last 2 weeks.

2: once you break quarantine, consider all water contaminated. Consider anywhere dust could settle contaminated. Continue to maintain your quarantine as best you can by having 'outdoor clothes' that get hand washed and not reintroduced into your home. The longer you can keep this up, the better.

3: Long term, see what the news says about groundwater contamination and general food safety. Exceed recommended safety protocols.

All airplanes including commercial craft can function as the first stage in a multi-stage delivery system.  A glide ratio of 10 is low.  So it is easy to add 130 km to any system just by hauling up to a 13 km ceiling.

>A dutch news website, (albeit most of the time not very high quality) did make an article about this a few days ago speaking to experts in the nuclear domain. This is part of the translated article:  
But the comparison with Chernobyl is unjustified, says radiation expert Lars Roobol to NU.nl. Or rather: it no longer applies since September, when the last of the six reactors was also shut down. The others have been out for over a year.  
""Once you turn off the reactor, no new radioactivity is created."" Any remaining radioactive debris then decays. This ultimately produces harmless atoms. Depending on the type of radioactive substance, this decay takes seconds to hundreds of thousands of years.  
**Only one hundredth of the radioactivity**  
What difference are months or a year? A lot, says Professor of Reactor Physics Jan Leen Kloosterman. A good measure of radioactivity is the amount of heat generated in the reactor. ""The heat development is only 10 percent 24 hours after switching off,"" says Kloosterman.  
Even after that, the decline continues, says Roobol - albeit more slowly. After a year, roughly one percent of the energy remains in the reactor.  
This decreasing heat has two important consequences, says nuclear safety advisor Mark van Bourgondiën of the Authority for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection (ANVS). Less water is needed for cooling. And if it does go wrong, the consequences are considerably smaller.  
**In worst case scenario, keep windows and doors closed**  
If the cooling of the reactors fails completely, it could still lead to a core meltdown, says Van Bourgondiën. In addition, radioactive material can spread into the environment, but not lethal levels over a large area.  
""High radiation levels and radioactive contamination are still possible in the immediate vicinity of the plant. You are talking about an area of a few kilometers, possibly ten to twenty. Immediate protection measures must be taken there, such as keeping windows and doors closed for 48 hours.  
""Depending on the wind direction, radioactive substances can still precipitate in a strip up to several hundred kilometers away. According to Van Bourgondiën, this will not so much lead to dangerously high radiation levels for the population, but it may make it necessary to close greenhouses and temporarily keep livestock in stables.

So they're sending small groups forward to clear mines, and when Russia tries to stop them by saturating the area with shells, Ukraine then takes out their artillery.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War  

Two examples of offensive conflicts where the defender had higher losses.

I know, i know, the iraq invasion is ridiculous to put in there. 

But it does serve as a reminder that ""3 to 1 advantage to defenders"" and all those kind of rules, are not rules, but guidelines. And an overwhelming power who systematically dismantles defenses before moving in can certainly have lower losses than the defender.

And what has Ukraine been doing recently? the counteroffensive is moving slowly, but the amount of drones and artillery hasn't been reduced at all from the Ukrainian side. And the videos that *do* get released of Ukraine capturing trenches are often about 10-20 Ukrainian soldiers simply mopping up the confused Russian soldiers left in the trench without any backup.

Moreover, yes, we've seen plenty of footage of bradleys&tanks being taken out, but we've also heard at how good those are at keeping their occupants alive. 

Finally, even with Ukraine going on the offensive, Russia plenty of times tries to take back lost positions with counterattacks. And from what we've heard so far, those counterattacks are more often meatgrinder attacks that get repelled than any systematic offensive like Ukraine is doing.

is it 8-10x? Why not? while we do get footage of Ukraine taking losses, it is never in the numbers of casualties like we see from the Russians. Moreover, it is unclear whether we're talking about local losses during the counteroffensive, or more global losses in the entire theater. A hardfought battle on one front can be compensated by a Russian suicidal attack on another front. and individual actions can be far more succesful than 8-10x, so if you're not looking at the entire theater it is possible that locally the advantage is even bigger.",1688552578.0,1688552381.0,t3_14qzm94,t1_jqqjza1,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

Bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), one of several naturally occurring isotopes of potassium. One BED is often correlated to 10−7 sievert (0.1 μSv); however, in practice, this dose is not cumulative, as the potassium in foods is excreted in urine to maintain homeostasis. The BED is only meant as an educational exercise and is not a formally adopted dose measurement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose

>Thus, exposure from Chernobyl and Fukushima equates to 6,480,000,000,000 Banana Equivalent Doses ‒ that's 6.48 trillion bananas or, if you prefer, 6.48 terabananas or 6,480 gigabananas.

That’s irrelevant though, because Article 5 is within the framework of NATO itself. This resolution is a symbolic gesture but ultimately has no impact on NATO, whether the resolution is agreed to by the US senate or not. 

It is ultimately NATO and the impacted member states who would work together to decide on whether Article 5 should be invoked.

If Russia can engage the F-16 from a distance beyond the range of the F-16 and even before the F-16 actually can detect them on her radar, that's obviously a huge problem, even if we only talk about a handful of jets. The S-400 will be another huge challenge and generally, Russia has tons of AA.

I'm not saying that F-16s are completely useless, and they shouldn't be sent, btw. I'm just saying that the impact that they are going to have will be very limited. They most definitely won't be a total game changer, but they certainly could target Russia's rear more effectively, provided the West is willing to supply long-range missiles in an adequate number, and for now, sadly, it kind of seems that they're shying away from that. But if you believe that F-16s will be swarming in on the frontline and bombing the shit out of Russian positions... that's not going to happen.

Firstly NATO has had plenty of excuses to involve themselves if they wanted. Their goal throughout the entire war has been to avoid escalation and getting involved in the war directly.

In that respect I don't see how anythings changed.

Disregarding what two US politicians stated NATO doctrine suggests that article 5 can be invoked if the fallout causes direct harm to NATO members, but there is enough leeway there to argue the amount of harm any fallout could cause.

Also everyone on reddit is acting like if the reactor goes boom half the population of Europe are going to fall over dead from the fallout. 

That didn't happen with chernobyl and considering the fact that this power plant has been shut down for a while now the realistic damage would be far less. (at least the actual experts seem to think that the risk is more local than global). 

Unfortunately or not considering what we have seen so far from NATO I think people are getting over excited about the possible response to this, and the scope of it as a whole. 

Lastly as someone who lives in Poland, while there is for sure no love for Russia here, I don't see the political will to get involved in the war. Certainly not like everyone keeps saying.

They were practically an Axis power up to the very moment Operation Barbarossa was launched. To the extent that one of Churchill's plans for leveraging an Allied presence in Norway, had that misadventure panned out and France not fallen over the next two months, was for Allied forces to reinforce the Finns in battle against the Red Army.

Stalin went from trying to be as helpful as possible to Hitler, to crying about the need for a second front in Europe. Continuing to do so long past the point where the campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and in the skies over France and Germany, were distracting more than enough Axis personnel and equipment to constitute this second front in their own right.

It would be easy to undersell the impact of the air campaign, alone. As the daylight bombing raids of Germany continued to tie down vast numbers of the 88mm cannon that was so feared in the antitank role. Instead of laying in ambush for T-34s, these were blasting away almost uselessly at bomber formations, requiring 16,000 shells to be expended per B-17 or B-24 shot down by flak.

Then of course, there was the D-Day campaign, and the rout of the Germans from France. US forces already fighting in Germany by the end of the year. The doomed Wacht am Rhein operation for which the Germans stripped their defenses bare in parts of the Eastern Front to rush panzer divisions to the Ardennes.

Or for that matter the French soldiers who managed to hold the line against the Germans in parts of the front line, and still constituted a large and threatening fighting force that was ultimately sold out by the Third Republic's politicians, some of whom were rewarded with positions of power in the collaborationist Vichy government. This at the very moment the Wehrmacht were stretched beyond their supply lines and coming down off their weeks-long pervitin (basically meth) bender.

But I was focusing on the US Army's rapid advances specifically because it brings into stark contrast how complete the failure of the Russian army in Ukraine has been since February of 2022.

And capitalizing, in making this point, on the fact that casualty figures had, of course, eclipsed 230,000 by the end of 1944, but with *results.* The main belligerent, in something of a historical parallel, having their initial position of strength reversed to the point of seeing fighting in their own cities, kind of results.

Fair. None of us, especially me, know what we’re talking about.  

> Firstly NATO has had plenty of excuses to involve themselves if they wanted. Their goal throughout the entire war has been to avoid escalation and getting involved in the war directly.

True but nuclear is different. There is a taboo that can’t be broken without response. Allowing any use of nuclear as a weapon is a slippery slope. 

> Disregarding what two US politicians stated NATO doctrine suggests that article 5 can be invoked if the fallout causes direct harm to NATO members, but there is enough leeway there to argue the amount of harm any fallout could cause.

It’s not the Americans I’m thinking about. It’s Poland and Romania. Poland is looking for a reason. 

> Also everyone on reddit is acting like if the reactor goes boom half the population of Europe are going to fall over dead from the fallout.

> That didn't happen with chernobyl and considering the fact that this power plant has been shut down for a while now the realistic damage would be far less. (at least the actual experts seem to think that the risk is more local than global).


This is all 100% accurate. I don’t think it will be a massive nuclear explosion to be fair, but that thought is rampant and obnoxious here. I think there will be radioactive material that gets dispersed in the air just like with Chernobyl. I think if any of that touches Poland or Romania, it becomes an issue. 

> Unfortunately or not considering what we have seen so far from NATO I think people are getting over excited about the possible response to this, and the scope of it as a whole.

That’s a fair read. NATO has been reluctant. I just feel the use of nuclear as a weapon will elicit a large response regardless because allowing that precedent to be set is dangerous. 

> Lastly as someone who lives in Poland, while there is for sure no love for Russia here, I don't see the political will to get involved in the war. Certainly not like everyone keeps saying. Again everyone just jumps on the meme and soon it becomes 'reality'.

Wagner has never been a PMC. They’ve been operated that way but always under the control of the Russian military. Russia used them so they could maintain plausible deniability which is exactly what we’re talking about. And Russia definitely had stakes in Syria. 

And that doesn’t negate how the communications took place which is what the conversation is about. Like, do you think countries don’t lie to each other? I’m so confused what you think happens. Do you think they make a pinky promise to always tell the truth? No. 


What happens is China calls up Russia and says “Hey, are y’all going to blow up the plant?”

And Russia is like “No. Those are lies. We have intelligence the Ukrainians will.”

And China is like “Okay. If you blow it up and there’s proof, there will be consequences. “

And Russia is like “We definitely won’t do that. If it blows up, it will be Ukraine.”
