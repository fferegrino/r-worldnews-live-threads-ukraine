Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 13 September 2022

- Elements of the Russian forces withdrawn from Kharkiv Oblast over the last week were from the 1st Guards Tank Army (1 GTA), which are subordinate to the Western Military District (WEMD). 1 GTA suffered heavy casualties in the initial phase of the invasion and had not been fully reconstituted prior to the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv.

- 1 GTA had been one of the most prestigious of Russia's armies, allocated for the defence of Moscow, and intended to lead counter-attacks in the case of a war with NATO.

- With 1 GTA and other WEMD formations severely degraded, Russia's conventional force designed to counter NATO is severely weakened. It will likely take years for Russia to rebuild this capability.",False,1663048761.0,t3_xcxe2f,t3_xcxe2f,,0,148,0,148,0,0,

The Kherson attack was never a feint or a diversion, according to people briefed on the plan. And it has succeeded in forcing Moscow to delay sham votes on whether parts of the Kherson region want to join Russia. But, as expected, the counteroffensive is moving more slowly given the much higher number of Russian forces there compared with Kharkiv.

Eventually, Ukrainian officials believe their long-term success requires progress on the original goals in the discarded strategy, including recapturing the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, cutting off Russian forces in Mariupol and pushing Russian forces in Kherson back across the Dnipro River, American officials said.

Russia has been weakened. By failing to detect Ukraine’s buildup around Kharkiv, the Russian military has demonstrated incompetence and shown that it lacks solid intelligence. Its command and control have been decimated and it is having trouble supplying its troops, giving Ukraine an opening in the coming weeks, U.S. officials said.
While Ukraine may have an opportunity to recapture more territory in the east, U.S. and Ukrainian officials say the south is the most important theater of the war.

Day 202 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had no electricity in the morning again, but this time it wasn’t because of a new missile strike, it was to repair the damaged power lines. We had no electricity or water since 8am to 2pm, but after that districts started to have their electricity restored one by one, and around 8pm it was announced that the electricity was completely restored in Kharkiv and its oblast.

A “major win” for the Russians indeed, very worthy of celebrations, which is what Russians did, and it even made them forget about their losses for a bit. We were inconvenienced by not having electricity and water for the entire 16 hours total in 3 days. It was definitely worth wasting 100 million dollars in missiles to do this. They actually also fired 2 missiles at us today at 4:30pm, one of them fell in Belgorod as usual, and the second one was intercepted by our air defense, so we don’t know what they were aiming at this time.

Those dumbasses were actually thinking that by doing this, it would make us go and overthrow our government, because “they can’t even keep the electricity and water running”. I’m not even joking, that was literally what their propagandists said on their TV shows. They seriously think that by doing this, it would turn us against our government, and not against the people that fired the missiles that damaged our power plants in the first place? What kind of logic is that?

It was also hilarious seeing Russians get mad after one of their deputies said that they need to start full mobilization. It was also very predictable, they are only fine with this war until it actually affects them, and they are the ones that have to go fight and die. As expected the comments under that post were a mix of “fuck off”, “go fuck yourself”, “you first” and “you are the ones that started this war, so you go and fight in it”.

>Brutal realizations have been raining upon the Kremlin’s top propagandists—and when it rains, it pours. The same pundits who used to threaten NATO countries with nuclear strikes are begrudgingly acknowledging that Russia’s Armed Forces have suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in Ukraine.

>...

>Bogdan Bezpalko, member of the Council for Interethnic Relations under the President of the Russian Federation, was even more outspoken. “For two months, Ukrainian Armed Forces and military equipment have been massing in that area, all Telegram channels have been writing about it. Where was our damn reconnaissance? All of their heads should be laying on Putin’s desk, hacked off at the base... Of course, this is a tactical defeat. I hope it will be very sobering.”

>On Monday’s broadcast of The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, filmmaker Karen Shakhnazarov likewise dispensed a large dose of brutal honesty. “I urge everyone not to panic in the face of a defeat we’ve suffered in the Kharkiv region, and we have to acknowledge it,” he said. “A defeat has some meaning when you acknowledge it and draw new conclusions. And if you don’t acknowledge it, all you get is another defeat, perhaps even more devastating. This is a very difficult situation and we have to recognize that we’re battling a very powerful adversary.”

Note that both my family and friends are considered middle to higher class and live in either Kazan, Moscow or Petersburg (all 3 are wealthy cities).

&#x200B;

1. Family (50-90 y.o.) All family including pro-war vatnics like my father and grandfather and absolutely anti-war progressives like my mom and uncle (they are both ashamed and disgusted by the war) share the same - they don't notice any major changes to their lifestyles except grocery prices. All of them say that grocery prices increased about 10-20% in general, but nothing crucial.

At the same time, they still notice some inconveniences, for example, my mom and grandma went to Turkey this August, and instead of usual 3 hour flight they got 5 hours flight due to closure of Southern Russian air routes. Also, my mom loves Ikea and she is unable to go there now. Also, my dad (vatnic) reached out to me so I can ship him a new iPhone from Canada, to his surprise Apple left Russia.

&#x200B;

2. Friends (27 - 32 y.o.)All my friends are in their late 20s, early 30s. All my friends are absolutely against the war and feel depressed currently. They all feel sanctions higher than my family. Just some of the points which I discussed with them:

\- many of them love to travel, especially to Europe. Obviously they are not able to do it now, due to air restrictions and recently, due to visa restrictions.  
\- one of my closest friends said that the most severe consequence for him is the lack of clothes. Specifically Zara and H&M. These are one of many brands who fled Russia for good.  
\- Beer. No, really, beer. No Guinness, no Kilkenny in the pubs anymore. My friend claims there is still a good selection of Chezh beer, but no Irish classics.  
\- Little things like sports. We are all fans of EPL (English Premier League), and recently they cancelled their contract with Russian provider to cancel their streams.  
\- Movies. No cinema movies, no Netflix, nothing. Again, most of my friends are forced to pirate content now.  
\- \[BIG\] Money. One of my friends stopped investing in SP500 because of financial diifficulties. I don't know the details, but he is angry about that.  
\- Fastfood. Departure of MacDoanlds is not a huge blow, because Russian analog is presumably very similar (at least so far). Also they still have Burger King, KFC and Subway.  
\- iPhones. All my friends are Apple users and they overpay for Apple products on grey market.  


My thoughts overall. Unfortunately, in my experience sanctions mostly affect young folks who are already against the war. However, I think that sanctions will have more severe effect next year, so much so that every vatnic will feel them. Including my damn father (probably have to create a separate thread on challenges communicating with his vatnic soul after Feb 24).

P.S. Just for a full picture - I fled Russia in 2016 and I fully support Ukraine in Russian aggression.",1663058120.0,1663057590.0,t3_xcxe2f,t3_xcxe2f,,0,271,0,271,1,0,

**Government asks pilots to repair planes on their own**

> The Ministry of Industry and Trade believes that pilots should be able not only to fly aircraft, but also to repair them. A proposal to reconsider the approach to training pilots was made by the deputy head of the department, Oleg Bocharov, at the Eastern Economic Forum.
> 
> Together with the Ministry of Transport, we must train and certify pilots as universal fighters: they must simultaneously be both pilots and aircraft technicians. And the equipment should provide for the possibility of field repair in operation.
> According to Bocharov,  first of all, we are talking about pilots of regional aviation. For her, it is proposed to create a ""fundamentally new airworthiness maintenance system.""
> 
> Currently, the Ministry of Industry and Trade is working on bringing the Baikal small aircraft to the market, the creation of which in the basic configuration is planned to be completed in 2023. 
> 
> At the same time, the department launched a number of works that will allow improving the aircraft directly in operation, actually creating a designer from them. Bocharov explained that in this way, airlines, together with pilots, will be able to quickly upgrade the aircraft  for a flight - “transform it into a cargo, cargo-passenger or passenger configuration.”
> 
> In fact, at a new level, we are entering that same good old Soviet system, when more than 4,500 aircraft were operated in the USSR. This is a very serious challenge - no less serious than the MS-21 and Superjet programs.
> Oleg Prikhodko, vice-president of the Trade Union of Airmen of Russia, current pilot , believes that such a proposal cannot be implemented in practice, since pilots and technicians are two completely different professions.
> 
> According to him, now pilots are sometimes allowed to inspect the aircraft and do some simple work, but only after consulting with the engineers. “Full maintenance requires a separate education. So this proposal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade is unrealistic,” Prikhodko emphasized.
> 
> Earlier it was reported that in order to save money, the Ministry of Industry and Trade plans to replace the co-pilot in aircraft with a virtual one, despite the fact that this is contrary to international flight safety rules. 
> 
> Russian airlines also  advised  their pilots to use less brakes when landing and taxiing in order to conserve the resource of Western airliners, spare parts for which are not supplied due to sanctions.

I think that Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, dictator of Tunisia, is the example that Putin should fear most. I know that Qaddafi is the example that Putin actually fears the most, but that’s just because of how that ended. It’s how Tunisia started that he should worry about.


Ben Ali’s trouble didn’t start in the big city, in the capital. A street vendor in a small city protesting economic conditions and local corruption set the ball rolling towards his ouster. 



Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire and set off protests in the town of Sidi Bouzid. The heavy-handed response by the Ben Ali regime sparked way way more protests until they spread to the capital, where more heavy-handedness only made things worse and worse. The rest, as they say, is history.



The inherent flaw in tyrannical regimes is that they don’t handle setbacks well, economic setbacks, military setbacks, any kind of setback. They can survive poverty, as long as the poverty stays roughly the same. Ask Fidel. But take a big step back? Things can go from street-vendor holding a one-man protest to fleeing for your life to Saudi Arabia in the blink of an eye.

The only way to put the screws to Putin and his regime was to stand together. Given how many countries there are in this world, that is an extremely hard thing to do.

https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine/status/1569710242933383173

>Satellite imagery of known Russian positions in Kyselivka, 15 kilometers northwest of Kherson, shows that all but four Russian vehicles have departed from previous forward positions, consistent with rumors that the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR) troops have abandoned Kyselivka and moved back towards the Dnipro River.

>Kyselivka is an operationally significant location for Russian forces around Kherson because it is the last major settlement along both the E58 highway and a railway line between current Ukrainian positions and Chornobaivka, the outermost suburb of Kherson.

>The apparent withdrawal of Russian troops from this position may compromise the Russians’ ability to defend the northwestern outskirts of Kherson and suggests that Russian troops in this area perceive an imminent threat to their positions.

>Spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command, Natalya Humeniuk, stated on Sept. 12 that Russian forces located along the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast are attempting to negotiate for surrender under the auspices of international law.

>Ukrainian operations in Kharkiv Oblast are unlikely to have had such a dramatic psychological effect on Russian troops this far south, and both the withdrawal of troops from forward positions in Kyselivka and reports of surrender negotiations are indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south are progressing in a significant way, even if visibility on this axis is limited by the shift in focus to Kharkiv.

>The success of recent Ukrainian counteroffensive operations may be impacting the will or ability of the Russian military command to use newly formed volunteer units in Ukraine in a timely fashion. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the Russian military command has suspended sending new, already-formed units to Ukraine due to recent Russian losses and widespread distrust of the Russian military command, factors which have caused a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse to participate in combat.

>This assessment is still unconfirmed, but low morale due to Ukrainian counteroffensive success may prove devastating to the Kremlin’s already-poor ability to generate meaningful combat capability. The deployment of these newly formed units to reinforce defensive lines against Ukrainian counteroffensives would be an operationally-sound decision on the part of Russian military leadership; and the delay or potential suspension of these deployments will afford Ukrainian troops time to consolidate and then resume the offensive.

>Other key takeaways of the report are as follows:

>Russian forces are failing to reinforce the new frontline following Ukrainian gains in eastern Kharkiv Oblast and are actively fleeing the area or redeploying to other sections of the front;

>Ukrainian forces continued targeting Russian military assets and positions in Kherson Oblast, likely steadily degrading them;

>The Ukrainian recapture of Izyum has likely degraded Russian forces’ ability to conduct artillery strikes along the Izyum-Slovyansk highway;

>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP);

It will lose its visible boundaries and potential predictability for the parties to the conflict. It will follow its own military scenario, involving new participants. This has always been the case.

And then Western countries will not be able to sit back in their clean houses and apartments, laughing at how they are carefully weakening Russia with the hands of others. Everything will go up in flames around them. Their people will suffer a lot. The ground will literally burn and the concrete will melt. It's going to hit us hard, too. It will be very, very bad for everyone. It is said, ""By these three plagues, by fire and smoke and brimstone, which came out of their mouths, a third of all men died"" (Rev. 9:18).

But meanwhile, short-sighted politicians and their dim-witted thinkers, thoughtfully twisting a glass of wine in their hands, are speculating about how they can get rid of us without going to direct war. Dull, classically educated idiots.""

>In this context, Russian President Vladimir Putin also reported on the practical steps Moscow is prepared to take to reduce tensions between Armenians and Azeris.

>""The mediation efforts of the Russian Federation aimed at stabilizing the situation in the region were fully supported,"" the CSTO General Secretariat concluded.

>Hostilities between the two countries lasted six weeks and left thousands dead. They finally ceased when the two countries reached a Russian-brokered cease-fire agreement allowing Russian peacekeepers to settle in Nagorno-Karabakh for a period of five years.

0b58cb2d682183f3fae378214a35749f,xcxe2f,io8ofaw,">🧵 Armenia being attacked today and some responses in the West are shockingly embarrassing, with condescending tweets saying “no one has time” for the conflict there; the attacks on Armenia were driven by impunity for invasions such as Afrin, it’s all connected. One can’t say that to Armenia that we shouldn’t focus on a conflict there because it might take away from coverage of Ukraine; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was fueled by the impunity given to Turkey and also the fact no one stopped the war in Nagorna-Karabakh.

>The impunity means that you can’t just focus on one conflict and be condescending to others. Each person is equal. Attacks on Kurds in Afrin in 2018, or Armenians driven from their homes in 2020; or the horrid invasion of Ukraine are linked. Conflicts should not be a hobby of western commentators and those suffering should be treated with respect. Armenia deserves the same respect.

>This depiction of the conflict as some “old” problem conjures up the bad narratives on conflicts in the Middle East as “ancient hatreds”…and that rhetoric was mistakenly used by past US administrations. When ISIS was committing genocide it wasn’t some “ancient hatred”, it was a modern genocide against Yazidis; there were victims and perpetrators. Western converts who joined ISIS were not acting out an “ancient” conflict, they were colonizing and attacking the vulnerable

>The conflict in the Caucasus are not some ancient thing; they are driven by modern day events; there is a reason the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has increased more recently because of a belief that the US-led world order won’t step in to stop it. That is why Ankara fuels the conflict. And Ankara state media pushes the propaganda

>It’s important to see Moscow’s role also. These are not just random conflicts, they are part of the wider picture of the war in Syria, the impunity for the Syrian regime, Iran’s attacks on the Gulf; Ankara’s invasions of Syria; Ankara in Iraq; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

>One should not look away or pretend they can’t understand the conflict or don’t care; it’s worth caring and having respect for Armenia and also Azerbaijan; and caring about the people and history. Not just saying “this gets in the way of my morning coffee”. Commentators do best when they treat others as equals and treat victims of conflict as equals, not when war is a PR game for them for retweets and they mock come countries.

>Lack of caring is why not enough was done to help Afrin and prevent ethnic cleansing. Not enough people spoke up and that helped fuel Moscow’s belief no one would care about Ukraine. As students of history know, one has to stop the aggressors before they invade, like stopping fascism at Munich; not waiting until 1939. A serious discussion would look also at the SCO meeting this week as context

It’s from a Ukrainian (or possibly russian living in Ukraine), somewhat neutral on the war but leaning towards supporting Ukraine, strangely enough.

He claims that russian retreat was “a deal”.

TLDR: Deal between Putin and Biden so Biden stays in power, while Putin gaining… well they didn’t specify.

Because of course when you make a deal you also leave a couple hundreds units of armor while losing a couple hundred soldiers as POW and three times more killed. 

Because of course putin wants Biden to stay in power at all cost and wouldn’t mind losing an entire front for it.

A point I’ve been making is that, in the midst of all this euphoria, we should not lose sight of the fact the war is still on. Thankfully, if what little we know of the Ukrainian command is correct, they haven’t lost sight of this. 

A real concern is one expressed by the Ukrainian Defence Minister: Ukraine must be wary and watch for any signs that Russia is organizing a counter-attack. The Ukrainians may be somewhat ground down and disorganized by success. There may be opportunities for Russia here - if they have anything that can take advantage of them. 

Social media has been exuberant, as one would expect, and predicting a quick downfall for Russia. That may well happen. However, the Ukrainians cannot count on it, and apparently, the Ukrainian command is not succumbing to ‘victory disease’ (underestimating an enemy because you just beat them like a drum). Russia is still very dangerous despite all of the obvious problems they have and defeats they have suffered and I worry that everyone predicting Russia’s fall will turn just as quickly to doom and gloom if Ukraine suffers a reverse on the battlefield. 

Personally, I think the Russians are pretty well done, I find it hard to see how they can come back from this - but unless their morale collapses utterly, or there is a coup, it may be months and much destruction before they are driven out of Ukraine for good. 

That said, the Ukrainians are wise to keep careful watch on their enemy. While the Ukrainian counter offensive was a magnificent feat of arms, one for the history books, this isn’t over until the last Russian is forcefully shown the border.",False,1663084906.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_io9q8d3,,1,39,0,39,0,0,

Kyiv, the capital, despite being quite old, was literally wiped out in mid-1200s, so almost nothing left. There are reconstructed [Golden Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate,_Kyiv), and the cave monastery [Lavra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv_Pechersk_Lavra) is very much worth the visit; there's a huge collection os Scythian art, including the legendary [Tovsta Mohyla pectoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Pectoral_from_Tovsta_Mohyla), which stays in its own room in the museum. [Saint Sophia cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia_Cathedral,_Kyiv) is also impressive, with preserved early medieval frescoes. Also there are many pretty places all over the city, the river Dnipro is absolutely enormous and hard to imagine. The food is hearty, with lots of meat and cream. But the transport infrastructure is bad, the subway is noisy and crowded, and the bus/tram network is shit. 

The west is typical central European: Lviv, Krakow, Prague, you know the vibe. The region was a periphery for a long time, with all good and bad results: not very many impressive buildings, but the existing ones are preserved intact because no one had money to reconstruct them in more fashionable way. On the other hand, many places are in disarray.

The south is flat; the beaches are similar to Bulgarian ones, but the climate is a bit worse. 

Crimea is barren, apart from the southern coast, where there are mountains and a narrow strip of almost subtropical climate.

The German government eventually canceled the contract in 2014 because Russia invaded Crimea, but Rheinmetall had almost finalized the project at that point.

>The company has repeatedly said that sanctions against Russia would not have a major impact on its business because the combat training centre, its only major contract with the country, has been largely delivered and paid for.

>Germany’s Sueddeutsche newspaper said the combat training centre, which was to be built in the town of Mulino in the Volga region and was expected to go into service this year, could train 30,000 soldiers a year on high-tech simulators.

Or maybe Crimea is a soft underbelly because they’ve moved everything out of the rest of the front?

Russia would be better off with a large mobile reserve.  When the UA attacks again it could break through but then be met by the reserve.  The reserve would patch the hole in the line keeping the line from collapsing.

It's not necessarily corruption.

Prior to 2014, Germany had a very practical relationship with Russia - Germany is a machine that drinks in gas and shits out cars, and Russia helped fuel a lot of it. Historically, Germany sits precariously between its ancient rival France on the one side, and the sprawl of Russian-influenced eastern Europe on the other. When France and Russia team up against them, Germany gets screwed, so Germany's chief foreign policy goal is to maintain strong economic and cordial diplomatic ties with both, while avoiding even the perception that they are looking to re-arm. That is, Germany may be a peaceful economic powerhouse now, but Europe remembers that it took less than 6 years from the moment the Nazis rose to power and began re-arming in the open until the invasion of Poland. They do not want to their uncontested peaceful economic dominance of Europe to be jeopardized by the hint of militarization.

The weight of that geopolitical imperative means that many want the 2013 status quo back.

Depends on the natural resource you are thinking about. There's a big natural gas and some smaller oil fields under Donbas/Luhansk all the way to the black sea. There are some other resources in the ground there (iron, some coal and some rare earth if I remember correctly). They've not yet liberated that part completely.

I think one of the main reasons for russian aggression here is, that they're fucking scared for their economy. If Ukraine was able to utilize the gas fields on its territory, it would directly threaten russian gas exports to EU (which make up more than 50% of their GDP I think). And since Ukraine did a nice little shift away from russia and towards EU (see EuroMaidan protests / government change in 2014), this was suddenly very realistic and partly led to occupation of Crimea.

Osa - a wasp

Strela - arrow

Iskander - some bullshit too, sounds decent though

There’s a Kamaz Mustang

There’s also a thing called “belgianka” - the belgian girl.

There’s a thing called “zhuk” - bug, meteorite, TERMINATOR, “dozor” - the watch (as in night’s watch), panther, bobcat, POVOZKA - A FUCKING HORSE CARRIAGE

And, of course, the FUCKING ZOO. (Zoopark) - would be funny if it was the name of their main troops transport, but no

So, looking at this, we're not talking about airliners or any kind of jets, we're talking about a propeller driven successor to the An-2, and thinking about rural bush pilots anywhere in the world, actually, yeah, it didn't used to be that unusual that they *did* effect basic repairs on their own, indeed most often they had to if they didn't want to walk or die.

I mean, we're talking about the ""golden ages"" of bush flying, so the barnstorming era between the wars, and the postwar era up to the late 60s, where cheap surplus trainer planes like Cubs (in the States and Canada) and Tiger Moths or Austers (in the UK/Europe/Australia) made their owner/operator pilots a living, flying long hours solo and being self-sufficient, including them doing their own repairs and their plane often being their accommodation. The USSR kept this model way longer than the West, with An-2 pilots still plying a similar trade in Warsaw Pact countries and friends, specifically their African allies/satellites, well into the 80s.

What this says to me is that Russia looks to go back to that model, which means, reading between the lines, that they are no longer able to build those components which made self-repair impossible - electronics. Expect to see new Russian bush planes being built in 2023 with no GPS, no glass cockpit, no EFI, but a map, analog electromechanical gauges, and a carbureted engine.

The gas and rare earth minerals in the East, water for Crimea, trying to incorporate the power grid into their own system before the war even finished. Most all, it’s about people.

They thought they could assimilate the Ukrainian population to offset Russian ethnic decline. Failing that I’ve heard they’ve specifically been trying to send non-Russian minorities to fight so as to lessen their numbers since they can’t bolster their own.

Because Russia as we know it today is an artificial state of sorts, an ethnic supremacist empire formed after European Russia conquered east, colonized, and forcefully assimilated everyone there. They’re held together by sheer force and societal momentum. This is why Moscow is the center of everything to a bizarrely excessive degree. Why the Kremlin is obsessed with saving face even if it requires obvious lying. It’s about power and dominance. Their government does not hold authority through a legit social contract with the people, but through fear and violence.

The moment ethnic Russians become a minority east of the Urals, as projected sooner than later, will be the moment these places ask why they’re still reporting to Moscow, still speaking Russian over their native tongue, and most importantly, what exactly is Russia and why?

Or so the Kremlin certainly believes, based at least partly in the experience of the USSR’s brief liberalization allowing many nations to break away. Nations Russia had every intention to assimilate fully but hadn’t finished to varying degrees. As the USSR was in truth, just a convoluted continuation of the Russian empire. Ukraine was perhaps the most far along, that’s why half the population speaks Russian.

It’s not all that dissimilar to the dynamics of the situations of white domination of parts of Africa and America. When their ethnic dominance wanes, the whites react like a chicken with its head cut off. Are their fears justified? No, but it does change things, South Africa and America today are not the same nations that practiced slavery and apartheid. Just as Russia will not be the nation that conquered and holds hegemony over so much of Eurasia by force.

Thus they’re a sort of artificial status quo state trying to keep conditions just right for their continuation.",1663060498.0,1663060277.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_io8chd7,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

But what amuses me even more, is that he doesn't understand what is needed here in the first place: Professional Western combat soldiers aren't all ""special forces"", they're more akin to  technicians who can work specific functions with different tools, but even grasping that is too ""Western special forces army that is outnumbered"" for him.

So all in all he doesn't understand what they themselves have, what his enemy has, what is needed to defeat them, and he is outright arguing to return to an even more oversized and less modern military that probably depends on mass infantry attacks behind a rolling artillery barrage. With his state-of-the-art thinking (for 1915) he seems perfectly qualified to become the next Russian minister for defense.",1663076457.0,1663072232.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_io8jzun,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

I'm kind of rusty on this, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a typical QR link is just an encoded URL.  If followed, a phone would send a request to a website which would then have the phone's IP address and some metadata (which could reveal some location data).  The website might be able to [request geolocation data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) from the phone, but most browsers would prompt the user and ask if they really want the website to have access to their location data.

So, a Russian soldier would have to voluntarily allow the website access to their location data, I think.

People have been dogwhistling about NATO jets since the start of the war. It isn’t helpful, and suggests that people really don’t understand the challenges of introducing a totally new airframe even at the best of times.

Every time F-16 training gets brought up, advocates have tried to downplay the difficulty of the process by saying that you can just crosstrain experienced fighter pilots so that you only have to update them on the differences. How many of those does Ukraine actually have? Well, prior to the war they only had 83 dedicated fighter airframes but that isn’t the answer - air forces rarely have exactly one pilot per aircraft. So where else can we look for a clue? Well, 54 pilots were reported to be given “specific meteorological training” about 15 years ago, and in 2007 only 45 simulated air-to-air launches occurred in the country’s largest ever air exercise to date. So we don’t really know how many pilots they started with, but it’s probably in the dozens. We can’t include Antonov and Tupolev pilots because we’re talking about experienced fighter pilots, and the same probably applies to Sukhoi 25 pilots because they’re CAS airframes - not all of them even have a radar. 

So how many are still alive? Ukraine’s been fighting for seven months and we know a number of their pilots have been killed. Oryx reports 11 MiG-29s and 4 Su-27s destroyed in flight, although the number is likely higher because of the controlled information space relating to Ukrainian losses. Not all of those pilots will have survived in good enough health to keep fighting. So we have to guess that at least a dozen are at risk of having been casualties, and probably double that or more.

So at this point, we have maybe 50 pilots remaining? At most? It’s uncertain, but that’s probably a reasonable answer. Now we have another challenge: every pilot who leaves the country for training is completely unavailable to an airforce that is *still fighting a war*. That’s a real problem because every remaining pilot has to fill their boots in the workload. During operational pauses that might be okay, but when the tempo increases that means pilots will be flying more and more flight hours, and fatiguing more quickly. Piloting a fighter is physically demanding and requires rest, and missions are intermittent and unpredictable in nature. All of those contribute to the need to spread the workload between pilots to avoid them ending up like the Russian Sukhoi 25 pilot who famously killed himself on takeoff this week.

So the simple answer is, Ukraine probably has either no experienced pilots, or a very, very small number, available. They’re at war. This is to be expected. They’ll get their jets at some point, but they still have a war to fight with the jets they have right now, which have clearly shown themselves to be at least adequate for the task.",False,1663100880.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_ioaw37y,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

While true, it's important to remember the geometry of the situation. Ukraine is on the ""inside"", so they have a shorter distance to cover between the two furthest points along the front. Russia has a much longer path between the two ends, so even with a sizable mobile force, they'd have to distribute it around for it to be within useful range of what the Ukrainians get up to.

Worse for Russia, Ukraine has virtually live satellite reconnaissance to rely on for figuring out where Russia is moving, but Russia doesn't. They only have film cannisters dropped from their satellites every month or so, or the rare drone flight that isn't shot down.

The nonbinding resolution, which was supported by 100 United Nations member states, affirmed the General Assembly's commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 Crimean referendum. Eleven nations voted against the resolution, while 58 abstained, and a further 24 states were absent when the vote took place.

The tenth paragraph of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution of 2 March 2022 confirmed the involvement of Belarus in unlawful use of force against Ukraine. The resolution was sponsored by 96 countries, and passed with 141 voting in favour, 5 against, and 35 abstentions.

Saddam Hussein's army was definitely the largest and most fearsome in the region, by far.  They were defeated in 3 weeks by Coalition forces - who suffered only very light casualties.

It's a very dumb comparison.  Did Coalition forces have trouble with the multiple insurgencies that popped up afterwards? Yes.  And even most armchair generals (including newsmedia pundits) knew that the Coalition had obviously not flowed enough forces in to SECURE Iraq.  (same political stupid move Putin is making today - out of fear of being perceived a warmonger by his own people: Bush faced the same problem, and made the same stupid decision). Ultimately, this was a political problem: the conservative ideology says that it's better to lie to the people, than it is to try to convince them with a weak truth.

The lie was that Saddam had WMDs.

The TRUTH was that Saddam was a threat to US allies in the region, and was functionally a Russian Proxy.  (and no; it was not about OIL, because if it was, you would have seen BP and Shell rolling in there, setting up wells and shipping out oil by the tankerfull, and that NEVER happened - in fact, during Trump's reign, those oil resources were handed over to Rosneft. Like, the week before Manafort was arrested, he was over there, ""arranging"" this.)

The Bush administration had lied so much, and had such little political capital (other than 9/11), that they probably knew they'd fail to convince the American people to stop the threat of the Hussein regime. So they made up the bullshit 9/11 and WMDs lies and pushed those.   THAT was the conservative strategic blunder.

Additionally, the authoritarianism is definitely a factor in Russia's downfall. It fosters nepotism by rewarding those who are loyal rather than those who excel, reducing the quality of leadership. Also, if you look at one of the core problems of the Russian army, you see that they are run in an exceedingly top down and centralized manner. Decisions are made away from the battlefield driven by political goals rather than achievable military aims. The result is an army that cannot react or think on it's feet, and they are given the constant run around by the Ukrainians because of this.

So as a whole, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if these issues Russia has are mirrored to a degree in the Chinese army, and that these are a logical result of the form of government that is in use.

It certainly could have made the Kerch bridge inoperable, and it could have interdicted Russia commerce and military vessels all along the Black Sea. It could cut off water to Crimea.  


So imagine you are Russia. You have taken Crimea, but its usefulness in the event of a war is at great risk. So what do you need? You need to create a buffer. You need to create a secondary route to Russia that doesnt rely on a single bridge. You need to secure the water supply. 

And you want to do it semi-legally. Do like Crimea and hold oblast wide referenda that will (in your eyes) legitimize your annexations. So you've got to take Kherson, Zaphorizhzhia, and Donetsk oblasts in their entireity. To take Donetsk its best to control the routes in from the north (in Kharkiv Oblast) and Luhansk. 

The easiest way to do that is to get a government in Ukraine that would just give you that land. That failed when Kyiv held. If that doesnt work you want to take the whole black sea coast, which would cripple Ukraine economically and make them unable to fight back. That failed too.  


Now, due to man and material constraints they had to make a choice between beefing up Kherson (which supplies water to Crimea and could later act again as a launch pad for westward attacks) and beefing up Kharkiv (which is basically just providing a shortcut for transportation of goods and men from Russia to the Donetsk front line at this point).

Ukraine could try them under Ukrainian law. Ukraine recently recruited a large number of foreign fighters.  More importantly consider the motives.  Following standard POW treatment encourages them to surrender.

Fair enough. Though if the discussion now is about Russia's intentions towards Germany, at this point they'd prefer the 2013 status quo, too (which is why they're keen to use Nordstream I as a reminder of their half of the deal).

Russia had apparently made the calculation that invading Ukraine would not affect the pragmatic economic relationship with Germany. I mean, if China could throw millions in concentration camps and still not face sanctions from western trading partners, why should Russia fear any significant consequences from acting on what they considered an internal matter in their ""near abroad"", especially given the muted response to Crimea?

Russia's argument to Germans, which they hoped would be a winning one, is that Eastern Ukraine is far away from Berlin, outside of the EU and NATO, and  overall none of their concern. Furthermore, that a faction of hawkish western policy makers had sleepwalked them into a confrontation with Russia by using Ukraine as a wedge, which they are trying to rebuke. And once resolved, security, diplomatic, and economic relations between Russia and the German people could be even better, not worse.

They were, to put it mildly, extremely wrong about how receptive the majority of Germans would be to that. Though doubtless there are some who agree - and while they would look dourly and mournfully at Russia's treatment of Ukraine, they would bury their misgivings as they have with countless other bad actors on the world stage over the decades.

But the point being, Russia did not invade Ukraine as a declaration of war against Germany. They had hoped that, at worst, economic pragmatism (and/or leverage) would give them free reign. Oops.",1663092201.0,1663089519.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_ioa3dhs,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

From a Quora thread on the subject:

>Is it true that the Abrams’ gas turbine is very inefficient?
> 
> Unfortunately yes. The Abrams is notoriously fuel-inefficient compared to other Western MBTs equipped with diesel engines.
> 
> For example, Sweden conducted comparative tests of the Leopard 2 and the M1A1 Abrams during the MBT 2000 program in 1984. During those tests, the M1A1 had a fuel consumption of 14.7 l/km (3,820km traveled at the cost of 56,488 litres of fuel). Meanwhile, the Leopard 2 had a fuel consumption of barely 7.2 l/km (3,730km traveled at the cost of 26,874 litres of fuel). In other words, the Abrams consumed twice as much fuel as the Leopard 2 to cover the same distance.
> 
> 
> Leopard 2 TVM Max, the tank which won the MBT 2000 competition to become the new MBT of the Swedish Army (as the Stridsvagn 122).
> 
> In addition, keep in mind that the Abrams runs on JP-8, which is the standard jet fuel used by the US Military. In 2014, the US military spent 3.73$/gallon for JP-8 compared to 2.51$/gallon for diesel.

That's not to mention that aside from the price of fuel, the availability on the battlefield must be met, and that's why logistics are so important in war.

America could send over gobs of Abrams tanks, but could Ukraine even keep them running?

I read the Leopard tanks have a range of like 400 miles to the Abram's 100 (over flat terrain, it was closer over rough ground).

Created to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Gundam, it is also loosely based on the 14th century Chinese historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong.

The overthrow of the popular and briefly Fretilin-led government sparked a violent quarter-century occupation in which between approximately 100,000–180,000 soldiers and civilians are estimated to have been killed or starved to death.

Then you wrote a whole argument. 

>The last hyperinflatory economies in Europe was Soviet prior to becoming the superpower it became, Germany in the decades prior to the second world war, France right before Napoleon.

Are you saying Turkey will soon be overtaken by an ultranationalist expansionist movement and try to conquer Europe before collapsing miserably?

But regardless, your statement is both false and misleading. It's a joke if you think Europe has had 3 hyperinflationary economies total since 1790.

All 3 states you mentioned had been superpowers already, and had minor blips in the middle which led to massive upheaval. Then they all expanded on borrowed time before finally collapsing and never rising again to the level which they had reached. 

Let's talk about lesser known but more relevant cases of hyperinflation. Like Yugoslavia. Which broke down to civil war after two years of hyperinflation. 

Another was Hungary, which if you'll pay attention and notice, is not a major power. 


>I would say the track record of inflation being a huge hurdle to becoming a major player in international security is lacking a lot of foundation in history

Yeah, like the ones I mentioned. 

Also, if you think Turkey with its minor landmass and no sizable navy can ever play a major part in *international* security, i have some prime green land in the Sahara to sell you. 

>You ofc know these things, you are sure inflation will cripple any nation for almost a century atleast.

Century? Nah. A few decades, easy.  

A nation about to subsist on American, European and Chinese handouts cannot be a great power. Especially in a post nuclear world, as a nation with no nuclear weapons. 

Inflation kills economies. Dead economies ruin nations. Ruined nations cannot be great powers. 

By the time Turkey manages to fight off inflation, other players will already have surpassed it.",1663063681.0,1663063440.0,t3_xcxe2f,t1_io8k5m7,,5,0,0,0,0,0,
