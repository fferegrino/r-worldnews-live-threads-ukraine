1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,12utzov,jhaycp2,"Last year an anonymous American bequeathed a million-dollar inheritance to Zaluzhny, who then donated it to the Armed Forces.  Ukrainians were very curious about this mysterious benefactor. [*Ukrainska Pravda* featured who he was, why was Zaluzhny his heir, why he cared about Ukraine, and did he donate to anyone else.](https://life-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/society/2023/04/22/253945/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en), as told by his best friend, his daughter, and the estate attorney. 



- Gregory Stepanets, who died in October, was born in Vinnytsia in 1938, the only child of a Ukrainian father and Jewish mother and lived there till 18.   He was close to his many cousins, who—due to occupation and later USSR resettlements—lived in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine.

- At 18, he moved to Moscow. He obtained several post-graduate degrees in Moscow, and throughout the 70s, worked in Moscow as a senior systems programmer, but was **later targeted by the KGB due to his support of dissidents, culminating in one job termination**. (He then worked with early IBM computers in Moscow, and would be sent abroad for training—he learned English, German, and Italian, in addition to his Ukrainian and Russian.)

- In mid 1980s, he was able to emigrate to Israel with his [Russian] wife and daughter, due to his heritage.  He could then emigrate to America but only as a single man—he then divorced, emigrated, Soviet collapsed, so then wife visited and remarried. His best friend—who he’d known since the 1960s in Moscow—also came to Seattle.

- He got a job at Microsoft in Seattle—always used public transportation, lived meager housing—his wealth/success was not observable—in fact, he held a patent, which he then sold to Microsoft.  This was only learned by his best friend after death. He worked there over 30 years, retiring at 81, due to cancer.

- He fought cancer for 3 years, but spent all his retirement creating his own absolutely enormous garden, so large that could hike, and his friends would get lost. He filled it with horticulture, cultivated it, it was his retirement passion.

- Then Russia invaded.  It’s implied that he wanted to go to his homeland, but by then, he was weak from cancer.  His daughter Milana says then became obsessed with listening to the news from the front, and did everything in his power to assure that Ukraine would win. His health failed, but then his wife started having heart problems. She died in October, he died next day.  

- He told his daughter how he wanted to leave his fortune.  All heirs were surprised. He left 1 million to the Israeli military, in honor of his Jewish mother.  

- He left one million to General Zaluzhny. 

> in conversations with his daughter, Gregory emphasized that ""Zaluzhny knows what to do with the inheritance.""

> > My father respected General Zaluzhny very much, admired him, considered him a great patriot of Ukraine, and the architect of the entire military campaign.

> > My father dreamed of a free, independent, economically strong, democratic and prosperous Ukraine,"" says Milana. 

Indeed, when he received it, [General Zaluzhny told the NYT,](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/01/24/7386365/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en) ""I gave my whole life to the Armed Forces. And I had no doubts about what I should do with the inheritance. The last will of Mr. Gregory, apparently, was to support the Ukrainian army through me personally. I am grateful to everyone who helps the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And I am grateful to my family for their understanding.""

- Cultural education was also important to him. He bequeathed $2 million to the [Kyiv-Mohyla National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy), a research university, 
- and another 2 million to the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv [which was created in Soviet times and known as hallmark of Ukrainian language]


> > ""My father told me about the systematic suppression of the Ukrainian language by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. He said that in the 1950s there was only one Ukrainian-language [primary] school in Vinnytsia. He believed that education is extremely important for the future economic growth of Ukraine, so he wanted to support the development of culture and language, which, in his opinion, are the basis of national identity,"" adds Milana. 

- he also bequeathed undisclosed amounts to the members of the Kozatska Choir, who perform Ukrainian works from different eras: the Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. Milana says that her father really liked these songs. 

> > ""He greatly appreciated the contribution of Taras Kompanichenko and Khoreya Kozatska to the development of Ukrainian musical culture and listened to their songs every day,"" the daughter adds.",1682191398.0,1682191006.0,t3_12utzov,t3_12utzov,,0,165,0,165,2,0,

🔹 The politician said that on the eve of the NATO PA meeting in May this year, Ukrainian parliamentarians, together with their European colleagues, are preparing a resolution on Ukraine's future place in the Alliance.

""We are now trying to engage the NATO PA as much as possible to support the resolution, which should expand the political decisions to be made during the Vilnius Summit. We call on Poland to support us as much as possible on this platform,"" the MP said.""

So I might garner some downvotes with the following, but I feel that a southern drive to cut off the land bridge to Crimea is perhaps too ambitious. It's too obvious and the Russians have had ample time to create defences there. Instead I think a more limited offensive is better. Yet I understand that the offensive should yield proper results, not only on a military level but also on a political level. Therefore today my mind concocted a concept of an offensive taking place at Bakhmut. Not necessarily directly in Bakhmut but on the wings. If the Russians were to completely pushed back from Bakhmut (and perhaps more), that would be a huge morale hit on the Russians. Russia has been hyping up Bakhmut way too much (if you read their propaganda you see they think capturing Bakhmut would open the road all the way to the Dnipro). Without Bakhmut (and Soledar) Russia has absolutely nothing to show for, for the last year. Bakhmut incidentally is at the place where Wagner and the conventional Russian army meet, and Wagner takes great ""pride"" in their ""work"" at Bakhmut. Undoing that would further strain the relation between Wagner and the conventional Russian army, and create further morale issues and infighting. Thus it would not only yield military results (easing the Donetsk frontline) but also political results (creating morale issues and infighting for Russia). 

I understand that a large part of the Russian army is at Bakhmut, so perhaps Ukraine could draw away some of it with a feint to the south. 

Again, I completely concocted this idea while I have zero military experience and I absolutely shouldn't be taken serious in this regard. See this  more as a little bit of wild airmchair general thinking. I am more interested in what you guys have to say about it and why a drive to the south would be better.",False,1682164554.0,t3_12utzov,t3_12utzov,,0,-31,0,-31,0,0,

> Russia has 110 official billionaires in the list, up 22 from last year, according to Forbes' Russian edition, which said their total wealth increased to $505 billion from $353 billion when the 2022 list was announced.

So, when the list was made in Feb 2022 there were 22 less (so 88) billionaires worth $353 billion.

Now (presumably in 2023) there are 110 people on the list and their total worth is $505 Billion.

In 2022 the average wealth of the listed individuals was about $4 billion.

In 2023 the average wealth of these individuals is about. $4.6 billion.

But…

> the total wealth of Russia's billionaires was $606 billion in 2021, before the war began.

If there was 88 billionaires, their average wealth was much higher at almost $7 billion each in 2021z

Either way, these numbers seem to more reflect a rapid Re-distribution of wealth, possibly the spouses and family members. I presume to avoid sanctions.

My guess is there are some spouses would have suddenly become billionaires.

But, what is not mentioned that the early Soviet era missiles only have a range of 75km, some only 45km. Kharkiv is really the only city that is range of these older missiles when launched from Russia.  

When you build a surface-to- air missile there is a trade off between speed, range, and warhead size.  It was not until the 1990’s that Russia started building longer range and faster S-300’s with smaller warheads.  

The older S-300’s had a 150kg warhead.  The newer and faster long range ones have about a 24kg warhead.  It takes accuracy not a big boom to shoot down a jet fighter.  I doubt that Russia is willing to use expensive newer S-400 missiles with a 400km range to blow up someones house if Lviv. But, anything is possible. 

Kharkiv is about 40km from the Russian border, and about 75km from Belgorod.  They would have to move the launchers to the west of Belgorod to hit Kharkiv with these older S-300s.

It did seem like Megaupload was doing the minimum it's lawyers said it needed to be compliant (probably given they were completely aware of what users mainly used the site for) and authorities disagreed that it was sufficient. 

 It was kind of like when Facebook breached Irish data protection laws, except instead of being fined, Mark Zuckerberg gets an arrest warrant issued and then SWAT raids his property in the US and arrest him so that he can be extradited to Ireland and all of Facebook's servers are confiscated and taken offline until the trial.

Probably the worst-case for Russian morale is VK and Telegram being full of images of people fleeing Crimea as they fear it's about to be cut off; lots of even ultranationalist Russians are decidedly meh about annexing the Donbas, Zaporizhia and Kherson, but lots of non-ultranationalists genuinely think Crimea to be Russian territory. If anything is likely to topple Putin in the near term, it'd be that. But I think it'd be folly to attack towards Melitopol for the purpose of trying to cause that effect, which is far from guaranteed to work as you'd hope or expect (what if someone worse than Putin seizes the reins?

Ukraine has further the complete backing of the west, economically and military. The idea that the West would back out if the coming Ukrainian offensive is not decisive is dangerous: this war will likely not end this year, and continue for longer, as say many military experts. Therefore the West needs to make sure to Russia that it will back Ukraine no matter what. Else Ukraine might think it needs to make a desperate gamble.

Russia does have the larger manpower pool and a large reserve of vehicles and artillery, but economically the (long-term) situation does not seem favourable to Russia. While the West can still make advanced vehicles and ammonution, this is way more difficult for Russia considering the sanctions (advanced microchips etc.). I would also argue Russia has more morale issues than Ukraine. Prigozhin and his Wagner group also seem like a loose cannonball which the conventional Russian military finds difficult to contain. Hence the idea to utilize this infighting and morale issues.

Therefore I am quite skeptical of a decisive offensive this year. And I know that this is an unpopular opinion. The liberation of Ukraine needs to be planned well and if it is not doable this year, then so be it. Crossing the Dnipro is still very difficult task as it requires solidifying several bridgeheads, and the Zaporizhia front has been static for over a year, and therefore is likely heavily mined and fortified (see Vuhledar).
