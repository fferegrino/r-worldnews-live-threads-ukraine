Day 37 of my updates from Kharkiv.

My area was pretty quiet again, but east part of the city is continuously under heavy shelling, there have been 20 fires in just a single day. There are photos from Saltivka where dead civilians are just lying in the streets while people walk around them. There are no military targets in the area, there’s no fighting around that area either. They are just shelling residential districts from a distance.

Long rant ahead. There are explosions and fighting all around me every day, normally you would think that this is the scariest part of this war, but it’s not, at least it isn’t to me. What scares me the most is just how potent Russian brainwashing is. I’ll just talk about 2 recent conversations of mine.

First conversation was a couple of weeks ago. It was with my friend with whom I raided in WoW for the past 2 years, he’s not even from Russia but from Belarus, but he thinks exactly as a Russian would. First he said that he’s not on anyone’s side, and also that both sides are at fault, which by default means that you are on the side of Russia.
 
After that I asked why don’t people try to find the truth for themselves, which he answered with “why do we even need to know the truth?” To me this just seems so weird, why wouldn’t you want to know what is really happening? When I said that this is a real war not some hypothetical scenario he basically said “this is life, either run or endure it”. 

Ah, also he said that actual problems of the world are money and democracy and that we are all just insignificant people that can’t change anything. Yeah, why have a choice when you can have a dictator make that choice for you. And if this war was about money it wouldn’t have begun in the first place, the economic damage to Russia far outweighs whatever they could potentially get from this war.
 
Second conversation was just yesterday with my father (who is a Ukrainian that fled to Russia 9 years ago, and thank god he did), who we thought was still somewhat reasonable until just recently. 

When I told him jokingly about those “nationalistic flying squadrons of death” he apparently believed in them, and still does, he basically said “well, you haven’t seen them, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist” What the fuck? He literally says we don’t know who is really shelling us, and that Ukraine spreads more fakes than Russia.  

And of course he said that we (people in Russia) know the truth about the war and know why each of the buildings was destroyed. It’s funny hearing about us being brainwashed from people living in an alternate reality where Russia is the hero that is currently saving us from Nazis.

Sorry for the rant but this is just unbelievable. People that aren’t even Russian become zombies from living in Russia. At this point everyone we knew from Russia is a lost cause. This war isn’t about conquering territories or about money, it’s a war against the truth itself and if Russia wins, only gaslighting and lies will remain.

This is where Yanukovich decided to demonstrate how tough of a ruler he is by ordering riot police to brutally disperse those students. Next day the country woke up, turned on their TVs and saw literal blood on the main square of the country. Half a million people were on that square by noon. The rest is history.

On Thursday, an official with the US Department of Defense told CNN they believed that the Russian military had likely left the airport. The new satellite images, taken on Thursday from Maxar Technologies, confirm they have.

Previous satellite images showed that, around military vehicles and artillery positions, the Russians had constructed protective earthen berms. Now, just the berms remain. 

The capture of the Antonov airfield was the first major victory notched by the Russians on the first day of the war — Feb. 24. A number of transport and attack helicopters ambushed the base, and the Ukrainian soldiers at it; CNN even witnessed some of the intense firefight at the base.

Since then, Ukrainian forces held strong against the Russian advance; they never made it closer to western Kyiv. Intense firefights took place along the Irpin River and the towns of Irpin and Bucha, just south of the air base and the surrounding village of Hostomel. 

And for weeks, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a number of videos praising the ease at which they claimed to have taken the air base. Russian state media echoed those claims, even traveling with troops around the airport as evidence for how safe the area was.

Tl;Dw: Over a month after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has come to understand that ""there can be no military solution here,"" exiled Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky told DW. Khodorkovsky, a prominent critic of the Russian leader, previously spent a decade in prison in Russia on charges widely regarded as revenge for challenging Putin's rule. Russian troops began their invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Putin announced that the operation aimed at ""demilitarizing"" and ""de-nazifying"" the former Soviet state and protecting Russian speakers in the country. 

But with Russia failing to quickly occupy the country due to strong Ukrainian resistance and its troops getting bogged down, Moscow recently announced a change in its war aims, saying that it will focus on the ""liberation"" of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. ""Putin is stuck when it comes to the military operation,"" Khodorkovsky said, adding, ""Putin has two options now: Either he escalates things, which could mean either introducing mobilization or using tactical nuclear weapons, or he can stabilize the situation and begin peace talks in earnest."" In the interview with DW, Khodorkovsky also stressed the importance of a unified Western position. 

""The West's position needs to be clear, meaning comprehensive support for Ukraine if the war continues and in case Putin uses tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction,"" he underlined. ""That sort of clear position from the West will, let's say, help Putin make the right decision.""",False,1648909319.0,t3_tu9wwh,t3_tu9wwh,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

https://missilethreat.csis.org/system/russian-air-defense/

>Current Russian air defense doctrine follows a three-tier approach. This layered system allows Russian air defense forces to create [anti-access area-denial ](https://missilethreat.csis.org/russia-nato-a2ad-environment/)(A2AD) zones that can be difficult to penetrate. The highest tier of these defensive networks uses long-range systems such as the [S-200](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/s-200-sa-5-gammon/), [S-300](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/s-300/), and [S-400](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/s-400-triumf/), providing air defense bubbles potentially up to 800 km in diameter.


>These zones are typically augmented by the second tier which includes medium-range systems like the 9K37 Buk and its variants. This medium-range layer is intended to increase radar coverage within the air defense zone and augment the more limited inventories of longer-range interceptor missiles. The third tier uses mobile short-range systems like the 9K33 Osa and S-125 Neva to provide extra protection for key areas such as military bases. These systems, along with highly mobile systems like the 9K37 Buk are often also attached to formations of ground forces in the field.

>Due to their vulnerability to low-flying threats such as cruise missiles, the first and second-layer defenses are often guarded by point-defense systems like the [Tor ](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/tor/)or [Pantsyr-S1](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/pantsir-s-1/).[1](https://missilethreat.csis.org/system/russian-air-defense/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4108)

Elsewhere I read:

- S series: 40-300km range. 
- Kub, BUK - 15-40k.
- Osa / Tor / Neva - 4-15km
- Shilka / Tunguskas / Pantsyr / Strela /manpads: 0-4km point-defense. 


If I'm reading right, low-flying helicopters as seen attacking Russia's fuel depot flying above the trees would be tough targets to hit with these systems. Of course it makes them vulnerable to small-arms fire or tunguska-types, but that's why these choppers went in in darkness and got out asap. I assume Russia scrambled fighter jets to intercept, but 40km isn't too far from Ukrainian air defenses, presumably.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces continued to capture territory in central Mariupol on April 2 and will likely capture the city within days.

Ukrainian forces repelled several possibly large-scale Russian assaults in Donbas, claiming to destroy almost 70 Russian vehicles.

Russian forces will likely require a lengthy operational pause to integrate reinforcements into existing force structures in eastern Ukraine and enable successful operations but appear unlikely to do so and will continue to bleed their forces in ineffective daily attacks.

Russian forces in Izyum conducted an operational pause after successfully capturing the city on April 1 and will likely resume offensive operations to link up with Russian forces in Donbas in the coming days.
Russia continued to withdraw forces from the Kyiv axis into Belarus and Russia. Ukrainian forces primarily conducted operations to sweep and clear previously Russian-occupied territory.
Ukrainian forces likely repelled limited Russian attacks in Kherson Oblast.

-	My brother used to be a total Indophile, having spent significant time out there on work and holidays, waxing lyrical about how Modi is our natural ally etc., but now he’s very despondent, saying that he misjudged the country.
-	My wife is from the Philippines and previously her family was very pro-India and anti-China. Her family Viber group is currently having a heated debate about Hindu nationalism and whether it’s as dangerous as Islamic extremism.
-	An academic colleague of mine with a large research grant had been planning a big conference for Summer 2023 in Asia to meet with collaborators.

Генеральний штаб ЗСУ / General Staff of

the Armed Forces of Ukraine's post The operational update regarding the #russian_invasion on 24.00 on April 2, 2022.

The thirty-eights day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the russian military invasion ends.

The russian enemy continues to carry out systematic missile and air strikes on military and civilian targets, but the intensity of missile strikes and high-precision weapons strikes has declined.

Additional russian enemy units are being prepared to take part in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. It is planned to create ""volunteer"" battalions of residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and mercenaries.

In the Volyn direction, no significant changes in the condition and position of the occupying forces and their allies were noted.

In the Polissya direction. The russian occupiers continue to withdraw units to the territory of the republic of belarus. During the withdrawal of troops, the enemy mines the routes of advance and individual settlements.

In the Siverskyi region, the russian enemy completed the withdrawal of units from the territories of Ukraine to the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. The main routes of the enemy columns run in the direction of the settlements of Gomel and Mogilev regions. In addition to trucks, the columns included elements of a pontoon bridge fleet, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and Iskander launchers. The enemy's military equipment is concentrated at railway stations and facilities that have railway tracks, which allows it to be loaded and sent to the territory of the russian federation.

Units from the 2nd All-Military Army of the Central Military District, which were operating in the direction of the city of Brovary, are being withdrawn to the russian federation (via the Sumy oblast). The withdrawal of troops is provided by the battalion-tactical group of the 1st Tank Army of the Western Military District.

In Slobozhanshchyna, the russian enemy continues to partially block the city of Kharkiv and shells residential and industrial areas of the city with artillery systems of various types. It should be noted that the intensity of the shelling has decreased. Units of the russian occupying forces are regrouping, probably in order to continue active operations in the Izyum direction. The enemy is trying to conduct reconnaissance, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles.

In the Donetsk direction, the russian enemy continued to fire on some units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and to conduct assault operations in some areas. The main efforts of the russian occupiers continued to focus on capturing the settlements of Rubizhne, Popasna, preparing for the attack on Siverodonetsk, gaining full control over Mariupol, as well as access to Vuhledar and Marinka. They did not succeed.

Ukraine's defense forces continue to defend our land, gradually liberating the occupied territories, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.

Together to victory! We believe in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Keep calm! Glory to Ukraine!

#In Putin’s Ukraine quagmire, echoes of Soviet failure in Afghanistan

By Griff Witte

The Kremlin had banked on a quick, trouble-free decapitation to solve the problem of a neighbor appearing to stray too far from Moscow’s orbit. But after its vaunted army thundered across the border, very little went according to plan.

The invading troops met fierce resistance from outgunned fighters defending their homeland. International allies, including the United States, rushed to aid the underdogs. And a war that Moscow had seen as a chance to show off its might became instead a bloody and embarrassing display of weakness — one that threatened the stability of its deeply entrenched regime.

So has gone Russia’s stumbling, five-week-old invasion of Ukraine. But the same description applies to the Soviet Union’s ill-fated adventure in Afghanistan, which precipitated collapse at home and the Cold War’s end.

Now the history of that four-decade-old conflict looms over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision-making as he tries to navigate a self-inflicted quagmire. Veterans of the Afghanistan war say he has already failed to heed some of its most critical lessons, notably by overestimating his military’s capabilities and misjudging his adversaries.

“The Russians underestimated the Afghans in the 1980s,” said Bruce Riedel, who worked on the CIA’s covert program to aid the rebels. “They seem to have underestimated the Ukrainians today.”

Riedel said there’s irony in that failure: Putin, in invading Ukraine, has appeared bent on restoring the glory lost when the Soviet Union broke up, an event he has described as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.”

Yet, by making some of the same mistakes that haunted Soviet leaders until the day their empire fell apart, Putin has put Russian power — not to mention his own future — in doubt.

“In setting out to reverse history,” another CIA veteran of the Afghanistan war, Milton Bearden, recently wrote in Foreign Affairs, “he may instead be repeating it.”",False,1648923463.0,t3_tu9wwh,t3_tu9wwh,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

BUCHA, Ukraine — The Russian forces that were intent on overwhelming Kyiv at the war’s start with tanks and artillery retreated under fire across a broad front on Saturday, leaving behind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.

The withdrawal suggested the possibility of a major turn in the six-week war — the collapse, at least for now, of Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and the end of its hopes for the quick subjugation of the nation.

Moscow has described the withdrawal as a tactical move to regroup and reposition its forces for a major push in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. While there are early indications that the military is following through on that plan, analysts say it cannot obscure the magnitude of the defeat.

“The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals — the capture of Kyiv — proved unobtainable for Russian forces,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview Saturday.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks continued unabated, and the Pentagon has cautioned that the formations near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

Kyiv region ""liberated"" from Russian forces, senior Ukrainian defense official says

Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, said Saturday that the Kyiv region had been ""liberated"" from Russian forces.

She said in a post on Facebook that Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and ""the whole Kyiv region was liberated from the invader.""

CNN could not immediately verify that the entire Kyiv region had been cleared of Russian troops by Ukrainian forces, but the Ukrainian military has in recent days regained control of suburbs around the capital, which has remained under government control. The Russian military has said it is ""de-escalating"" around Kyiv.

Russia shifting focus to victory by early May in eastern Ukraine, US officials say

Russia has revised its Ukraine war strategy to focus on taking control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. 

More than a month into the war, Russian ground forces have been unable to keep control of areas where they have been fighting.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is where he is most likely to achieve that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia’s “Victory Day,” according to a US official.

May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day on which the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to celebrate a victory of some kind in his war that day. 

But other officials note even if there is a Russian celebration, an actual victory may be further off. 

“Putin will have a victory parade on 9 May regardless the status of the war or peace talks,” a European defense official said. “On the other hand: a victory parade with what troops and vehicles?”
Still, US and European officials say any deadlines Moscow may set rhetorically don’t change the reality on the ground that Russia appears to be preparing for the prospect of an extended conflict.

A European diplomat said while the Kremlin is talking optimistically, Putin is preparing for a “Chechnya-style long, drawn-out war, because he, to a certain extent, has nowhere else to go on this.”

There are several reasons behind the May timeframe, the officials say. As the winter freeze ends and the ground softens, it will be harder for heavy Russian ground units to maneuver, meaning it’s vital for those forces to get into place as soon as possible, US intelligence assesses. 

Russian-backed fighters have also already been in that region for years. The Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine is where Russian separatist forces took control of territory in 2014.

Ukrainian officials have publicly pointed to the date as well. ""Ahead of May 9, Putin set the goal of a victory parade for this war,"" Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Thursday.
Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Friday the Ukrainians believe they are facing a “very complex and difficult month” as Putin tries meet a deadline.

“His ultimate goal is, was, and will be to take over Ukraine, but he failed. He failed due to a very strong resolve of Ukrainian military and very strong unity of Ukraine and the Western world, and the sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and G7 and the European Union,” Yatsenyuk said. “So now, as far as I see, Putin switched to Plan B. My take is that this Plan B has a, kind of, deadline.”
The US also assesses Putin is now preparing, for the first time, to name an overall commander of the war to achieve greater Russian successes, two US officials said. The US believes Putin will likely name a general who has been in the southern part of Ukraine because that is a place where Russians have succeeded in their objectives.",False,1648939407.0,t3_tu9wwh,t3_tu9wwh,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

I’m from Sweden, and have been following Greta Thunberg’s actions for a while. I find it interesting to see that India’s approach to Russia is a bit similar to their approach to climate change, and the same can be said for other states as well. 

In the beginning of 2019, a video was released of Greta addressing Narendra Modi. She said that he needed to ”take action now against the climate crisis” and not just ”doing business as usual, and just talking about and bragging about the little victories”. She also said that Modi was going to be seen as ”one of the worst villains in human history” if he ”keep on going like this”. *1 India is the 4th biggest polluter in the world and accounts for ca 4% of ”percentage of greenhouse gases for ratification” in the Paris agreement. *2 DW reports that Modi has said that India will decrease the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. *4 Net-zero at 2070 is a lot later than what many other countries are aiming for. Finland aims for 2035, Iceland 2040, Sweden, Germany and Scotland for 2045. *3 Also, Denmark is said to aim for cutting carbon emissions with 70% by 2030. *5

It seems like India is prioritising short-term profits over long-term planetary well-being when it comes to climate change. It seems like it’s doing the same when it comes to relationships with Russia. Earlier this week BBC described that ”India has been taking advantage of discounted prices to ramp up imports from the country”. *6 Some days ago US deputy NSA Daleep Singh ”warned of consequences for any country that seeks to circumvent sanctions” and said that ”the US doesn’t want to see ”rapid acceleration” of India’s imports from Russia”. *7

I think it’s interesting that other countries that are seemingly quite supportive of Russia are also not very ambitious when it comes to climate action. China has net-zero aim 2060. *4 Israel is aiming for cutting carbon emissions with 27% by 2030. *8 In Brazil, deforestation, the biggest source of Brazil’s emissions, hit a 12-year high in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest in 2020. *9

2 days ago China’s state TV CGTN published a ca 30 min long video on YouTube called ”BRICS diplomacy: Russia-Ukraine conflict in a brewing cold war”. It’s from a show called World Insight. The host starts the show by saying that ”the recent exchanges among BRICS countries amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict have laid the ground for closer and inclusive partnership among these countries”. *10 

It seems like countries that aren’t very ambitious when it comes to climate change are bonding not only over that but also over the response to Russia’s invasion. These countries also happen to be not very high ranked when it comes to democracy, freedom, and human development. It seems like India’s actions with regards Russia is further evidence of a divide between north-south, rich-poor, democracies-authoritarian regimes, freedom-unfreedom. It would be interesting to hear what Greta thinks about it. Don’t know if she’s addressed the issue.

First, the people that believe that the good of the many outweighs the good if the few - that the “right thing” to do is to minimize the risk to the most people, even if that means some smaller portion of people must suffer and die for the rest. 

Then there’s the second group. They believe that there’s a tipping point somewhere, where the suffering of even a small group of people becomes so unbearable that it dehumanizes the larger group who are otherwise untouched by the suffering. (Dehumanizes, in that the larger group loses a core component of being human - compassion and the desire to help your human being - i.e., you sacrifice your soul so that the majority will be less impacted.)

Not judging either group here.

British military intelligence said on Saturday that Ukraine’s air defense capability continues to pose significant challenges to Russian aircraft, despite the invading forces' continued effort to diminish Ukraine's air defenses.

“Ukraine continues to provide a significant challenge to Russia Air and Missile operations. As a result, Russian aircraft are still vulnerable to short and medium range air defense systems,” the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in an Intelligence Update.

Russia has not been able to obtain control of the air due its inability to find and destroy Ukrainian air defense systems, the ministry said. Thus, this inability has significantly affected Russia’s, “ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts,” according to the MOD.

The ministry also reported that there has been significant Russian air activity towards southeastern Ukraine, “likely a result of Russia focusing its military operations in this area.” ",False,1648957386.0,t3_tu9wwh,t3_tu9wwh,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Do these heroic warriors really want to be treated with mawkish consideration directly the scales of war tilt against them? Must they go on for ever in alternate phases of war and whining? Would it not rather conduce to a manly mutual respect if, as people say, we gave it to them hot and good?

> They have insisted on being a nuisance to all the world, they have stopped the wheels of progress, life is entirely disorganized not only in France and England and Poland but in Sweden, Holland, Belgium, on account of their love for playing soldiers, and it is absurd to concentrate upon Herr Hitler the responsibility for all that fierce, fatuous, crowd-swaggering which thousands of photographs have recorded. There are thousands of pictorial records. There are, I say, many excuses for the Germans, Versailles and the strangulation after 1919-20, etc., etc. – we all know how sound their excuses are, we concede them almost excessively, we over do it; none the less they have been made excuses for abominable behaviour – and I am convinced that vigorous bombing and bombarding, town-wrecking and the like, would be an entirely wholesome and chastening experience for the German ""soul"".

Or do you think Putin more than likely knows that, while Tucker Carlson has a large audience, it’s a small-ish percentage of the US that actually has similar viewpoints?

More than a month into the war, Russian ground forces have been unable to keep control of areas where they have been fighting. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is where he is most likely to achieve that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia’s “Victory Day,” according to a US official.

May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day on which the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to celebrate a victory of some kind in his war that day. 

Ukrainian negotiator claims advances in talks with Russia, possibility of 'direct consultations' between Zelensky, Putin in future: David Arakhamia, a member of the Ukrainian negotiating team in talks with Russia, said the Russian side has responded positively to Ukrainian positions on several issues.

Arakhamia said there is a possibility of ""direct consultations"" between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he said had been facilitated in part by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 

The status of Crimea -- annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 -- has been a sticking point in potential negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine and most of the international community consider the peninsula to be illegally occupied. The Kremlin consistently says the status of Crimea is settled. 

The Ukrainian side said there had been agreement to suspend negotiations on the status of Crimea for 15 years, but the Russian side has not confirmed, and the Kremlin has publicly reiterated its position Crimea is part of Russia.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said there was no official confirmation of those positions in writing, according to Arakhamia.

However, Arakhamia added: ""Orally, as of yesterday, in a video conference, we heard that the Russian side does not object to such [Ukrainian] positions.""",False,1648957555.0,t3_tu9wwh,t3_tu9wwh,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

I fully understand that dependence on Russian energy imports is fundamental to many nations like Germany. Just cutting the line in response to the invasion isn't feasible. 

However, this isn't an excuse, because Russia has been at war with Ukraine for nearly a decade -- since they invaded Crimea. Many nations sat not only idle but continued to fund Russia as Russia actively terrorized sovereign territory.

> (Bloomberg) -- Russia’s economy has staggered through the first full month of the war with Ukraine but it may yet emerge with a sparkling balance sheet if some of its biggest trade partners don’t turn off the tap on its exports of energy.

> For all the hardships visited on consumers at home and the financial chokehold put on the government from abroad, Bloomberg Economics expects Russia will earn nearly $321 billion from energy exports this year, an increase of more than a third from 2021. It’s also on track for a record current-account surplus that the Institute of International Finance says may reach as high as $240 billion.

> “The single biggest driver of Russia’s current account surplus continues to look solid,” IIF economists led by Robin Brooks said in a report. “With current sanctions in place, substantial inflows of hard currency into Russia look set to continue.”

> The calculus may change completely, however, in case of an embargo on energy sales.

""But when Lenin died in 1924, he was succeeded by Joseph Stalin, one of the most ruthless humans ever to hold power. To Stalin, the burgeoning national revival movement and continuing loss of Soviet influence in the Ukraine was completely unacceptable. To crush the people's free spirit, he began to employ the same methods he had successfully used within the Soviet Union. Thus, beginning in 1929, over 5,000 Ukrainian scholars, scientists, cultural and religious leaders were arrested after being falsely accused of plotting an armed revolt. Those arrested were either shot without a trial or deported to prison camps in remote areas of Russia.

Stalin also imposed the Soviet system of land management known as collectivization. This resulted in the seizure of all privately owned farmlands and livestock, in a country where 80 percent of the people were traditional village farmers. Among those farmers, were a class of people called Kulaks by the Communists. They were formerly wealthy farmers that had owned 24 or more acres, or had employed farm workers. Stalin believed any future insurrection would be led by the Kulaks, thus he proclaimed a policy aimed at ""liquidating the Kulaks as a class.""""

""Ukrainian Communists urgently appealed to Moscow for a reduction in the grain quotas and also asked for emergency food aid. Stalin responded by denouncing them and rushed in over 100,000 fiercely loyal Russian soldiers to purge the Ukrainian Communist Party. The Soviets then sealed off the borders of the Ukraine, preventing any food from entering, in effect turning the country into a gigantic concentration camp. Soviet police troops inside the Ukraine also went house to house seizing any stored up food, leaving farm families without a morsel. All food was considered to be the ""sacred"" property of the State. Anyone caught stealing State property, even an ear of corn or stubble of wheat, could be shot or imprisoned for not less than ten years.

Starvation quickly ensued throughout the Ukraine, with the most vulnerable, children and the elderly, first feeling the effects of malnutrition. The once-smiling young faces of children vanished forever amid the constant pain of hunger. It gnawed away at their bellies, which became grossly swollen, while their arms and legs became like sticks as they slowly starved to death.

Mothers in the countryside sometimes tossed their emaciated children onto passing railroad cars traveling toward cities such as Kiev in the hope someone there would take pity. But in the cities, children and adults who had already flocked there from the countryside were dropping dead in the streets, with their bodies carted away in horse-drawn wagons to be dumped in mass graves. Occasionally, people lying on the sidewalk who were thought to be dead, but were actually still alive, were also carted away and buried.""

""By the spring of 1933, the height of the famine, an estimated 25,000 persons died every day in the Ukraine. Entire villages were perishing.""

If they threaten other countries for this they get told clearly to stay behind their border's or get their Blyatzi army hammered by a technologically superior force. 

What's clear here is that without Western technology and equipment Russia cannot maintain itself in the long run and the best and most direct way of making Russia reform and change it's ways is to make it clear that if they refuse to hand over the bastards responsible for these massacres that while Russia itself wont be invaded neither will other states be willing to do any sort of business with them either.

Russia wanted a ""demilitarised"" Ukraine? Not a chance they'll likely end up with an extremely well armed Ukraine at the end of this not taking any of their shit a second time around. Way things are looking it's likely the more Putin digs in the more likely he's going to end up with a hardened Irony Curtain along the Russian border from the Ukrainian Black Sea Border all the way to the Artic Ocean in Finland and Norway and well reinforced to deter any future threat.

Either Russia pulls it's head out of it's collective ass and reforms itself and starts cleaning up it's country and then it can have all the good things that come with it or it ends up like a fatter north korea walled off, a failed state despised by it's neighbours for it's atrocities and basically China's Bitch for the next few decades selling whatever it has for below cost.

Antony Beevor describes it as the ""greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history"" and concludes that at least 1.4 million women were raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia alone.

https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1509637412871360514 

To translate what the graphics state: if something is flying at 20,000 ft off the ground (presuming the radar is sited on a reasonably high spot atop of your terrain) you're talking around \~340km of range.   This is where the S-series and any aerial search radar dominates in it's coverage.

Go to the nap of the earth, and that detection (and engagement lock-on) range drops down to barely 30 km.  In fact, you're just as likely to first sight something at that height visually.  So no warning, no way to position anything in time to respond to the first detection.  It's all down to MANPAD and point defenses, and if those aren't pre-positioned before the engagement, they're fairly useless.

Keep in mind that these distances are assuming completely flat terrain.   In reality, trees, buildings and other terrain will alter the distances, shortening them even more.   Given that the Ukrainian planners probably had the best GEOINT available to plot radar and defensive weaponry positions, as well as good up-to-date satellite photos of the terrain, they could plan a flight to minimize detection at all points by taking advantage of these obstacles.",False,1648919388.0,t3_tu9wwh,t1_i341sjh,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

We (the west) would strongly suggest you check ourselves into a substance abuse treatment center (preferable at the bottom of the ocean while wearing cement shoes).

 >The Katyn massacre was a series of mass executions of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the NKVD (""People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"", the Soviet secret police) in April and May 1940. Though the killings also occurred in the Kalinin and Kharkiv prisons and elsewhere, the massacre is named after the Katyn Forest, where some of the mass graves were first discovered by German forces. The massacre was initiated in NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria's proposal to Joseph Stalin to execute all captive members of the Polish officer corps, which was approved by the Soviet Politburo led by Stalin.

In fact they don't seem to be engaging in routs at all in and around Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts, even where it seems they could do so.  They are taking fire from longer-range missiles, but they're not returning fire as the US and UK expected them to, and as those countries warned Russia they might.

In fact, most of the OSINT and Intel experts thought that Russia would have tried for Dnipro in the early phases of the war to cut off the Ukrainian forces in the east. However, Russia didn't follow their own doctrines, and with all their logistical issues, Dnipro ended up fine. 

Now, a lot of commentators feel that there will be an upcoming battle in the Donbas that will decided the war. Dnipro would be the logical target for a major Russian offensive westward. 

>   Are they going to do what they did in Mariupol or will they only try to hit ""strategic"" targets? are questions I have in my mind.

There is a lot of strategic problems with this vs Mariupol. First, Dnipro will be very difficult to surround, so a Mariupol like siege is very likely impossible. Next, Dnipro is such an obvious target, that if a major offensive from Russia punches through the JFO defenses the logical place for Ukrainian soldiers to pull back to would Dnipro, meaning Russia would have to fight through a hornets nest as they headed westward. Think the Battle of the Bulge. Next, Dnipro has far more people, and is a much larger city then Mariupol. Russia very likely can't take it unless they have way more troops. Finally, Russia has not demonstrated the ability to operate beyond their supply lines, taking Dnipro would require the Russians to demonstrate an ability to operate with stretched supply lines, something they have not been able to do. 

TLDR: Dnipro is an obvious target. But real world strategic considerations mean that it is extremely unlikely to end up like Mariupol. I would be surprised if Russia even made it that far, and if they did, I doubt they would be able to stay long. Still, Dnipro may see more strikes and bombings in the future.",1648916197.0,1648909970.0,t3_tu9wwh,t1_i33yft9,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Each BTG differs slightly in size with anything up to 800 officers and soldiers. 

Another working estimate is that once a unit takes on ca 15% losses it becomes ineffective. 

If the number of fatalities at ca 17,500 is correct that's around 10% losses assuming a middle estimate of 175,000 troops engaged and then there are the wounded, captured and deserted etc to factor in. The estimate of wounded to KIA is supposed to be around 3-1 for this type of combat, so you can guesstimate around 50,000 plus wounded alone, add that to those killed etc would mean they are getting close to 50% of their men either killed/wounded/captured etc. So your assessment of they are fucked if this continues is reasonable, unfortunately Putin seems to be operating on the principle of WWI generals and just one more push might win it... 

Russia has also had a number of generals, colonels and senior ranks killed and presumably others injured, given that a lot of the Russian army are badly paid/trained conscripts they can ill afford to lose this type of experience. 

However not all of the dead will be Russian soldiers - Putin has tapped Syria and Chechnya for cannon fodder and there are some mercenary units like Wagner who are thought to be fighting. 

So what do they have in reserve...

Pre-invasion they were thought to have 170 BTGs but some of them will be stationed elsewhere doing other stuff and that total could anyway have been inflated for propaganda purposes. The suggestion is around 120 BTGs were deployed by Russia in Ukraine so they have little they can call up without stretching things elsewhere. 

So, they are fucked because they have already lost too many men and not easy to replace tanks and helicopters etc, fucked again because they have lost experienced officers and fucked a third time because they don't have much in reserve.

All things considered, is the assumption here that Russia *will* grind down and capture Ukraine really all that safe an assumption?  He talks about a couple million soldiers to occupy.  I don't even think that's *possible* given the state of the military as seen.  Even with a full draft, how long will it take to train and prepare a new force, while under sanction?  Never mind the rest of the alleged plan, the *other countries*.  You've got to be fucking kidding me.  There's just no way.

Russia really stepped in it.  He's right in that the US wants to bleed them here, to avoid a later confrontation.  But I think even if somehow Russia gets out with some of it's military intact, they're not going anywhere.  They're going to stay home, spend a good decade rebuilding their economy and their military and getting over/recovering from these sanctions, and wait for a more friendly political climate (changes of leadership across the west) before they try anything again.

I just can't see how they bounce from this to another war, even if they ""win"".

Similarly I think he's right in that this was a great lesson for China.  They'll pursue expansion through political means, not military ones.  They encouraged Putin, they believed what Putin sold them (maybe) and were waiting for the west to prove itself a paper tiger in response to a real mover and shaker.

Tanks are no longer the battlefield juggernaut they once were, but they still hold an important role. They force the enemy to employ defenses for them, even with their weaknesses, they are great for holding ground when properly deployed, and they are necessary as a counter for other armored vehicles. Tanks can be killed by missiles easily enough, but missiles don't hold ground. Ultimately,  an occupation comes down to infantry and armor. Infantry without armor is begging to be overrun.

I think it is pretty clear that they play a lesser role than they used to, but tanks have always been big targets, and always been vulnerable to anti-tank weapons if not deployed combined with infantry in close coordination. Portable rocket launchers capable of destroying tanks have existed since WW2, they are more deadly and longer range today, but so are the tank's weapons and optics, and all the ways to counter foot soldiers and air strikes still exist.  Drones can be shot down, soldiers with rocket systems can be killed or suppressed with artillery, machine gun, and small arms fire.  


Having tanks, which are fairly fast moving, have a lot of firepower, and enough armor to withstand that small arms, machine gun, and even smaller artillery shellfire is an asset on the battlefield that can be decisive if employed properly.

Army requirements demand that an APS must be capable of protecting vehicles under all conditions, and the radar is effective in adverse combat conditions like smoke, sand, dust, mud, glare, and explosions.  
>  
>Once the threat is detected, the onboard computer classifies the threat and, if a hit is probable, the countermeasure launcher slews into position and launches a tight pattern of explosively formed penetrators that neutralize the warhead before impact or detonation. The threat detection, fire control, and processing all take place in milliseconds.

>The same sensors that track incoming shots at the vehicle also paint a target on the shooter, allowing an immediate response from the crew. They can return fire, maneuver out of contact, activate slew-to-cue weapons and sensors, or call for fire support.  At the same time, Trophy automatically transmits the engagement data to the battle management network, giving friendly forces immediate enemy information.

Air defense networks have similar capabilities to track missile trajectories, though on a significantly larger scale. Here's an excerpt from a rundown for the U.S. Army's planned updates to air defense systems.

>As part of a complex system of ground-based radars, satellite sensors and interceptor missiles, missile interceptor technologies work by using infrared sensors on satellites to monitor heat signatures produced by launching rockets. Once a launch is established, tracking is transferred to radar systems that help verify the missile's trajectory.

People (up to and including the white house) are using the word 'escalation' as a sort of thought terminating cliche to mean 'if we help Ukraine too much they might actually win the war and russia will get really angry and attack NATO and then something something something nuclear war'

That line of thought is coming from the same expert analysts who thought russia would crush ukraine in days and now imagine that the 'mighty' russian military is spoiling for a fight with NATO at the slightest provocation. They've swallowed russian propaganda, simple as that.

To be very very fucking clear about it. Russia has a third rate military, they know it, the world knows it, and the idea that they are going to respond to any form of assistance within Ukraine by directly attacking a NATO country is laughable. They are perfectly aware that any conventional attack would be rapidly annihilated, and if their only comeback after that is nuclear suicide, why would they possibly do that by choice? 

If the position is that the west doesn't want Ukraine to win this war because we are worried what russia will do with its nukes if humiliated then lets just be honest with ourselves about that, cut off all assistance and watch the Ukrainians die rather than prolonging their struggle.

Alternatively, if the West's commitment to democracy and freedom of choice is real, if it actually stands with the Ukrainian people, if it wants to help them save their country rather than fight a bloody stalemate whilst their women and children are butchered by war criminals, then let all stop swallowing russian propaganda and give the Ukrainians whatever they need to win this war.

This is a wrong question to ask. There is NOTHING in the entirety of Ukraine that can offset the economic losses for Russia. Consider Mariupol. Suppose Russia takes it (which can happen), and then miraculously Ukraine agrees to cede it (which I don't think can happen, but suppose it does). The city is a ruin, it will require billions to rebuild, billions that Russia does not have. No investment will come to rebuild any lands that Russia annexes. No oil drilling company will come to aid russia in extracting natural gas from Donbass and Crimean sea shelf, and Russia lacks the know-how on itself (same with its vast Arctic deposits). Natural resources are all about technology needed to extract them. North Korea sits on trillions in rare metal ores, but what good does it them?

The right question is what Putin gains out of it? Putin has staked his legitimacy on a ""small victorious war"". Therefore, the main benefit of any agreement should be something he can sell to the domestic audience as a win. He loses the war, he loses power.

However, no one asked the authoritarians of the world if they were in favor of treaties and debates over war? Surprise, they are not. Most did however stay in line (only fighting other authoritarian regimes or their own population) due to fear of western power. That fear have however resided partially. The EU have (until now) been incapable of making though decisions politically and it’s military have degraded into a joke. The US is also seen as weak politically. Obama ignored his own thin red line in Syria, ignored the invasion of Ukraine, Trumpf… (you know the story) and Biden made a shot show out of Afghanistan. The biggest authoritarian saw weakness - and they pray on weakness.

If we want to reinstate respect around the international institutions? Rule of law? We need to be prepared to use raw brutal force.

I'd pump the brakes on your 'local supply chain bad', 'prevent the West from having strong militaries' and 'dissolve borders' comments
  
I firmly believe self-sustainability and local supply chains are fundamentally better for people, environment, efficiency, and political self-determination (other governments have less leverage over you)  
   
I believe in soft power and do not want militarization for myself or my own country, but because I believe in self-determination, if other countries in the West want to militarize, it's up to them. Frankly, given the way some other countries are acting, it's not necessarily all bad.  
    
I believe in borders insofar as I believe in government, because I have seen the politics of some other countries and I do not want to take part in their systems.   
   
Countries should be aware that they are a construct and that the greater goal is always to reduce human suffering and improve the human experience on a global scale, but they (countries) certainly do have their uses. I'm not ashamed to admit that they are a useful societal structure, and I will not be shamed into trying to do away with them by merging them all together into a decisive global political entity.

They currently have 1500 nukes already on launchers, with a further 1000 strategic nukes (and 2000 tactical nukes) in reserve. A further 1500 nukes are in maintenance.

Let's assume Russia maintains a 2:1 tactical:strategic nuke ratio. That would mean 500 strategic city-killing nukes are in the first strike, and 1000 are to be used in follow-up attacks.

Let's assume your best case here, and that Russian nukes have a 60% failure rate matching that of their missiles. That means that 200 cities will be destroyed in the first strike, and 400 in the second. Are you okay with losing 600 cities? Again, this is _using the best-case observed failure rates of Russian equipment._

Let's say that nukes are harder to maintain and have a higher failure rate. Sure. There were guys in the 90s telling Yeltsin that the nuclear weapons stuff was failing; let's assume that corruption has caused 95% of all Russian nukes to fail.

First round destroys 25 cities. Follow-up destroys 50 more. This is with **a 95% failure rate of their strategic nuclear aresenal.** A 95% failure rate of Russian missiles means that Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Washington D.C., Berlin, Krakow, Madrid, Barcelona, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. are destroyed. Note I only mentioned a dozen cities - _there are 63 more cities that will be destroyed_. And that is with a frankly insane assumption that **95% of all Russian nukes are bad**. And every other variable is in your favor.

Unless you have a source for 99.99% of Russian nukes being duds, you are being absolutely ridiculous. If you are even slightly wrong, your _brilliant_ idea would kill millions of civilians.

Also ""take over Russia in 1-2 days easily"" it took the US longer to take over _Iraq_. Russia is the largest country by land mass in the world. Every city will be full of civilian defenders trying to make another Stalingrad. The US doesn't just magically have solutions for urban warfare; they have to go block-by-block.

Note that to join NATO you need to *commit to resolve disputed territories peacefully*.

They'll then turn and wipe the floor with the separatists at this point.  The west will continue resupplying Ukraine, and chances are sanctions will stick around for a bit and the west will engage in a massive rebuilding/charity towards Ukraine who have now proven themselves a formidable buffer state *against* Russia.  The money will come pouring in.

Ukraine will again cut the freshwater supply to Crimea.

Basically Russia will come out of this worse off, their economy trashed, their claim and grip on Crimea weakened, and the world has seen that their military little more than paint-over-rust.  Ukraine doesn't necessarily need Crimea back, they just need to not concede it to Russia.

 >The Black Sea Shipyard (Ukrainian: Чорноморський суднобудівний завод; Russian: Черноморский судостроительный завод) is a shipbuilding structure located in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. It was founded in 1895 by Belgian interests and began building warships in 1901. At the beginning of World War I in 1914, it was one of the largest industrial facilities in the Russian Empire. The shipyard was moribund until the Soviets began building up the fleet in the 1930s and it began building surface warships as well as submarines.

 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: [ɦolodoˈmɔr]; derived from морити голодом, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The term ""Holodomor"" emphasises the famine's man-made nature and alleged intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement. The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country.

With 4 million refugees and 10 million internally displaced persons so far and millions more facing Mariupol-like situations, plus the danger of an autocrat cornering the old world's grain export market and being able to weaponize famine, it's hard to find anything in the West that $2.3 billion will buy that can confront a comparable humanitarian and security disaster. 

While it may seem far away, and its true that they are not 'Murican, if its what matters most to you, this war is going to impact your life whether you want it to or not. Losing Ukraine's harvest is going to play havoc with world trade and food supplies and, in turn, there can be knock on security and humanitarian catastrophes and even more refugees and wars. This can impact things even you care about, including America's supply chains for everything from raw materials needed for smart phones to electric vehicles to oil. Also, it will be difficult for America to avoid the waves of refugees clamouring to get in, directly or indirectly. 

If you're looking to cut America's defence budget, you'd be better off not building an aircraft carrier, or as some call it ""the world's largest hypersonic missile practice targets"" - even one of them, without aircraft, costs tens of billions to build, and then tens of billions more to fuel, staff and board with aircraft, and most won't have the opportunity to save the tens of millions of (admittedly non-English speaking) lives that the west's aide to Ukraine can help.",False,1648874749.0,t3_tu9wwh,t1_i32nrkv,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

>  jamming a radar is the opposite you'd do in a mission based on being undetected

Well let's think this through for a second. They're not ninjas slinking around on tiptoes, they're in fucking helicopters. You can *hear them coming.* The anti-air weapons that could hit them are either radar- or infrared-based, so jamming them would seem to be useful. And this is well into Russian territory, where there aren't likely to be a bunch of infantry with Strelas hanging around waiting for a target to appear.

Ukraine also just captured a bunch of fancy Russian anti-air tech, and probably has a bunch of other ridiculous intel advantages we won't learn about for fifty years. They might be able to spoof Russian IFF, for example. Whatever the means Ukraine used to pull off this raid, the point Hertling is making is that the raid is a flex demonstrating a new capability. Which has strategic value that goes well beyond whatever the immediate value of the fuel depot was.

>Due to improvements in modern tank armor, anti-tank hand grenades are generally considered obsolete. However, in the recent Iraq War, the RKG-3 anti-tank hand grenade has made a reappearance with Iraqi insurgents who used them primarily against U.S. Humvees, Strykers and MRAPs, which lack the heavier armor of tanks. This has in turn led the U.S. to adopt countermeasures such as modifications to MRAP and Stryker vehicles by the fitting of slat armor, which causes the anti-tank grenade to detonate before coming in contact with the vehicle.\[22\]

 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: [ɦolodoˈmɔr]; derived from морити голодом, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The term ""Holodomor"" emphasises the famine's man-made nature and alleged intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement. The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country.

A few things to consider about the losses:

* Those are just destroyed. There's going to be multiples of that number of vehicles that are damaged through combat and attrition. Good chance that much of those will be a long time in the body shop
* Those are just confirmed-via-media kills as well. 
* The ""in service"" numbers you've quoted above are just that - shit in the inventory. Status of all that stuff has quickly become a very hot topic of conversation (as you infer). The Russian military, dating back to WWII, has a terrible track record when it comes to maintenance of it's motor pool, let alone a truly dedicated and serious (i.e. not just for show) repair/recovery units. I would not be surprised in the least if an audit were performed and it determined that 25% of those vehicles would be considered operable or battle-ready. I don't think it's ""anybody's guess"" in the sense that we don't really know, but I do think it's ""anybody's guess"" in the sense that they'd be lucky to get 10% of those vehicles to a battlefield.

""But when Lenin died in 1924, he was succeeded by Joseph Stalin, one of the most ruthless humans ever to hold power. To Stalin, the burgeoning national revival movement and continuing loss of Soviet influence in the Ukraine was completely unacceptable. To crush the people's free spirit, he began to employ the same methods he had successfully used within the Soviet Union. Thus, beginning in 1929, over 5,000 Ukrainian scholars, scientists, cultural and religious leaders were arrested after being falsely accused of plotting an armed revolt. Those arrested were either shot without a trial or deported to prison camps in remote areas of Russia.

Stalin also imposed the Soviet system of land management known as collectivization. This resulted in the seizure of all privately owned farmlands and livestock, in a country where 80 percent of the people were traditional village farmers. Among those farmers, were a class of people called Kulaks by the Communists. They were formerly wealthy farmers that had owned 24 or more acres, or had employed farm workers. Stalin believed any future insurrection would be led by the Kulaks, thus he proclaimed a policy aimed at ""liquidating the Kulaks as a class.""""

""Ukrainian Communists urgently appealed to Moscow for a reduction in the grain quotas and also asked for emergency food aid. Stalin responded by denouncing them and rushed in over 100,000 fiercely loyal Russian soldiers to purge the Ukrainian Communist Party. The Soviets then sealed off the borders of the Ukraine, preventing any food from entering, in effect turning the country into a gigantic concentration camp. Soviet police troops inside the Ukraine also went house to house seizing any stored up food, leaving farm families without a morsel. All food was considered to be the ""sacred"" property of the State. Anyone caught stealing State property, even an ear of corn or stubble of wheat, could be shot or imprisoned for not less than ten years.

Starvation quickly ensued throughout the Ukraine, with the most vulnerable, children and the elderly, first feeling the effects of malnutrition. The once-smiling young faces of children vanished forever amid the constant pain of hunger. It gnawed away at their bellies, which became grossly swollen, while their arms and legs became like sticks as they slowly starved to death.

Mothers in the countryside sometimes tossed their emaciated children onto passing railroad cars traveling toward cities such as Kiev in the hope someone there would take pity. But in the cities, children and adults who had already flocked there from the countryside were dropping dead in the streets, with their bodies carted away in horse-drawn wagons to be dumped in mass graves. Occasionally, people lying on the sidewalk who were thought to be dead, but were actually still alive, were also carted away and buried.""

The war will then essentially become a somewhat continuous south-to -east front where the Russians will become defensive rather than offensive, leaving the difficult task of attacking to the Ukrainians for a change. 

They'll claim to have denazified and demilitarized Ukraine and liberated the Donbass, potentially satisfying the domestic audience and saving face for Putin. They additionally will have achieved a land bridge to Crimea, which was a large strategic wish. 

Then the most likely strategy is to try and exhaust the Ukrainians, try to achieve peace through diplomatic means and influence campaigns, and potentially just outright threaten to throw a nuke on anyone that attacks them since they now count those parts of Ukraine to be ""Russia"" and therefore it satisfies their requirement for using nukes. 

As things stand now, it's hard to see Ukraine agree to that. If the Ukrainians are prepared for a long war, you'd think they'd be successful. Imagine how many soldiers they could have trained and equipped in one year from now. How is Russia going to match that without general mobilization?

Ukraine is growing in strength substantially due to the activation of their reserves, Ukrainians returning to fight, and foreign volunteers. This is addition to the influx of modern weapons to arm those soldiers. The total available Ukrainian force is over 1 million, while Russia can’t have more than 250,000 soldiers in Ukraine. 

This it at the same time the Russian military is waning in power. Their soldiers in the north are now out of the fight while they reorganize and potentially relocate. Russia can grow in strength as well, but they would need to draft more than the 135,000 they did, and they are already short on advanced weapons. I don’t see how Russia can build a force that exceeds what they sent into Ukraine before 2023, maybe 2024. That is in terms of personnel; I don’t know if Russia would ever be able to rebuild their advanced tanks, etc, especially while under sanctions.

Once the Ukrainians can shift the focus outside Kyiv, plus apply their newly organized combat power, they will be able to move significant combat power to the East. My original thought was that Ukraine would launch the first major counterattack from Zhytomer across the Kyiv axis, but the Russian retreat made that move pointless. My prediction was wrong because the Ukrainians are doing even better than I predicted 4 weeks ago, when I was told I was a delusional Ukrainian fanboy.

The next best move would be an major attack out of Dnipro with intent to relive Mariupol and cut off the Crimean land bridge. This avoids the destroyed bridges in the south near Kherson. This could be a force of 250,000 Ukrainians or more. Ukraine could then reinforce the attacked area with more troops to defend the Donetsk axis while wheeling the attack force down into Crimea, where they would outnumber the Russian forces by 5-1.

Ukraine would likely also make secondary attacks against Putins stupid bridge to stop reinforcements from Russia to Crimea at the same time, as well as starting to use their newly acquired anti-ship missiles against the Black Sea fleet.",False,1648918232.0,t3_tu9wwh,t1_i34dr6i,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Then, if accounts are true, they dug trenches into the radioactive soil, disturbing more dust. The very radioactive topsoil and some trees were buried, which they might have disturbed, again potentially inhaling the dust. They then lived in these trenches for near a month. They potentially burnt radioactive wood to stay warm, releasing radioactive smoke they would have inhaled. In such an environment, it would be impossible to keep dirt or dust off your food, plates, utensils, mugs, etc - so they likely also consumed radioactive particles.

The type of radiation there is alpha, which can't even get through paper. Outside of the body it isn't a major threat, because the dead layer of skin is enough to prevent it entering the body. But if you inhale it or ingest it, it essentially can't escape from your body and it can cause the most damage.

So, if they did indeed live in the red forest for a month, and build trenches / latrines / ate food there in the open / burnt wood there, I can believe that after a month they could be feeling very unwell.

>India and Pakistan become embroiled in their third conflict as Pakistan descends into a civil war that ends with the creation of Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, on December 6. Despite evidence of the Pakistan Army’s violence against its own citizens in East Pakistan, the United States sides with Islamabad, given its mediating role in Nixon’s rapprochement with China. India also signs a twenty-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in August, sharply deviating from its previous position of non-alignment in the Cold War.

There were tough relations that still haven't truly mended since the 1970s. I don't think the US or India see each other as adversaries by any means but there's some friction and some cooperation.

https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-india-relations

Meanwhile, the US has always been weirdly cozy with Pakistan. DARPA has worked in Pakistan, we sell them a ton of military equipment, and when they were first established, the US was one of the first to buddy buddy with them. Again, that's not for the west at large, but the US sides with Pakistan over India and India is aware of it.

They don't think they invented everything, etc.

The support of Russia by Russians isn't for nationalistic reasons.  It is for selfish reasons.  Russians are inherently selfish and self-preservationist, on an individual level.  I would say out of the few hundred Russian people I have met in my life, maybe 10% displayed some sort of national pride.  

I will give you an anecdote.  I once met a Russia man and his wife on vacation in Cuba.  We were talking about Russia.  He was based on Siberia.  I said 'oh you have wild horses', his response (and I am LITERALLY going verbatim on this recount) was 'no, only oil wells'.  I said 'but you have one of the largest lakes in the world, Lake Baikal', 'no, only oil wells' came the response.  Any compliment I attempted to pay him and his country was met with negativity.

> Violence against civilians may be “driven from ‘below’ and tolerated from ‘above,’” i.e., violence as a “practice” (Wood 2018, p. 514); armed group leadership does not order or authorize soldiers to carry out such violence. This category includes violence driven by group-level social processes—including performative processes leading to what Fujii (2013) calls extralethal violence—as well as opportunistic violence that “soldiers initiate to advance their own interests, impulses, or social standing” (Manekin 2020, p. 7).1 Violence as “organizational policy” differs from these other forms of violence in that an armed group's leadership orders or authorizes violence against civilians (Wood 2018). Within this category of violence, the literature focuses primarily on strategic violence against civilians—violence aimed at achieving a military or political objective—but as Wood (2018) points out, violence as organizational policy can also serve internal purposes within armed groups, such as the abduction of women to become soldiers’ “wives.” Restraint toward civilians can also be a deliberate strategic choice by governments or rebel groups (Hoover Green 2016, 2018; Stanton 2016; Wood 2009).

Russia amassed a massive economic war chest to withstand and economic impact from sanctions. The war chest is 600 billion dollars in gold and foreign currency. Which is when compared as a ratio to the GDP is 5 times higher then it normally would be for a normal country.

Now Russia plans to uses that money to in essence fight off the rubles inflation. This can be just buying rubles themselves or making payments in with gold/foreign money at exchange rates that positively affect the rubles.

Russia has also double the interest rate in their banks this strengthens the ruble by encouraging people to hold onto it.

Russia has also demanded 80% of foreign currency income by citizens and companies has to be convert to rubles immediately. This creates a buying pressure on the ruble which helps strengthen is exchange rate.

Два транспортно-боевых вертолета Ми-8 ВС российской федерации сбили вчера военнослужащие 95-й отдельной десантно-штурмовой бригады ВСУ

Вертолеты были уничтожены на Харьковщине расчетом отечественного переносного противотанкового ракетного комплекса «Корсар»». Это первый случай, когда с ПТРК успешно уничтожена воздушная цель!

После поражения ракетой неуправляемый воздушный противник столкнулся еще с одним российским вертолетом, летевшим сзади.

 ▪️Військовослужбовцями 95-ї окремої десантно-штурмової бригади ЗСУ 1 квітня були знищені вертольоти в районі Харківщини розрахунком вітчизняного переносного протитанкового ракетного комплексу «Корсар». Це перший випадок, коли з ПТРК успішно знищено повітряну ціль;

Yes, and meant it.

Add to that an unpredictable, self-aggrandizing, authoritarian regime, and North Korea is a fair (if scaled-down) Asian analogue to the potential threat posed to Europe by Russia.

Hot war wouldn't really be a contest, in terms of conventional force parity, but the risk of massive collateral damage (up to and including MAD) is still too high to chance it.

It took \~14 years to get to a point where it would happen, lead to a civil war and coincided with a perfect storm to allow it to happen of:

&#x200B;

\- weak ineffective Russian leadership

&#x200B;

\- loss of support of the army due to the heavy losses and poor decisions in WW1.

Ukraine only left the 1st Armored Brigade to protect Kyiv from the north as well as a scattering of mobile forces elsewhere. Most of the first phase of the war was fought as light infantry by the Ukrainians, moving around in trucks. Obviously, there were many Ukrainian tanks active and many lost in heavy fighting against a larger force, but the overall tank activity was low relative to what it could be. Some of the force was sent to contain breakthroughs, but much remains on standby to preserve a mobile fist for the extremely obvious strategic counter offensive in the next phase of the war.

Don’t discount the Ukrainian Army’s mobile capability. Keep in mind the some of the best tanks the Soviet Union had were built in Ukraine. Now they have tank factories (maybe only the Lviv plant now) upgrading the older chassis to modern western standards with thermal imaging, fire control, C3i systems, and modern radios. These forces have also been training with NATO for years, and almost their entire reserve military has combat experience in Donbas. Compare this to Russian reserves who are mostly 1 year conscripts with little experience beyond hazing.

Also keep in mind the amount of intel that the west can provide increases the closer to Poland or the Black Sea the fight is. Notice the difference in Ukrainian fighting between Kyiv and Sumy. This mostly because of better western intel. One of the first escalation points we blew through was Russia demanding “the West won’t provide real-time intelligence” and the West saying “No, I think we will”. /r/forte10 will be able to see every Russian move in Crimea and tell the Ukrainians exactly where to hit.  The best part is that Russia can’t do anything about it. The just have to sit there under the ever watchful eye of Uncle Sam via at least one RQ-4 Global Hawk. If the Russians attack a US aircraft operating over international waters, that’s an immediate invocation of Article V and NATO has 90,000 of its best troops lined up on the border.

For those reasons, I think Ukraine will have more success on the offense than Russia. They also have the benefit of reclaiming their own land, immediate advantages in the amount of personnel, increasing advantages in equipment quality, and most importantly, belief in their cause. Ukraine doesn’t just have to “accept” that “Crimea is off the table”.

A month ago, very early into the war, I predicted pretty much exactly what has happened: That not only would the Russians fail to capture Kyiv, but they would be defeated before May. I was called all sorts of names by people saying that it was obvious Russia was going to win and I was just “high on copioum”. Not only was I right, the Ukrainians beat my optimistic prediction by a month.

This became obvious once the Ukrainians were shown on many videos destroying fuel trucks the first few days. A modern army runs on fuel and the fact the Ukrainians knew this, could target them, and were capable of doing it many times showed all I needed to see about the relative strength of Ukraine, despite being outnumbered. Now, the Ukrainians aren’t outnumbered. The Ukrainian Army is now quietly 4x larger than the Russian army in Ukraine.

Yes. 90% plus of Ukrainians support fighting for 1991 borders. They now have victory in the Battle of Kyiv with the Russians running away to Belarus with their tail between their legs.

For my next prediction, the next Russian offensive in Donbas, if they can mount one, will be similar 1917 Kerensky Offensive. The Russian Army, demoralized from losses, attack again into a better equipped enemy. They advance some, but the Army halts, and eventually disintegrates while their own side resorts to death threats to push them forward more.

It's often easier to predict 5 years ahead in a war than 1 or 2 months.

OK let's do a thought experiment... What needs to happen to set the conditions for a break of the siege of Mariupol, assuming no peace/ceasefire?

Primary access is from the North and from the WSW (Melitopol).

To access from the North you either need to take control of the separatist border areas, OR make inroads south to Melitopol.

So we're back at a significant push south, even then the access from the North will be butting up against separatist areas, not going to be nice.

So the WSW.

Melitopol. To access from this avenue, you basically need Berdiansk as well.

These are two major centres, just to access Mariupol reliably.

The plus side is that retaking Melitopol also causes issues for Kherson.

You then end up in a situation where Ukraine would likely have to choose between trying to get Berdiansk or surrounding Kherson.

Based on what's left in both centres, Kherson is likely the high priority compared with Mariupol; easier effort for better results. Berdiansk, maybe for trade but Russian Navy is out there.

Summary:

- Any move on Mariupol most likely is preceded by retaking of Melitopol, at minimum a push in that direction.

- Any retake of Melitopol could also be an indicator of a move on Kherson or the wider southern region.

- The situation in Mariupol means that at a cold, hard logical view, many other areas are of higher strategic value.

- Ukraine has demonstrated to date a willingness to make the logically correct but very difficult decisions.

- This is just napkin logic with a map.

The Ukrainian Army is now substantially bigger and that’s just a direct fact. The Russians went into Ukraine with 170,00 soldiers. They’ve been reinforced but they’ve also taken extremely heavy losses and probably can’t have more than 250,000 soldiers, but likely have closer to 200,000 combat ready soldiers. Ukraine has nearly a million soldiers in their active and reserve militaries, plus large amounts of foreign volunteers. They have also drafted military age men in Western Ukraine, and 70% of Ukrainian men of military age, some 10 million men said they would fight. The Ukrainian Army is now a million men at least, maybe substantially more.

The Russian units that have been the hardest hit were the combat soldiers in the most professional BTGs. Losses in front line units are often above 60%. This kind of loss of professional force doomed Japan in WWII. Russian can throw unhappy conscripts into human waves, but they can’t make a professional fighting force in less than a year. I don’t think they have the capability to expand much more. Russia’s stores of military gear is rusty old crap, Western nations keep their reserve fleet in kept in like new condition, because if you need gear from the stockpile, you obviously need it to work.

So maybe back off on the condescension.  And if I was unclear I'll try one more time: 

My question is for those who say ""absolute free speech is a guarantee against tyranny and any restriction on speech leads to a slippery slope to tyranny"" -- which is a lot of people on the far right AND far left in the US -- and it is -- to repeat it again -- this: Germany bans some political speech that promotes Nazi ideology and symbols. Bans it. You can go to jail for displaying a swastika. And yet Germany is a wealthy free country with better democratic participation, of a wider ideological spectrum, in its elections by far than the US. It has excellent civil rights protections otherwise. A strong civil society. Plenty of dissenters. No political prisoners I'm aware of.  Really strong courts and a fair criminal justice system with far lower rates of incarceration or poverty than the US. A remarkably strong free press. Lots of free enterprise making many Germans wealthy. Its citizens value freedom and enjoy it.  They also enjoy an effective government.  You also don't see daily mass shootings and police killings of unarmed innocent people. They do enjoy government funded and excellent health care. So for some values of ""freedom"" and some kinds of citizens, I suspect Germans enjoy more freedom than many Americans believe they themselves do. 

So where's the slippery slope? 

It seems to me that empirically ""only absolute free speech preserves freedom and democracy"" is a disproven hypothesis. That is if you even accept the falsehood that the US has ever allowed ""absolute"" free speech. 

And by the way if an ugly, genocidal, shameful history is sufficient cause for banning symbols, why do Americans tolerate the flag of treason and slavery everywhere (the ""confederate battle flag?""). The history of that symbol is no less shameful than a swastika.

You say that as some sort of gotcha, but I never said that all violence and killings were of the disorganized category. We were discussing this subject in the context of the horrific images that have come out today. My point is that these images and these killings are the hallmark of wanton killings and indeed ""driven from below"". 

The article you are linking is that Russia is or was planning to kill and remove very specific people as a means to retain power in an occupied country. That is violence as well certainly of a different kind. Those people would have been arrested or otherwise rounded up and detained or executed ""cleanly"". What we are seeing here is rape, torture, random killings as displays of frustration and dominance, for sport even.

Essentially what you are doing is changing the subject. You got upset with me because I pointed out that these killings were of a disorganized ""bottom up"" nature, when I argued my point you have now switched subjects by pointing to a different set of (planned) killings/removals. 

They are not the same, and neither type by the way leaves the Russian command blameless or innocent. They bear full responsibility for what happened here. But there is a difference between responsibility and guilt. In the case of these ""bottom up"" killings they are responsible because they have been negligent, and depending on the circumstances complicit because they knew and did nothing. If they gave direct orders however, they would have been directly guilty. 

Either way they are terrible people. But fact is, they did not order these killings that we are seeing here today - and your point was that they undeniably did so, to the point that I should go and fuck myself because I was daring to take different point of view.",False,1648943387.0,t3_tu9wwh,t1_i35z9tv,,7,-1,0,-1,0,0,

1.  Were you there?  Did you actually see the helicopters attack that fuel depot?  Can you prove that helicopters, Ukrainian or Russian were used?  I don't think so.  It's entirely possible that the tanks were destroyed using easy to acquire explosives (there's a war going on, you might have heard about it) and that the saboteurs then blamed Ukrainian helicopters.  
2. Personally, I think it was probably a Ukrainian strike and they are just denying it to mess with Russia.  But we cannot confirm that at this point, which means it is reasonable to consider other alternatives.
3. It's not that hard to blow up a fuel tank with simple explosives, particularly if said tank is mostly empty and full of fumes.  It is also not that hard to have a couple of people post modified footage of a helicopter flying around at night online to create more confusion and allow you to then blame the destruction of the fuel tanks on these helicopters.  
4. No one needs pilots or painted helicopters when you can just blow up the tanks at night and blame it on those pesky Ukrainians.  Funny how quick the local government was to come out and blame it on Ukrainian helicopters, don't you think?
5. Flying low enough to the ground, it would be possible for a well planned strike package to infiltrate and attack, thus presenting a saboteur with a rational excuse as to why the tanks were destroyed.  If the helicopters were below radar coverage, of course there would be no evidence of their flight in and out.  And of course, all evidence of rockets or weaponry would also be destroyed in the fire at the tanks.
6. Why would Russians blow up their own fuel tanks?  To hide years of theft and fraud.  To hide the fact that they don't have the amount of fuel that they are supposed to have in those tanks, and that they can thus not supply that fuel as ordered.  It's every man for himself, and the guy in charge of the tanks doesn't care if this hurts the Russian war effort- he just wants his money and to avoid going to jail.
7. That doesn't mean that those tanks were always empty.  It's not hard to move fuel around internally and those tanks could have been partially full just a day or two ago.  Then they were drained, the fuel moved to other tanks to top them off, and then the empty tanks destroyed.
8. Destroying the empty tanks after topping off the other tanks allows the corrupt administrator to hide the fact that he did not have all of the fuel he was supposed to have.

Again, I think it was a Ukrainian strike that did in those fuel tanks.  But there are reasonable explanations for why it might have been sabotage, and this is a task that could have been accomplished with only a handful of individuals using equipment readily available in the area.
