Ukraine's strategic goal, in addition to the unconditional return of territories, is to create conditions that make it impossible for aggression to be repeated in the future. Conversely, any ""war freezing scenario"" with Russia's territorial annexations fixed, as some Western observers are considering, and without Ukraine's NATO membership (because the war is not over) will only encourage Moscow to increase its appetite and return to war after a short break. That is why there is no alternative to Ukraine's Peace Formula: strengthening the army, accelerating the supply of weapons, de-occupation of the territory, regime change in Russia, compensation from the new government, and mandatory punishment of war criminals.""

Evidence of this is the level at which the AFU is sending reinforcements there from the 126th Territorial Defense Brigade. This appears to be a strategic change from the marine and SOF units previously used in the cross-river assaults. Russian sources have also describe seeing ""boat after boat"" being sent there to deliver reinforcements and remove any wounded for treatment and, unfortunately, any KIA's.

On their part, the Russian forces continue attempts to dislodged AFU forces but are under constant and intense artillery fire from the right bank and mortar fire from units at the bridgehead. The AFU has also been targeting nearby Russian assembly areas, logistics points and ammunition dumps in Radens'k, Oleshky and Nova Kakhovka that are used in support of their units in the local AO (Oleshky and Kozachi Laheri).

They'll likely be more in a support role.  There aren't very many Russian fighters in Ukraine because neither side lets their aircraft get that close due to ground based AA.  The role of F-16s will be more to deliver bombs like JDAMs, act as a quick-reacting anti-helicopter weapon, mayyybe take out slower cruise missiles, and mayyybe deliver Harpoons.  If there is a F-16 vs. SU-35 dogfight its because someone screwed up or someone is desperate.  

2) I do agree with the idea that what will eventually bring victory to Ukraine is Russian equipment attrition.  Infantry alone can only do so much.  The loss of much of their (functional) tank and BMP forces mean that their offensive capability is neutered.  The erosion of their artillery is what is going to neuter their defensive capability.  The only other things I can see ending it earlier is a complete collapse of Western support of Ukraine or a political earthquake in Moscow.

But anyway, there is a huge significance in this - Russia is barely a net exporter anymore, and further decrease in exports and (somewhat) stable imports would result in Russia being a net importer after a few months (assuming that it isn't the case already). 

Assuming that Russia is a net importer, and that Ruble is crashing against other important currencies (USD, EUR), imply that import prices relative to the Russia's population income would skyrocket (as goods are purchased for USD and EUR which would be worth more RUB). That puts the Russian state in a very uncomfortable position - they either have to drain reserves to keep the Ruble stable, start printing money, or they have reallocate funds from the military activities. If they do not choose any of the options above, then the population might face a decrease in life standards, and (spoiler alert) last time it had resulted in the USSR's collapse, so we might expect some friction appearing in the state structure yet again.
