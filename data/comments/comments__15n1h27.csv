The past week hasn’t been the quietest, though Kharkiv has only been targeted directly once. About 4 days ago at 9am Russians fired at least 2 S-300 missiles from Belgorod, afterwards we heard 2 very loud explosions happen here in the city. Later it was reported that they hit some enterprise’s building, thankfully there was no fire and no casualties were reported.

Other than that missile strike, many towns in Kharkiv oblast have been getting shelled and hit with missiles and glide bombs pretty much every day. It’s not something that is notable enough to make international news, but it’s getting covered in our local news/by our governor and it is happening constantly. We get reports about residential buildings getting hit with glide bombs almost every day, and sadly most of the time there are civilian casualties, like that time last week when they hit a blood transfusion center in Kupiansk.

I know that for many the news about civilians from Kupiansk region being ordered to evacuate might come as a surprise, but if you follow the local news, you would see that Russians target our civilian neighborhoods with their glide bombs and missiles daily. If you are a civilian living near Kupiansk, then you are basically their priority number one, so evacuation order is the only right choice in this situation, same as it was with the evacuation of civilians from the Donbass region last year. And no, it doesn’t mean that Russians are about to steamroll our defenses as some people might think, the evacuation is happening because otherwise more of our civilians could die for no reason. 

Russians also continue to target civilians in other regions. Yesterday they destroyed a temple in Zaporizhzhia with Iskander missiles and killed multiple civilians, today they hit the same city, but targeted a hotel building this time, killing at least one civilian and injuring many more. It’s a place popular with journalists and it also housed a children’s camp, but thankfully all children were evacuated from the building before the strike. I’ll never stop wondering what the fuck they are trying to achieve by purposefully targeting civilians, because none of these strikes ever make sense.",False,1691705811.0,t3_15n1h27,t3_15n1h27,,0,175,0,175,0,0,

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/us/politics/biden-ukraine-aid.html

>President Biden asked Congress on Thursday for another $24 billion to help Ukraine and other countries affected by Russia’s invasion, the first time lawmakers have been asked to increase financing for the war effort since Republicans took over the House in January.

> The request will test whether the expansive American effort to bolster Ukraine retains the bipartisan support it has enjoyed in Washington since Russian forces crossed the border nearly 18 months ago. Leading Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump, have grown increasingly vocal in expressing skepticism or opposition to more aid for Ukraine.

> “The president has reaffirmed that we will stand with Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty for as long as it takes, a strategy that has successfully united our allies and partners and equipped Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression,” Shalanda D. Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California.

> Mr. McCarthy said in June that any supplemental appropriation request for Ukraine was “not going anywhere” and that additional aid would have to be worked out in the regular congressional spending process. Seventy House Republicans voted last month to cut off Ukraine altogether and while that suggests a bipartisan majority remains, it was unclear if Mr. McCarthy would defy such a large segment of his conference.

> The president’s request includes $13.1 billion for military aid to Ukraine and replenishment of Pentagon weapons stocks used for the war effort. Another $8.5 billion would go for economic, humanitarian and other assistance to Ukraine and other countries affected by the war, and $2.3 billion to leverage more aid from other donors through the World Bank.

> The supplemental appropriation request also includes $12 billion for disaster relief, $4 billion for border security and $60 million for wildland firefighter pay. The combined $40 billion total of the request will challenge the spending limits that Mr. Biden negotiated with Mr. McCarthy in May.

> Dan Caldwell, the vice president of the Center for Renewing America, a right-wing think tank influential among House Republicans and Freedom Caucus members, said his organization would work to try to kill Mr. Biden’s request.

> “Congress should not spend billions more in support of continuing a war in which there are no vital American interests at stake and where there remains a real risk of nuclear escalation,” Mr. Caldwell said. “Speaker McCarthy made clear after the passage of the debt limit deal that he would not support supplemental spending packages like the one the Biden administration is requesting.

[https://twitter.com/SPlokhy/status/1689590616789860352](https://twitter.com/SPlokhy/status/1689590616789860352) 

>When Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine in February 2022, it marked the bloody end of the post-Second World War European security settlement. It has cost thousands of lives and spurred the largest movement of people in Europe – either within Ukraine or fleeing the country altogether – since 1945.
>  
>Now, the Ukrainian army, with Western assistance, is in the middle of a crucial counter-offensive to throw the Russian occupiers out of their land. For historian Serhii Plokhy, a professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University, Putin's invasion and the Russian state's increasingly authoritarian, nationalistic and repressive policies at home raise obvious parallels with the historic monster of the 20th century: Nazi Germany.   
>  
>""The two countries lost the war,"" he begins. ""In the case of Germany, that was World War One; in the case of the Soviet Union, that was the Cold War, and they are dealing with the question of the so-called 'divided nation'. The Germans were obsessed with bringing together \[German-speakers\] within the borders of one greater Germany. Putin's Russia \[has become\] obsessed with the annexation of \[Ukrainian\] territory and bringing Crimea 'back home'. So the parallels between the annexation of Crimea and the \[1938\] Anschluss of Austria are very obvious.""  
>  
>For Plokhy, the importance of the historical parallels is made more potent when one considers what he calls the “fruitless efforts” of “Old Europe” to find a peace settlement. 
>
>It is here, he believes, that the similarities between the lead-up to 2022 and 1939 are most stark and most worrying.  
>  
>In the 1930s, ""Old Europe"" meant Britain and France, who, still recovering from the devastation of the First World War, saw the policy of appeasement as the best way to maintain peace in Europe. ""There was a lot of wishful thinking involved that no one wanted to go to war. The idea was that appeasement was a solution,"" says Plokhy.  
>  
>But, although it did give European countries time to re-arm, appeasement did not prevent war. After Anschluss, Germany moved to swallow the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. Like in Ukraine, Nazi propaganda used the Czechoslovak state's oppression of local German speakers as justification for the move. Hitler's gambit paid off. Britain and France capitulated to Germany's demands, and the Sudetenland – and then the majority of Czechoslovakia – was absorbed into the Reich.  
>  
>For Plokhy, the policy of appeasement is the historical antecedent for modern-day Germany's strategy before February 2022. ""This is more or less the behaviour of 'Old Europe' this time, with Germany being in the leading seat when defining this policy. Since the early 1970s, when the Soviet Union started to export oil and gas to Central Europe and Eastern Europe, Germany has had a policy of Ostpolitik, the policy of détente. It looked like it produced results. The Berlin Wall fell, right?""   
>  
>Through the end of the 20th century and the start of the 21st, the policy towards Russia remained broadly static. But, for Plokhy, leading Western countries lost touch with developments inside the country. ""The trick was that the world changed,"" he says. ""The Russia of Vladimir Putin is not the Soviet Union of Mikhail Gorbachev or Leonid Brezhnev. It was a much more aggressive, revisionist power, much more so than the Soviet Union. But Germans continued basically on the old track. In the \[2008\] Russian invasion of Georgia, the German response was, 'Let's build Nord Stream 1'. The \[2014\] Russian annexation of Crimea, the start of the war in Ukraine? Let's build Nord Stream 2!""  
>  
>Guilty of misunderstanding the new Russia, Western countries' apathy and thirst for natural resources had dire consequences. ""The idea was, 'OK, we will engage Russians with trade, and somehow they \[will\] be less prone to go to war'. In reality, what was happening, Europe, Old Europe, partially new Europe as well – in exchange for Russian gas – was sending more and more money to Russia, really making Putin's rearmament possible and contributing in that way to this war.""  
>  
>While researching his new book, Plokhy looked into the character of Vladimir Putin to present the most illuminating portrait of the Russian leader. [...] Much of what [Putin] is saying and what he believes in, like 'Russians and Ukrainians are the same people', comes straight from the history textbooks of 19th-century Imperial Russia.  
>  
>""Putin is someone who tries to use the outdated imperial ideology to move forward; the ideology of the 19th century to move into the 21st century. In that sense, I would say, he is a hostage of bad history.""  
>  
>The depressing conclusion Plokhy has come to after studying the parallels between the 1930s and the years leading up to 2022 is that Europe does not learn from history.   
>  
> ""I, and probably many others, lived with this belief that somehow we as humanity, we learnt from our past, we learnt from our mistakes,"" he says. ""And looking at these parallels, the uncomfortable idea comes to mind that actually we don't learn or don't learn enough.""

* Fake news disinformation accounts: These are probably run directly by the FSB. They tend to link to propaganda videos on obscure streaming sites and have ridiculous names.

* Fake persons with English names but profiles that make it unlikely they are real person. The names also feel somewhat contrived, e.g. just ""Richard"", and sometimes are clearly made up, such as the infamous ""Suzie Rottencrotch"" on Youtube. Most of them sound more British than US and consist of Firstname+Lastname, though. They tend to not have profile pictures on Youtube, which is weird since it's not hard to add one.

Through a variety of factors, some by hook, some by crook - the war continuing with increasing levels of sanctions, the winter of 2022-2023 being fairly warm and cutting down fuel usage, the quick mobilization economically to fill in the petroleum supply gaps in Europe, a drop in petroleum prices, a drop in Chinese raw input requirements (amongst other factors) - the current economic and financial situation doesn't favor the Russians from here on out.

I'm not sure this is driving the Ukrainian conservative posture, though.   The Ukrainians have managed the war fairly well, but they were clearly hoping for something more decisive out of the early phases of the current counteroffensive.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as well as they hoped.  In a bid to prevent chewing through soldiers and equipment at a Russian rate, they reverted to a more conservative approach.   I think it's more a sober tactical and strategic strategy assessment that's put the brakes on the offensive, and not concerns about the economic situation.

The less-obvious one was whether you can carry out operations that will ensure you can keep your equipment and supplies ready for a decisive strike or operation, while keeping the opponents supply and burn rate elevated, so that the enemy is forced to consume supplies faster.

Looking at this in an armchair manner, the reason I think the Russians have been able to manage a somewhat threatening offensive movement in the North and a stronger defense in the South this summer was due to them using the undersupplied and underequipped  'meat assault' tactics in Bakhmut and other spots along the front during the winter and spring.  It wasn't necessarily that they were out of supplies by the time last winter hit - it looks like they were hoarding everything for a larger assault later, and hoping to keep the Ukrainians burning through their own supplies by sustaining attacks throughout a time you would normally expect to be able to refit and resupply your units during an operational lull.

*“They are wrong,” says Vitaly, a tank operator from the 15th National Guard, of Western criticism of their progress. “We have success. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends on how fortified they (the Russians) are.” The Russian troops had a year to get ready, he notes, adding: “The biggest problem is underestimation of the enemy.”*

*""After months of headlines about Russian incompetence and disarray, they are learning that Moscow’s better troops – the paratroopers on the southern frontlines – have not forgotten their training. “You shouldn’t honor the enemy,” says Vlad. “But don’t underestimate him.”*

Stark reminders it's not just the troops pushing on the direct front that face the dangers and losses.  All glory to the medics that keep as many as they can alive.

*""Yet the major handicap Ukraine faces in this already difficult fight is palpable in the cratered streets of Orikhiv. Russian air superiority is taking Ukrainian lives daily, with half-ton bombs landing frequently – sometimes 20 in as many minutes.*

*Life underground is nerve-shredding. A Russian rocket – or guided glide bomb – could hit at any time, and they have been showing some accuracy, says one Ukrainian soldier. Ukrainian troops constantly relocate and hide their vehicles at every opportunity to frustrate Russian targeting.*

*Still, vast destruction has plagued Orikhiv’s main buildings. The “invincibility point,” a converted school where the few remaining civilians received handout food and could wash, was hit in June, killing five. That building and several nearby are leveled, and smoke from another blast that morning still smolders. The smell of death haunted one apartment block that was torn through by a missile. Some streets of the town smell of explosives. Military casualties are not declared.*

*Among the most closely hunted of Ukraine’s forces are Orikhiv’s military medics, whose lives are spent mostly underground, their last two triage points bombed. Their bunker is where they wait, nocturnal even in the day, a cardboard Sharpie sign saying “Night club” on the wall. Only dark humor fits here and death is close enough to be shrugged off.*

*“When they hit further than 100 meters away from us we don’t pay attention,” says one medic, Eugene. “If it’s closer we just laugh hysterically.”*

*His colleague Vlad adds: “I tell everybody, we will all die. But a bit later. Maybe in 50 years.”*

*Disrupting casualty evacuations appears to them to be a Russian priority. “The Russians let the ambulance get to the casualty,” Eugene says. “But as soon as we load them, they unleash everything on us. Anti-tank rockets, grenade launchers, mortars. We lost five wheels on our APC during two days of the assault.”*

*Eugene adds that they rarely treat casualties at the collection point. “We do everything inside (the ambulance) at high speed. And the road isn’t the best one. What was our speed record? 180 km an hour.”""*",False,1691684629.0,t3_15n1h27,t1_jvkz6w0,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Moreover there will usually be a second line as mentioned- this goes back to the time of WW1 where the Siegfried Line became the first preplanned large scale one. Basically with the second line a token force can be kept up front for shelling, then when it’s over reinforcements can be rushed up, or if necessary all can fall back.

In modern days artillery, machine guns and more will cover the line, along with bunkers.

Unfortunately, relative to everything else, building these kinds of things are *CHEAP*. Not pennys but even mines are fairy cheap and can be mass deployed, and for trenches the majority of the cost is just labor- bunkers are concrete. 

For a more primitive war like this it can get really bloody really fast as digging in doesn’t take much time at all. Even Iran-Iraq was a lot like this.

Blowing the dam was a huge tactical move by Russia that likely stalled most of the southern offensive plans. The Russian offensive is likely to prevent further movement of Ukraine by pinning significant forces that might have to respond.

What does screw over the military is having your troops forcibly discharged for being gay, as well as the anxiety that comes from the threat of discrimination, which can lead to breakdown of trust within the unit.

A poll in 2006 allegedly found that only 5 per cent of personnel would struggle if a homosexual was included in their specific unit, 
this was during the Don't Ask Don't Tell battle.

Versus 76 per cent who claimed to be supportive, or at least comfortable.

That's going to make it even easier for Putin to keep Russia fighting and to move alot of Russian citizens from apathy about the war to actively supporting it.
