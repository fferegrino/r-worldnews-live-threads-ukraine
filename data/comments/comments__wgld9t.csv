6a2f1cc366adb997273d0578d06471d6,wgld9t,ij0ffxs,"📰 [Daily War Summary] Summary of the events which transpired on Thursday, August 4^th. 

🪖 No major territory changed hands on Thursday.  [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1555386911891398656), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555242099301294081.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555383581228388352.html) go over all the details of the day.

🪖 More people are noticing that russia’s mass movement of troops into Kherson looks more like its setting up for [an offensive operation](https://twitter.com/Apex_WW/status/1555265467815809027) than a defensive one.  This was mentioned in the recap last week and the Ukrainian response was “[offensive is the most stupid thing they can do](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1553183347152769024)”.

🍄 Correction: Yesterday I accidentally posted the same video of the Ukrainian train strike twice.  Unfortunately, the video I wanted to post can’t be found as I delete my twitter bookmarks after posting these summaries.

👉 On Thursday, Amnesty International [released a report](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555212868215361537.html) condemning certain Ukrainian tactics in the war.  While there have been [many](https://twitter.com/PhillipsPOBrien/status/1555258059651534848) eloquent [rebuttals](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555167248679157763.html) of the report, perhaps the most damning is that in preparing the report Amnesty actively [ignored and suppressed input](https://twitter.com/Val_Voshchevska/status/1555272472240463873) ([translation](https://twitter.com/ForosLucius/status/1555286146258714627)) from their own Ukrainian chapter.   Amnesty dismissed criticism of the report as “[mobs and trolls](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555314884476387328)”.

👉  russia is preparing to launch a spy satellite for iran, but will [use it first for the war](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1555265325146509312) in Ukraine before [handing it over](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555382955190657024).

👉 While roughly 30,000 school-aged children have returned to Ukraine, some 640,000 remain [abroad as refugees](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1555320174835748864).  The EU has [extended the temporary protection](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1555327724075483137) for Ukrainian refugees through the spring of 2024 and refugees will have access to education, medicine, housing and employment in the EU.

👉 russia sentenced basketball player Brittney Griner to [9 years in a penal colony](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555214302986092544.html).  The US continues to work on a prisoner swap with russia to get her released.

👉 On Wednesday, Ukraine killed “Korsa”, [an infamous commander](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1555242171812515842) from Donetsk.  On Thursday the funeral was [apparently shelled](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1555137158649880579), though Ukraine [denied responsibility](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1555135434757382147).

👉 To aid in coordination and reduce waste, NATO plans to establish a [Joint Trust Fund](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1555267334108880896) for Ukraine, consolodating six separate funds.

 👉 It’s believed russia will remove [12,000 tons of ammunition](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1555199836307292160) from the territory of Belarus by the end of August.

🥷 russians in occupied Bilovodsk were searching for Ukrainian partisans and [found some](https://twitter.com/serhey_hayday/status/1555197416156037121) who shot up their car.

💰🇺🇦 Ukraine bought a [rescue helicopter](https://twitter.com/Hromadske/status/1555198615454453761) raised through the United24 fundraising platform launched by Ukraine President Zelensky.

💰🇲🇰 In the early 2000’s Ukraine sold 4 Su-25 aircraft to Macedonia.  On Thursday it’s reported that macedonia has [gifted those airplanes back](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1555259519432892423) to Ukraine.

💰🇫🇮 Finland looks ready to [limit tourist visas](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555238956056420357.html) to russians.  

🔥 russia is [seen “flaring gas”](https://twitter.com/HannaLiubakova/status/1555249904922120193) — burning it off at the well — as they have [no place to send it](https://twitter.com/TolomeoNews/status/1555288118219227143).  Capping wells is not easy and could take years to re-establish flow, so venting and flaring is likely seen as an intermediate step hoping the gas markets to the EU reopen.  Given the global climate crisis, unproductively burning billions of cubic feet of gas is only bad news for the entire world.

🎁🇨🇦 Canada will send up to [225 military instructors](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1555268588541468672) to the UK to help train Ukrainian troops.

🎁🇺🇸 The US is providing the World Health Organization with [$1.8 million](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555234809395531777) to support healthcare in Ukraine.

🌾 Ukrainian intelligence services are investigating, and identifying collaborators behind [large-scale grain theft](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555224299144941568) as well as the [countries used](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1555249800957894656).  According to Ukrainian intelligence, russia has stollen more than [650,000](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555224302961786881) tons of grain worth more than $200 million since the war began.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.

Presently the advantage [belongs to Ukraine](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288).

>Here is the Ukrainian translation of the Amnesty Ukraine Team's statement. 

Copied from the included screenshot:

>Today on the anglomovnomu website amnesty international released the material in which
the actions of the armed forces of Ukraine were criticized. It was created based on data
collected by foreign researchers and researchers from the Crisis Response Department of
our organization's global office.

>The Ukrainian office was not involved in the preparation or writing of the text of the publication. And, unfortunately, already at the initial stage of this report, we have entered a dead corner where our team's arguments about the inadmissibility and incomplete of such material were not taken into account.

>On their part, the representatives of the Ukrainian office did everything they could to prevent this material from being published. While our repeated objections were answered with a firm no, we also did everything we could to minimize the spread of the material. We asked authors to send us all versions of the material in advance (unfortunately, it did not happen), we convinced them to ask for an official comment from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, but unfortunately, they did not give enough time to receive no answers and published this study without their comment. We also categorically refused to publish this
press release on our website or translate it into Ukrainian, because of its, in our opinion,
unilateralism. We are very sorry that even after all the possible arguments ""against"" we
were still not heard.

>Every person from the Ukrainian Amnesty office knows that the Russian Federation is responsible for the crimes of aggression against Ukraine. Moreover, a large part of our team are people who personally had to save themselves and loved ones from the war with Russia, leaving everything behind. Some of us have already been displaced or refugees twice.

> February 24, Ukrainian colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that all war crimes are verified and recorded for the international community. We have released more than two dozen materials about crimes committed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. Many of the materials have had international resonance and will be repeatedly used in international institutions in the process of Restoration of Justice.

>But you're right, bureaucracy, misunderstanding of the local context, flexible system of
work, ignoring the opinion of the Ukrainian team and the position of the human rights
community in Ukraine, all of this prevented us from stopping today's release at the stage of the idea how to its was meant 2 be. Nevertheless, with all the mentioned phenomena, we fought to the last. And we will continue to fight in different forms and in different positions, no matter what it costs us. I and the Ukrainian office team believe in human rights, we believe in Ukraine's victory, we believe that all war crimes perpetrators must be brought to justice.

Andrew posted this assessment in his daily update today:

> In Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine is continuing their attacks south towards Dorozhnyanka (16), Nesterianka (17), and Konovalova (18).

> The main fighting going here, though, are artillery duels. And Ukraine is absolutely wiping the floor with Russia. Ukrainian counter battery fire is otherworldly, and they are managing sub one minute response times with their counter battery fire. 

> That is off the scales in terms of speed, and it means they are using predictive fire. Not only is Ukraine killing Russian artillery while they are shooting, they are killing Russian artillery while they are moving into position to shoot. Striking vehicles on the move. 
Russian artillery has suffered so many losses that this week they had to bring in a new artillery brigade to fill in the gaps. That brigade has been pulled out and sent back to Tokmak (19), presumably as a result of their high losses.

Day 163 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was not shelling, but instead they fired their missiles much sooner, at 12:30am, at least 6 of them, some landed in the city and others in the Kharkiv oblast, no idea what was hit yet, but so far it looks like there were no casualties. There was another air raid alert at 11pm, but no missiles followed. Then some channels wrote that actually 2-3 missiles were fired at that time, but they all malfunctioned and fell to the ground, though I don’t think there was any video confirmation.

Yesterday we were shelled from Smerch MLRS with cluster munitions, only residential building got shelled, people were posting photos with shrapnel that penetrated the windows in their home, but thankfully no people died, and only 3 were injured. It helped that it was almost the curfew so there were barely any people outside.

Also with yesterday’s missiles they targeted Chuhuiv, I don’t know what they were trying to destroy but all 4 of them fell in someone’s backyard and destroyed some houses, as always no military equipment was damaged. Do they even know what they are supposed to destroy or do they actually just choose their targets at random?

This isn't about where people's sympathies lie, and I'm not suggesting that the rules of war don't matter.

But any objective analysis or criticism of ukrainian behaviour surely has to start by appreciating the basic realities of the conflict they are in.

- This war is taking place on ukrainian territory in close proximity to civilians because Russia has  invaded ukrainian territory and is seeking to conquer their cities and towns. Settled areas are targets for Russia because they are seeking to conquer them. Unless you are wilfully blind to basic geography that is not remotely up for debate. This isn't a civil war or a sectarian conflict, or a case where two sides have both decided to go to war over a border dispute. Every single death and every single piece of collateral damage in this war is happening for one overriding reason, because Putin is trying to unlawfully seize Ukraine by force. 

- there is incontrovertible evidence, from multiple independent sources, heck, including amnesty international, that Russia has been routinely and indiscriminately attacking Ukrainian civilians since the start of the war. Since February they've used terror against civilians as a weapon, as a means of reprisal or just for kicks.

- Ukraine's military have no choice about whether or not the war continues. They are facing a far larger invading force intent on brutalising their population. They are hugely outmatched in the air and vulnerable to missile attacks. Without any hyperbole, they are fighting for their continued existence.  Russia of course absolutely has a choice. They chose to invade and they could choose to go home and end the invasion tomorrow.

So with those basic realities in mind, under the guise of being 'even handed', the best Amnesty can come up with is Ukrainian troops are basing themselves close to civilians? Given they are perfectly willing to target civilians anyway, do they have any evidence at all that this was affecting russian behaviour? Do they have any evidence that this is a deliberate choice to endanger civilians rather than simply the realities of not having much choice where and how they conceal themselves?. And what is it Amnesty suggesting they do? Camp in a nice open field somewhere with a helpful 'Ukrainian Military here' sign just so any russian planes know exactly where they are? Or maybe move all the civilians to a building away from the conflict and clearly signpost it as such...in fact [they did try that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.9news.com.au/article/ea63d44b-8d35-47e4-a7b0-c2705f5e8645). Russia bombed it anyway.

For an organisation supposedly dedicated to human rights to produce a wilfully naive, trumped up set of allegations at a time when the side that has unlawfully invaded is still there, still trying to push forward, lopping off people's genitals and burning down prisons full of POWS under the guise of being 'even handed' is just reprehensible.

 It is the moral equivalent of watching a violent rape in progress and complaining that the victim tried to knee the attacker in the balls.

 In fact it is probably worse than that. It is very very hard to believe that even the most wilfully stupid 'useful idiot' would be unable to appreciate  they just  handed russia a perfect propaganda excuse for continuing to target civilians- every time it happens now, you can guarantee russia will just shrug and point to this report. So thanks Amnesty, you just made it easier for Russia to kill civilians.

Given it has gone all the way to the organisations Secretary General and she stands by the contents of this report it's really not up for debate what Amnesty stands for. They've wilfully decided to aid a terrorist state and they deserve to be treated with utter contempt and disgust from this point forward. The next time one of their clowns tries to hit you up for cash feel free to refer them to the nearest russian consulate.",1659692665.0,1659691444.0,t3_wgld9t,t3_wgld9t,,0,168,0,168,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 5 August 2022
 

- Following five months of occupation, Russia's intentions regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remain unclear. However, the actions they have undertaken at the facility have likely undermined the security and safety of the plant's normal operations.

- Russian forces are probably operating in the regions adjacent to the power station and have used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river.

- Russian forces have probably used the wider facility area, in particular the adjacent city of Enerhodar, to rest their forces, utilising the protected status of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk to their equipment and personnel from overnight Ukrainian attacks.

[Battle of Austerlitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz)

> After eliminating an Austrian army during the Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until the arrival of the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies[clarification needed], but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. 

> Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. 

> Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.",False,1659705764.0,t3_wgld9t,t3_wgld9t,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

He was using some funky math that doesn't add up (propaganda) so I went through and used the estimates from World Bank, IMF, and CIA and used the list that looks best for the CSTO (The IMF numbers) to get the following data. In short, the standard of living is 2-3x higher in a NATO country than a CSTO country when judging by GDP Per Capita PPP (purchase power parity).  
  
First I showed that by just using GDP Per Capita the NATO average was 2x higher than CSTO. The pro-RU user told me that GDP Per Capita PPP was a better metric (true) but he still provided false numbers, using wikipedia as a source.  
  
I went through and did the math for both NATO and CSTO to find that GDP Per Capita PPP was EVEN WORSE for CSTO than just standard GDP Per Capita.  
  
Results are shocking: It is clear the NATO system is providing a much better standard of living for all members than that of Russia's support for their allies in the CSTO. Makes sense why CSTO members are beginning to pull away from Russia.

>We have published a short note on this topic already on the backup channel (may readers forgive us the dark humor about Minsk-3, God forbid).

>And now let's consider it in more detail.

>Let us begin with the fact that in the distant peaceful year of 2018 there was some talk (including quite official) about the decision to review the pace of implementation of the program with the beautiful title ""Industrial disposal of weapons and military equipment in 2011-2015 and for the period until 2020"". In 2018 at the minimum. Or maybe even earlier.

>Suddenly they remembered that the objects for scrapping have not exhausted their useful life, and that they can be upgraded using secret ""modern technologies"" and even sold to third countries, although they need to do this themselves because the situation in the world is heating up and the friendly forces need something to arm them again.

>Our wise government looked into the water, slapping the greedy hands of near-defense dealers, who were driving the shield and sword of the Motherland for rubles and dollars for recycling. Too bad it was too late.

>Taki came hard times and old iron ""unexpectedly"" (who would have thought, yes, what a passage, this in the age of hypersonic Kuzkin's mother 2.0!) seems to have found work again. And the point here is not in the supposedly huge losses, as trumpeted by the propaganda of one so far unhappy country, but in the very method of conducting combat operations with reliance on the artillery offensive to save the lives of its soldiers as much as possible. We dare to suppose that the T-62s flashed in the photos in the Telegram channels ""came to work"" in the air defense zone with self-propelled guns. The only thing is the range.

>The cannons were also scrapped for nothing and even more actively than the tanks, because it was many times easier to get sellable scrap. What was left in service or emergency was put in service, has a resource and it is NOT ETERNAL.

>In addition, some of the firing units in the NWO area have been out of production for a long time.

>The 240mm Tulpan self-propelled mortar is still firing, although production was discontinued back in 1988.

>The role of barrel artillery in current events is enormous. So is the consumption of ammunition. And the resource of combat equipment (barrel, structural elements, self-propelled system chassis) is also expended rapidly at this rate. Repair and restoration require time and production facilities, and they must be manned by high-class specialists, not by guest workers.

>We do not know what the appropriate authorities of the Ministry of Defense will scrape together in their coffers - they have delayed the recycling program in time. Let us hope that the storage bases are still holding long lines of what can be revived and made to fall on the heads of the foes the Vengeance so long deserved and expected by the people without a break and without any gestures of good will.

>But then North Korea flashed in the information space in connection with these events. Why? Besides the fact of recognition of LNR-DPR as a ""rogue state"", about which the peace-loving public has already made a contemptuous grimace, there is another important circumstance.

>No, we are not talking about new guest workers for Mr. X-lin, the lord of the Human Builders, that is a separate topic.

The only truly great prize(IE: Not some minor concessions) I could see Russia even somewhat reasonably seeking in these recent negotiations with Turkey is an opening of the Turkish Straits to warships, so Russia could reinforce the Black Sea Fleet with the larger ships elsewhere, like the Kirov or the Moskva's sister ships. 

One, would Turkey even be capable of making that call? I'm unfamilar with the century old agreement and the exact rules regarding what calls Turkey can and cannot make. 

And two, what does Russia have, if anything, that could warrant getting such a prize?

>ASAMS (National/Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) is a distributed and networked short- to medium-range[5]: 4  ground-based air defense system developed by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace (KDA) and Raytheon.[6] The system defends against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters, cruise missiles, unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), and aircraft.[5]: 11 

And someone has helpfully updated the page with the Ukraine info!

>On July 1, 2022 the United States through the Pentagon announced as part of $820 million in Ukraine military aid the delivery of NASAMS air defense system through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.[48] A US defence official said: ""The Ukrainians are doing a magnificent job of employing their existing air defense systems, but we all know that Soviet-type systems means that it's Russian made … so over time it will be harder to sustain with the spare parts."" This is part of updating Ukrainian air defence from Soviet era to a ""modern one"".[49] The systems being supplied may come from Norwegian stocks and may be retired units. The DOD has said: ""recognizes Norway's cooperation to enable the historic provision by the United States of modern air defense systems that will help Ukraine defend against Russia’s brutal air attacks.""[50]

Offensives don't just come down to tactical superiority, which Ukraine absolutely has when you compare soldier to soldier on both sides. They have awesome NCOs, well trained senior officers, improved artillery coverage, etc. But large-scale, deep-penetration offensives require a lot more than those things. They require training -- mass exercises -- on large-scale offensives, and they require vast, complex logistical networks with efficient flow of supplies and elastic assignment of duties for whoever happens to be available in the right area to do a new task.

These are things that the US excels at, but that didn't happen overnight. Back in the day when the US first did these offensives, it took a ton of growing pains -- offensives with massive casualties -- and overwhelming naval and wheeled vehicle superiority over the enemy had to exist throughout the entire period.

A lot is talked about with Russia's horrific logistics capabilities. Not nearly as much attention has been given to the quality of Ukraine's logistics. That's partially because Ukraine has been quiet about its logistics capabilities, but it's probably also mostly because Ukraine has been on the defensive. Aside from shoe-horning reserve personnel and ammunition into areas of intense fighting, Ukraine has not had to demonstrate the type of logistical depth and elasticity that a large-scale offensive would require. And even with all that said, even during its defensive fighting, I did actually see quite a bit of (subdued, not well publicized) worrying from independent military observers about Ukraine's weak logistical networks. They were not criticizing Ukraine so much as just noting the serious challenges Ukraine has had in adequately supplying its front-line forces in the face of Russia's artillery obliteration tactics. 

Most experts continue to postulate to this day that Ukraine simply lacks the ability for a sustained, deep-penetrating offensive on the scale that would be required to, say, retake Melitopol. Kherson is just easier because it is on the favorable side of the river and is very close. Melitpol is much farther away from the Ukrainian front line and the UA forces would be under attack from flanks on both their east and west sides during their advance. If they attack Kherson, they would be attacking an exposed Russian salient. If they attack Melitipol, they would be creating a vulnerable, exposed salient of their own that Russia could more easily cut off in a counter-offensive.

I just don't think we're there yet. The UA might have the capability for a deep-penetration offensive in another 6 to 9 months, but probably not this summer or fall.",False,1659707760.0,t3_wgld9t,t1_ij1tzzq,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

These guns caused a lot of problems for the Iraqis by being out of range of return fire. The range of an ordinary projectile is 40 km. And this is the 1980s, though. Since then, the Korean comrades have not stood still and by a number of estimates have increased the range of their upgraded 170 mm systems for some types of ammunition to 70 km, improving other characteristics, in particular the rate of fire.
The Korean leadership is inspecting its long-range guns.
We did not aim to analyze all the available artillery systems of the DPRK army, we will simply note that there are many of them. A country in isolation, a closed society, hunger-cold and Juche, but here is the paradox. Either guns instead of oil, or something else, which the current generation of effective managers cannot understand or repeat.

>All this time North Korea has been actively developing various versions of tank-based self-propelled gun mounts and artillery tractors for the well-known systems and calibers - 122 mm, 152 mm and 130 mm. I.e. theoretically their artillery systems can be integrated into our supply system without radical changes - at least as far as the use of conventional, unguided rounds is concerned.

>Is such a ""cannon deal"" possible and does Russia need it? The question is complicated, but there are unambiguous resonances - if Iranian drones are needed, then North Korean cannons would not hurt either. At least for the DNR-LNR militia. If there is a relationship, why not buy the weapons or receive them as a gift? There were more curious precedents in history with arms deliveries to young and aggressive Israel or the generous gift of the Vietnamese people to the GDR - an entire battalion of American armored personnel carriers.

>The main factor here is China's attitude to the issue at hand. We can say with great confidence that if China ""gives the go-ahead,"" military and technical cooperation with North Korea will take place.

>There is no need to be ironic. All of Europe plus America and Canada are pumping weapons into the enemy. Specialists go to these weapons in droves, and in some areas of the front lines the fighting is done entirely by mercenaries from Europe, America and Canada, and from South Korea too, by the way.

Essentially my guess is that though they promised the big push at around this time insufficient supplies of shells and Himars have stymied their efforts. Apparently their intel on targets is amazing and they can really clear a battlefield if they want to, but it seems they cannot concentrate fire on one area to advance rapidly without depriving other areas of defensive capabilities. 

Leaving the situation as it is, is a benefit to Ukraine, they are depleting the Russian stocks of essential kit like fuel tankers and armoured personnel carriers. This is the low body count method of a Ukrainian victory, sit back, knock out targets and eventually make a big push when the enemy is very weak and when they can throw a terrifying amount of material at them.

Ukr appears to be prepping the field, incrementally pushing the odds in their favor. There have been lots of individual strikes on ammo dumps, bridges, and other infrastructure that will make it hard for Rus to get resources to their troops when they need them. It's already reduced the amount of random shelling from Rus, which is a benefit in itself. 

Rus troops are massing in anticipation of their own offensive. Ukr appears to be letting that happen. It's not clear why. They might need time to adjust their plans, but I suspect they are allowing their targets to become larger and increase in value. It also means Rus troops are being moved to Kherson and out of other occupied territory.

Ukr also seems to be making Rus troops sweat it out, perhaps hoping for a mass surrender or a break in morale once the fighting starts. There have been smaller reports of this, but I'm not sure it's realistic.

Initially they pushed the Russians quite far, so far actually they are in visible range of Kherson city and they now have majority of Kherson oblast on this side of the river under conventional artillery umbrella, then HiMARS came and they change their tactic. Instead of doing large pushes they started being very careful, Zelinsky, Arstoyevich and Zaluzny said that they wont advance further in Kherson until Russians are properly softened by artillery as they don't want to waste UA soldier lives.

So they are seriously putting pressure on Russians in Kherson oblast between Nova Kharkova and Kherson City.

First of all their SPGs made short work multiple critical bridges in Kherson oblast which severely impedes the manoeuvrability, when HiMARS arrived it was massively focused at destroying all logistics and supplies. UA hit every ammo warehouse between Nova Kharkova and Kherson pretty much all larger storage facilities were destroyed so much that according to FIRMS artillery and MLRS fire in the region reduced by more than 80%.

After that they refocused HiMARS at hitting critical infrastructure. We saw them incapacitate the rail bridge, road bridge, pontoon bridges as well as ferry service. They definitely prepared the ground for a major offensive. Russians have suffered massively in Kherson in last 4 weeks its been crushing defeat after crushing defeat.

They lost multiple aircraft including two of their best fighters to friendly fire as well as a KA-52. On top of 100s of soldiers from barracks, an armoured train and all its cargo which included soldiers.

So whatever minimal benefit the article has in encouraging more evactuations and avoiding civilian infrastructure where possible must be overshadowed by Russia receiving yet another tool to justify their terror campaign or to cast doubt on their evil actions.

Our best hope is that the Putin regime falls, and that we help the next government to clean up the mess and then rebuild in a way that prevents a new Putin from coming in later.  Part of the reason, though far form the only one, that allowed Putin to rise to power in the first place was the gleeful way the west romped into Russia after the soviet union collapsed, and enabled the oligarchs so the west could cash in on anything they could in Russia.  That necessitated a power vacuum at the top and Yeltsin provided the assist there.  We did little to nothing to encourage a transition to a democratic state.  I'm not saying it would have been easy, but the west did a lot to sabotage it.  


Still, trying to make a Versailles like treaty for Russia after this war ends would be an epic mistake.  That's now you create terror states, and Russia is already 95% of the way there.  Even if you got a brief window of peace, a new wave of authoritarians will push into power and we'll be right back here within a decade or two.    


We need far more carrot than stick here.  Offer them great incentives for instituting real democratic reforms, and don't ever give them a hostage again, as was done with gas.  We need to be able to slap back at Russia when it doesn't keep to the correct path.  If the west returns to being dependent on anything from Russia it makes it hard to sanction them when they walk off the proper path.  Of course all this only after Putin is gone, no deal can be made with Putin while he is in power.

Let's go completely into fantasy land here and imagine that you're a country invading a neighbour for some grand, justifiable crusade. They're evil and their populace needs saving or they're making WMDs or whatever the line is this time. Your job is to conquer this place, and their domestic army is standing in your way. Targeting military installations and camps is obviously fair game, but what do you do if they start playing guerrilla warfare, hiding among the civilian populace or using hospitals as a base of operations to provide a human shield?

Honestly, I don't know what I'd do in those circumstances. I sure as shit wouldn't be happy authorising airstrikes, but I believe in this case Amnesty are just trying to be as neutral as possible.

Anyone with the slightest common sense can see that the above doesn't apply to the vast, vast majority of Russian strikes on Ukrainian soil, especially when firing at things like hospitals. They're absolutely using a reign of terror to try to cow the local populace into surrender, as is their standard playbook. But from the standpoint of an organisation such as Amnesty, it must be difficult to toe the line of impartiality and have to constantly, nonsensically give the invaders the benefit of the doubt.

With the huge advantage Himars gives them, why would UA go for a big costly push, when they can slowly and surgically remove the opposition?

They've blown up all supply routes and bridges into kherson. they're probably already busy blowing up any tank, artillery and armored vehicle that moves, continously probing the enemy to make them show where their resources are.

Yes, it will take some time for the attrition to kick in, but the surgical removal of the Russian tumor is by far the superior tactic. 

Plus, just because we don't *see* the massive push, does not mean that UA is not on the offensive. Slowly but steadily the Russians are losing villages, and each village they had to defend was costly for them, while UA only goes in when they're sure they can take it.

Given how close we're cutting it before we start having to worry about winter weather, it's a bit of a calculated risk.

It undermines their ability to receive Western aid and gives Russia essentially a carte blanche to keep bombing civilian structures.

To take such an extreme step - knowing the consequences - you'd expect AI to have a  good reason. But instead the report is condemned by many relevant experts for a variety of reasons:

\-They have yet to provide any proof for their claims and have instead relied on hearsay

\-The report itself is full of holes

\-Some claims in the report are plainly false

\-A misinterpretation of the obligations under the Geneva convention

\-A very naive view of (urban) warfare

For example, the instances provided in the report, such as a few times military personnel at civilian hospitals, then the hospital is shelled—is blaming Ukraine for civilian deaths, wholly ignoring who is shelling!  

The [Dep Defense Minister published](https://nv.ua/opinion/voyna-rossii-protiv-ukrainy-malyar-o-tom-chego-net-v-otchete-amnesty-international-novosti-ukrainy-50261085.html) a response to Amnesty International—I posted it yesterday.

*Among* the points were:

- research-report failed to consider: Russians use the tactics of capturing and holding populated areas, not permitting to leave.  *Is Ukrainian military not to defend their homes? Are we to wait in fields, idly, for Russians to show up, fight military-to-military?*  

- further, the conditions in the moment, the abilities in the moment, the aggression in the moment—impact why we’ve been near populations

- So yes, we’ve been in Ukrainian cities and villages—that’s where Russians strike—so we strengthen and defend against the aggression there^1, and cover the sky over populated areas.^2

- We ask civilians to leave, often assist. Those who remain do so by own choice.^3


___
^1  AI’s beef is that UA does not take enough precautions.  This is preposterous.  Russians are not fighting military targets.  The Nat Sec & Def Council just determined that Russians specifically target civilian infrastructure over military targets, at a rate of 60 to 1.

^2 At the beginning of the war, Zelensky removed the General who had overseen Donbas fighting the last year, gave him a desk job in a Kyiv—*because* he’d failed to adequately protect civilian life in intercepting a missile over Donetsk, resulting in about 15 civilians casualties downtown.  Zelensky didn’t want UA blamed—intercept out in less populated areas.  This didn’t get picked up by Western press, bc so much was happening.  It was in Ukrainian press.  And Russian. 
He’s now been transitioned out of that desk job, is back in command.

^3  AI says they know no instances where the military assists.  This is a half-ass defense of their cynical accusation.  Do they think military personnel will personally escort? Bc no.  But it’s being coordinated, together with Territorial Defense and OVA.  For example, last night I was reading Melitopol news, noticed it often had phone number for OVA office coordinating evacuations, to request assistance—google translation— https://ria--m-tv.translate.goog/news/294508/s_1_sentyabrya_okkupantyi_ne_budut_vyipuskat_iz_melitopolya_detey_ivan_fedorov_(video).html?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc notice the note at bottom, where to call for assistance evacuating.

The Spanish Armada was composed of Portuguese ships and sailors that refused to go into battle against a long term ally.... England.

But also a spectacular fail was the Counter Armada where England wanted to help Portugal become free from the Spanish Occupation and break the Trade Embargo across the Portuguese empire that was vital for English trade routes. Also led by Drake and Norris. Estimated a 24000 men strong force.

I don't like capitalism, because I find it completely unfair, but on paper it contributes to a dog eat dog culture where companies rise and fall, and you try to make as much money as possible, as aggressively as possible, by either furthering your career or growing your company to corner the market.

And then you're supposed to die off and somebody else continues pushing the envelope. 

Which admittedly has not happened to the likes of Amazon, who are well overdue for either a break up or a shock defeat to an upstart.

Capitalism in a rich society can be made to work by using the state's revenue to provide ways into the workplace, and by providing a safety net for those of us who either can't or won't play the game.

Suffice to say it doesn't surprise me that in Western countries we would see both higher incomes and stupidly high cost of living at the same time, what with how obsessive about economic growth we've become.

Historically these sorts of arms supplying situations (in Afghanistan and Vietnam most famously) have bled the attacking country while not provoking them to respond to the people supplying the arms. However in both situations arms which could actually harm the attacking country were never provided. That would likely be seen as a clear escalation and COULD lead to Russia treating the supply of those arms as an act of war in and of themselves. Whereas the supply of small arms and local level artillery and anti-aircraft weapons has historical precedent from both sides.

Again, this isn't me saying ""we shouldn't help Ukraine more"", I'm honestly unsure about what actions we should be taking. It also definitely isn't a moral stance. Its just me pointing out what I believe the intentions and thought process of the west is when it comes to the current levels of support they are sending to Ukraine.

I think there are very strong reasons to believe, as you apparently do, that Russia would be unable and unwilling to escalate war with the west when it already clearly has its handful with Ukraine, even and especially if renewed and improved weapon shipments allowed Ukraine to take that fight to Russian territory. However, I also believe that historically unprecedented move by the west would give Russia (and possible China) the justification it needs to also escalate should they be so inclined. The current strategy seems more predictable, if also incredibly dissatisfying and damaging to Ukraine as they fight a slow and costly war of attrition without the weapons needed to properly fight on an even footing.

I would also be sure to note that you seem to be approaching this from a moral standpoint, which is fine, but NATO has no political or realpolitik reason to react to Russia's invasion of a non-NATO country in the way you describe.

Trust me, I actually get it!  ;)  In a past career, I had a role that involved a lot of economic analysis of factor markets' response to taxation at international borders.  And now I am teaching a college-level economics class.

> Adding a tax only shoots ourselves in the foot

Adding a $x/therm import duty on Russia won't move prices much.  The elasticity of demand of gas is low: the amount consumed doesn't change much with price.  Russia's elasticity of supply is very high, but the elasticity of supply from non-Russian sources is low: it's difficult and very expensive to get additional gas from non-Russian sources.

If Russia is choosing how much to sell based on a quota, the supply curves of non-Russian sources will set the price.  Then, the import duty chooses how much money Russia gets for the tax: a bit less than everyone else participating in the market.

Of course, the meta-effect is that this may further encourage Russia to restrict supply.  The duty has to be low enough that Russia still has an economic incentive to sell.

Of course, no price knobs, import duties, or offsets either way will affect Russia if they do choose to choke off supply for strategic reasons in the long term.  But this is a good mechanism to have in place for when Russia inevitably needs money again and Europe would prefer to get some gas from them.  It signals to Russia -- ""Sure, you can sell, but you're not going to reap the benefits of the artificially high market price you've created"".

Aside from my explanation-- many economists and economic publications have come out on the same side of the issue:
