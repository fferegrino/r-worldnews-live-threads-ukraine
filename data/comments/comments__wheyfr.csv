🪖 A slow day, with no border changes but as usual [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1555720366911258629), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555589355351195651.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555637350276947970.html) go over all the battles of the day.

🍄 In a major, unsettling development, russian forces today [twice shelled](https://twitter.com/galapop2/status/1555593974601187328) the nuclear power plant in Enerhodar [at fairly close range](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1555617249498644481) in an act Ukrainian President Zelensky labeled [nuclear terrorism](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1555636916531372032).  The shelling [seriously damaged](https://twitter.com/PamelaFalk/status/1555739254633992192) two safety systems and there is a [danger of hydrogen and radioactive leakage](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1555589082318766082).  Ukraine called on the world to take measures to force russia to [withdraw from the power plant](https://twitter.com/customTranslate/status/1555597086418165760). 
 
🛩️ Reportedly Ukrainian forces hit and destroyed [4 S-300 anti-aircraft systems](https://twitter.com/MrKovalenko/status/1555353128534433792) in Nova Kakhovka and conducted large scale air-operations in Kherson involving multiple aircraft, indicating that russian air defenses in the area are either destroyed or weakened to the point of irrelevancy.  

👉 The blowback from the Amnesty International report continues as the head of the agency’s Ukraine branch [resigned in protest](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555626716621684738.html) ([Translation](https://twitter.com/sumlenny/status/1555621424018096128)), Ukrainian President Zelensky [weighed in on the matter](https://twitter.com/euronews/status/1555482683509280770), and Amnesty employees are [upset at the leadership](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555646138602201092.html) decisions that got them into this mess.

👉  In rumors of war, a major Telegram channel claimed that russia will start receiving [artillery from North Korea](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1555647565684768769).  Between wear on the artillery barrels from June’s astonishing barrage in the Donbas, and Ukrainian [counter-artillery fire](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1555383681895858176), russia is believed to be running low on both working artillery and ammunition.  There were also reports that North Korea has offered [100,000 men to fight](https://twitter.com/NRO/status/1555721087345983494) for russia.

👉 Unlike the soviet paradise of days gone by, when today’s russia occupies a city it turns into a [post-apocalyptic hellscape](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1555641601795448833) and the [hospital system collapses](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1555466729530212352).

👉 russia’s war goal of the week is — “[territorial expansion](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1555549156315480064)”.

🥷 It’s believed the russian proxy governor in Kherson was poisoned recently as he was suddenly hospitalized and is reportedly [in a coma](https://twitter.com/knittingknots/status/1555358165734146049).

🥷 Ukrainian Intelligence suspected their former deputy head of treason.  During a search at his place of work, the suspect [fired a Makarov pistol](https://twitter.com/CurrentTimeTv/status/1555562445682479104) at the investigators.

💰🇧🇬🇱🇻  Bulgaria and Latvia have [stopped issuing visas](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1555704949648015361) to russian citizens.

💰🇹🇷 Turkey agrees to partially pay for russian gas supplies in rubles.  There’s also a [Washington Post report](https://twitter.com/CatherineBelton/status/1555455337339273216) that russia is using Turkey to avoid sanctions.

🔥 The French power agency has said it is likely going to power down some of its nuclear reactors [due to low water levels](https://twitter.com/JavierBlas/status/1554727870995566592), exacerbating  EU’s ongoing energy crisis.  This is [not unique](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555250316102303748.html) to France, climate change is ravaging Europe.  Because of [low water levels on the Danube](https://twitter.com/LloydsList/status/1555102489271160832), Ukraine is having trouble using this alternate waterway to transport its grain.

Day 164 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled once, 3 hours ago at 12:35am, though it was pretty weird, there were only 3 explosions, and not the big ones. They were still loud, but they came from MLRS, not missiles, there were no confirmed missile launches either. But the question is, why would they only fire 3 MLRS rockets, and not the full salvo? The explosions momentarily cut electricity in some districts but it was fixed within minutes.

We also had 4 long air raid alerts in the past 7 hours it was active for 3.5 hours, and one of the alerts is even still active right now. Usually when air raid alert pops up at that time of day, it means that missiles are already flying at us, but this time there was no missile strike during any of the alerts. It’s already 4am, and the missile strike is yet to happen, hopefully there won’t be one today, but who knows.

Yesterday their missiles hit some small warehouse in Kharkiv, there were no casualties and no military equipment was damaged either. Though there was *one* forklift on the photos, Russians might have thought it was far too threatening to them, because using anything else other than your bare hands for logistics is unheard of in Russian military, so they couldn’t just leave it be, firing their multimillion missiles to destroy *one* enemy forklift was their only choice.",False,1659834734.0,t3_wheyfr,t3_wheyfr,,0,111,0,111,1,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 6 August 2022
 
- Russian forces are almost certainly massing in the south in anticipation of Ukraine's counter-offensive or in preparation for a possible assault. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, towed artillery, and other weapons continue to move away from Ukraine's Donbas region and are headed southwest. Equipment was also reported to be moving from Russian-occupied Melitopol, Berdiansk, Mariupol and from mainland Russia via the Kerch Bridge into Crimea. Battalion tactical groups (BTG), which comprise between 800 and 1,000 troops, have been deployed to Crimea and would almost certainly be used to support Russian troops in the Kherson region. On 02 August 2022, a new BTG had been deployed to Crimea and BTGs are also being re-deployed from Eastern Grouping of Forces. These will highly likely be sent into the Kherson region in the coming days.

- Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links with growing frequency in Ukraine's southern regions including the strategically important railroad spur that links Kherson to Russian-occupied Crimea, almost certainly using a combination of block, damage, degrade, deny, destroy, and disrupt effects to try to affect Russia's ability to logistically resupply.

- Russia's war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with the heaviest fighting shifting to a roughly 350km front line stretching southwest from near Zaporizhzhya to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper River.

From before high-altitude long-range bombers had even been invented military strategists started wondering if their existence would dramatically change the nature of warfare. The theory went that you wouldn’t even really need many soldiers and tanks on the ground conducting assaults for territory if you could disrupt the support infrastructure behind the other side sufficiently.



They tried it, sort of, in WWII. Bomber Command was never happy with the strategic bombing campaign against Germany having its resources diverted towards supporting ground assaults or looking for buzzbomb launchers etc. They wanted to keep going after ball-bearing factories and the like until the German war machine ground to a halt. The theory that the Allie’s could win the war on the western front without having to resort to D-Day etc. never really got tested. But it showed promise. 


Precision weapons brought a whole new angle to the theory that wars could be won or lost without where the “front line” is mattering much at all. The US military has had success with a strategy of crippling an opposing army’s ability to function with precision long-range strikes way before the first combat soldier on the ground advances across any front.



I can definitely appreciate the urgency of bringing cities like Kherson back under control, but it’s going to be a really tough decision to make. If the long-range precision strikes are working at breaking the functionality of the entire Russian military presence in Ukraine?

As the title suggests, this is something Soviet leaders simply *never* did; he was *shocked* when he first saw a US president (George W Bush) visit troops overseas, and then discovered that it is something *every* US president since FDR has done—to greet not only senior officers, but indeed everyone from top brass to enlisted men.

He then contemplates why this difference exists, hypothesising that it's a consequence of democracy vs autocracy: whereas the former requires support from the electorate and therefore an appeal to the common man—hence US presidents make themselves at least *appear* (relatively) more in-touch and accessible, Soviet leaders (and prospective leaders) were generally hidden away in the Kremlin caring only about the elite decision-making political groups (he gives a small anecdotal counter-example of Gorbachev meeting ordinary Russians on the streets of Moscow and notes how extraordinary that was, but doesn't expand on that particular point any further).

People keep touting this idea and it is not true that defending always results in less casualties. For instance, in a not-dissimilar conflict (peer-on-peer, positional warfare, heavy entrenchments) in 1918, the attacking side suffered fewer casualties. That was true of both the German attacks in the spring *and* of the allied counter-attacks in the summer.  The same is even more true of manuevre warfare: in the German attacks in Russia of 1941 and 1942, the defending Russians repeatedly suffered far higher casualties. In the long Iran-Iraq, Iran would often attack with considerably smaller forces but succeed with lower casualties (eg. in the Samen-ol-A'emeh operation). And for one of the most obvious examples, just look at the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, where (defending) Arab casualties dwarfed (attacking) Israeli ones on all fronts.

One sizable vocal Ukrainian opinion is that America isn't giving them weapons faster because they don't want this to end fast. It's bleeding Russia and putting taxpayer money into all the favorite defense contractors pockets. The handful of GOP against the aid have not done anything significant to slow the process. A few of them are irredeemable peices of shit but Rand Paul and some others when you take a look beneath the surface objected to the lack of tracking of the weapons as the law of unintended consequences rarely does thevUS any favors and this is consistent Rand and his dad's non interventionalist stances. Let Europe deal with Russia is not a new stance and the Dems used to be the side that had the most voices saying this. Obama said publicly that Ukraine was a key strategic interest to Russia but not to the US. He eventually caved under heavy scrutiny from the GOP and the Dems perpetual warhawks and started training the Ukrainians. William Burns current head of the CIA who was the ambassador to Russia was of the same opinion. When Hilary lost their was a big shift in the Democratic party, they blamed everything on Russia accepting no fault of their own. Two weeks ago John Bolton was hot mic'd boasting about trying to start a coup and influnce elections in Venezuela. The US was caught under Obama tapping Angela Merkals phones. This is what major powers do. It's easy to call people traitors with no proof and it's been very effective through out history. The  CIA has famously in multiple documented case started disinformation campaigns circulated rumors that the people/parties were working with them to destabilize movements to help American friendly authoritarians get into power.

My example said Iran.

The whole point of attacking in one location on a wide front is because you think you can win in that location. You bring overwhelming force to bear. You fix potential reinforcements. You interdict enemy supply lines. The attacker, in choosing the battle location, starts with an advantage.

>and discussion of Russian historical claims over Ukraine is just spin to justify these motives.

Ukraine wasn't really a country until the Brest Litovsk agreement. It had been partly Russian, or part of other empires (Lithuania-Poland I think). 

It was a part of the russian empire for hundreds of years, and so was obviously Belarus (which is actually mostly polish historical lands, while Poland occupies previously german lands). 


And these old hyper nationalistic boomers in Kremlin dreams of re-uniting the soviet union, or certainly the russian empire. Their political party is ""russia united"", and they are all billionaires who have nothing else to accomplish.
