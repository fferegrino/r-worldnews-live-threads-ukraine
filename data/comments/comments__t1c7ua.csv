cc7a4bf86de4c8adff0028989f9ecb2d,t1c7ua,hyf73vw,"Ukrainian President Zelensky's speech before the attack:

""I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.

That is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.

You are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.

You are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.

You are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?

Donetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.

Artema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.

Donbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.

Shcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost

Lugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.

Note that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?

Many of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.

But, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.

War is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.

Who is going to suffer from this the most? The people.

Who does not want this more than anyone? The people.

Who can prevent all this from happening? The people.

If these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.

I know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.

Do the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation.""

Putin looks quite mental in recent footage. Honestly, there's now a non-zero chance of him shooting himself in his bunker. Hopefully he doesn't decide to start a nuclear war and punish Russia on the way out, if he does this.

They don’t realize it’s only about preventing getting attacked.

I saw a Russian saying “I don’t understand. What does America and NATO want with my country.”

This is what someone born in Russia wrote to me. I knew them when I lived in Italy:

> “I don’t understand one thing (I'm talking about American politics), what do they want from us? Russia has never waged in America, all out... How many American soldier-children have fallen ... of these wars ???  Now this conflict is for the NATO armed men. Russia has said many times that we do not want to see you close to our borders ... And also Donezk, Harkov, Dnepopetrovsk ... 8 years of armed men near us. What would America do if we were to bring our guns and bombs near you??? We do not want American policy in our COUNTRY.  We are free. Italy since 1946 under America and commands political views here ... I have no people against, I love you and never do harm. I pray for all the men of the earth.”

Edit: I told her this:

> America and Ukraine do not want war.  Russian news makes NATO seem like a malicious tool that wants to attack Russia, but in reality its existence is only there to defend countries if they are attacked.  Its existence only serves to discourage people from attacking so that everyone can have peace.

> America, the European Union and Ukraine simply want not to be attacked.  It is sad what is happening.  Putin didn't need to kill.

While we will work to address any mistaken removals, which have occurred, we would like to remind users of a few areas where removals are consistent with sitewide policy:

* First, advocating for assassinating/killing or torturing leaders of nations is a direct violation of the sitewide rule against harm. We know that many users are extremely frustrated and angry at political leaders seen as responsible for this war and its humanitarian consequences, but this has been a firm rule for years now. Expressing any other manner of displeasure or anger at political leaders (provided it doesn't explicitly violate other sitewide rules, such as the ones against promoting hate speech) remain perfectly acceptable. 

* To that point, we have also noticed users suggesting that the Russian President is gay. We understand that the origin of this statement is not necessarily rooted in hate but rather as a form of protest as it's been alleged that Putin dislikes being associated with this rumor. Nevertheless, some of these comments will cross a line for us and the site as a whole if they play on hateful stereotypes and tropes about LGBT individuals. We will continue to be as deferential as possible to non-hateful interpretations of these comments to the extent possible, but just want to remind users that there is a limit to how they express such sentiments.

* Finally, there have been comments that promote hate against the Russian people and culture in general which we and the site construe as promoting hate on the basis of an identity. Russia is a country of 145 million people, with a rich and diverse culture. It's also a country where people are far from uniformly supportive of this war. Thousands of Russians risked detention to go out and protest against this war and many have reportedly been arrested, and 1/3 of Russia's armed forces are conscripts who do not necessarily harbor a desire to go to war. Painting with a broad brush to promote hate against the Russian people is never appropriate discourse, especially at a time when tensions are so high. That being said, we will continue to be as deferential as possible to non-hateful interpretations of these comments to the extent possible, where ""Russian"" or ""Russians"" can reasonably be interpreted to be referring to the Russian government and leadership.",False,1645818640.0,t3_t1c7ua,t3_t1c7ua,moderator,0,566,0,566,0,1,

<<Prof John Heathershaw, who leads research into international kleptocracy at the University of Exeter, warns Russia ""will not take these sanctions seriously"" due to the UK's ""kleptocracy problem"".

""There are professional 'enablers' that help Russian kleptocrats obscure their ownership and sources of wealth, gain UK residency and property, and launder their reputations,"" he says.

Tackling this, he says, would involve regulation that is ""opposed"" by many big businesses.>>

And that’s why, in my opinion, Putin is not scared by sanctions a bit; and I think that like any other dictator, Putin couldn’t care less about Russia’s economy downfall. 

Also, millions of Russians should’ve been on the streets already protesting these atrocities, not tens of thousands in a country of 145 millions. Without huge pressure from Russian people at home Putin’s war crimes will be hard, if not impossible, to stop.

Russia is further alienated. Even allies are distancing.

Despite being a considerably larger military, Russia’s military appears incompetent and ineffective.

Europe/NATO/United States are more united than ever.

Even if Russia managed to neuter the Ukrainian military, they’ll be bogged down in an expensive shit-show quagmire of trying to govern a large country of people who hate their guts and will inflict heavy losses. Basically Afghanistan on a much larger scale.”

I'm not sure I buy it; it could be old video.

However, it does occur to me that if Russia is worried about a nuclear exchange, they may be getting their ICBMs out of ""known"" storage sites and scattering them across the continent. That would make it harder for NATO/the US to take them out en mass with a surprise strike, because they're not all in one spot.

We live in scary times and I discount nothing.

Also given the alleged recent call in Russia for emergency medical staff I’m wondering just how prepared the Russians are for a slog. It should’ve been days or weeks at least before the Russians needed to call anything in. I would’ve figured they would’ve had everything prepared after a year for at least a couple of weeks of hard fighting just to be safe. I figured Putin had misjudged even before they invaded but this indicates that they might’ve misjudged even more than I thought. 

I will say I still think it was a failure of Zalensky and his government not to prepare more even just in the days leading up when it was clear there was no diplomatic solution anymore. So many articles coming out just before the invasion talking about the lack of obvious military preparation. Things like sandbags, checkpoints, and tank traps. Even just things like stockpiling food and water. It seems like there’s a lack of water in the metro bomb shelters which is something that could’ve been easily avoided. Given how much resistance the Ukrainians are putting up having to deal with these things on a semi ad hoc basis it makes you wonder where they would’ve been if they’d switched over to a total war footing before the invasion began. I’m sure they’ve had some level of preparation going on behind the scenes but there are things that should’ve been front and center and easily seen that just weren’t.",False,1645819071.0,t3_t1c7ua,t3_t1c7ua,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Because he fears NATO, and has two cards with which to combat it: nukes and Europe's biggest land army. If his threats based on those things didn't work, then his game was over unless he acted. And backing down was defeat.

Now I wonder if part of the decision to invade was emotion - a punt. His generals would have been very happy (in terms of feasibility/logistics) to take Donetsk and Luhansk. But what if Putin then said to take the entire country, and gave them 48 hours or whatever - granted, there had been substantial border build-up and exercises beforehand.

There are also reports he is spooked by the level of intelligence the US has and which Biden is making public. So this may have further added to his 'now or never' mentality.

Their artillery and air strikes have been relatively light -- less than a thousand total missiles employed so far. American military assessments expected Russia to bomb Ukraine for several days before even sending in the fast-moving units. Russia's reached Kiev within just 48 hours of the fighting starting, and they have not even initiated the decapitation-style bombings that they could have.

The war so far does show promising Ukrainian morale, but now that their mobile forces are [starting to succumb to classic ""road-of-death"" style bombings](https://twitter.com/200_zoka/status/1497227095847620614?s=20&t=bb3D92XLCxQ31I6z9vWMSA&fbclid=IwAR29yEyLacDcJlMwhPcSe34sMqwZXJMkOghYxNW1Et5-I5hdx3Xf0QYSrcI), organized resistance is probably just a few days from crumbling outside of a few entrenched pockets that get trapped behind Russia's advancing line.

I don't say any of this because I want Putin to prevail. But it's just not helpful spreading the idea that Russia's nothing but a bunch of cowardly conscripts. The casualties on both sides have been less than a few thousand people. That's not a reason to be hopeful for Ukraine. What that means is that Russia hasn't really brought its full artillery and air power to bear on Ukraine yet. My guess is that Russia is waiting to see if they can capture Ukraine's government in tact first.

Why... for all the propaganda reasons people have already written.  However, as with most propaganda, there is usually a grain of truth.  

The Russians did, for the most part, destroy the German armies in WW2, you know... the Nazis.  A LOT of Russians died in that war, like around 20 million.  They HATE Nazis.  Ukraine was a battlefield in WW2 and many of them did fight on Germany's side.  So, there is some ""Nazi"" past.  Given a choice between the Russians and the Germans... not really going to fault them.

In more recent times, when Crimea was annexed and the Donbas war started, the Ukrainian army didn't exactly respond very well.  In that void, some volunteer (essentially private) combat brigades formed and defended territory.  They fought exceptionally hard and managed to stabilize the front line.  Afterwards, they were rolled into the regular Ukrainian army.  Now, these solders were pretty hardcore and, while they did earn national respect, **some of them** are actual, real, Neo-Nazi... the works.  Not entirely unexpected given the history of Ukraine, the immediate war needs, and the ultra-nationalism involved with an all volunteer private army.   So, yes, there actually are some Nazi sympathizers in the Ukrainian armed forces.

Are the Russian people in Donbas subject to genocide?  I don't think so.  Not even cultural genocide in the lightest possible terms.  Is the Ukrainian government run by Nazi's?  I don't think so, but there are probably some ultra-nationalists in various positions.  That much in inevitable in a country at war for years on end.

Are Ukrainians fascist?  Not even close.  Putin is, by any reasonable definition of fascism, a fascist dictator.",False,1645822221.0,t3_t1c7ua,t1_hyfcfht,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Not only has the US and NATO failed at their objectives in Ukraine, but they will fail even harder and on more levels due to the sanctions.

Russia has the largest proven gas reserves in the world.  They are a major oil producer as well.  They supply much of Europe with gas.  

Europe is already experiencing insane inflation in energy prices before the sanctions took place.  These sanctions will make the problem worse.

So America will try to alleviate the problem by tanking LNG to Europe.  This will increase prices in the US.  What energy Russia does sell will be sold at elevated prices, but at a discount from global rates.  The main buyer will be China.  

So while Europe and the US struggle with higher prices, Russia will make more on what they do produce while still granting a comparative price advantage to China, the US's other major adversary.  

The US has failed miserably in their policy here.  The consequences of this will be felt for a long time.

All they had to do was come to the table when Putin asked back in December and trade the medium range missiles on NATO/Russia borders for the right for Ukraine to joined NATO or vice versa.  Instead, they said Russian demands were a ""non-starter"".  They *didn't* exhaust all diplomatic possibilities and found out that Russia wasn't playing.  People are dying because the US was bluffing Russia.

Even Zelenskyy was talking shit about not yielding and how strong they are, because he was expecting his bully friends to jump in and save his ass.  Today, he begged for his life on the world stage.

For all the other failures of the US and NATO in this predicament, they also manage to look weak and disorganized.  They knew they couldn't engage here and still pretended like they were tough and scary.  

To be clear: Putin said last week that if they take Ukraine joining NATO off the table, he won't attack.  All they had to do is yield that.  Now Ukraine won't be part of NATO anyway and a shit load of people are going to have to die about it.  How fucking stupid.

The Russian government may topple over this if Ukraine doesnt call it quits and Putin doesn't turn tail. Those sanctions will start to hurt shortly. Russians will be a lot less reserved when the government loses the military. Demoralized and starving isn't a deterrent for defense.

And even that will be inevitably temporary as oil is not an infinite resource. Fracking comes with a lot of ramifications -- danger to water supplies, earthquakes...What actually needs to happen is nuclear but the oil and gas lobbyists would never let that happen and politicians are in their pocket no matter what side they are on or what they say publicly.

When Republicans say ""we need to be energy independent"" it is code for ""we need to drill more oil""

Republicans are right that the US should be less focused on global energy and more focused on self sufficiency. They are wrong about the HOW.

The US, even without fracking or nuclear, is WAY better off than most countries. We would survive no problem if all outside energy sources got cut off. Costs would just probably go up some because currently it's cheaper for us to buy foreign than to use domestic in many regions of the country.",1645820700.0,1645819837.0,t3_t1c7ua,t1_hyf9sxe,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Yemen - It's not ""Yemenis vs Saudi Arabia"". It's a civil war with multiple sides *and* some of those sides being backed by outside powers. For that matter, you do know the history of Yemen, right? There was a North Yemen and a South Yemen, and they were basically mashed together by force ~30 years ago and don't like each other.

Somalia - The people being blown up in Somalia are basically as brutal and unpleasant as ISIS and want to overthrow the weak, but somewhat democratic elected government. And that's only part of the country, because another large chunk of it (Somaliland) has basically been doing it's own thing for 30 years and wants no part of it.

NVidia is best known for making its GPUs for gaming computers (and Bitcoin mining), but those GPUs can also be used for artificial intelligence and other applications that are consumer-critical, if not military.

Would this - alone - justify retaliation?  Maybe?  But would it just be cyber-retaliation?  Would we wait for further digital incursions before reacting?  I don't know.  It might take a while to pin down where the attack came from and to diagnose how severe it is to decide if it's worth retaliating.  The worst-case scenario I've read about would be if they managed to push some kind of update to NVidia software that's laced with malware.  It would be on millions of computers and in major systems.

NATO was formed after WW2 by the western allies with the core ideal of ""an attack on one is an attack on all"" that meant if the USSR invaded west Germany it would start a war against not just western Germany but France, the UK, and most importantly America which would mean a nuclear war. This was all done to deter the USSR and later Russia from attacking smaller nations.

NATO still exists and still holds to its ideals but they're in an interesting position in this conflict. Ukraine is not a member of NATO but they neighbor a few members and have been growing closer to NATO over the years. Russia has always seen NATO as a threat (not entirely baseless) so they supposedly invaded yesterday to ensure Ukraine dosen't join. NATO isn't currently at war. Some have suggested they should intervene since they now represent the combined armies of the US and most of Europe, but if NATO declares war that means the US and Russia would be directly at war.

Calling for the elimination of Putin is a valid public policy opinion in my own personal opinion, but the owners of the site reddit.com do not agree, and I don't make the rules.

Like, it's obvious that Putin would be on the okay list, but what about, say Xi?  The CCP is unquestionably evil, but Xi hasn't personally ordered any executions that we can prove.   How many deaths does it take to be on the ""okay to kill"" list anyway?  Andrew Cuomo basically murdered 172,000 people with the nursing home thing, would he count?

Russia's concern with sending troops will only be sending in equipment.

See also, for example, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemmersdorf_massacre:

>	The Nemmersdorf massacre was a civilian massacre perpetrated by Red Army soldiers in the late stages of World War II. Nemmersdorf (present-day Mayakovskoye, Kaliningrad Oblast) was one of the first prewar ethnic German villages to fall to the advancing Red Army during the war.

I really don't think that getting to the outskirts of Kiev in two days against an enemy that knew you were coming is sufficient proof that they have failed in that modernization.

Is easily interpreted as ""I guess we'll just do more sanctions"" which is what people often say when they don't know the power of sanctions themselves, and what options are at the disposal of countries. 

It also implies that you ***expect*** there to be more action. IE. you expect a retaliation of some kind since uninvolved citizens were attacked by an aggressor.

The quid pro quo was that US provided them weapons if Ukraine announces they're investigating into the Biden family.

Do you think Ukraine's confidence was boosted in the US, let alone NATO, when the goddamn President is trying to make him his own personal puppet? (i.e. exactly what Putin did in with Viktor Yanukovych).

I highly doubt the 5 times they met were to only discuss Israel's claim to Jerusalem, Iran, or just the war in Syria. Putin's focus has been on Ukraine heavily for over a decade. Putin declared the [""Collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century"".](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7632057) (Btw, 20th century saw nuclear bombs being dropped in war, 2 world wars, a massive economic depression, Holocaust, multiple genocides... See where Im getting at with this?) 

&#x200B;

Putin is a romantic. He wants Russia's borders to go back to the days of the USSR days. Ukraine was a big part of that. I *promise* you those conversations behind closed doors have been an effort to both Trump getting what he wants while simultaneously trying to use parts of territory not belonging to US as bargaining chips. This has been how Trumps ""really good deals"" have been playing out.
