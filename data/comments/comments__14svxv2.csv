Under Article 51 of the UN Charter Ukraine has a universal internationally recognised right to self-defence and thus we have been officially requesting these types of munitions for a long time. I would like to stress that in exercising our inalienable right to self-defence we will continue to strictly comply with all the international humanitarian conventions signed and ratified by Ukraine.

It is important to note that the russian federation has been indiscriminately using cluster munitions from day 1 of the unprovoked large-scale aggression. In February-March 2022 Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city with over a million population, was relentlessly bombarded by russians cluster munitions.

Our position is simple - we need to liberate our temporarily occupied territories and save the lives of our people. For this we need to inflict losses on the enemy - war criminals, rapists and looters - who are occupying our territories. The more losses we inflict on them the more lives of Ukrainian people we will be able to save. 

It is in our interest to save the lives of our soldiers. This is why we will continue to do this using all lethal weapons available to us. 

Regarding the cluster munitions, we have 5 key principles which we will abide by and which we have clearly communicated to all our partners, including the US. I have personally informed our US partners about these five principles in writing a long time ago. 

1. Ukraine will use these munitions only for the de-occupation of our internationally recognised territories. These munitions will not be used on the officially recognized territory of russia.

2. We will not be using cluster munitions in urban areas (cities) to avoid the risks for the civilian populations - these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect. Cluster munitions will be used only in the fields where there is a concentration of russian military. They will be used to break through the enemy defence lines with minimum risk for the lives of our soldiers. Saving the lives of our troops, even during extremely difficult offensive operations, remains our top priority.  

3. Ukraine will keep a strict record of the use of these weapons and the local zones where they will be used.

4. Based on these records, after the de-occupation of our territories and our victory these territories will be prioritised for the purposes of de-mining. This will enable us to eradicate the risk from the unexploded elements of cluster munitions. The Minister of Defence of Ukraine is by law acting as the Head of the national de-mining agency. In this capacity I will ensure the implementation of the relevant legal framework for the de-mining process after our victory. 

5. We will report to our partners about the use of these munitions, and about their efficiency to ensure the appropriate standard of transparent reporting and control.""

A powerful Ukrainian assault forced Russia's 83rd Airborne Assault Brigade to retreat on foot without an evacuation plan, only to be given ""illegally issued orders"" to go right back to the front, the Russian troops complained in a video appeal.

Russian draftees in another unit at Klishchiivka - the 1442nd Regiment - also refused to fight after suffering heavy losses under Ukrainian fire while being sent into combat without ammunition, their relatives said in an appeal. Some of the refuseniks were reportedly being held in a pit

The Russian airborne troops said they were ""fraudulently"" sent to Klishchiivka, where they spent 15 days under mortar fire without Russian artillery or air support or communications (which had been shut down by Ukrainian electronic warfare)

Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones reportedly zipped around freely overhead underhindered by Russian electronic warfare.

After refusing to fight, they said they were threatened with being forced to join a ""Storm-Z"" unit of ex-convicts, notorious for being deployed in Russia's virtually suicidal so-called ""meat assaults""

But — even the world’s biggest slowpokes should now realize that “the door is open, but....” excuse just doesn’t work and never will. 

So if we talk about serious things, there need to be at least two things declared and enshrined loud and clear:

- Ukraine joins NATO as soon as physically possible following the current war's formal ending as part of Europe's postwar security reconstruction plan that must be on the table by now;
- Ukraine is to get a membership plan ASAP, which should be declared as soon as the upcoming NATO summit;

For some weird reason, Russia did not attack the Baltic nations, but it took its time to make use of Western weakness and shortsightedness and made sure Ukraine was not covered by Article 5. 

You know what's the outcome. 

At the same time, it's very fair to say that Ukraine, in this postwar reconstruction, is just destined to go on developing as a major and modern military power for endless decades to come.

I got some thoughts...

(1) 

I never noticed bc I don’t usually read weeks worth of news at once, but there’s quite a bit of domestic Russian stories of FSB catching ukrainian spies or Russian traitors.  Like 5 stories per week.  Maybe they’re bs, like the Evan Gersowich case.  Or maybe they really are people who’ve helped Ukraine?  Some articles say that a suspects has dual citizenship.  Other cases say caught when crossing border.  Some articles say what planning... I honestly wonder if it’s fabricated charges or actual assistance.

(2) 

If the comments sections of the independent press is representative of Russia, then Putin has a problem, bc they’re Team Prigozhin.  The Russian commenters think the oligarchs/Propagandaists are doing a smear campaign against “the only hard-working oligarch,” and that Prigozhin is a “man of the people” and “Robin Hood,” and that Putin is old, incompetent, and only interested in his own wealth.  Ukraine doesn’t seem to factor in to people’s admiration—ie, they don’t like Prigozhin because he kills Ukrainians, rather, because he “works hard,” and “doesn’t vacation,” and “doesn’t own yachts” and “pays his employees.”  So...yeah... Russians are idolizing that ruthless mercenary.

If russia decides to conduct a radiological terror incident there, it will be when they have to withdraw from the unassailable fortress that is a NPP to avoid encirclement.  Or when the person in charge of the detonate button gets drunk.

But.  This could happen with very little warning if things go well.  One of Ukraine's primary fronts is to the W of Tokmak right along the former reservoir, and a breakthrough there that leads to a straight road down without russian reserves in place could lead to a breakthrough in really short order.  If Ukraine sees a way to drive straight across the former reservoir, or manages to make a bridge across the Dnieper at any location where russia has removed their defenses, a breakthrough could happen quickly.  These are both unlikely in the near future, but if the Ukrainian offensive is going as available intel indicates they will become progressively more likely over time.  Evacuating within ~20km (or whatever the Ukrainian government has said as the likely zone) is an extremely good idea.  People in Enerhodar could potentially walk across the former reservoir, or have high-quality masks ready for radioactive fallout and be ready to do so the hour that russia runs.

It's not easy to disseminate this type of information, since the risk of continent-wide panic is stupidly high (a dirty bomb would only affect a few km, but would do so at extreme levels) and much of the areas are currently occupied and the only way out is to walk across the former reservoir after russian soldiers leave (with a high-quality mask, to prevent the inhalation of radioactive particles) - you can literally just go back later once the radiation is gone.

Preparing water filters everywhere downstream should also be a priority.  Radioactive bits from a dirty bomb would easily be filtered out and would mostly sink to the bottom, but you really would not want to drink even a small amount of them.  ""Iodine tablets"", although cheap and with near-infinite expiration dates and worth using in the event regardless for people under 30-40, would be unlikely to be helpful since nuclear fission would not happen during a dirty bomb and therefore I-131 would not be a concern at all.",1688718397.0,1688717003.0,t3_14svxv2,t1_jqzxt6j,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Don't forget that the guy's other hobby (besides sausages, hammer executions, and global-scale rape and murder) is troll factories. So there are certainly some new issues in the ""authorized consensus"" that you previously saw in Russian media and Roskomnadzor really struggling to put a bandaid over everything. 

The situation seemed to evolve that the media itself is State controlled messages, with the orchestra of Telegram/comments and other ""social media"" basically conducted by the range Internet Research Agency, Patriot Group and other Concorde and Patriot group (just the cells we know about). We keep reading about how these have been shut down, only to find that much like Wagner, they seem to persist.

It's an unpopular comment when I make it, but I still think this mutiny was as much an image we were presented as it was a reality. Tanks and troops and Prigozhin himself certainly rolled into Rostov, but how much of it including the lead up was orchestrated is hard to say - we're relying a lot on sources that Prigozhin himself controlled in order to make sense of what is a very very bizarre moment. Neither the Kremlin's nor Prigozhin's accounts can be taken at face value. As for consensus among Russians....? Is really perceived as a Robin Hood? My guess is they will do what they are told and accept what the TV tells the no matter what happens.

Putin, a malignant narcissist, sees people as tools to serve either his ego or his goals or both, so presumeably Prigozhin has convinced Putin he is still very useful and that it was just a coup to the armed forced rather than an effort to rule the country.

You should think of this as the defense budget doing its job of protecting from russian invasion.  The US spends $750B annually on that, and nearly the entire point is in case russia decides to start a world war 3.  This is not ""sending money"", it is paying American workers to build stuff and sending that stuff rather than storing it in the desert (actually a lot of the stuff we've sent is just pulled out of long-term storage in that desert).  It's very similar to the lend-lease as we prepared to enter world war 2, which improved our industrial base and economy overall and cost no American lives.

Ukraine is also getting a bunch of loans and cash help.  This is essential because their economy has been cut something like half and the entire cash flow of the government is in danger without outside help.  Most of that is coming through Europe, not the US.  The loans would be paid back, but probably over a very very long timeframe.

The pre-war economy of Ukraine was extremely small, around USD$166 billion.  That was cut in half as ~10 million refugees fled to western Ukraine and across Europe, though some of it may have rebounded after the battle of Kyiv was won.  Ukraine had an unsually low wealth disparity and the average quality of life was quite high (people had smart phones, for instance), but the average income was not much per year.",False,1688764832.0,t3_14svxv2,t1_jr2ohhp,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Possibly lessening some immediate costs in maintenance and insurance etc?, but likely generating the need for future purchases to refill stocks.

Then its money directly donated for earmarked purposes like keeping the government running, buying weapons, food. I imagine it will be somekinda interest free loans or at least with some strings attached but a mix of donation/free loans.
Like regular foreign aid. Sometime in the future it might get forgiven.

What I think is interesting though if we imagine the war ends without it being a frozen conflict and no ww3 etc, and sort of a return to old borders and status quo (though possibly a clusterfuck of issues in Russia, though lets say its contained within).
The cost that has to be leveraged in cash and investment and pure labour and materials in rebuilding Ukraine. That will be a whole other ballgame wont it?

The Russians may have a huge stockpile of artillery, but the problem is getting it in place to providing defensive fire at the front.   The supply depots and warehouses at the rail junctions they're bringing everything in on are getting hit regularly.    The lines of supply are being degraded (as indicated by that regular number of trucks and vehicles being attrited, along with fuel depots used to fill those transports regularly suffering from attacks).

Russian planning might be to delay and disrupt the Ukrainian maneuvers by just throwing troops on the forward defensive lines to hold up the Ukrainians long enough to lay out more mines and set up what artillery reserves they can get into position at the second and third defensive line layers.   They're also calculating what they can strip from units in other defensive theaters without rendering those units ineffective, and then figure out how to funnel those into Ukraine, especially with the reduced capacity of their rail network to get that equipment where it needs to go.

I suspect sooner or later there's probably going to be a fallback for most of the Russian units.   I have some doubts as to the battle-worthiness of the units left....

Literal meaning: f*ck

How to use it: Unlike the ‘f*ck’ written above, this is the verb form. It takes root from words in ancient Indian languages meaning to copulate. In the figurative meaning, it refers to a person being annoying, screwing around or just being generally unpleasant. It is used in the common expression zhizn’ ebet meya, which means’life is f*cking me’.

In turn, the generals had to then wait for orders from the MoD who had to clear everything with the Kremlin.

By the time orders fed through the ranks the advantage was lost and information was out of date.

This is a perfect example of the sorry state of ""journalism"" and the game of telephone effect that happens when people link things without even reading them.

That foreignpolicy.com article links to a [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-mercenary-threat-revives-concern-over-nuclear-arsenal-security-2023-06-24/) article which does not mention what's being claimed at all. The only thing it says is:

> A congressional aide noted that the Kremlin has pumped extra resources into modernizing its arsenal in recent years, adding that, ""Russia’s strategic forces have generally been in ship-shape.""

A *congressional aide*, not the State Department.

And right above it, it also says:

> But the safety of these weapons is a persistent worry for Washington. U.S. intelligence agencies said in their 2023 Annual Threat assessment that ""Russia's nuclear material security ... remains a concern despite improvements to material protection, control, and accounting at Russia's nuclear sites since the 1990s.""

More generally, the term ""tankie"" has been applied for those who express support for one-party socialist republics that are associated with Marxism–Leninism, whether contemporary or historical.""

And from Urban Dictionary: ""A tankie is a member of a communist group or a ""fellow traveller"" (sympathiser) who believes fully in the political system of the Soviet Union and defends/defended the actions of the Soviet Union and other accredited states (China, Serbia, etc.) to the hilt, even in cases where other communists criticise their policies or actions. For instance, such a person favours overseas interventions by Soviet-style states, defends these regimes when they engage in human rights violations, and wishes to establish a similar system in other countries such as Britain and America.""

It seems to me colloquially that in the last year or so, the term has come to mean anyone, even if they're not a former Soviet, Communist, or Socialist, who supports the actions of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, or other communist/socialist/dictatorship states.

This group believe that after the counteroffensive winds down, that the war will move towards stalemate.

 I don’t think the Russian people will rise up and demand a western style government that respects its neighbors and sees other countries as equals anytime soon. That said there is a certain cold hard calculus that whoever rules Russia will face and that is that despite whatever dreams of grandeur the people have the Russian government will likely lack the military and economic might to accomplish those.

It's not that Ukraine would deliberately aim them at civilians, it's that they'd aim them at enemy soldiers, kill the soldiers, move on, and then a decade later a bomblet that didn't go off on impact finally decides to fuze as a farmer is walking through his field and it blows his leg off.

For example, the US DPICMs that are being sent to Ukraine are 155mm artillery cluster munitions that carry 88 bomblets. On average, the failure-to-detonate rate of those bomblets is about 2.5%. For every shell that's fired you end up with 2.2 bomblets sitting in the soil waiting to be disturbed by anyone who might come across it. And that's a low failure rate for cluster munitions -some US air launched missiles have dud rates of 10%, and the now retired ones that were used in vietnam had dud rates of up to 33%.

Don't get me wrong I firmly believe in sending every tool we have available to Ukraine to help them end this war on their terms, but it's important to be aware of the cost of using some of those tools. In the case of cluster munitions that cost is going to be either many many millions of dollars in UXO remediation or civilian lives - and we won't know how many lives it's going to cost until long after the war is over.

It's not solely a conflict between the US and Russia, but it most certainly is a conflict between the two. It also includes Ukraine and Europe, but the US has the capacity to end the conflict tomorrow either through escalation or by withholding money, weapons, and support from Ukraine.

>if they were not actually present and seen to be leading the discussion then it was a mistake and a bad message to Russia

Biden made 2 things very clear:

* This group was not authorized to speak on behalf of the administration and
* That there will be no resolution to this conflict without Ukrainian officials

The group did also brief the Whitehouse after the talks. This is the type of diplomacy that saw the JCPOA come to fruition. Back-channel, non-official US negotiators having one-off meetings in hotel rooms with Iranian officials. This meant that when public negotiations actually took place all parties were basically ready to agree.

I bet there are groups, possibly this same group, that are feeling out what Ukraine might deem acceptable for an end to the conflict. It's okay to get a better feel for what the gap is between the opposing parties.

The more successful the counteroffensive the better bargaining position Ukraine will be in this fall. Having fire control over Crimea, and the ability to deny Russia all of Crimea (even if Ukraine might not take it militarily) would be a huge victory for Ukraine. Especially if they can confine the rest of the Russian occupation to the areas previously occupied by Russia. Basically, Russia ends up losing Crimea from this adventure and Ukraine joins NATO which permanently denies Russia any further annexation of Ukranian land.

No, the American policy was hugely successful and led to eventually winning the cold war. Just don't think it remade Germany all that much. A bit on the edges it changed definitely and relative to other occupations it certainly was amazing. They are mostly very dysfunctional. 

I'm as an European grateful for the benign role the USA has played in our history. I just caution against underestimating the difficulty in guiding the development of a country.

People hunger for security and stability even more than they do freedom.  America was able to provide that for Germany as it rebuilt.
