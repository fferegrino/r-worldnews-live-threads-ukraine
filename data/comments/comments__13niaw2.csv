>Who has won and who has lost isn’t measured, however, in current control over the uninhabitable ruins that are left from Bakhmut, a once prosperous city of 70,000 people.
The answer will depend on the outcome of Ukraine’s planned offensive—which hinges, in part, on whether Ukrainian or Russian military capacity has been degraded more severely by the war’s bloodiest, and longest, battle.

>“It’s too early to judge the impact of the battle of Bakhmut on the war.” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses who visited Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut in February. “This will be clearer in hindsight.”

>Even as Ukraine lost its last foothold of destroyed high-rises on Bakhmut’s westernmost edge this weekend, it pulled off several successful counteroffensives northwest and southwest of the city in previous weeks. By gaining valuable high ground, Ukraine has made it much more difficult for Russia to use its new control of Bakhmut as a springboard for further advances into Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region.

>Ukraine has used [this] time to rearm and to bulk up its military. Following Zelensky’s visits to Washington and European capitals, the U.S. and NATO allies made a strategic decision to supply Ukraine with Western-made tanks and infantry-fighting vehicles such as Bradleys and Marders for the first time, training and equipping nine new Ukrainian army brigades as part of Kyiv’s strike force for the planned offensive.",False,1684692780.0,t3_13niaw2,t3_13niaw2,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 21 May 2023.  


* Since early May 2023, Russia has restarted frequent long-range missile strikes deep into Ukraine. They are likely primarily aimed at degrading Ukrainian air defences.  

* Innovating on earlier waves of deep strikes, Russia has started more frequently integrating unarmed, surveillance uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) into operations.  

* These have included Russian-produced SuperCam UAVs which are relatively cheap and have sufficient range to fly over the cruise missiles’ targets.  

* Russia has highly likely adopted this tactic in an attempt to obtain more timely battle damage assessment and improve its targeting cycle.  

* The Russian military’s slow and inefficient targeting process has been a major weakness in its performance in Ukraine. However, slow surveillance UAVs are highly vulnerable to Ukrainian air defences.

I'm doing it as I find a lot of things he talks about relatable to the corruption and mindset in current Russia
______________________________________________________
ECHO FROM STUDENT YEARS - part two

In the summer of 1948 all the students of our faculty found themselves on a 45-day brigade near the Danube, where we made bricks. From that time is the memory of the first and most glaring injustice that would later become a basic party and state principle. While we ordinary students had to work for 12 hours a day at a murderous pace, the party comrades, who were appointed by who knows who as commanders, would lie around all day and play volleyball. There was a certain cynicism in the picture of running overworked female students carrying the heavy brick moulds and behind them, behind the net, the smug faces of the commanders playing volleyball. The work was unbearably hard and some of us paid with our health. That autumn I found myself in the sanatorium for tubercular students near Vladaia and from that time I remember the strange meeting with Georgi Dimitrov. Those were difficult years and many people were dying of tuberculosis. But in this student sanatorium the atmosphere was always optimistic, cheerful. In the evenings, everyone who could get out of their beds went down to the living room, where they sat down to play backgammon, chess or cards. Mostly, bridge was played on friendly terms. Gambling was a complete stranger. One early evening, I don't remember the date, but it was snowing, there were about 40 of us students, players and watchers gathered in the living room, surrounding the tables. Everybody was engrossed in the games, the usual half-silence could be heard, interspersed with the occasional cough. Suddenly the front door opened. I was seated facing the door and saw the ""leader and teacher of the Bulgarian people"" appear. With him was his bodyguard, whose name, I think, was Kolyo the Sailor. Dimitrov stopped for a moment, looked around and seemed ready for the usual loud welcome, applause and chants of his name. Even his face had assumed that condescending expression of one accustomed to salutes. But strangely, no one even lifted his head from the table, as if Nicholas the porter had entered. I saw that everyone was so caught up in the games that none of the students noticed the man who had entered. I seemed to be the only one watching him with any particular curiosity. He continued to stand at the door, and seemed unable to believe himself that his appearance had caused no reaction. The man whom the propaganda machine of the regime called ""the greatest Bulgarian"", who was accompanied by the incessant echo of his own name, who apparently considered himself a super-hero or demigod, suddenly faced cold disdain. If he was a normal citizen, it wouldn't be hard for him to discover that people simply hadn't seen him. There were quite a few communists among them. But his paranoia was in full force. I noticed how his face changed color, his adam's apple flashed, his eyes blazed, and the next moment he gave a shrill shrill shriek, ""Students! Is this Monte Carlo? Comrades! Gamblers! Shame and disgrace! Is that why the people sent you here! You play cards with the nations money..""







He kept screaming like a madman, he was completely out of himself, and watching him, I thought how insignificant and small this man was who could erupt with such hatred and loathing over a truly innocent disregard. His face trembled, his hands shook, his whole body shook. All the students turned instantly, many jumped to their feet, one with greater self-possession tried to say something apologetic, but the Leipzig lion roared until his voice broke, then rushed out and slammed the door. Some then said he was drunk.









But from that moment on, the student sanatorium, where I was destined to spend many long months, was the only treatment facility in the country where bringing playing cards was considered almost a national treason.",False,1684661121.0,t3_13niaw2,t3_13niaw2,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

Prigozhin has actually been frustrated and trying to get out of Ukraine for a while now. I think Wagner had been a victim of their own success, and have been unable to withdraw with the Russian Ministry of Defence at their back once Bakhmut became a meatgrinder

Basically, Prigozhin was stuck, with his guys dying in pointless battles over a pointless city, but he couldn't realistically withdraw without facing political suicide back home

So all the hysterics over ammunition and anger at the Ministry of Defense was real, because it was costing him men when he just wanted to leave. In this scenario, Prigozhin does not care about political capital in Moscow or replacing Putin or any of that. He just wants to get out ASAP

Since then they've had to major defeats in Kharkiv and Kherson with no real success anywhere.

Even then, this wasn't even a Russian army victory, it was almost all Wagner. Wagner stopped at the edge of Bakhmut and has no real desire to go further, seeming to want to pull out altogether and head of to Sudan. Russia committed more forces to this battle to help Wagner near the end, but now they'll need to defend it without the offensive pressure Wagner put on the Ukrainian defenders. Don't see how they can since trying to traverse open fields to advance more has been disastrous for them.

The F-16 program originated in Soviet war plans during the Cold War.  The Soviets had decided that rather than trying to keep up with American airpower, they would build aircraft that were cheap and easy to build and focus on defeating the US by attrition.  These war plans were subsequently stolen by the CIA.

This freaked US war planners out because they had just completed/started the F-14 & F-15 projects and by their calculations the Soviets could beat those platforms through attrition even while taking losses 10:1.

So, the F-16 was designed on 3 principals - cost, ease of use/pilot training, and flexibility to do all the air to air and air to ground jobs of most other aircraft.

Because the F-16 was designed to thwart attritional strategies, after coming into service the US built 1,000s upon 1,000s.  And now with American partners getting the multi-role F-35, hundreds of F-16s are being decommissioned in Europe over the next 36 months, to go with the few thousand the US has.

(2) To properly use all the tools: HARM, Storm Shadow, JDAM, aerial decoy drones, etc., etc., the Ukrainians need a Western platform with Western avionics.

(3) Payoff.  The thing that makes a stand up main force battle against the US, and any other Western power that fights like the US, suicidal is air power.  The risk of losing pilots may be great, but if Ukraine can gain air superiority or air dominance, that by itself will effectively end the war.",1684681548.0,1684681327.0,t3_13niaw2,t1_jl0w9ec,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

1. Theyre current airforce has taken a lot of losses. The west hasn't got infinite soviet jets to supply. But it had a shit tonne of its own old stuff. So this opens more options.

2. The mig 29 while good in many ways, is also largely outclassed by the F16 in a lot of ways. Some pilots have said an F16 pushed to its max can match a mig 29 in a dogfight. That doesn't leave much room for the mig to be better. So its fair to say the f16 is better, especially the more modernised ones. The f16s being sent should be more modern than Ukraine's old mig 29.

3. We think of the airforce in the light of top gun. Big dogfights etc. But its actual end goal is moreso to support the ground troops. Air to air combat is a way if denying the enemy that. The f16 can use Western weapons which the mig 29 can't. The west is very air power dominated so much of its better precision weaponry is air launched. This opens the doors for much more, and better weaponry to be sent. Plus, systems like HARM missiles which Ukraine already uses can be used in their more effective modes when shot from western jets.

So TLDR. They are better, there's more of them, they can use better weapons to support ground troops.",False,1684675033.0,t3_13niaw2,t1_jl0w9ec,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

They have even been able to do some SEAD with the HARM (High speed Anti Radiation Missiles) that have been adapted to be used on the MiG’s. Unfortunately Ukraine’s MiG’s are only capable of using Semi active radar homing air to air missiles that have a shorter range and require a radar lock from the launching aircraft all the way to impact when Russia has Active Radar missiles that have their own radar and can be fired and allow their aircraft to turn away. This is a huge advantage in air to air combat. F-16’s will allow Ukraine to push Russian aircraft back from the front line by threatening with longer range missiles and they will be able to more adeptly suppress and destroy Russian ground based air defense, allowing more close air support on the front lines.

Instead, I suggest that these policies are there to reassure the **Chinese** and manage their participation in the conflict.  

I'll make an argument why, but here's the tl;dr - both the US and the PRC can avoid risk and achieve their goals by following this policy.  **The US keeps the PRC on the sidelines and the PRC keeps the pace of escalation slow and without surprises.**

The Chinese have many different interests in this conflict.  But it's interesting to see just how big a zero their involvement has been so far, especially in light of the ""limitless"" friendship statement delivered just before the war.  They have not provided arms - there has been no outpouring despite the Russian need for things where China is at the leading edge, like missiles and drones, or even standard stuff like ammunition. 

They also have not provided much in the way of diplomatic cover.  Western observers looked for some major policy declaration during Xi's latest trip to Moscow, but the only thing that came out of it was the bland 12 point declaration.  Then Xi went off to meet with the Central Asian governments, effectively ""poaching"" on Russian turf.  

They haven't been supportive at all.  I believe this is due to several different factors.  For one, they aren't ready yet to confront the West, even if they wanted to.  Their military modernization program won't be fully online until 2030.  But were that the case I don't believe that the PRC would be interested in putting their chips down to support a Russian adventure, and one so shoddily run.

Moreover, I would not be surprised to learn that the whole thing has been a bit of a wakeup call to PRC policy makers.  The collective West's unexpected unity, the effectiveness of their sanctions, the advantages held in the control of the information battlespace, and the success of mostly outdated Western arms designed and produced fifty years ago and more no doubt gives them much to reflect on before rolling any geopolitical dice.

But they **do** have a significant interest in preventing instability, which is shared by the West.  The US does not wish a direct confrontation with Russia on this issue and has made that very clear.  I believe they are perfectly fine with the Chinese response so far.

And it wouldn't surprise me if the PRC saw a great deal of risk in their large, diverse, kleptocratic and nuclear armed partner.  Succession change after Putin has a lot of uncertainty and risk under the best scenarios.  Add in the stresses caused by a major military defeat and nobody sleeps well.  

While the PRC may be wise to stay on the sidelines, they likely believe they are still serving as a good ally to Russia.  It's my argument that the slow pace of introduction of new arms packages and the relatively small numbers, are in there to prevent Chinese escalation.  That's a real and tangible benefit.  And similarly, the US is behaving as a good ally to Ukraine.  Sure, the AFU would like to be firing off ATACMs.  But they wouldn't like to be seeing Kyiv hit by dozens of DF-112As every night. 

The US has its ""boneyards"" full of M1A1s and Bradleys and could roll out 5x what has been provided so far at nearly zero cost.  But it hasn't.  The Chinese could send trainloads full of artillery ammunition, thousands of drones, and extremely advanced missile systems.  But they haven't.  There is a reason and I think it's by agreement.

Desert Storm involved roughly one million coalition forces and thousands of the most modern planes plus tanks and every other weapon under the sun. In 2021 Ukraine had a military budget of about 6 billion dollars while Russia’s was around 70 billion. If Ukraine wanted to go full “desert storm” they would have needed hundreds of billions of dollars in spending for years to build up those capabilities and they would need hundreds of thousands of ground forces from other countries coming in as well. That’s just not an option and honestly even the US may not be able to pull off another “desert storm.” At the time even the US was shocked by how well it went.

As for “no promises not to attack Russia itself” that’s just bad strategy. While morally I do agree that Ukraine has every right to strike Russia winning this war is not about “morals” but about what makes the most sense. If Ukraine is attacking Russia itself with western weapons western countries will likely stop supplying then.

That's not remotely true.

>*Ukraine’s pre-war Sukhoi Su-25 fleet numbered around 30. Write-offs since February 2022 total 15. NATO countries donated 18 of their own subsonic Su-25s, more than making up for the wartime losses.*

>*It seems the Ukrainians had around 105 MiG-29s, Su-24s and Su-25s before the Russians attacked—and, a year later, still have around 105 of these types.*

>*That leaves just one major fighter fleet: the Su-27 supersonic interceptors. The heavy warplanes perhaps are the hardest to count, and for good reason. Fast, maneuverable and flexible, the Su-27s might be Ukraine’s most useful jets.*

>*They patrol for Russian planes, fly high-stakes bombing sorties and even fire American-made anti-radar missiles at Russian air-defenses...*

>*Just how many Su-27s the Ukrainian air force had in service before the wider war is a matter of intensive debate. Ukraine inherited 74 then-new Su-27s when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Twenty-three years later, as few as 24 were in active service.*

>*The Russian invasion of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 motivated Kyiv to expand the Su-27 fleet. It’s possible as many as three dozen unflyable airframes were in storage. And by 2016, at least one analyst counted 57 Ukrainian Su-27s with confirmable “bort” numbers painted on their noses.  If all 57 were flyable, it might imply Kyiv had restored every single available airframe.*

>*The Ukrainian air force has lost at least seven Su-27s—and at least five pilots—in the past 11 months...*

>*It’s impossible definitively to count Ukraine’s Su-27s. If Kyiv has made a maximal effort, potentially 50 of the powerful fighters still are airworthy.*

And I still think the F-16s will make a big difference, just not in the Wunderwaffe category.  The switch from ancient legacy soviet aircraft to F-16s is surely beneficial to Ukraine in many ways.  They are perhaps not the most modern tech, but certainly a large improvement on what they have so far.  This western platform obviously makes it much easier to integrate a vast array of western munitions.  Delivering more and more aircraft will make it easier to flexibly cover less well defended ingress routes of russian cruise missiles (and Shaheds, should the decision be made to go with APKWS).  Further aircraft deliveries and spare parts shouldn't be all too much of a problem, though she does touch on some of the older electrical components of these particular F-16 models no longer being produced.  And this will make future integration into NATO much easier.  Perhaps most importantly, the decision to supply F-16s

In the air-to-air domain, the chief weakness of the MiG-29 is that the Ukrainian Air Force doesn’t have access to actively guided missiles. Their only options are semi-active, so the launching aircraft can’t defend itself at any point before impac. That means the Russian Air Force has a complete overmatch against them.

F-16s are good jets. So are MiG-29s. The difference is that Russia isn’t selling Fox-3s to Ukraine.

The jet itself makes a difference for SEAD/DEAD. The MiG-29 can probably fire HARMs in pre-briefed mode, but that makes for a very long targeting loop - on the scale of hours, when it needs to be seconds. An F-16 can fire the same missile, but it can do it against targets it identifies in real time or in ‘self-protect’ mode with no specific target at all.",False,1684675737.0,t3_13niaw2,t1_jl0wvgw,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

I believe Ukraine's Mig-29s are only capable of firing Semi-Active Radar Homing (SARH) missiles.  Semi-active radar homing missiles use the launch aircraft's radar to illuminate the target and guide themselves to the target.  This means that a Ukrainian Mig-29 has to keep its radar pointed at the target - which can only be accomplished by flying generally towards its target, making things like flying evasively to avoid any Russian missiles virtually impossible to do without causing the SARH missile to go off target.

Aircraft equipped with SARH missiles are at a disadvantage to aircraft equipped with Active Radar Homing (ARH) missiles in a beyond visual range engagement.  ARH missiles have their own independent radar transceiver on the missile.  Once launched, they are capable of using their own radar to guide themselves to the target without assistance from the launching aircraft.  That means the launching aircraft can fire an ARH missile, then turn away from the target to avoid any incoming enemy missiles.  Most Russian fighter aircraft fighting in Ukraine are equipped with the R-77 or R-37 missiles, both of which are ARH missiles.  I don't believe the Ukrainian Mig-29s are compatible with any ARH missiles.  If they are, they're in very short supply in the West.

The F-16 can carry the AMRAAM missile, which is an Active Radar Homing missile.  It would do a lot to level the playing field between the Russian and Ukrainian air forces in air to air combat.  There are many spare missiles available to give to Ukraine throughout Western air forces and they're still currently being manufactured, so supply concerns are far fewer.",False,1684676581.0,t3_13niaw2,t1_jl0wvgw,,2,11,0,11,0,0,

The usuall attack run was done from the floor level, launching missiles from around 40km. Of course if the target was aware of incoming aircraft they usually ran away or launched R-77s with much higher range and with active homing. Latest AMRAAMs are on par with R-77s regarding range, so it would give Ukrainians a chance in BVR engagements.
