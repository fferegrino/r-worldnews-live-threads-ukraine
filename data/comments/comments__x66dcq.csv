Then the new troops and equipment started coming into service for the Ukrainians.

Day 194 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today, I’m pretty sure, there was no shelling in Kharkiv itself, but they did shell Kharkiv oblast at around 9pm, not that far away from the city as it was audible here. And also there were two missile strikes instead of one. First missile strike happened at 10:15pm. As usual they were launching S-300 missiles from Belgorod, and at least 1 missile malfunctioned after being fired, and blew midair in Russia.

Then there was a second missile strike at 12:18am, there were 2 explosions in Kharkiv. We don’t know where the missiles from the first missile strike landed, but we do know about the second missile strike. One missile hit someone’s private house, destroying it, and killing 1 woman, who was found under the rubble a couple of hours ago. 

Then the second missile landed near yet another private house, thankfully that one missed, but it still damaged it and started a fire. They are specifically targeting civilians for no reason. After that missile strike in the middle of the day 2 days ago, Russian MOD said that they “killed 30 nationalists from Kraken and destroyed 10 vehicles”, but they only injured 3 civilians and damaged some private houses along with an apartment building. Their lies get disproven even before they post them, with photo/video proof too, but they post them anyway.

1. The highest numbers of Russian casualties are coming from the East.

2. Equipment losses (such as tanks) have begun to spike as well.

3. There has been no indication of effective Russian offensives.

Casualties are generally an indicator for the intensity of fighting, and do not necessarily mean ground gained.

But we haven't seen Russia advancing in the East, so at least, Ukraine is effectively defending and possibly conducting some Recon-in-force with results.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 5 September 2022


- Despite its effects to contain recent Ukrainian offensive action, Russia's main effort in Ukraine almost certainly remain its Donbas offensive operation. Its principal axes of advance in the Donbas remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut. Although Russia has had the most success in this sector, its forces have still only been advancing around 1km per week towards Bakhmut.

- The political goal of the Donbas operation almost certainly remains to secure the whole of Donetsk Oblast, which would enable the Kremlin to announce the 'liberation' of the Donbas. Russian forces have highly likely repeatedly missed deadlines to achieve this aim.

- The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that Russian forces are now under orders to complete this mission by 15 September 2022. The force is highly unlikely to achieve this, which will further complicate Russia's plans to run referendums on the occupied areas joining the Russian Federation.",False,1662357884.0,t3_x66dcq,t3_x66dcq,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

It's easy for us on our couches to criticize Germany while Ukrainians die in a war of aggression but... having  played the game all summer, now Germany finds itself with nearly full gas reserves and new, albeit more expensive sources coming online. They're now in a much better position to weather the hardest part of the energy storm this winter. What will they do now that they've effectively won the standoff?

The first is that they are only as good as your willingness to carry them out. In this regard Russia is poor at threatening. Particularly with gas and oil, they kept turning stuff off/on. Everytime it goes back on, they undermined their threats. Compare this to the US, while they are scary because of their strength, they also have consistently demonstrated a willingness to apply it, which adds to the effectiveness of a threat.

The second is the relative power dynamics at play. In this sense, Russia needs to sell its oil and gas more than most EU countries need it. Yes, prices will spike but we are mostly talking about advanced economies with a lot of economic leverage to mitigate the real world consequences. Russia relies on oil and gas for a large chunk of their revenues and finds it hard to find alternative buyers (particularly as far as transporting it to such).

Basically this will bite EU for a while, but it is likely manageable without any moderate-severe repercussions. Russia however will suffer moderate-severe economic repercussions.

I believe most people would have expected Ukraine to push in the middle, go fast and hard for Nova Khakovka and basically split the russians in two effectively encircled pokets. Because that would be the sane thing to do to end it quickly.

But if instead you bait the enemy to reinforce the most distant point of its line and only advance when resistance crumbles, the damage you can do is so much greater, both to men and equipment.

Since russia doesn't have retreat as an option, basically Ukraine just has to exhaust the russian front troops, which will draw more and more russian reinforcement from across the Dnieper. Reinforcement that gets shelled/harrased during crossing. And then on the way to the frontline. And then on the frontline. And then attacked.

On the other side, a total collapse of the Russian forces is not unplausible. 

On the other side, Ukraine is completely dependent on foreign support. While US and UK is strongly committed, EU seems to have at least some internal discourse regarding the support due to the energy crises.

Typically it's better to take enemy troops out of the fight completely so that they don't retreat and then have to be fought again later.

But Ukrainian strategy of limiting its own casualties favours taking out russians above quick advancements.

This has a double effect: first, it does lead to taking back land due to russian inability to replenish losses, and second it sends a tangible and easy to understand signal back in russia.

The average russian has no ideea what and where Severdonetsk, Bahmut or Vysokopillya is, so capturing/losing them might not have an impact. 
But when the number of casualties piles up, they can directly feel it.
Relatives of dead soldiers mourn and talk around, POWs are allowed to call home, and WIAs go to russia and spread even more awareness.

So, irrelevant of Ukraines actual military power, unless they are willing to cross into russia and bring the ground war to them, the best option is to entice the russians into a meat grinder.

c507e8757902fcb2e679858b267edc9b,x66dcq,in89tp2,"Pretty unlikely, IMO. The Afghan withdrawal was months before the Ukraine invasion, and it wasn't until very late 2021/early 2022 that US intelligence started sending up ***serious*** red flags about the Russian buildup. 

Russia spent months organizing the invasion, but they had been doing ""military exercises"" off and on for years before finally rolling into Ukraine. That is a pretty common tactic tho, dating back to Alexander the Great, at least. Alexander would have his soldiers parade up and down a river on a schedule, making lots of noise, doing nothing to hide their presence, with the intent of getting the enemy on the other side used to their routine, essentially getting them comfortable with their presence... and then doing nothing. The purpose of this was to lull the opponent into a sense of safety because all that noise on the other side of the river meant nothing. After a few weeks of noisiness, he'd use the complacency he'd built with the opposing army to hide the muster of his forces, and then he'd order his army to cross en masse. There's a military term for this kind of battlefield preparation, but I can't remember it, and Google isn't helping me at the moment.

What I think is more likely is that Putin viewed the chaotic US withdrawal as a sign that the US was spent in terms of military adventurism, and that he could invade Ukraine without significant opposition. So he used his regularly-scheduled build-up/military exercises along the Ukrainian border to mask his deployment of forces, and then he ordered them in, surprising not just Europe, but much of his own forces. The US was warning about this of course, but the US had also been warning about the buildup of Russian forces for years prior - pretty much every time Putin ran a ""military exercise"". Part of the reason that EU leaders (and Zelensky as well) didn't listen to the US is because they got tired of the US warning them every time Putin moved his army around.",False,1662410476.0,t3_x66dcq,t1_in86nff,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

043c155ba5cc328b5b19963ca0ed0254,x66dcq,in9hmuu,"I think generally the story of this war is that because of it's experienced and better equipped, trained and motivated infantry and NCOs, Ukraine has an edge in small unit, squad level engagements- so if a section of 15-20 Ukrainian troops encounters a section of Russian troops they'll usually fuck them up.

On the other hand when forces concentrate on the battlefield, the large numbers of russian armor and artillery give them the advantage because they can shell concentrations of ukrainian troops into oblivion.

Obviously HIMARs helps redress that by interdicting supply lines, but I think the Ukrainian plan with this offensive is to try to exploit their small unit superiority and avoid the pitched concentrated battle that russia wants, ie put pressure on everywhere, probe along a long line, constantly try to find and exploit weaknesses at a squad level whilst using Himars and long range artillery to cut off supplies. They've picked Kherson for this strategy because the geography means Russia has to move reinforcements and supplies through the choke points on the Dnepr River. 

A single decisive push to river would in effect play into russian hands by giving them an enemy to concentrate and mass artillery against. 

The way this is unfolding it's basically a mathematical question- is Ukraine able to kill/incapacitate/exhaust the supplies of a russian troops north of the Dnepr at a faster rate than russia is able to bring in supplies and fresh troops over the Dnepr (and without the river at its back is Ukraine able to keep its own  forces supplied and reinforced so they can stay on the offensive).

If the Ukrainian strategy is working it's more likely we will see several weeks off incremental gains all over the Kherson front line, with some advances as weak spots are exploited,  followed by (hopefully) a general collapse as the russian supply situation hits critical and their exhausted troops flake out.  Alternatively if the maths is not heading in the right direction, Ukraine will get to a point where russian defences are getting stronger rather than weaker and their own attacks are suffering heavier losses than they can reinforce- that would be a sign their efforts to interdict supplies has failed and at that point the offensive will run out of steam.

By the way, as Hertling and some other military experts have commented, this is really a very smart plan, it exploits geography, relies on the Ukrainians tactical strengths and minimises their weaknesses- if it comes off it will be one of the most brilliant military campaigns in modern history- a smaller less mechanised army with less artillery and less air support should not be able to go on the offensive against a larger enemy.",False,1662430538.0,t3_x66dcq,t1_in8rntz,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

A NPP needs power for the cooling pumps, to keep reactor cores from melting under certain circumstances. If all reactors are powered down and don't produce any electricity, they need external power from somewhere else. Earlier today it has been reported, that only one of the reactors is currently producing power. And if they now also power this one down, they have only backup diesel generators for power production. This is of course not ideal, since the russian troops have logistical problems and may not be able to provide enough fuel. Or the generators might be damaged.

Now the (from my opinion) probable path ahead: The russians will connect the NPP to the russian power grid and take this as a propaganda win of 'saving Europe from the inevitable nuclear catastrophy, caused by Ukraine!11'.

It's pretty obvious that Russia has been staging acts against the power plant, take it for example the alleged attack by Ukrainian special forces to take control of the plant on the eve of the IAEA inspectors reaching the plant and conducting an investigation on the situation at the plant. It was clearly staged, it would have been ludicrous for Ukraine to have conducted an amphibious assault on the plant with so little men, when there was no prospects of relief by other Ukrainian forces that were situated some 60 kilometers by land from the plant.

Somebody does a thing once, others notice/enjoy it/mock it, and continue on with the thing. Why did the first-ish person do this? Tough to say.

Specifically here, there might be a couple of things going on. It could be a play on ""the Ukraine"". I believe Steven Colbert once referred to Google as ""the Google"". As another commenter mentioned ""The Netherlands"" is the correct name of a country, even though ""the Russia"" is not. Language is not always 100 consistent.

Linguistically, in this particular case and question, it takes a proper noun and makes it a common noun. The humor Colbert was going for was based on breaking the expectation that Google is a proper noun, and making it a common noun breaks our expectations. We probably don't think about how we might have different mental categories and ideas around proper vs. common nouns, but this switching of noun categories brings to light that we might have such unrealized conceptions.

Does making a proper noun into a common noun somehow minimize, deligitimize, or diminish that proper noun? I think it is possible it does. At the very least I think it provides cognitive distance between the speaker and the noun in question. It speaks to lack of attachment or specific regard, and allows the speaker to appear cool and unattached/distant in regard to the thing.

Further on these questions of the language of geography and identity, there are interesting questions on ""the Ukraine"" and even ""the Donbas"". I have yet to see any objection to calling the Donbas the Donbas. Yet there is a reddit bot that at least used to admonish posters to stop using ""the Ukraine"" and simply call it ""Ukraine"". Setting aside notions of right or wrong here, what can we learn about this distinction? It might be that we are into conceptions of identity here. The Donbas is a region, which is generally defined as being comprised of two political geographies, Donetsk and Luhansk. But the Donbas itself does not have a political identity, it does not have a legislature or executive. 

And perhaps this is what the objection about the construction ""the Ukraine"" is all about. It ""un-propers"" the geography, and removes its political identity. Which, according to some, is what the current military conflict is actually about: achieving a political objective that Ukraine not have a distinct, separate political identity.",False,1662383449.0,t3_x66dcq,t1_in60qhw,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

I explained the SOF part, it would have been straight up ludicrous for Ukraine to have launch an amphibious assault on the plant. Such assault would have been a suicide and doom to fail. There would have been literally no logical military reason to attempt it either. So I discard such an operation based purely on its implausibility, and the Russians provided no real evidence that it happened either. (some images showing ""bodies"" without showing faces, some images of Ukrainian passports, 100$ bills are definitely not enough to give credibility to such an outrageous claim).

The Prison camp one might sound a bit more convincing. The idea is that the Ukrainians looked at a camp that appear to be occupied by Russian forces and used Himars on it only to find out to their horror that it was storing Ukrainian POWs in it. **The problem with this of course is that Ukraine was fully aware that that complex was a prison for POWs for years already**, as it had been used by the DPR forces before. And Ukraine had evidence that the Russian forces moved POWs to the camp a few days before the alleged attacked.And then on top of that, the images released by Russia on the prison camp simply do not support the idea that it had been attacked with Himars, which is what Russia claimed to have happened, a himars attack would not have left the walls of the building standing, and would not have result in so much fire damage.

All of this evidence coupled with a straight up lies of the Russian government leave no doubt that Russian forces started the fire inside the cells, killing the POWs, and then posted images of it to try and blame the Ukrainians for it, to attempt to show Ukrainians using the weapons given to them by the west in an irresponsible manner.",1662405390.0,1662405190.0,t3_x66dcq,t1_in7ubf5,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

Logically, if they thought the national resistance was going to collapse or be overwhelmed, the sensible individual choice would be to put your gun down and flee the country- there's no point in dying for no benefit or surrendering and being on the end of russian war crimes.

So they not only needed to be individually willing to fight, they needed to trust that their comrades and the government were willing to fight, knowing that if they're wrong they will probably have lost your chance to flee and save your life.

The only reason their country still exists today is because in that first 48 hours millions of Ukrainians  made the same private internal decision to trust each other and stand their ground.

Peoples 'google-able' tolerance is low in these threads (things that a person could reasonably easily find out through a few google searches). Their tolerance for the same old, already debunked ideas is also low. I always advocate engagement so let me briefly address your earlier mobilisation point, which I will note has been debunked about twice a week since April in some depth, that I've seen.

Russia likely cannot effectively mobilise and even then, the issues it is suffering cannot reasonably be solved by mobilisation, even if they could. It is likely that Russia mobilising anything at scale and sending it to Ukraine would actually make things worse.

Russia isn't the Soviet Union and doesn't have the facilities (training), industrial base (equipment, supplies) or command structure (high numbers of officers to provide direction to large numbers of mobilised people) to mobilise at scale or in any timeline to impact anything. This combined with mobilisation being very unpopular domestically mean it is effectively a no go. Remember that Putins likely number 1 priority is maintaining his position of power in Russia.

There are many more reasons such as terrible domestic economic impacts but just on those above, mobilising won't be effective even if they tried to.

This is all compounded by a range of issues Russia is suffering on the ground and in the air in Ukraine. Russia is struggling to field its numerically 'superior' airforce, is struggling to supply troops and equipment on the ground, is struggling to replace equipment losses with modern equivalents and provide effective command and control to the forces it does have. Considering this, increasing manpower on the ground just means there are even bigger supply issues, logistics issues and command issues but more mostly untrained people to the meat grinder, effectively hastening and increasing the likelihood of a complete collapse.

Hopefully that helps explain the mobilisation issue.

You cite the source and if necessary break down the potential bias within and treat it with the scepticism it deserves whilst drawing your own conclusions.

The first response I wrote was from my own knowledge going back years to when I used to debate this stuff late at night in University in the early 2000's and many times since then.  I got to the BBC article through Wikipedia after you mentioned the wiki page as I was interested to see what was written there and why you were accusing me of that :D

The article on the BBC (which I ref above)  as ref 1 on the wiki article was from 2012 when the Euros were being played and suddenly the whole of Europe was looking at Ukraine. Nothing to do with the Maidan protests.

Yanukovych was president in 2013. I suspect you're trying to say it can't be a Russian thing because the embassy mentioned it under his rule, Is that it? .

In rebuttal, Ukraine's constitution was written 20 years previously to 2013 and no mention of ""The"" was in it. They called the country Ukraine.  End of story.  It was specifically done for political reasons at the time in the early 90's for good reasons following the collapse of the USSR.  The embassy correcting this later has nothing to do with Yanukovych. It was a big deal after the collapse of the USSR it remains a big deal today. Words matter.

Going right back to the start.  Calling Ukraine Ukraine is what we should do as it is its name.  Calling Russia The Russia is a small way to mock the nation that has led all but one of the European invasions of sovereign nations since the second World War.

They have been very aware of the imperialistic nature of Russia originally in 1991 and it's re-emergence since 1999 under Putin.  

A lot of Russian propaganda is not in Slavic languages but Romantic and Germanic, aimed at the countries that are potential supporters of Ukraine.

 Adding an unnecessary definite article turning a Proper Noun in to a common noun is derogatory to the country and something Ukrainian diplomats  have been very aware of for a long time.

So to summarise:  
  
An earlier poster ""invented"" a distinction between state and public bodies just to argue with you.  
  
Knowing that such a distinction did not exist (because it was not covered in your ""High School Taxes for Dummies (Remedial)"" class) you did not bother to google for any such distinction.  
  
You were provided a link to the google page for the distinction but because you had been not taught how to read or to navigate a google page in your ""High School Taxes for Dummies (Remedial)"" class you did not click on the first link in the page.  
  
You were provided with a direct link to that page but challenged the validity of the (basic non-controversial) definition in that page because you had been taught in your ""High School Taxes for Dummies (Remedial)"" class that data from unfamiliar sources (in your case most of human knowledge) should be discounted.   
  
We can conclude, therefore, that the earlier poster had fabricated this entire site/page and hacked google to fix the dates (probably the entire internet) just to make look like some kind of ignoramus.  
  
But in your ""High School Taxes for Dummies (Remedial)"" class they did teach you that taxes have something to do with the state. Taxes also have something to do with financial transactions.  
  
Therefore if the public make some financial transaction (e.g. media services) then it must be a tax so long as it helps your argument.  
  
Unless it isn't a tax (e.g. media services) when it does not help your argument.  
  
Further any financial transaction that you deem to be a tax must imply state control even if the state has no control over it. Except in cases where it doesn't imply it.  
  
And, thus, any financial transfer must make the recipient a state body. (Also) unless it doesn't.
